"“The Struggle for Mastery in the Fertile Crescent” by Fouad Ajami (July 2014).  This is touted as a 68-page-long “paperback”.  Well, that’s stretching things a bit; calling this a “paperback” is being overly charitable.  There are only 51 pages of text, and given the size of this “paperback” (3.5” x 6”), I’d list it as more of a monograph (and really, $8.95 for this?).The author provides a very brief review of the Sunni-Shia battle throughout the Middle East.  But it’s just too brief.  He will mention the significance of some religious war-lord in Syria or Lebanon, but doesn’t provide any details about the number of soldiers in that war-lord’s army.  Nor does he provide any data regarding the financial strength of any war-lord.  So there is no way how one can measure the real strength of any of the characters listed by the author; few war-lords are actually named.The author noted that Iran (Shia) and Saudi Arabia (Sunni) are “in it for the long haul” in trying to influence the political powers in the Middle East, but doesn’t provide any data pertaining to finances or foot soldiers involved in the raging conflicts.There is no explanation as to why these two Islamic sects can’t reconcile.Despite any data regarding the various competing forces, the author’s review of the M.E. conflicts provides more insight about the competing actors than the usual prattle printed in most news-journal editorials.This booklet ignores detailing the political divisions of the 1980s Lebanese civil war, concentrating instead more on the 2010-2013 conflicts within Syria; but even there few names are detailed.The author doesn’t get much into the “whys” as to why some sub-conflict is happening, but his “generality” comments seem beneficial.  Doesn’t explain “why” Turkey or Iran so involved with Middle East issues.Despite its lack of depth in analyzing much of anything, this tract is definitely worth reading for its Arab author’s perspectives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMEVK9IXPW4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0817917551#wasThisHelpful","RQMEVK9IXPW4B","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Brief comments from a brief review by William Philpott in the 12-13 July 2014 “Wall Street J”, p.C10.)  “A Fatalist at War” (1927)  by Rudolf Binding.]  “A reserve cavalry officer, Binding fought largely on the Western Front, and he bears witness to its horrors… Binding comes across as both a Hun and a humanitarian.

"“Business Adventures” by John Brooks (orig hardback in 1969, Kindle e-book since 8 July 2014, and also in paperback), 360-400 pgs.Mr. Bill Gates ( a co-founder of Microsoft), opined that this “remains the best business book I’ve ever read” in the July 12-13, 2014 “Wall Street J.” (p. C3).It contains 12 chapters regarding various businesses (Xerox, Edsel/Ford, General Electric, Piggly Wiggly, Texas Gulf Sulphur, the 1962 Stock Market crash, Mr. David E. Lilienthal, the British Sterling Pound currency, and more) as they succeeded or failed to expand on some budding side-line in their company.As Mr. Gates commented: “Brooks’s work is a great reminder that the rules for running a strong business and creating value haven’t changed….. It doesn’t matter if you have a perfect product, production plan and marketing pitch; you’ll still need the right people to lead and implement those plans.”  In conclusion, Mr. Gates wrote:  “’Business Adventures’ is as much about the strengths and weaknesses of leaders in challenging circumstances as it is about the particulars of one business or another.  In that sense, it is still relevant not despite its age but because of it.  John Brooks’ work is really about human nature, which is why it has stood the test of time.”This book was recommended to Mr. Gates by his fellow card-playing aficionado: Mr. Warren Buffett [who also recommends “The Intelligent Investor” (1949) by Benjamin Graham].

"“Living Hell: The Dark Side of the Civil War” by Michael Adams (May 2014).  I’ve read many books about the U.S. Civil war, almost all of which detailed how some Union or Rebel general maneuvered his units around some battlefield – including the fine relics by Bruce Catton. “Living Hell” is just about the first one I’ve read that really details what it was like to participate in a battle; from the time being fitted with a uniform, learning during basic training, then marching and fighting in a battle: of the shock in witnessing a buddy’s head being shot away by a cannon ball and watching the arterial blood shoot up into the air for a couple of feet, or watching someone receive a bullet through the head which forced blood to pop out his eye-balls and then squirt out in two steams through the empty sockets – before finally collapsing.And the stories of young soldiers who quickly tired of the thrill of war, to be replaced by the thrill of terror of not wanting to die any longer at such of a young  age for their country.  Then there are the burial details:  the gravediggers using long hooks to pull at smelly, rotting corpses into shallow trenches with a little dirt thrown atop – but washing away during a light rain, and then the farmer’s pigs and dogs eating exuberantly at the exposed remains.How generals on both side of the conflict had to deal with soldiers who fell away during marches to the next battlefield, how those stragglers who were deemed to be cowards were either hung or shot by their commanders -- even after listening to their pitiful pleas for mercy.And the author provided stories about how the wounded were treated after a battle, moved inside jostling horse-drawn field ambulance-wagons to aid stations were their fate usually met a quick but gristly amputation – maybe succored with some opium (which was scarce in the South).  Or so badly wounded they could not move, but could merely holler for help for several days in tall weeds before being found and given food and water – if feral pigs didn’t find them first and gnaw upon them.How to treat those who had both hands shot away, maybe they could be fitted with a bad prosthesis.  But how do you repair a damaged mind, either wounded by bullet or shell shocked by battle – how PTSD existed even then but wasn’t recognized -- except by being labeled instead as a slacker or coward?  Thousands upon tens of thousands of damaged bodies and scared minds.And stories of the young, harried female nurses who comforted the slowly but surely dying.  What of the justice that officers could resign their commissions and escape the next battle, but the drafted enlisted had to continue their mach to the next meat-grinding battle?  Anti-draft riots formed, but the war nonetheless continued.  And so much more!“Living Hell” is a highly recommended read, along with “The Aftermath of Battle"" by Meg Thompson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPXHBLUDN49X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421412217#wasThisHelpful","RLPXHBLUDN49X","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Give Me A Fast Ship” by Tim McGrath (July 2014). [Partial comments from a review by Jonathan Jordan in the July 5-6  “Wall Street  J.”):  This book “sails smoothly in 13 roughly chronological chapters over the turbulent waters of 1775 to 1783”  …. Mr. McGrath’s prose betrays him as an avid fan of sailing adventure novels.  Readers will find his dry wit and eye for maritime life reminiscent of the late Patrick O’Brian’s .…  In the crew’s living quarters below decks, we learn, “bilge water, livestock, unwashed bodies, smoke and tar created an odor that defied description.”  …  It is rare for a one-volume work to fill the sails of personalities and battles separated from the modern reader by nearly two centuries, but “Give Me A Fast Ship” pulls it off beautifully.”[The author details the naval exploits of American ship commanders:  John Paul Jones, John Barry, Nicholas Biddle, Richard Dale, Alexander Murray & Edward Preble, amongst lesser-known buccaneers.  The author discusses the British attacks upon the colonial Atlantic seaports, reviews American vs. British naval engagements on the high seas, and notes how the naval war was finally taken to the British shore itself.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WQA6N0RP5E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451416104#wasThisHelpful","R30WQA6N0RP5E3","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Map Thief” by Michael Blanding (2014).  The earlier reviews have pretty well covered the plot of this book: a seller of old maps, who has fallen heavily into debt to pay for his lavish lifestyle, stole old maps from old books in old universities for re-sale to those who collect very, very expensive historical maps.Besides discussing how the thief was caught, the author adds much to this book by detailing some of the political shenanigans of early 16th Century cartographers:  drawing fictitious boundaries on New World maps to support their nation’s political goals of claiming larger swaths of land than what their explorers had actually discovered.Besides detailing the swashbuckling, good-time party-man, back-slapping personality of the map thief, this book could almost stand alone as a book discussing the historical development of maps regarding the New World.This isn’t a book about how to lay out strands of chain-links in how to map as a budding  land surveyor, but it is an informative look at the development of cartography of New World maps. Why, two books for the price of one!  An insight to the lack of security at many big-name libraries.The author was able to arrange only one meeting with the thief, before he clamed up for good  -- the author speculates that perhaps the thief didn't want to become liable for more prison time if he were to reveal that perhaps he hadn't been fully forthcoming in his admissions as to what more he might have purloined.  Although the thief admitted to stealing some 110+ maps, several librarians thought that he might have stolen more -- as many other maps disappeared from their libraries shortly after the thief had visited them.  A good enjoyable, interesting and informative read by a determined author who doggedly wrote a fine book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQT4WHSAR841/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408176#wasThisHelpful","R2VQT4WHSAR841","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmm, the ad stated that you can soak someone up to 38 feet away .... about the best I did was 15 even on the ""single spray"" selection.  When you switch it to the tri-spray mode, it takes a couple of pumping actions to get the water into the ""wings"" of the crossbow -- and they don't shoot as far.  It claims that it can hold 40 oz. of water, which seems to empty all too soon in the heat of soaking someone.  (Certainly hold more than the old handgun model I had 60 years ago!)  I would have liked a larger water-holding tank:  maybe something of a machine-gun drum on a crossbow -- although that would mess with historical accuracy. I don't think that the triple-squirting really adds that much.  The single spray seems to be enough to catch their attention.  I liked the handling of this soaker, and it is well built.  DO FOLLOW THE INITIAL SET-UP instructions!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19HBVX3WY094O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAHY1QS#wasThisHelpful","R19HBVX3WY094O","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Lion’s Gate” by Steven Pressfield (2014).  This book presents snippets of the personal combat stories of  100?, 125? (I can’t count them all), Israeli military personnel who served during the 5-10 June 1967 “Six Day War”.  These stories cover the various battlefronts: Gaza Strip, Sinai (Egypt), West Bank (Transjordan) & the Golan Heights (Syria).These stories include the exploits of infantrymen, tankers, sailors, helicopter & aircraft pilots – of all ranks. Some of the accounts are short, only a paragraph or two in length, with longer articles by those explaining some of the “big picture” insights of some campaign.Being in junior high school at in May 1967 in Oregon, I remember reading the newspapers and hearing on the media that Egypt’s Pres. Nasser had closed the sea-lane to southern Israel), how Israelis in Tel Aviv where digging protective ditches, and how it seemed that tiny Israel would soon be overwhelmed by menacing Arab armies.Once the “fog of war” had cleared on June 11, it was amazing to learn of Israel’s amazing war victory.  This book provides the intimate stories of Israeli military personnel who in lightly armoured vehicles attacked Egyptian units in the Sinai; engaged in hand-to-hand fighting while clearing enemy soldiers from houses in Arab-occupied Jerusalem; or flew planes hugging the ground to avoid Arab radar to make surprising raids on Egyptian airfields.There were a couple of short accounts as to how the Israeli upper commanders plotted their battle strategy – these were new accounts to me in learning how the commanders quickly reacted to new military threats as Jordan, then Syria, were hoodwinked by Nasser to join his failing battle strategy.One critic thought that there were too many “hurrah” hero stories here;  but that’s the way this war was fought: the Israelis were fighting for the life-or-death of their country; it required many acts of heroism of getting “up close” in order to engage well-entrenched Arab soldiers.  There are many accounts of high Israeli battlefield casualties, too.Perhaps someday some Arab historian can write a similar book from the Arab perspective (I’m not aware of anything currently available; if something like it exists -- hopefully they can be noted here in ""comments"").  Most of the brave Arab soldiers who would have a perceptive tale to tell died at their posts.Another worthy  similar, companion book is ""The Battle for Jerusalem"" by A. Rabinovich.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ONA9U7DWH3K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595230912#wasThisHelpful","R1ONA9U7DWH3K8","A1APW5TK8QSA68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1APW5TK8QSA68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, I like these earrings and they're worth the price (around 20$ when I bought them). I like the pear shape because it kind of sinks into your earlobe instead of a tall setting. The size is good--not too big, not to small. I also like the pear set because it's a little different than regular round.The only thing I'm a little disappointed with is that they don't sparkle as much as I thought they would from the pictures and other reviews. They sparkle when you hold them directly up to a light or look closely, but standing about 3 feet from the mirror in a well-lighted room, they look more glassy than sparkly. Of course I don't expect $20 cubic zirconia earrings to be as good as actual diamonds or Swarovski crystals, but I have other higher quality CZ jewelry that can sparkle from halfway across a room.All in all, though, these are very cute everyday wear earrings and I like them.

"I received this at no cost for my honest review. Here are my comments.1. I use this at the airport to keep track of my passports and iPhone 6. This looks nice and is very roomy. It measures 7.5 x 0.1 x 5.7 inches and has three compartments. In one I can easily fit two passports and in the other my iPhone 6. There is still plenty of room for a couple of pens for the family to fill out immigration forms.2. The strap is adjustable, but is still somewhat long even at its shortest length, though it's perfectly useable. No problem walking around the airport with this.3. Value for money, you would get similar models for around 25$, so this one works just as well.4. In comparison to Belt model I prefer the neck one as it is more easy just like my purse, but my man prefers the belt model. So it is basically personal preference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHRAMKI1S6FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S2QXMS#wasThisHelpful","R1MHRAMKI1S6FM","AKT3M7FRWSBBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKT3M7FRWSBBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this package and the instructions were pretty clear. As stated in the videos on the product website, it is better to install in the evening and leave it overnight to dry.I installed initially and the protector kept moving over the screen, even after waiting for 15 minutes. I ended up waiting for 45 minutes and then pressing the edges of the screen over the watch. One edge of the screen did not stick properly and I have to regularly press over it. I left the watch to dry overnight with the screen protector and except for the one edge, rest was fine.I would recommend this over any case as it is barely noticeable and does a good job protecting the watch screen. About two days after installing I was walking at work and the screen scraped a pillar.

"This is a well made waist trimmer. It is lightweight and comfortable to wear. It does not interfere with your normal movements.The wrap has some built in support for the back, however, the amount of stretch is minimal so there is less compression than if there was more elasticity.

"This lock is better made than your typical TSA luggage locks, which often seem to be little more than junk.  I bought it in the hopes that the cable loop is longer than your typical cabled luggage lock and I wasn't disappointed.  I have the Master luggage/TSA lock and its not long enough to do the job I want... but this one has enough cable and more.Many cable style locks have a simple unlocking mechanism - dial the combo and press inwards on the cable at its base.  Cable slips free from latching to the outer edge of the lock housing.  Simple -- and cheap to manufacture.  Except its easy to operate holding it in your hand... but wrapped tightly and upside down on your luggage?  Not so much.  This lock has a push button to release the cable.  To me that one feature is worth the higher price of this lock.

"My ARMS #22 mk1 QD scope rings fit loosely.  Actually they *looked* tight but I could tell by the tension on the lock lever they were loose.  A tug on the scope and sure enough they moved.  Would not withstand 223 recoil without losing zero.  Those ARMS rings are to say the least professional grade products, and that specific rig will work on numerous other rifles just fine and fit quite tightly... it ain't the rings' fault.If on the other hand you have rings or a mount where you can vary the attachment clamping force (ARMS Mk 2 rings, or just about any screw-down picatinny mount) then likely you can overcome the rail sizing issue with a few extra turns of the screw.  But if you have a QD product that depends on an in-spec rail then you'd better look elsewhere.On the plus side, it fits fine on my 1990's Colt A2 receiver, and I have no issues using the iron sights.  Fit is snug and I'm sure a little locktite will keep the thing snug.

"Amazon tells me I bought the last one of these I own (I have two) in April of 2011.  Thats over 4 1/2 years ago.  I have a very nice electric rice cooker ... that is buried in a cupboard.  I only use this microwave cooker.  Its perfect... once you know how to set it up and run it, so to speak.Worth noting up front:  There is no need to get your hand near anything that vents steam.  You can touch this cooker straight out of the microwave by using your bare fingertips on the two handles.  Look closely at vent placement on some other cookers.  Not all of them are so generous.  After removing the cooker from the microwave, you can flip up the two lid latches straightaway and quickly lift off the lid (there will be quite a steam cloud if you do this fresh out of the microwave, so exercise proper care and attention if you choose to open it up quickly).A key feature on the cooker is the vent at top.  I cook 1 cup of rice and 1 1/3 cups of water on high in an 1100 watt microwave in two steps.  The first is 5 minutes with the vent only very slightly open (one dot on each side of the vent open to the black underneath).  After 5 minutes, close the vent and nuke it for another 5 minutes.  By varying the venting you marshal the heat that is inside the cooker while ensuring it doesn't boil over and further all of your the water will not boil away.You can use the cooker as a storage container by simply putting the lid back on and tossing it into the fridge.Its easy to clean.  Don't be afraid to pry off the inner lid... I guess its a heat shield, underneath it is some black plastic widget and all three just need a quick wash and reassemble easily.There are no chemical smells associated with this cooker, although if you let the water boil away that could change.  It has no evil chemicals (BPA etc.) in its construction.If there's a starchy smell its because you didn't rinse the rice first and that has nothing to do with the cooker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY90DXBIJLDK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007M2BMQ#wasThisHelpful","RY90DXBIJLDK9","A2A2NFSPJYCXVK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A2NFSPJYCXVK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought one for a small project, and came back right after opening the box to order their 3-pack.  I'll put one in the trunk of each car to keep misc items from floating around.My project:  I needed to build a cheapie range cart for CMP/NRA high power club matches.  Bungee this crate to the base of a light folding hand truck and stack your goodies inside. On the line, use the crate as a rifle rest in the offhand phase.  Depending on your ejection arc it can also be a brass catcher during seated and prone.Regardless of the application, one of these crates attached to a light duty hand truck turns it into a heavy hauler.UPDATE (May 6 2015):  Its been a few months and I've had plenty of experience with these.  I am docking them two stars, to three from five.  The plastic on these is sturdy but its nothing like a real milk crate.  As a result I have seen the tops bend under what I would consider to be not-excessive load.  Stuff a few pounds of gear in one in a trunk and the thing bows outward over time.  That range cart I described?  I Midway heavy  duty shooting mat - only weighs a couple pounds - rolled up and sitting atop the forward edge causes it to bow outward.  And sitting or standing on it?  Don't do that like you would with a real milk crate.  They are worth the money but they are not as strong as real milk crates.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCL5T5J8BGB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054029SM#wasThisHelpful","R1GCL5T5J8BGB0","A2A2NFSPJYCXVK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A2NFSPJYCXVK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sights are good for tinkering around, but after you are done playing around in the end (tinkering is fun and not a bad thing) you're very likely to be better off using a truly square-profile sight.These sights are a good learning tool to let you see what works and doesn't in terms of width.  My eyes told me very quickly that the 0.034 sizes were so small that my older eyes couldn't use them.  The 0.072 sights - both the ball and the square post - were the same width as stock so not much to be gained there unless I wanted to keep the 0.072 size and move to the ball.  I didn't.  There's a reason the military doesn't use that type of sight themselves and instead sticks to the square edges.  The 0.052 widths match up pretty well with the outer edges of match targets at high power events.  You learn real fast that there is an advantage in having a sight that appears to be just as wide as the black of the target - its real easy to see if you are centered, or not.But the 0.052 square post is not truly a square.  Its a little box on top of a bigger post.  That contributes - on my eyes at least - to a little bit more ghosting around the edges than I would get with a traditional post that is 0.052"" wide top to bottom.So for matches, after experimenting with these I wound up going to a 0.062"" match sight that ran me about $11 plus shipping.  I don't regret buying these.... they taught me some things about sights and sight picture in a match environment.  They were worth the money to me for that.  But they weren't suited to stay on the rifle.Lastly - note that these sights are quite a bit taller than stock versions.  This might be no big deal or a very bad thing for your style of shooting.  You won't know until you find you need to adjust the sight and it bottoms out well before you get to where you need to be zeroed into.  0.032 tall (according to another reviewer) is quite high.  If you are using an Improved Battlesight Zero or a Revised Improved Battlesight Zero (google it) these sights' increased height may actually help rather than hurt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35C3N7O42590H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007DN5QRO#wasThisHelpful","R35C3N7O42590H","A2A2NFSPJYCXVK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A2NFSPJYCXVK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Short version:  This is a good product if you look at it as part of your backup strategy in an overall low light setup that includes optics.  But if you just want the best overall sight post there are other, better options.There are two ways to look at this sight with respect to rating its performance.  The first is as a generic black rifle sight post.  The second is to consider it as a tool dedicated to low light performance.  Unfortunately, unless you only need to patrol a cave or are invading one of the Earth's two poles you will have daylight to contend with, so you have to consider this sight against its less exotic counterparts.As an all around AR front sight post:  The Meprolight front sight post is effectively an M16A1 profile.  It has the round, tapering shape found on that Version 1.0 model.  Unfortunately the A2 replaced the A1 for a reason:  Sone of its improvements were to the sights and included a square front sight post with sharp edges for a clearer sight picture.  Its easy to see why Meprolight went to the earlier, less-effective design since the round sight allows them to rotate the outer shell to account for site adjustments.  However they COULD have had a rounded inner core with a square shell and given the consumer a better sight.This statement in the product description is, unfortunately, egregiously false:""This sight has a round front post, which is much narrower than the square post currently coming on the AR rifles. This thinner post gives more accuracy since it does not cover as great an area of the target at distances.""This is a flat out misrepresentation.  The very widest of AR15/M16 sights are about 0.070"" in width.  Usually 0.072"".  This sight, if anything, is WIDER that the standard-issue sight.  Target or ""national match"" sights are typically 0.052"" in width, and you can find intermediate sights in 0.062"" at specialty match rifle outfitters, and 0.032"" sights right here on Amazon.  Claiming that the Meprolight sight is narrower - and giving it the benefits of a match sight - is a patently false claim that deserves to be called out.Now, onto its use as a night sight:Its as good as they get.  Low light 'iron' sights are sub-optimal compared to a variety of options out there, not the least of which is co-witnessing thru a red dot where you can dial up or down brightness at will.  A decent, basic red dot can be had for about the price of this sight post, too.  However if your job is mission-critical then you've got an optic and you will also want your irons to be fully functional, and thats where this sight post's size comes into its own.  It may be fatter than a standard sight... but that is a *good* thing in low light conditions, where its unlikely you will be doing any long range target or bench shooting.Does it glow?  Yes.  Does it glow like a red dot sight?  Not even close.  These sights have been available for many years, and while they once were state of the art, that is no longer the case.  They remain the smallest, lightest and most fail-safe option, but they are far from the best performers and are barely holding onto the label of 'cheapest'.Worth mentioning:  The A1 profile is faithful right down to the need to use the 5-prong A1 sight adjustment tool (which most people don't have and many won't even know exists).  However an A1 tool will not work given the 2-piece nature of the sight.  Its no problem dealing with this.  I used a dental pick to depress the detent and then the sight spins around just fine with a standard A1 tool.  When its time to turn the glowing bit so it faces you a standard A1 tool works just fine for this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CAT5QH8Q0VRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002INGN8#wasThisHelpful","R3CAT5QH8Q0VRZ","A2A2NFSPJYCXVK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A2NFSPJYCXVK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is, I believe, the lightest mildot scope on the market.  I also have the illuminated reticle version (I never use that feature) and my experience with that scope caused me to buy this one for a second rifle - a 10/22 Takedown.

Great for general plinking and worked a treat for me at two 25-meter Appleseeds.

"Its a flat pouch... not much you can screw up there.  Its also made sturdily with heavy cloth.  The velcro backing is generous and effective.  So much for the good news.The molle webbing on the back is spaced *all* wrong.  Its impossible to interweave the straps to the pack, which is the point of molle attachment.  There are two horizontal straps on the back if this piece, and the first is directly at the very top... thus making them impossible to use.  The second set of horizontal strips are too far down.  What you wind up doing is looping under two sets of molle straps on your pack, then you can move underneath the last strap on this pouch.  But oh by the way that second horizontal strap is only secured at each end and the middle.  So the manufacturer found a way to make them nearly worthless as well.  Did I mention the vertical straps aren't spaced out quite right either, in terms of width apart?This is ok for morale patches on your kid's tactical school backpack, but its not suited to any serious application.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PA361FTVYDNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YAI40M#wasThisHelpful","R2PA361FTVYDNU","A2A2NFSPJYCXVK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A2NFSPJYCXVK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its small.  Its sturdy.  Its cheap.  It can use a cheap AA battery (rechargeable or not) and using a AA for the power source its plenty bright.I bought three of these.  All were of comparable quality with no defects.  I tested two by loading each with Maha/Powerex 2700 mah batteries, standing them on their bottoms facing up and letting them provide light for the room until the batteries wore out.  The power lasted for two solid hours before it visibly began to fall off (fairly quickly).  During that time a touch test showed that there was no issue whatsoever with heat even directly touching the lens.The crenelated bezel is an affectation.  You won't be doing any hard work with it, but it does serve as a protector for the dome-shaped lens.  HOWEVER the crenelations are ALMOST as long as the height of the lens.  If you try to stand the light on its face (you can do that) the bulb center touches whatever surface you are standing the light on.  So while you can do it you are contacting the lens and over time that is bound to scratch it up.  All they have to do is make those little tabs a bit longer and the lens will be much better protected.The focus mechanism is simplistic - a simple slider moves the outer casing in and out which alters the lens focus to a pinpoint square (thats the shape of the LED itself) or a sharply defined, enlarging circle.  A scew-in/out mechanism would be nicer but of course this is a bargain-basement price so its hard to complain too loudly.  The mechanism has a nice detent and stays put so long as you don't bump it, but if you do it will change whatever the focus level is that you have chosen.The screw-on rear cap has an o-ring but I don't think I would want to drop this light in the water on purpose. Other reviewers have stated these lights aren't waterproof.Its a nice bright light that doesn't heat up, uses cheap batteries and is so small you can forget its in your pocket.

"On the HX20V you do not get the proper battery meter like you do with the genuine Sony batteries. I do not fault the batteries though, it's likely Sony just being finicky with their technology like they always are.

(Again it's hard to tell since the battery meter doesn't work properly). It could even just be my imagination. The HX20V is a battery-burning beast.

"While I liked the first book it didn't have time to do much character development. This book made up for that. This one, while it had some interesting action, was mostly about character development and I felt like I really got to know the people onboard the ship much better. The author also introduced an interesting new character that was not in the first book. Overall while I really liked the first book this one got me totally hooked on the series. Eagerly anticipating #3, which will finish off the current story arc.It took a little Googling but I found it and I am now following the author's website at www.mmoreau.net for more info on when it is coming out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY2EAZ9J2TZTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502556499#wasThisHelpful","RY2EAZ9J2TZTZ","A329P043ENCM1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A329P043ENCM1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of the old Andre Norton books, the Solar Queen series in particular, and was very excited to see someone carrying on the tradition. You won't find a lot of subtext in this book, it's all about the main action, and that makes for a fun read. It's a fairly short book, but a good introduction to this strange universe in which ""rocketships"" are the main mode of interstellar transportation and there are ""martians"" and ""rayguns"" and all of that. I enjoyed it so I bought the second one as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVHI1V0DNKEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496080467#wasThisHelpful","R3GVHI1V0DNKEE","A329P043ENCM1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A329P043ENCM1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some reviews say it's not real leather. It is, you can smell it right away. It's nice and supple but quite sturdy. The color is just like in the photo and it looks like a really high quality item. The stitching is very nicely done and the snaps hold well but don't feel like you're going to have to tug them until they break to get them free.Some commented that it's a bit long for the 10-30 kit lens, which is true but actually not if you've got it still in the ""on"" position. Yes I know, most of the time that you will have your camera in this case it will be turned off but if you're shuffling through a crowd and want to keep the camera protected (but still be able to take pictures fairly easily) you might button it up and leave the lens in the on (and therefore more extended) position. Taking a photo with the case still on is as simple as undoing the two side snaps and flipping the front of it out of the way.Again, I can't emphasize enough how this looks and feels like an item that costs easily 4 times what it goes for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROPWHUI6443EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068VQBI0#wasThisHelpful","ROPWHUI6443EH","A329P043ENCM1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A329P043ENCM1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"::Skip to bottom of review for quick setup help::Let me first point out that I have tried several other modem/router combos and none of them worked. By that I mean they literally did not work no matter how much I tried to get them to work. No connection whatsoever. I am not computer illiterate either, quite the opposite, I ran a computer repair shop for years, have done tech work for major IT corporations and am knowledgeable in just about every platform, operating system and network interface on the planet but most of these modem/router combos are just plain garbage.This one DOES take forever to boot up, especially on the first boot, but after that it's all good. It didn't come with a manual (and at first I was too lazy to look one up) so I had no idea what the wifi login/pass was from the get-go so after hooking it up to my cable input and calling Cox to register the modem with them I hooked it up to my laptop via ethernet and went through the config page to set up everything to my preferences. I did have to power it down and back up a couple of times before it gave all of my devices an IP address but now all is well and it's quite fast. With my old modem I was getting a maximum of 19.1Mbps but with this new docsis 3.0 device I'm getting over 31Mbps and that's over wifi! I haven't even tested it via ethernet yet. Overall I'd say it's a great modem for a great price. Comes with 4 ethernet ports and the wifi is very dependable (although it's not the strongest signal I've seen on a router).QUICK SETUP HELP1. Remove your old modem and/or router2. Power down any computers you plan on using with the new one3. Hook the cable input to it and power it up4. Call up the cable company and give them the Serial # and MAC Address of the modem (on the bottom)5. Go ahead and power it down again. Make sure all of your ethernet cables are hooked up and restart it. Give it a few minutes until all of the status lights are blue (internet icon stays green though).6. Power up your computers/devices and they should all have connectivity. Use one of them to access the setup page, type 192.168.0.1 (as opposed to the standard 192.168.1.1 that most routers use) into your browser's address bar and hit enter. Enter ""admin"" as the login and ""password"" as the password. This gives you access to the config page. Go ahead and visit the wifi configuration page and chance the network name (SSID) to whatever you want it to be called and set up a passkey that you can remember.Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MAC0ZF1LRGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D35XKW4#wasThisHelpful","R37MAC0ZF1LRGS","A329P043ENCM1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A329P043ENCM1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Everyone that has given this product a bad review has done so because they expected to put EOS lenses onto their Nikon 1 and have the camera interface with it and autofocus and all of that. I have news for them, those types of adapters are very expensive (several hundred dollars). This is just a plain old ""dumb"" adapter that physically mounts the lens to the camera.Back in the day folks were used to manually focusing a camera and manually setting exposure settings, I guess now everyone is so spoiled to fancy electronics that they expected miracles. Fotodiox makes great products and I had to review this to bring up the overall rating because the other reviews are total nonsense. They're rating the adapter badly because the camera itself doesn't like being fitted with non-Nikon 1 lenses.If you buy this adapter expect to have to turn the focus ring and focus the camera yourself and also know something about photography so that you can expose your pictures correctly.Please folks, don't give products bad reviews because you didn't know what you were buying.

"Most folks like reflectors but all of that collimating just turns me off. My AstroMaster is always ready to go in a minute's notice and where I live (southern Louisiana) that's important. Our weather is cloudy for a large portion of the year so when the sky does clear I don't have time to play around with aligning mirrors.This scope is plenty powerful enough to check out the moon in great detail, Jupiter (you can see the cloud bands) and Saturn (rings are visible). It is also fine for the larger and brighter Messier objects like M31 (Andromeda Galaxy) and M42 (Orion Nebula). I do suggest eventually getting the Celestron lens addon kit for it though as that opens up so many more options and the lenses are just a better quality.Lastly I will comment on the tripod. I am giving this scope a 5 star rating DESPITE the tripod. It's not that it's flimsy, it's fairly sturdy, but the clutch system makes it really hard to get it set onto a moving object and then to re-position when it moves. Honestly, I usually just mount this scope on top of one of my sturdy video tripods and it works even better. There are threads on the bottom of the scope's dovetail mount that allow you to mount it to a standard tripod and that wins lots of brownie points with me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVT91FPSI6FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MLHMAS#wasThisHelpful","R2PVT91FPSI6FP","A329P043ENCM1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A329P043ENCM1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price these go for they're really, really worth the money. Macro lenses are really expensive and if you're like me and only very rarely do macro stuff for a hobby then get these, skip the fancy macro lens. While I wouldn't suggest them for someone who does macro work frequently for a living for hobbyists these more than get the job done.

"I loved the way the book was set up, how Ben and Fallon meet on November 9, which is a particularly difficult day with bad memories for Fallon. From there, they have a pretty natural chemistry and easy comfort in each other's company as they spend the rest of the day together before Fallon moves away that night to the other side of the country. Fallon is an aspiring actress and Ben is a writer. That definitely puts the heavy expectation on Ben that he has a way with words, and he really does. Agreeing to meet up every year on November 9 for the next five years without contact in between, Ben and Fallon part with the expectation of resuming their building friendship or relationship so that Ben can write a story. Ben also encourages Fallon to spread her wings and to venture out of her comfort zone. He genuinely wants her to take risks and to explore.I really loved Ben right away. He sees Fallon the person, a girl with great qualities whom anyone would be lucky to know. Fallon is likable, too. She's been through some experiences that have taught her tough life lessons which chipped away at her self-confidence. Every year they meet up, Ben and Fallon pick up right where they left off from the previous November 9. I was really fascinated by this part, how for one day of the year, they could keep moving forward because they don't live near each other or email or call or text one another for the other 364 days of the year. I mean, most people have events and people in their lives around them that consume them, but in this book, they both look forward to the one day in November and the focus of the book is on those days. While it's hard to ignore their obvious magnetic dynamic, there's still so much in terms of the everyday details that they don't know about one another.So yes, there are some surprising twists to the story that build up the angst and drama. If you are wanting to feel blindsided or sucker punched, then this will do it for you. While most of the emphasis is on Fallon developing as a character, with Ben's support, Ben himself also has his own personal obstacles. The bomb that drops after the first one, is the one that could not have been easily predicted, despite the very subtle clues. I think some readers might feel like either one of the twists really diminishes the quality of Ben's character and what he represented in the first half of the book, because I briefly contemplated that myself, but in the end, I chose to accept it at face value rather than think about it in that way. I still loved Ben and I think for those particular plot twists, Colleen Hoover weaved them well in terms of how it was navigated in the aftermath. But no, I wasn't happy about them because they made me feel too much - anger, betrayal, disappointment, etc. but I think you should also trust Colleen in redeeming him, too.I would have loved a little bit more in the end, but otherwise I read the book in one sitting, had moments where I laughed out loud and also where my heart raged or hurt for the characters, so I definitely recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFN5HJQHB8DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501110349#wasThisHelpful","R1KFN5HJQHB8DI","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 stars. Semper Fi is Sebastian Hunter's POV and retelling of The Education of Caroline, which takes place ten years after The Education of Sebastian. Sebastian as a 17 year old was always very sweet, giving, loving and even a bit nave and immature. As a 27 year old, he's been hardened by the military and heartbreak.Sebastian hasn't had the easiest of childhoods and Caroline was the one bright spot of his upbringing and then the love of his life as a teenager. When he thought he and Caroline were over forever, Sebastian became very reckless, with no clear direction or goal in life. His decision to join the Marines wasn't his own, he was forced to do so by his father, a person he held in contempt.While Sebastian has a tendency to be rash and hot-tempered, he has never been confused about his true feelings and desires when it comes to Caroline, that is probably the only thing he can see clearly in his life. Caro's insecurities had a lot to do with being independent and confident, and now she's an accomplished and self-established journalist. Sebastian's insecurities come from not having any particular talent or craft that he can be proud of and his feelings of inadequacy for not having gone to college or being worthy of someone like Caroline.What I have always loved about Sebastian is his heart, it's very pure and unconditional. He doesn't see the rest of the world when Caroline is in his focus because he recognizes her heart and that's all he needs or wants. This book is definitely for Sebastian fans because there's not a lot of new information compared to The Education of Caroline besides a front seat to Sebastian's thoughts, although the ending gives a little extra into the future. However, the proceeds for this book do go towards military charities so it's still worthwhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ0VW0X6FUP0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VIALM2#wasThisHelpful","RZ0VW0X6FUP0W","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-4.5 stars. If you love second chance romances, this one will not disappoint. Ten years after Evie walked away from Adam without anything beyond a note and annulment papers, Adam sees her again at a coffee shop. Imagine his surprise that she's right there in front of his eyes after thinking about her for so long and even trying to search for her.I really loved both Adam and Evie. Meeting them 10 years ago tells the story of how they met and became a couple leading up to the actual marriage. As teenagers, they were perfect for each other, there was no doubt that they belonged together and what they gave up to be with one another. Adam had never had a girlfriend before and Evie didn't have a lot of time to devote to a boyfriend, but they made it work because they were fully committed so it didn't feel rash or like a stretch when Adam proposed.Adam was abruptly abandoned and never got closure from Evie's departure after he gave her his heart. As angry and upset as Adam is, there's still unfinished business between them and in order to move on, he needs answers. Evie is really relatable. She was put between a rock and a hard place and now she's being confronted to dish out an explanation that she's afraid to reveal because if she thought she lost her love once and it broke her, she could lose him forever this time and be completely devastated. Their situation is complicated because no one comes out a winner and even if there's a possibility of reconciliation, will they be able to forgive and forget the past? Yet when they were apart, Adam and Evie were not living their lives fully. Still, what good is love if there's no trust?I really enjoyed the tension, the feels and the dialogue, certain parts really hurt, too. So much pain created from so much love on both sides. My heart broke for both of them, Adam for being in the dark and Evie for having to make a tough decision. I was able to predict the reason behind Evie's leaving ahead of time and understood where she was coming from. The ending felt just a teensy bit rushed, but otherwise, this is very well-written and I definitely recommend it. I also hope it's not too soon to request a story about Max someday.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TX7LCVDHZU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01692EJJU#wasThisHelpful","R13TX7LCVDHZU9","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-4.5 stars. A lot more information is revealed in this installment and adds more depth to the characters, particularly Frankie and her own personal situation. Derek's history hasn't been completely laid out, but it's obvious that he cannot deviate from his agenda although having Frankie in his life makes him want to. I really enjoy seeing Derek try to deny how he really feels for Frankie when it's obvious that she's making him break all of his rules without her even purposely try to. I admired Derek even more after the revelation about his sister came out and Derek didn't even bother to pick sides between her or Frankie. He's determined to keep them both in his lives. While things are still as steamy as ever between Frankie and Derek, they also build more emotionally, too. The cliffhanger on this one isn't as intense as the first two, but I still need to keep reading to find out how the rest of the story transpires.

"4-4.5 stars. #TeamSilence. After meeting Dylan at the very beginning in More Than This, he has always been the quiet one, so when it came time for his story to be shared, I was really curious as to what kind of thoughts were running through his head. Not to mention that he's been present in every book since senior prom of high school and very little is known about him. What's different about Dylan is that although he went to college with everyone else, he left college when he enlisted in the Marines.Dylan is home on medical leave and living with his dad and brother, who are former military, too, so they understand Dylan, but at the same time, it's a household where very few emotions are shared. Dylan is the sort of guy who doesn't have much to say and prefers peace and quiet. He likes to work on cars and is a handyman. His best buds are Jake, Cameron and Logan, as well as Dave, who serves in his unit with him overseas. Dylan is the closest to Jake among all the guys, which made me love Dylan even more because Jake is my #1 More Than guy. Dylan also happens to be a complete mastermind when it comes to Operation Mayhem.While I absolutely love Dylan and Jay's writing, the heroine was just okay to me. I really didn't see what Dylan saw in her, particularly at the very start when she's not presented in the best light. And this has nothing to do with the fact of whom the heroine is - I'm completely indifferent as to whether she wound up being whom a lot of fans expected her to be vs someone else  - she just didn't compare to Kayla or Lucy for me. Dylan fell for her pretty quickly, and again, I missed the boat on what drew him in to her because she was initially devoid of personality given that she was too busy drowning in her sorrows. She didn't strike me as Dylan's type, not that he's had so many girlfriends to know, but I do know that he's faithful and devoted so once he makes a commitment, Dylan doesn't back out, ever. He's similar to Jake and Cam in that way, he's 100% all in. The heroine grew on me a little bit as the story progressed, but I couldn't completely invest in her. Still, it was important to me to see Dylan be happy and she was his happy place.A happy Dylan is a talkative Dylan. It's very entertaining to get to know him. The main characters obviously go through their own struggles, mostly battling with her issues initially and then Dylan's later on. They are stronger together and pull each other out of the darkness and silence. I loved the letters that were written and the way Dylan handled the heroine with such care and affection, but he also has a very macho and sexy side (gotta love Lucy for her extra comments about Dylan). The rest of the More Than gang show up and they are as lovable and funny as usual when they are all together, especially when they come to the heroine's side while Dylan is deployed. Dylan's and the heroine's family are also very likable, too. I'm sad that the series is over, I've enjoyed the whole cast of characters and watching them all grow up to find their own love and happiness, and definitely wouldn't mind to see more of them in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XMX470C3GF0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017O6EWFQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XMX470C3GF0B","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before reading this book, I was not a big Kayla Moore fan but I was intrigued by Lachlan McGregor. After reading this book, Kayla and Lachlan became my favorite couple of this whole series. Kayla is like the 5th wheel of her group of friends - Steph, Linden, Nicola and Bram. She sees how in love her friends are and secretly hopes to find something like that on her own so Kayla is taking a step back from her usual hook-up approach and biding her time.Lachlan, Linden and Bram's cousin, is in San Francisco to lend Bram a hand to help increase investments in Bram's apartment building for lower income families while recovering from a minor injury. Lachlan is a professional rugby player in Scotland and has a very closed off personality. Even Bram and Linden do not know many personal details about him other than that he has some hidden demons and to avoid angering or upsetting him. Kayla is really captivated by Lachlan right from the beginning when she meets him. Kayla, who typically comes off as confident, speaks her mind and is a reputed man-eater, is trying her hardest to keep her cool around Lachlan and not scare him off.Getting to know Kayla's real personality revealed so much more about her. She sees herself as someone with a black heart, but based on how Kayla interacts with her mother, that's not true at all. While she may have deterred Lachlan initially with some of the things she says, Kayla really does make an earnest effort to curb her bluntness and to see Lachlan for who he really is. Kayla's personal struggles include being seen for her true self because up until now, she doesn't put much passion or effort into anything she does, including her job. But being around Lachlan gives her renewed purpose, partly because she's attracted to him and wants his attention, but also because she wants meaning in her life and to be proud of herself.Lachlan is a complex guy. He is moody, quiet, doesn't like being around people or talking about his past and has a tender heart when it comes to stray dogs. The development of Kayla and Lachlan's relationship was gradual and seeing Lachlan lower his walls showed how much of his past he keeps buried, along with pain. I really loved the dynamic between the two of them. Even though they seemed like opposites on the outside, there was so much they could understand about each other. The way Kayla immediately forms a bond with Lachlan's dogs was endearing, as well as Lachlan himself in terms of the endless love and compassion he has for the dogs.The biggest obstacle between them is the fact that Lachlan lives in Scotland and Kayla lives in San Francisco. What would they have to give up to be together? Is what they have worth that sacrifice? Not to mention Lachlan's deep issues that are already too much for him to handle, let alone someone else. My favorite parts of this book were how much Lachlan and Kayla had to stretch out of their comfort zones for one another and how they supported the other person when no one else would. To me, this is definitely the best book of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGLLI034QPJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OQN4AC#wasThisHelpful","R2XGLLI034QPJQ","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Wow, Derek can really charm and seduce. He thinks he can only offer Frankie one night but he's been paying attention to all the details about her, too.Derek is the sort of guy who is dominating and needs to be in control. He has to call all of the shots and make the decisions and he's rapidly losing focus over his goals because he's so busy thinking about Frankie. As for Frankie, she's a bit unnerved by how much Derek affects her but decides that maybe she should just go ahead and indulge herself, however temporary it may be.

"4-4.5 stars. Great start of novella series! Frankie Jordan is competing for a contract to represent architect Derek Block in his new apartment buildings. While Derek comes off very rugged, sexy, impassive and intense, he's very interested in Frankie. I really liked the both of them. Frankie is very hard working, committed and independent. She gives her best at her job and wants to take over her father's company. She's not ready to dive into a relationship, but Derek isn't offering, so maybe something purely physical is enough for now. However, if they are coworkers, that's crossing a line that cannot be uncrossed.Derek is preoccupied with his job and he's got certain goals to accomplish that cannot be derailed from. While he cannot ignore his attraction to Frankie, he's hoping to keep it under wraps and simply offer her something temporary to satisfy both of their needs.There's more to the storyline than just instant lust and I found myself becoming very interested in how things would play out between Derek and Frankie. They both have a past that plagues them - Derek is trying to bring justice to his and Frankie is trying to forget hers. I definitely want to read what happens next as the chemistry between them continues to build.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDZ06LBY4OHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE30UHW#wasThisHelpful","RPDZ06LBY4OHT","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5-4 stars. Nine years ago, Zach and Violet were best friends in college who shared some intimate moments along with each other's souls through music and poetry. Then Zach broke Violet's heart and walked away. Zach went on to become a musician and songwriter while Violet became a novelist and poet. Now they are both in the same place again at the same time and it's apparent that those old, buried feelings are quickly resurfacing. The problem is that Violet doesn't trust Zach and Zach will do anything to prove to her that he won't be so careless with her heart this time around.The setup for the story was brilliant, two artists away on a retreat at the same vacation home, trying to find their muses within only to realize that the other person is their true muse. Violet is struggling because if she doesn't meet her deadline, she will lose a lot of money, but the distraction of Zach in the same house is just too much. As for Zach, he's looking for ways to convince Violet that he's changed and for the better, that they deserve a chance to be together.It was interesting to see how different they were from the past, but also from each other in the present and how they had to work through accepting those changes. While I was engaged in the story, I had a little bit of difficulty getting into the story and fully advocating for both characters. They definitely work better together as a team and Zach had his work cut out for him in convincing Violet of the same. There was so much of the past to let go and to forgive in order to move on. Katy Regnery does a great job of covering all those areas even though I didn't love this book as much as some of her others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O12ODE2H4TVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HS6NJNO#wasThisHelpful","R3O12ODE2H4TVS","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cameron and Lucy might have just tied with my favorite couple in this series, which is Jake and Mikayla. Knowing Cam and Lucy from the other books, it would seem like the buildup to their relationship was a seamless and easy transition, but actually it is far from that. Cam is the guy who pulled Lucy out of the dark and had infinite patience with her at age 15 while she healed and began to smile again. Maybe Lucy didn't pay much attention to him at first, but Cam showed up everyday to help in whatever way he could, empathizing with her and being an extra set of hands to support her in her daily struggles while she looked after her brothers. As if it wasn't already big of Cam to assist Lucy, he's also like a big brother figure to her siblings.Before this book, Lucy came off as fun loving and free-spirited, plus who doesn't love the drunk version of Lucy when her lips start talking and saying whatever is on her mind? In More Than Forever, Lucy struggles a lot with so many things, but Cam is always right next to her, no questions asked. In return, Lucy believes in Cam's talent and wants him to go after his dreams. If there was ever a more devoted boyfriend, it would be Cam Gordon.Oh, how I loved Cam's mom, Heather, and her boyfriend Mark. They are just plain awesome as parental figures and I loved the dynamic between Cam and Mark. Lucy's dad, Tom, is also fantastic, too, once he gets his act together. Even though there's a serious undertone in this book, there were plenty of laugh out loud moments, too, that are beyond entertaining. The scenes with all of the More Than gang never fails to disappoint. Definitely looking forward to Dylan's book next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IIKEMSWI5YNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPUXAGK#wasThisHelpful","R3IIKEMSWI5YNM","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars. Another great book by BN Toler! Connor is being released from jail after 8 years for history of manslaughter and Demi is picking him up to take him home. Demi is Blake's widow and Connor is Blake's cousin, except Blake is no longer in the picture. Even though the reader doesn't get to meet Blake, it's pretty obvious what a wonderful person Blake was and that he is not only a planner, but a perceptive judge of character. Because Blake vouches for Connor, Demi and the reader don't feel as judgmental of him despite his felon record. Once Connor steps into the book, it's becomes immediately apparent that Connor isn't a bad guy at all. I didn't just like Connor, I loved him.I really loved the dynamic between Demi and Connor. There's a bit of angst and sexual tension building up, along with the general white elephant in the room regarding Blake. The secondary characters are also well portrayed and I was equally invested in their stories, not just Demi and Connor. There's some unexpected surprises revealed along the way and I enjoyed unraveling these twists because it made the story unpredictable, but not in an unbelievable way. The passion, love and sacrifice, alongside with the determination for justice, really kept me on my toes and I would definitely like to see more of these characters in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OS2C9JIYIFBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01741KKA2#wasThisHelpful","R2OS2C9JIYIFBG","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Laney and Levi went their separate ways because they had different paths to take. Levi never recovered because he had just professed something important to Laney while she dropped the bomb that she was moving.Laney always regretted not handling the situation differently and never strayed from loving him. Laney has a lot on her plate. She's reuniting with some old friends and her brother and she's got a life changing condition to deal with.

She thinks of others before her own self, but she's also determined and decides to start taking risks because tomorrow is not guaranteed.Levi is definitely resistant, and understandably so.

"Grace and David knew each other as kids when they were neighbors. David rescued Grace when her house was on fire and Grace never forgot the boy who saved her, always dreaming of meeting up with him again someday. David often thought about Gracie, too, because she is the inspiration for him becoming a firefighter.Eighteen years later after the fire incident, David and Grace serendipitously cross paths and remember each other. David hasn't been looking for a serious relationship before but Grace makes him want to reconsider that. Grace is a little insecure about intimacy and has this way of rambling excessively when she's nervous. Regardless, they both have a natural and easy dynamic between each other because they already know the other person as they get reacquainted. David goes the extra mile to pull Grace out of her shell to let her be the confident and sexy woman he's attracted to.There's several references to 9/11, which is a thoughtful reminder to never forget and to honor all those who were lost at that time. When tragedy strikes again, David cannot be the knight in shining armor this time around. Does Grace have the strength to pick up the pieces for the both of them? What they go through is emotional and taxing. I really felt for Grace and David, because how does one navigate through something like that, knowing that things may not necessarily get better?

"4.5 stars. Mia has decided to seek out Matt Quinn for his escort services. Quinn also happens to be her brother Harry's best friend. While he doesn't remember the specifics of meeting her years ago because he was drunk at the time, he left a memorable impression on Mia. She's moved back into town and is starting her new job and life and ready to take the plunge in physical intimacy.Mia used to be overweight and her dating experiences were extremely limited. Figuring that Quinn can be her first sexual partner to show her the ropes gives Mia the confidence to move forward. Not to mention that she has a crush on him, too. Initially, they only communicate via email or text message, but eventually progress to phone calls before their first face to face interaction. Mia comes off sassy to her brother and confident and fearless at work. But on the inside, she is insecure when it comes to anything intimate.I really loved Quinn. He's high in demand and he gives as good as he gets if not more, but he's become increasingly detached from his job. Forming a friendship with Mia prior to meeting her offers him something new, the opportunity to really get to know a client as a true friend with whom he can share his most honest thoughts with. What I adored about him was how much he enjoyed getting to know Mia as a person and he hadn't even seen her yet, but he wasn't ever focusing on her would-be appearance regardless.When they are together, Quinn and Mia fit with one another like 2 pieces of a puzzle. Now that they've met and Quinn has provided his services, do they continue to remain friends? What about when Quinn finds out who Mia's brother really is?

"4.5 stars. Whoa, this book was angsty and made my chest hurt. I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts towards Emilia because she is the one who has all the hang ups and internal freak outs. Emilia lost both of her parents by the age of 12, they had the kind of love that made them whole, but destroyed them when one couldn't live without the other. Emilia decides that she could never allow herself to fall in love like that because it only devastates and ruins, where there's nothing left afterwards and having dealt with heavy loss firsthand, she cannot endure that again.Instead, Emilia focuses on school and her career. Then she meets Weston Carter and immediately, there's sparks flying between them even though the first encounter is casual at best. Emilia's MO tends to be to ignore her feelings or to force herself not to feel them when they become too much. Poor Emilia, little does she know that it just doesn't work that way, especially when it's the one great love of her life. Weston is especially dangerous for her because he's a musician (like her father) and he's a player. Poor Weston, he doesn't know that Emilia has all these issues and he doesn't care because he knows that she is the one for him.So the storyline isn't new, but the way it was written gave it a fresh vibe. I absolutely loved and adored Weston. He prioritized Emilia above everything and that was his downfall. There's no doubt that Emilia loved him back, so when she made certain choices out of sacrifice, I couldn't completely hate her, but I'm positive a lot of readers will and it doesn't stop from there. Don't get me wrong, I definitely hated her choices, she continued to let things spiral downward to the point of no return or irreparable damage. Yet, being in her head, I recognized her fears and how much they paralyzed her, even though they absolutely do not justify her actions. Emilia is a runner and until she can stop backing away from difficult situations and using deception in its place, she won't ever be happy. The people who love her wind up hurt repeatedly and no one escapes unscathed. After sinking down so low, will Emilia be able to climb back up? And will she finally fight for what she wants and eventually deserve?As for that emotional bomb of an ending, I'm really hoping the next book comes out sooner than later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6MUL0UYCGF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WZM2RA#wasThisHelpful","R1L6MUL0UYCGF5","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars. Evelyn and Devon met in college. Although their first encounter was memorable, the second time they meet, Devon is dating Evelyn's best friend Olivia. From there, Evelyn stays on the sidelines while Olivia and Devon continue a relationship that results in marriage. But now Olivia is gone and it's just Devon and Evelyn again. Will they finally have their chance to be together?The blurb of this book drew me in because I didn't know how to feel about this plot, but I knew I wanted to find out more. I couldn't deny my curiosity, knowing there was more to the story. Devon and Evelyn are definitely attracted to each other, even when Olivia is around, but Evelyn buried it deep so not to interfere and remained the supportive best friend. I could feel the unresolved tension and angst between them and wondered how things would have played out if Olivia had not been in the picture. I also needed to know if Devon truly loved Evelyn or if she was a second choice to Olivia.Because this is Evelyn's story, I have to admit that I didn't care for Olivia. While Evelyn loved Olivia to the end of the earth and vice versa, I could not bring myself to tolerate Olivia even a little bit, dead or alive. Olivia was a barrier between Evelyn and Devon, before and after. Olivia isn't a villain, but I disliked her anyway.What I really loved about this story was Evelyn's journey. She gave up so much of herself for Olivia and to Devon after Olivia's passing. While she is generous with her time and love, Evelyn is very guarded with her heart and has a tendency to run away when things become uncomfortable or confrontational. She has endless compassion and understanding. What Evelyn doesn't have is a solid grasp of herself. She doesn't know who she is independently of her friends or what she truly wants in life. She's spent so many years devoted to the needs of others, and lost in her feelings, while watching Devon and Olivia live the life she wanted.Devon himself is a good guy. I really liked him a lot. He has the best intentions and his heart is in the right place. I wasn't sure he deserved Evelyn, though, unless he could prove that he saw her independently of Olivia and pursued her appropriately. The circumstances of their relationship was precarious because of the unique dynamics and the ball seemed to be in Evelyn's court so I wondered what was the sign she was looking for to move forward.Then something happens and it becomes crystal clear to me, like it does to Evelyn, as to what her path should be and who she should be with. I loved the ending for this because it was absolutely perfect for Evelyn, to be worthy and wanted first and foremost. Once Evelyn embraced herself, she could allow herself to let someone in and to return that affection. The underlying message of the story speaks volumes so don't hesitate to read this if you think you know how it's going to end based on the blurb, because you might be surprised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQRU52F439WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GAHA1U#wasThisHelpful","R2EQRU52F439WE","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love books with socially awkward heroes or heroines and Lev was exactly that. Mina is living on the streets, desperate for her next meal when she meets Lev, who catches her stealing. Lev comes off as apathetic, precise, quiet and impassive. But from his first encounter with Mina, she strikes a deep chord somewhere within him and he offers to help her. I was a fan of both Lev and Mina immediately. Lev may not be good with feelings or social cues, but he can be intuitive and considerate with the people he cares about. While he may not offer up much in the way of conversation or affection, he does provide loyalty and protection, especially when it comes to Mina. He's very direct in his words and even though he thinks he is incapable of love, it's apparent in Mina's observations that Lev is far from cold-hearted.Mina herself is a fun character. She possesses a certain innocence about her, but she isn't entirely clueless. She's perceptive and compassionate. She appreciates any kind gesture towards her and she also understands the value of good friends and family. Although she is attracted to Lev, their relationship starts out as strictly friendship and it's very sweet and endearing in the way they interact with one another because they seem to understand one another in a way that others do not. Mina isn't looking for a relationship because she has to get her life back on track and Lev simply doesn't do relationships for obvious reasons. However, they are injected into each other's lives so everything becomes intertwined and that comfort they find in one another's presence continues to grow.The development of their relationship, along with Mina and the other characters that are part of Lev's life is at a natural pace and I enjoyed all the different dynamics. There were several times where I laughed out loud by something one of the characters would say, but there were other times when my heart squeezed, too. The cast of secondary characters is great, and I can tell that they have some interesting stories coming up ahead, which I look forward to. Mina came into the story with nothing to lose but now that she's a part of Lev's life, she has everything to lose if Lev doesn't want her to stay. For a guy who doesn't believe in or understand love, would Mina be the exception? I really loved that scene with Lev and the cue cards, definitely a unique one of its kind for something that often happens frequently in books.

"3.5-4 stars. Bryer Reid has a crush on her personal trainer, Nathan James. She hasn't had much luck with relationships and the last major one she had shattered her trust in men. Nathan is charming, seductive, serious and confident. He's also not someone who ties himself to women so even though he's very attracted to Bryer, he knows she's a commitment type of girl. But Bryer decides to kick it up a notch and take control of the situation by asking Nathan out and he agrees. From there, they start to spend time outside of the gym and really get to know each other.I liked Nathan and Bryer overall, they had great chemistry. It was interesting to see them both push themselves out of their comfort zones. Nathan wanted to romance Bryer rather than bed her and Bryer was not afraid to ask for what she wanted. There are other complicating matters, though, like Nathan's past that he has to reconcile and Bryer's past that she hasn't quite faced head-on. Also, a bit of suspense is thrown in, too, with surprises unraveling along the way.This is a good debut novel and storyline, but I had a hard time connecting with both Bryer and Nathan.

While they seem like opposites on the outside, they are very compatible between the sheets and Marcus discovers that he enjoys Sophie's company. As for Sophie herself, she likes being with Marcus but she isn't ready to invest her heart into a relationship due to Marcus' reputation. I liked the dynamic between them because Sophie was the one who held all the cards and dictated how things would go and Marcus had no choice but to go along. However, I didn't feel like they were getting to know each other very well because they spent all their time sleeping together rather than having conversations about personal details so I didn't get to know them very well either. Even though Sophie is reluctant to open up, she's well aware of this game that she's playing and has to decide if she can trust Marcus with her heart. Will Marcus settle for being Sophie's fling or will he push her for more?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BB8VY7GCV8UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTGGMU4#wasThisHelpful","R2BB8VY7GCV8UA","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bree Richards has been living in fear for the last decade. She doesn't have her full memory for the 5 days that she was abducted 10 years ago, but knows that danger still lurks out there. Michael Ryan, who participated in her capture, is being released from jail and Bree knows that Michael has the answers she is seeking so Bree decides to pursue him for the purposes of closure. Add in the FBI who are keeping tabs on Bree and a protective best friend who is searching for her and it becomes a suspenseful story filled with surprises while Bree travels with Michael because he might be the only one who can actually keep her safe.I really liked this storyline a lot. The characters were likable and the plot moved at a good pace. I couldn't predict what was going to happen next and Bree developed well as a character, balanced with revealing the real person inside of Michael. The flashbacks of Bree's memory were all pivotal and crucial in trying to piece together the puzzle as to who was after Bree. Michael surprised me in the best way and I loved that despite how bad his upbringing was, he wasn't a heartless person himself. The secondary characters, Jo and Agent Davis added a great dynamic to the complicated situation. However, this story could be additionally edited and/or formatted and some of the dialogue was a bit disjointed or immature, especially with regards to Bree. Otherwise, I definitely want to read the next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVNWGX1YVN0K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515081788#wasThisHelpful","RVNWGX1YVN0K3","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Makayla is one those adorable and awkward heroines who is impossible not to love because of the things she says and yet she's so caring and well-intentioned. She meets Max at an underground mixed-martial arts club because Max is one of the fighters. Even though everything about Max screams dominating, alpha and dangerous, there's a tender side of him that allows Makayla to set the pace when it comes to pursuing her.Both Max and Makayla have parts of the past that hold them back, but together, they are a fun and lovable couple.

"4-4.5 stars. Both Tristan and Elizabeth are broken characters who are trying to move on with their lives. Well, Elizabeth is trying to move on for the sake of her daughter, but Tristan is at a stand still. Elizabeth meets Tristan by chance and their first encounter is awful, Tristan is not warm or receptive at all but Elizabeth sees a man who is hurting deeply. He continues to be cold and mean towards her afterwards. They are now neighbors, too, so it's difficult for them to completely avoid each other, not to mention the small town rumors buzzing around about Tristan and his unsavory character.This story was different in the sense that when Tristan and Elizabeth found each other, they weren't trying to develop a romantic relationship at all. They did, however, lean on one another to remember their previous relationships and to numb the pain. Elizabeth also sparked something in Tristan to pull himself out of his internal bubble. The relationship between Elizabeth's daughter, Emma, and Tristan is especially sweet and endearing.The emotions are heavy in this story and the dynamics between Elizabeth and Tristan continue to change and evolve. Can they have a future with each other if neither wants to let go of the past? And what happens when they discover that their paths are more linked than they realized? There's a little bit of a suspense element, too. Just when everything seems lost or out of grasp, can either of them find their way back to the light and into each other's arms and live in the present? I really liked the portrayal of both main characters and the balance in showcasing their grief and their struggles to believe in happiness again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ETELLFTYXOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015L78KRQ#wasThisHelpful","R13ETELLFTYXOH","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 stars. The Education of Caroline takes place 10 years after The Education of Sebastian so Sebastian is no longer that seemingly young and innocent teenager he once was and his age isn't a barrier anymore. Where he used to be so thoughtful and caring and loving, he is now hardened and emotionally withdrawn. Sebastian and Caroline cross paths overseas while they are both on assignment, with Sebastian as a soldier and Caroline as a reporter. After a decade, neither of them have forgotten the other but so much has changed since then, they are different people now.I loved seeing Caroline being so independent and confident in herself now that she has made a living on her own and can stand on her own two feet. That's not to say that Caroline hasn't been lonely or struggled in her own ways, but she has accepted her life for what it is, both the mistakes and triumphs. Sebastian has risen through the military ranks and has also made a name for himself, now a multi-linguist and skilled soldier. Despite the divide in time and space, when they are together again, the strong connection between them hasn't dwindled. Sebastian is all man now and the growth in his character is obvious. Whereas Sebastian is impassive towards other people, Caroline is his weakness and while he was heartbroken for so long, he quickly realizes that he cannot survive without her and then glimpses of the old Sebastian, the sweet and tender and loving guy he once was, resurfaces.If things were difficult in the first book between them, they are not easier in the second book. The obstacles are different. They weren't worrying about their lives before, but now they do in a war zone. Sebastian has always had an unwavering faith in his love for Caroline, but now Caroline has to be the one to draw from her inner strength to help Sebastian pull through some dark times. I absolutely love both Sebastian and Caroline and needed to see them find their way back to each other and finally have the conclusion they deserved. Jane Harvey Berrick's writing is superb and even after I finished reading this, I still wanted more of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYWYDUYBJ5Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD2PT8M#wasThisHelpful","R1VYWYDUYBJ5Y3","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sophie Tisdale is a college student who works in a coffee shop and fantasizes about a repeat customer named Luke. He is older, professional, super sexy and completely out of reach. They don't converse much other than for Sophie to take his order when he comes into the shop. But then they have an encounter in a different setting, at the gynecologist's office where Sophie is there for an examination and Luke is the examining doctor. Well, isn't that all kinds of awkward for Sophie!Sophie gives off a very young and innocent vibe, she is also funny and sweet, too. She is very serious about her college studies and has always put off having an intimate relationship because she doesn't want to repeat her mother's mistakes. Sophie can be mature in that respect, but given that Luke is older, Sophie does come off immature in comparison to him, but very age appropriate for herself. It was endearing on her, though, and Luke found himself drawn into that as well, no matter how hard he fought it.Luke is the sort of guy who likes to be in control and he's dominating. He's intelligent, confident and persistent. For someone who is so collected on the outside, Sophie gets under his skin. I really liked both Sophie and Luke. They had amazing chemistry and witty conversation. The way they navigated through their obstacles wasn't unlike what other couples deal with, although add in the age factor because they are at different stages in their lives, and Sophie is still trying to find her path towards the future while Luke wants to simply offer readily available solutions. Can they convince one another that there's more right than wrong between them? A cute and entertaining story overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FIA2SJ8HJYN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ZZEYWE#wasThisHelpful","R3FIA2SJ8HJYN2","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-4.5 stars. This is my favorite book in the series so far because of the Southern cowboy Cain. His voice is perfectly captured in his distinct thoughts and sayings, which is unlike any of the other characters so far. Cain has a big heart that is just waiting to love someone and he knew he was a goner from the first time he set eyes on Celia. From the previous books, it's obvious that Celia has walls up around her when it comes to anything romantic, but the reason why is unknown. The prologue pulls the reader in and sets the stage for discovering Celia's history.Celia is amazing at her job, she really cares about her patients and has infinite patience herself. She's very giving, compassionate and understanding. While she and Cain develop a friendship, Cain wants to push her for more because he can't deny his feelings but Celia keeps holding back with hesitation, explaining how unavailable she is. I thought Celia was emotionally unavailable, but it just so happens that there's so much more behind that statement. Celia was in love once many years ago and that love, while not the same anymore, is what she clings to and can't let go of.I admired Cain's tenacity in pushing through Celia's barriers but Celia is equally stubborn and won't relent, especially when she sees how much it hurts other people around her. I was actually really annoyed that her best friend Audrey was so unsupportive even though I knew why. Storms Over Secrets is angsty and charged with a vibe of longing and regret. I really empathized with Celia because she was stuck between a rock and a hard place and until she could find a way out, she couldn't be with Cain and he did what he needed to do in order to move on. There's a great message in this story about people who cannot be helped if they don't want to be helped to begin with. Seeking help is nerve wracking, letting other people in is scary, and baring one's vulnerabilities is frightening. Yet living on the side of the fear really isn't living at all and once that meaning is understood, a whole series of events begins to take place that sets things in motion in the right direction. I didn't expect Cain to be my favorite character so far but he is, especially with the way he is so devoted in his heart and how he will go to any length to help out the people he cares for the most. Great story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBME8E8X431F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BBZB1K#wasThisHelpful","RUBME8E8X431F","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katie and Devin were best friends turned lovers growing up but then they had to go their separate ways. Katie has recently suffered a horrible ordeal and in the process of her recovery, is recommended to reach out to a soldier and the one she chooses is none other than Devin.I loved the correspondence communication between Katie and Devin. Because of their history, they didn't have to start with basic formalities and dove right into true and honest territory between them. The story alternates POVs between Katie and Devin. Katie has a lot of anger, frustration and grief that she is dealing with. She's overworking herself, extremely stubborn and she's numbing herself from any vulnerable emotions. Devin never forgot about Katie and when they reconnect, he sees this as an opportunity to prove to her that he still cares about her.Devin is overseas and gives a pretty good account of his life as a soldier. There's a lot of military descriptions (I had to look up some of the abbreviations or terms) and he has many fellow soldiers to keep track of in the book. I liked Devin a lot, he had a good heart and he was authentic in every way. He was also focused on his job and took his responsibilities very seriously.Katie had relatable qualities, but I couldn't quite relate to her fully. Still, I admired her for trying to overcome her issues so that she could move forward with her life. She really put in the effort to manage her roadblocks and to not mislead other people. I liked that after so many years, they could fall into such easy conversation again and that they still felt a strong connection with one another. While she wasn't sure about trusting Devin with her heart, she was open to resuming a friendship. If Devin wanted more and because tomorrow is never guaranteed, would Katie let him back in?I'm always in awe of the service and sacrifice provided by our military heroes, and Devin and his colleagues are no exception. If you like second chance romance with a military man and forgiveness being a big theme, then this book is for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQ0T0DB1OGEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FVO6LS#wasThisHelpful","RIQ0T0DB1OGEL","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-4.5 stars. Such a fun read with quirky characters. Indy Savage is a Rock Chick, the type of girl who attends concerts, lives out loud and has fun. She's also been in love with Lee Nightingale since she was 5 years old, but after repeated rejections, she has moved on and avoids him. However, Indy lands herself in a dangerous situation and the only person who can both help her and protect her is Lee himself. Lee takes it upon himself to use this circumstance to his advantage so that he can prove to Indy that he wants her after all. Will Indy allow herself to fall for Lee again?The humor in this book is well-written. Indy tells the story like it is, infused with her sarcasm and observations that are beyond entertaining. Indy's life is in danger, there's multiple shenanigans involving gun fire, kidnappings, explosions and car chases. While Indy takes it all in stride, she's not the sort of girl who simply follows directions and sits quietly while waiting for the excitement to die down. She cares a lot about her friends and family and is both free-spirited and an independent thinker.Lee is a definite alpha and he's also a scary bad boy, all the more reason for Indy to be attracted to him. I really liked both Lee and Indy, they had definite chemistry and Lee had his reasons for pushing Indy away early on. The secondary characters are also a lot of fun to read about, too. I am curious to find out what happens to the others in the rest of this series.

"I love a good forbidden romance, and Sins of Sevin seemed to promise that kind of storyline. But keep in mind that this is written by Penelope Ward and her stories are not predictable. Nope, not at all. This isn't a light-hearted read, there's a whole heck of a lot of stuff that happens and it's angsty, page-turning, heartbreaking and puts the characters and readers through an emotional meat grinder. The story goes even deeper than what the blurb describes and really pushes the limits of love in multiple ways - true love, platonic love, friendship love, sibling love, parent-child love, sacrificial love, substitute love, redemptive love and unconditional love.I grew quite attached to the main characters, Sevin and Evangeline, but they are very flawed characters. Sevin grew up in a conservatively religious household after his dad remarried to his step-mom and has the opportunity to get out when an offer to court Elle comes along his way. Sevin is at an age where he is beginning to understand that there are serious consequences to his actions and that while he is easily tempted by so-called forbidden things, he accepts that but wants to earn his place in life and fulfill a purpose.Elle and Evangeline are sisters and their upbringing is also rather traditional and conservative, too. Elle and Evangeline are very different from each other. Elle is sweet, optimistic and upbeat. She is also very simple in a lot of ways and her goals and desires in life are basic. Evangeline is more of the black sheep in her family, much like Sevin was. She is free-spirited, honest and has big dreams beyond the blueprint of the future that her parents expect of her. The chemistry between Evangeline and Sevin is undeniable, they have so much in common and it's obvious that they are the better match. Both Evangeline and Sevin acknowledge their imperfections and internally make promises to themselves to be better people, which is what guides a lot of their big decisions, and treads into the dangerous territory of being selfless vs selfish because of the potential aftermath.I didn't expect this book to be as emotionally consuming as it was, but it was. I'm not sure what to make of the turn of the events because it's a lot to process all in one book. I really loved the first half of the book, and then the second half veers into resolving the unresolved issues and it's messy, complicated and gutting. So many times I just felt clobbered by what happens and kept hoping that the characters would hurry up and find peace or closure - it's very well written and everything is addressed, no stones are left unturned. Although the plot and events are fictional, there's a true element of realness to the characters, their experiences and their feelings that make it all come to life with the highs and lows and everything else in between. I won't be forgetting this story any time soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SZEDTPKH0QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M1PULU#wasThisHelpful","R5SZEDTPKH0QE","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She winds up working for Julian Lefray, and her boss is flirty, sexy and fun. Unlike the last 2 books by RS Grey that were coworker romances, Julian actually isn't a jerk towards Josephine. They become fast friends and the novel is told in dual POV. Josephine refuses to give into the mutual attraction because she depends on her job to pay the bills and can't afford to lose it over a casual fling. I really liked both Julian and Josephine. They have a good sense of humor, an easy and natural chemistry and they respected one another. This is not a high drama or angsty romance, but there's plenty of entertaining events that made me chuckle.

There's plenty of Reese and Dylan love in this one, and it's fun to see how enamored they are with each other and some flashbacks in the past. Reese is still as sexy as ever but also very protective and dominating, too. Dylan is still hilarious and she and Juls and Joey are a happy trio of best friends. Brooke, Juls' sister, comes to work for Dylan and she isn't as obnoxious as she seemed in the last book so I'm looking forward to reading her story next.Sweet Possession is fairly light-hearted and low angst and fun.

"Liam Westbury is returning to Beaumont for his best friend's funeral and to face the love of his life, Josie Preston, that he left 10 years ago. Instead of becoming an NFL athlete, Liam is a famous musician and instead of marrying Josie, he's unattached and never let anyone take her place in his heart. Having read Finding My Way, I knew what Liam was thinking and I think this was helpful for me to understand him and where he was coming from when he went home. Otherwise, I think I might have had a harder time empathizing with him or wondering why he did what he did because some of his explanations weren't as detailed as I needed them to be.In Finding My Way, Josie comes off real sweet and loving, but I also thought she was a little vapid in some ways. Given that her future changed course when Liam walked out, Josie's had to grow up in many ways over the last decade so the Josie in Forever My Girl is more mature and not quite so oblivious. Their first encounter after so many years is definitely interesting and charged. I had to respect Liam for giving Josie space, but part of me wanted him to fight harder for her rather than waiting for her to come around. Sure, he let her down and thinks he deserves her hatred, but I expected him to try to redeem himself with everything he had in him instead of simply focusing on the singular connection that he has with Josie, which ties them together forever. She was great about putting the needs of others first and trying to comprehend what Liam went through.Even though things re-developed at an appropriate pace, I think I was still waiting for grander gestures or overtures so that I knew they could move forward past all the hurts and things wound up wrapping up more rapidly towards the end. Great second chance story overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R289HITDW56HKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATNJW3Y#wasThisHelpful","R289HITDW56HKT","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liam Westbury has his future all planned out already. The only problem is Liam is not sure that he wants to go along with that road map because it isn't what he planned, it's what others expect of him. Finding My Way is told entirely in his POV and gives insight to how Liam Westbury became Liam Page during the 10 year period after graduating high school. There's no doubt that he loves Josie Preston and wants a future with her, but Liam is struggling internally with measuring up to expectations that he can't see for himself and even Josie is expecting him to fulfill his potential. Although Liam is a star athlete with NFL potential, he's interested in pursuing music. Understanding his home life and how smothered he felt definitely made me empathize with him on the choices he made, including the multiple screw ups along the way. He needed to be in charge of his future and to make his own decisions, even if it cost him the person he loved the most because he couldn't be the person she deserved if he didn't like who he was or what he was doing with his life. Admittedly, Josie comes off as the sweet and supportive girlfriend, but also a bit oblivious and a little too idealistic with the image of her future with Liam. I felt like the story got a lot more interesting once Liam gets out to Los Angeles because he's left his bubble of security into a cutthroat environment where there's no trust, and it opens up his eyes but also pushes him to pursue his talent while living real life experiences along the way. Even though this is book 4 in the Beaumont series, I read it first because I wanted the background about Liam before diving into Forever My Girl when Liam returns to Beaumont to face everyone he left behind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AITUZ77VWVNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMQ1ABC#wasThisHelpful","R3AITUZ77VWVNS","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Brad is Piper's twin and Tanner's best friend and he's always had the stronger bond to the two of them. While Brad may not be ready to accept the idea of his sister and best friend being a couple, they sure are. Piper is a little insecure when it comes to Tanner. She's realistic, logical and goal oriented. Only Tanner seems to scatter her emotions. As for Tanner, he's persistent, determined and motivated. He's also sexy and charming.Before Tanner and Piper have a real chance to get started, they are already over due to deception. Now, 2 years later, they are going to be in each other's presence at Brad's wedding. Tanner wants Piper to forgive him and let him have a second chance. As much as Piper would like to concede, she can't compromise her morals or integrity for what Tanner did.What Tanner did isn't nearly as bad as some other types of deception. Not to mention that Brad isn't without his own faults. He came off self-centered and while I'm sure he wasn't clueless about Tanner and Piper's feelings, he didn't help them out when they were both miserable and missing each other either. And not just because he was doing Piper a favor in a big brotherly way, but more like he was unhappy and didn't mind dragging the others down around him to share in the misery.Although it was a good story, I expected a bit more in terms of Piper and Tanner's relationship, especially in terms of their maturity 2 years later. While Tanner had a lot of great qualities, I didn't really get to know him in terms of his quirks or personal details aside from him being Olympic quality in athleticism, his loyalty as a friend and his seductive charm. I also felt like I didn't get to know Piper outside of her insecurities tied to Tanner besides being a little bit frosty and a tomboy. Otherwise, the plot was decent and I am curious to see what happens with Brad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IBQTG95XUES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKQPA72#wasThisHelpful","R3IBQTG95XUES","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Auden has multiple insecurities so she doesn't let people in easily and assumes Aleksandr is a ladies' man. The reason behind Auden's cold exterior has a lot to do with abandonment type issues and the lack of nurturing and affection while growing up.I struggled to get into this story and following the characters as they developed was also hard because I couldn't tell if they were actually staying true to their character while progressing. I couldn't feel the chemistry between Auden and Aleksandr nor could I empathize with Auden's pain from childhood. I didn't find her very relatable. While I liked Aleksandr, so many things about him seemed at odds with who he appeared to be on the outside and lacked believability. He didn't really let the reader in too deep about him internally except for what little he shared with Auden. When he started expressing his true emotions, it felt out of place.The surprises that popped up in the story weren't predictable in a good way and kept me wondering what would happen next. Otherwise, it fell a little flat with the character dynamics.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z086K10REERL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7O6#wasThisHelpful","R1Z086K10REERL","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 stars. Best Laid Plans has two very interesting characters, Lily and Marc, and ""interesting"" is describing them mildly. Marc is a mercenary and is absolutely ruthless but also precise when it comes to doing his job. He doesn't have the time or interest in any type of entanglement. He lives for himself and loves his solitude. Lily is a transporter and although she may seem like a gorgeous and unassuming girl on the outside, she's no damsel in distress. Lily can kick a$$ with the best of them and one of the best is Marc. Although they are barely acquaintances who hook up for one night due to a mutual attraction, everything changes the following day when they are supposed to part ways - and the change is far from romantic.Marc believes Lily double crossed him and goes after her, intercepting her long awaited plan in the process. From there, it's a lot of fighting and distrust and just about all the bad words known in vocabulary. They are at an impasse because neither will yield and they both want the same thing, the diamonds in their possession, because those diamonds are a bargaining chip to somewhere else for someone else. Located in an exotic place with very little around them while fighting for survival, they have no choice but to tentatively depend on the other person. It's a fragile bond at best and recipe for catastrophe at worst.I enjoyed their business-like interaction with each other. Lily and Marc are not soft people with emotional hearts who exchange poetry. Lily is not to be underestimated. Even though she's not a trained assassin, she can fight without ever surrendering and keeps Marc on his toes. Marc may be a killer who doesn't blink over death, but Lily gives him a run for his money. Together, even in mutual disgust, they manage to work as a team to reach their destination. This book definitely packs excitement as far as not knowing what's going to happen next since a lot of what they deal with along the way is improvised.Marc reminds me a tiny bit of Tal and Jameson in certain parts, but he is most definitely his own character. He's rough around the edges, impassive, instinctive and goal oriented. He's also scary and dangerous, where he will act first and think later. While he seems unshakable, he has begrudging admiration for Lily because she won't back down no matter how threatening he is, and she's also very resourceful. I really enjoyed their dynamic. The progression of their relationship where emotions begin to trickle in felt very naturally paced and organic. Throughout the whole story, one of the major themes is deviating from the plan and just when I think they are going to stick with the plan, the story veers off in another direction again. Very entertaining story for action and suspense fans who like hardcore main characters that fight for survival to the end. Can't wait to read more about these characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322BSB1V60U68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KWCNL8#wasThisHelpful","R322BSB1V60U68","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both Brody Madden and Jordan Elliot have something to prove to the world. Brody wants to be more than just a football player, he wants to earn the respect and admiration of his peers. Growing up with parents who didn't value his true talents and sneered at his lack of academic ambition, Brody focuses his energy on being recruited into pro football. He has a lot of pressure on his shoulders with very little support because he doesn't trust many people with his secret, especially since it's at odds with his reputation at school.Jordan Elliot has a lot to lose and everything to gain with her international scholarship to play soccer in her senior year of college. That means no distractions and aside from studying to keep up her grades, she has to practice, practice, practice. There's no time to socialize, much less worry or care about other people and that includes Brody Madden. Her brother Nicky in Australia is counting on her to succeed and Jordan refuses to let him down.Everything changes, include the goals of the game, when Brody and Jordan meet. Although they are both stellar athletes who can relate to each other in more ways than one, trying to juggle a potential relationship amidst everything else proves to be quite a challenge. Jordan isn't one to mince words or be superficial so Brody's intentions send her mixed signals because she's not sure she can allow herself to get involved with someone, especially since she's not an American and plans to return to Australia. I admired her intensity and dedication to soccer, but she also has a good sense of humor and isn't selfish or pretentious. Brody surprised me with how much vulnerability he was willing to show Jordan because I thought he would play up the arrogant and confident jock more than anything. This story has some great themes about redemption, being true to one's self, pursuing happiness and looking internally for the strength to overcome big obstacles. Sometimes I got a little confused by how fast the timeline was moving forward and there were parts that didn't flow as smoothly as I would have expected, but good story otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBSDXB4S2ZG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IDFDQU#wasThisHelpful","R2BBSDXB4S2ZG6","A3KFTHKGVC63SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KFTHKGVC63SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very nice little case for your Galaxy S6 - very slim and stylish and it comes in 12 colors!  You can choose any color that matches and they are very nice cases, well made and sturdy.  The inside case attached to the wallet is very durable and hard so that it will keep your phone well protected.  There is a hole in the back for the camera and the hard case has all the necessary cutouts for your jacks and ports so you can keep the case closed and plug in the power cord :)  So go and grab the color you want now, get a few because they are inexpensive and then mix and match with your outfit :)  This is great for taking one item in someplace because it has the wallet area on the left side and room for a few cards and a pocket for cash.  I love the wallet cases, I don't even want the old style cases anymore!  And check out the photo of the inside of the case - it is awesome!  It is a nice tan suede with the company URL and insignia :)  Great deal, great value, great case!

"Just the name of this was enough to tempt me to try it!  When you think of Cashmere what comes to mind?  Silky, smooth, beautiful and soft for me - which is everything you want in a hair treatment.  This one is a no-drip solution and there are no nasty residues left over and the Moroccan Argan Oil is simply amazing in so many products but especially for hair.  I love to use it right after my shower - my hair dries fast because it is short and it gets oily too - but I have noticed that this treatment done every night has cut down on split ends, oil and it has really made my hair look sleek and yet soft at the same time.  I no longer use conditioners, just this.  I just take a few drops on my fingers and run it through my hair and just let it sink in while it dries :)  Definitely the best hair treatment I have ever come across - I have always had to use conditioners and not having to use them is such a great thing!  This does way more than any conditioner I have tried - so give it a whirl :)  Your hair will definitely thank you!!!

"Have you heard of Matcha Green Tea?  It has been hailed as an amazing weight-loss ingredient and is actually quite tasty in smoothies, ice cream and lots of other foods.  It helps with memory and concentration as well - there are SO many benefits to using this and it comes as a powder that you just mix in - so no prep needed just add it to whatever you are making and let it flavor your food :)I am not normally a tea-drinker but every once in a while I will try something new, so when I saw this it looked pretty good and looked into it a little bit, and it is all organic and the powder is ground from fine Japanese green tea leaves.  Matcha Green Tea is also what they used to use in traditional Japanese ceremonies although there are 2 varieties - the Ceremonial and the Culinary Grades!  And I have always loved the tea they serve in Japanese restaurants so I gave it a whirl!  It was really easy to make - I just boiled some water and poured the powder into my cup and stirred :)  I would liken this tea to a bold roast coffee as it is quite strong.  But the flavor is intense and has just a tiny bit of sweetness to it.  It is extremely smooth going down.  It was amazingly good and comforting.  I have not yet tried but I think it would be a good flavor to add like to a chai smoothie maybe or something similar?  This tea also has a lot less caffeine in it than a cup of coffee and if you want to keep it all organic you could add some soy milk and possibly some agave syrup to sweeten it up without adding too many calories :)Now I have never been to Japan and never went to a tea ceremony - but I have seen it on tv that they use powder for their tea and not tea bags.  So I assume this is the closest you can get to original Japanese tea without ordering from overseas.  I definitely recommend this brand, I was pretty impressed with it and it is not overly expensive which is a definite plus!

"I got this fan just in time - the hottest day of the year so far here in Indiana and my A/C in the apartment wasn't working - it was HOT.  I have asthma and it was terrible so I decided to get this fan out of the box and get it working.  I expected the same amount of air as my other stand fans but this one is amazing!  The three small rotating fans put out at least double the air as normal stand fans and because there are three of them in a row it puts out air on 2 levels more as well - so you get it on your feet, body and head area all at once.  I absolutely am in love with it and we have like 5 fans in our apartment right now and my daughter never notices them but as soon as she saw this fan she immediately went over to it and watched as her dress fluttered in the breeze :)  I love that it comes with a remote control too - I work online from my desk so I keep the fan at a little bit of a distance from me and I am always getting hot and turning it on then get cold to turn it off.  But with this fan I can sit at my desk and keep working, click the button and change the speed, rotation and everything :)  I LOVE THIS FAN!!!!  It is truly high quality and well-constructed and it is very stylish.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good tower fan!

"This is an awesome little steamer that you can use for anything you want!  It's not good for just veggies, you can cook a LOT of foods in it like fish or chicken and steaming keeps the nutrients in food better than other methods so it's also healthier.  The two features I like best are that the steamer opens just far enough to fit whatever size pan you are using and I really like the holder with the ring in the middle that allows you to grab it without getting burned.  And being stainless steel it will not rust and you will be able to have this for a long time.  You can throw it in the dishwasher when done and the sink sprayer works great for getting anything in the holes out :)  Wonderful product highly recommend trying it for your cooking needs!

"So far I really like this series even though I am not normally a fan of novels with cowboys and cowgirls. But this isn't the normal western novel, it's a story about 3 alienated sisters who come back to the family ranch after their father's death and find out that in order to inherit the land they must all live together. Kate is the one daughter who stayed with their father and worked the ranch and she loves it. So the thought of losing what she has worked SO hard for is devastating for her and she fights to ensure her sisters stay. The whole sibling rivalry theme runs strong through this novel as the sisters start to warm to each other and their new lifestyle. Each sister has a different personality: Kate is strong and has a will of iron and will not back down from any challenge including the one her father gave her; Jenny is also strong-willed but she is a city girl so living on a ranch is NOT the life she had planned for herself; and Jenny is the soft-spoken one who doesn't like fighting and doesn't make waves. Jenny is still a country girl at heart and in some ways I got the impression that she missed life on the ranch. She may not have planned this life but she isn't fighting against it as Jenny is. While Mandy and Jenny are struggling to adjust, Kate is struggling to find out whether her father was murdered or actually committed suicide. She has suspects but will she and her sisters be able to figure out the mystery before they become the next victim? Very well-written novel and the characters really come to life and are so completely different but somehow start to come together.

"I have never been a big one for taking selfies until recently.  And I could not figure out how people take such masterful pictures of themselves while holding the phone!  I seriously can't do it LOL they come out terrible.  So then one day I discovered the selfie stick while searching and I was like WOW so maybe that is how they do it!  So I applied for this review to try one of these awesome little sticks and I am thrilled at how well they work.  Not only can you take selfies with these but I have also seen people using them while taking tours to get better pictures and lots of other places.  Most selfie sticks you just insert your phone or camera onto the end of the stick and secure it to take pics.  This one has a great feature in that the stick collapses and it also has a 270 degree rotation on the stand.  The rotation gives you unlimited ways to take your selfies - even upside down :)  And it does fit easily into a bag once collapsed.  This is truly an awesome thing that every person who takes pictures with their phone needs!

"This is a very soft and silky skin care cream that everyone will love.  When you open the jar it smells nice and fresh and it is creamy and looks so smooth.  This has all of the great ingredients that every skin care cream needs like Shea Butter, Macadamia Nut Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Rose Hip Oil, Vitamins A, D3 and extract of Ginseng Root, Chamomile & Green Tea.  All of these and more plus the Aloe which is possibly the best known moisturizer and has been used for centuries to treat burns and dry skin.  This does not have a harsh scent but rather a nice kind of fruity citrus smell to it that is not overpowering but just enough.  I am very happy with the results of this cream, it absorbs easily without leaving that nasty greasy residue on your skin and it leaves you feeling so refreshed and really moisturizes your skin.  I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin or rosacea to help ease the redness and dryness.

"Another awesome case from Verus!  Comes in many colors and for both the S6 and the S6 Edge.  Very stylish case and if you really look at the pictures it looks like the case gets slimmer in the middle which is awesome :)  It's like a little black dress for your phone except it's green!  I honestly wasn't sure I would like the Thor Green color but after seeing it up close I have to say I really like it.  And every Verus case makes a great bumper case and provides superior protection for your phone.  And you WANT good protection if you are going to spend $400 or $500 or more for a phone.  This slides onto your phone and forms a tight seal around it so that you can drop it hard and the inside cushion will help stop cracks and nicks.I am totally in love with the Verus cases - they have SO many to choose from and they really are the best I have seen - they give you the complete protection for your phone without the bulkiness.  And when you go to the product page by clicking on the image at the top of the page check out the Electric Blue and Thor Shine Gold - they are my other FAVORITE colors for this case :)  Check out their range of 2 piece cases as well, the top piece snaps into a small bottom piece and you can mix and match all their colors with those :)  So much to choose from, grab them now!

"I have always struggled with acne and being 39 and still having that issue is so annoying!  I just want clear and beautiful skin.  I have tried all the acne meds and nothing helps - so I was skeptical about trying these for that reason.  But I have noticed a definite lessening in my acne since using these - these little dots are easy to apply and they blend with your skin so that you can't tell they are there.  And rather than using a cream that rubs into the skin one time, these provide a round the clock absorption so it clears up your acne much more quickly.  And it's an overnight treatment - you put it on at night and in the morning take it off!  These are natural - no chemicals that will dry out and harm your skin so they are also much better in many respects than the acne creams out there in the store.  You get 16 patches in one pack for just $17.90 on Amazon.  Did I mention they are also Vegan, Latex-free and never tested on animals?

I wasn't sure what exactly I was getting when I ordered them for the review but I got them and just had to get them out immediately and as soon as putting one on my phone I was hooked and had to do a video of them!  These are amazing little gadgets that just stick on the back of your phone case or phone and they pop up and down so you can use them to hold onto your phone while texting, taking pictures and other things that you normally could easily drop your phone while doing.  I have been using this all the time since putting it on!  You can wrap your phone cord around it so you don't lose it too.  And it seems big when it is popped out but you just apply a little pressure and it pops down to a thin disk that you can't even tell is there :)  The best part is they come in SO many colors and designs - you can literally get whatever matches your phone or mix and match.  I received 2 PopSockets and I chose a really pretty owl design and a psychadelic design.  I am really impressed with these and I am definitely getting more so I can match all of my phone cases :)  I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLS0A5CQFS0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMXD9FU#wasThisHelpful","R1YLS0A5CQFS0P","A22LQGRG61FDYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22LQGRG61FDYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an awesome book about friendship, betrayal, loss and ultimately finding yourself and letting go.  Taylor starts climbing the stairs after she is involved in an accident and we are to believe they are the stairs to her final resting place.  But with each step she takes we see a flashback from her former life - most of them involving her best friend Sunny who is both friend and foe for Taylor.  Taylor expects the steps to lead somewhere, that there will be an ending - but what will she find at the end of the steps - or will there even BE an end?  I really loved the way the author kept making the characters more complex with each story.  I went from liking certain characters to disliking them and then some I liked again by the time it all unfolds.  Highly recommend this book, it is definitely a page-turner and really makes you think about your own life and how you look at the world.

"I love stories about different places and times and this has everything; nobility, intrigue, romance, mansions and most importantly a strong heroine that won't bow down to what her father wants and rails against tradition to make her own way in the world.  Even though Rhona's father is set on her marrying a rich laird but she isn't having it!  Instead she opts to go against her father and enters into an engagement with the dashing agent Charles Blackwood.  What follows after she leaves her home is a harrowing journey with twists and turns, loyalties and the ultimate disloyalty ... being betrayed by your own family.  But WHO is betraying Rhona?  You will have to read the book to find out - is it just one person or many?  And is Charles Blackwood the good guy that she has come to trust or just another one out to get her?  Bringing a British agent into the Scottish landscape really adds a great point of interest to the story :)  I really loved the Victorian England setting paired with the Scottish lifestyle and some of the humor that is mixed in.  The ending of the book sets up the next in the series very well and I have got to read Book #1 and Book #3 now because they all have one thing in common - strong sensible heroines and that is one thing that I really love in books!

"I absolutely am in love with this pan - I wish I had ten more like it!  I use it all the time for everything anymore.  I normally have to buy an entire set of pots and pans every year because they lose their coating - but I have to say that this holds up against even the most expensive sets of pans and it has not lost ANY of it's nonstick coating.  It is a nice size, not too big and not too small and it is solid and sturdy and you can tell when you hold it that it is high quality materials.  I have tried a few Ozeri products and have yet to be disappointed in their brand at all.  They make a LOT of products for not just the kitchen but also scales.  This pan is also very easy to clean up, I put it in the dishwasher but the nonstick material is SO great that you can burn cheese or anything and it will just wipe right off!  Something that normally only the supremely expensive pans can boast.  So check out all of their products today and get the best in your house!

"The perfect case for anyone who wants protection, style and ease of use all in one case.  The silver color is awesome and looks like real silver bars and definitely lends a ton of class to this case.  It has all the cutouts for the camera, ports and jacks and the buttons are easily accessible.  The inside of this case has an air pocket that allows a cushion if your phone is dropped and doesn't get damaged plus it is lightweight but still very sturdy and well-made.  This particular case is sold for both the S6 and S6 Edge and the price is approximately $17.00 for either.Verus makes some great phone cases for all styles and models of phones - I really love the different types they offer because some are slick and thin, some are more modern with edges and so much more.  If you are in the market for a case that is versatile and high quality then Verus is for you.  if you are going to spend upwards of $300 on a phone you really need to have a proper case to make sure it doesn't get broken.  And while you are at it grab up a screen protector to help stop scratches and dents on the front of the phone too.  So check out all of their cases and choose the ones that are the best fit for you AND your phone :)  I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCFJJJY94KI90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEEZ6V6#wasThisHelpful","RCFJJJY94KI90","A22LQGRG61FDYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22LQGRG61FDYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am loving these phone cases!  Verus has something for everyone and yet they are all so versatile and easy to change your style.  They are perfect protection for your phone, nice hard cases but this one is a bit different ... it has a slot that opens up on the bag to cards in!  That's right - you could put your credit or debit card, drivers license PLUS some cash in this slot and no one will know it's there - and no worries about it slipping out of the case, it closes nice and tight and looks normal!  This is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to take their purse or wallet in someplace but want to carry the very minimum in a safe way.  I have honestly never seen a phone case that does that and is still slim!I love the color of this one, it is a beautiful gold color and it fits your phone like a glove but is NOT made of silicone - it is a hard plastic bumper case.  If you use this case with a screen protector your device is VERY well protected!  The best part is that the inside of the case is made to be shock proof - it is NOT hard but rather soft and the edges are rubberized to help with shocks if you happen to drop it.  You spend a LOT of money on these phones - you need a good solid case to protect them.  Don't let them get broken, especially when you can protect them for a great price and these cases are only $19.99!  That's most likely less than you would have paid for that expensive warranty :)  Check out all of their cases - they have 2Link models where the top slides into the bottom and locks and you can switch out colors and styles :)  Can't go wrong with Verus, I love all their cases so far!

"This is the third different MeasuPro BP monitor I have been able to test and I like it just as well as the others.  MeasuPro has something for everyone and they all work great.  This one is a smaller upper arm monitor and the machine itself is also smaller and easy to read.  It gives you a really nice large LCD screen that clearly states SYS, DIA, and PUL so you can get the results you need instantly and easily.  It also has the capacity to store 2 people's BP results as the other monitors do, you can keep up to 120 total readings so you can have 60 per person if more than one person uses it on a regular basis.  I like the cuff on this monitor - it is the perfect size - not too long and not too short.  It is also small so it's easy to store and comes with a nice carrying bag for traveling :)I had perfect BP until I turned 37 and all of a sudden it went downhill.  Now I have to be on meds and having this BP monitor is something I need to make sure my BP stays within the correct rates and the meds are working properly.  I love that it has space for 2 people - my daughter is 8 and has Williams syndrome - she had heart surgery at 3 months old.  So I like to try to take her BP every so often to make sure it is good.  This allows me to keep hers as well as my own separate readings.  I will definitely be using these BP monitors for a LONG time - they are great and I love having them at my fingertips when needed :)  I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XCUWEEBND6E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGC4MNY#wasThisHelpful","R2XCUWEEBND6E3","A22LQGRG61FDYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22LQGRG61FDYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love to have pure water but unfortunately in the city you don't always get that - and even though a case of bottles is not super expensive it adds up!  Especially when you are living on a budget and you can get water from the tap for nothing.  I like this because you can keep it right next to the sink and use it to make your water whenever you need it - you don't HAVE to have the filter working 24/7 - which in turn saves costs on filters.  It can be turned on and off easily so you don't have to let it work all the time.  I honestly wish I would have had this at my old place because the water there tasted and smelled horrible even with a water softener.  It filters out all the nasties in your water and I must say the taste of this water is amazing even compared to bottled water.  It is really easy to install - you can have someone install it by cutting a hole in your countertop OR you can just hook it up under the sink and keep it under there for use when you need it which is how I have been using it - but very easy and unique product :)  I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZW4W2OR6PU72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXSMDHM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZW4W2OR6PU72","A22LQGRG61FDYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22LQGRG61FDYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These necklaces and bracelets are perfect - she got all different colors and types from hard to softer and she really loves them!  I am thrilled with them, they haven't completely gotten her to give up the binkies yet but they are working for her during the day and the nice part is she can use them at school and wherever else we go and no one looks at her strangely or complains.

"The title of this book just gives me chills - I don't know why - but it is clear from the title and cover image that when you open this book it will not be your ordinary Victorian journey.  And it isn't.  What we get is a fantastical journey into the world of steampunk which is a fairly recent genre involving bots and Victoriana and imagination.  This book is different from the beginning though because it is NOT set in Victorian England, but in France.  So that sets it apart and I love that you can read the book and actually hear the accents in your head as they are speaking.  We get a chance to meet Marguerite, a girl who seemingly has everything - she is wealthy, privileged, has her own ""maid-bot"", and has the absolute best of everything including clothing and education.  She is extremely smart but in the beginning we see her as this ""model"" of girls during that period - she conforms but wants to break free and be herself.  When I first started reading I saw her as a very shallow girl and then watched her grow into this strong and independent woman by the end of the book.  Fantastic characterization from the author as you really get to KNOW the characters and almost build a relationship with them.  Madame Pomphart is actually a hilarious character in my mind - and she reminds me a lot of the teachers in Jane Eyre.  She is mean and it is hard to figure out whether she dislikes the lifestyle Marguerite lives; Marguerite herself; or is coming from a place of jealousy.  Marguerite is fairly naive about the larger world and she decides to follow the man she believes to be the love of her life Claude into that world.  But what comes next throws Marguerite into a whole new landscape of reality, fear and ultimately becoming an adult.  The title comes into play when she leaves because she seems like the normal rich girl but underneath she is something different - and that something will allow her to face the realities of the big world she has never seen and overcome her flaws to become the lady inside.  After reading this I REALLY want an Outil maid-bot of my own :)  The whole book is filled with the backdrop of the steampunk theme - automation, bots, innovation and more.  I had to laugh at the ""automated koi"".  It is something that seems like a dream world, but in reality is it something we would really want?  And I guess that is part of the question that Marguerite must ask herself and find the answer to.  Very intriguing novel, and definitely a steampunk staple if you are into that genre!!!!

"I love power :)  Who doesn't?  Especially when your phone or tablet is dying and you are freaking out because you have a call you can't miss or that game you might lose because you can't play.  For me it's my phone because it's my only phone and my daughters iPad because it keeps her busy and she goes nuts when it dies on her.  So when we are in the car or out somewhere that we can't to a plug and we need power this is great!  I have about 5 power banks that I always keep charged, and I really love this one compared to most of them because it's bigger but still very light and it gives one full charge quickly without taking forever.  Plus it's easy because it doesn't have a long cord and so you can keep both the cube and your phone in your pocket or purse together while they charge.  Plus this is a universal device, it will work with any device that has a USB cord so for the Apple iPad Minis or just the mini-USB cords.  It will give one FULL charge and then will just need to be charged back up when you get home - the greatest part of this one is that it comes with it's own dock :)  I leave mine on the chargers and grab an go :)  Can't beat them for mobile power whenever you need it and no matter where you are!

"WOW is what I have to say about this book so far and now I cannot wait to read the second part ... the complete and utterly shocking twist of events at the end of chapter thirteen is just stunning and then you don't find out why it is happening!  The first thing I noticed about this book is the juxtaposition of light and dark.  The rooms are totally white, they must keep them completely perfect with nothing to clean with.  Then the red blood they must give each day set against this stark and cold background - it has to be a set up for the ending but I haven't figured it out yet.  They call the parents Mother and Father, and then the girls are called by their room numbers instead of their names.  All of the twins start to almost become the other twin and yet Claire is holding out she seems to recognize that something is up but with her headaches and fear it is hard to stay inside herself.  I found myself wondering about the half butterfly with metric shapes in between chapters - does it mean that they are trying to make 2 twins into 1 person?  It seems that way.  But it also shows the sterility of the whole book as well - everything MUST fit into these perfect little packages and yet they don't.  At least Claire doesn't.  Audrey seems like a very immature character compared to Claire in my opinion, but I loved the way the author brought Brayden into the picture and the way he metamorphosed - just like a butterfly.  Butterflies come out of a cocoon and then they live a short but beautiful life.  Is that what the twins are?  Butterflies who are destined to live short lives?  Will one but not the other survive?  What are they using the blood for and why does all the testing take such a toll on them?  I seriously cannot wait to find out - I read this all in less than an hour, I devoured the book!  It is a MUST-READ for anyone who likes suspense and paranormal and in the end what seems to be a dystopian universe.  I absolutely loved it :)  And the cliffhanger will have you literally holding your breath for about 2 minutes!

Body Merry also uses NO chemicals, parabens or sulphates in their products so you know they are natural and mostly organic.

"I have several portable battery chargers, and this one is the lightest and largest capacity with 9000 mAh power.  I have a Samsung Galaxy SIII and it will charge that as well as my Galaxy Tab 4 AND my daughters iPad 2 on ONE SINGLE CHARGE :)  That to me is excellent!  My phone and her iPad are the two devices that tend to run out of power more quickly.  I can carry this in my purse and if we are somewhere that I can't plug in I can just hook it up to my phone and charge wherever!  Walking down the street even!  One of the best features of this is that you can charge 2 devices at once - so if I forget a power cord at home I can charge them up no problem.  Plus this comes with a cord for you too and if you are like me you like to have about 30 power cords laying around in case something happens :)  If you have ever had a small portable hard drive this is about the same size just thinner and lighter.  Just keep this plugged in when you are home and keep it charged, grab it when you leave and you know you are safe from power drains.

She becomes one of the creepiest characters I have ever read in a book just because she keeps calling Helen by her daughters name and therefore begging the question if the reader believes that when an organ is transplanted does the donor received any of the former owners thoughts, ideas or wishes?  As Helen comes to resent her, Marilyn realizes that the heart went to someone who she believes is not worthy.  Losing Heart is truly a story of love, loss and the struggle for redemption and freedom.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and it is an easy and quick read - I could not put it down and read it in one hour!  Helen is one of those heroines that you like but don't like, and you aren't sure whether you are rooting for Tom or Jack to win in the end.  The mother is really annoying and it's almost like she is inside Helen's head rather than a real person, like Helen is judging herself rather than being judged.  She knows what she is doing is wrong but she NEEDS it.  I was spellbound by this book, and it truly is a heartwarming and tragic story.  And the cover I think perfectly illustrates the theme of the book - the pomegranate once opened starts to lose the seeds just like once Helen's heart is opened she starts to lose herself.  But the question is can she FIND herself again?

"Messy Grace by Caleb Kaltenbach is an insider’s look at a pastor who has developed a deep and growing love for the LGBT community.  Pastor Kaltenbach has a unique perspective on this subject, as he grew up with parents who were gay.After revealing some of the details of his painful story, the author challenges the church to reach out to the LGBT community in practical ways.  What really stands out in this book is the balance between truth and grace.  Most churches and indeed, most Christians appear to land in one arena or the other.  Some professing Christians simply overlook the sin of homosexuality and give such people a pass.  Grace covers a multitude of sins.  Others, in an effort to be faithful to the Scriptures condemn the sin of homosexuality and alienate the LGBT community in the process.  The truth shall set you free.Kaltenbach argues for a radically different approach.  His aim is to see the church demonstrate grace to the LGBT community, but never at the expense of truth.  He challenges believers to love these people who struggle deeply with their sexual identity but without compromising biblical morality.I anticipate this book will stir up a hornet’s nest in the evangelical world.  It is a bold book.  It is a controversial book.  It will challenge conservative evangelicals.  Most important, it will reveal the heart of the Pharisee.May Christ-followers learn from Pastor Kaltenbach’s godly example.  More importantly, may they follow the example of Jesus by reaching out and befriending people in the LBGT community.  The recent Supreme Court decision, while disturbing and discouraging actually opened a huge door to Christians.  This door will enable followers of Jesus to demonstrate love to people who are created in the image of God; people created with dignity and a purpose.  Kaltenbach warns that such a move will prove costly.  Such a move will be messy.  But messy grace is the result of life-on-life relationships which are prompted by a desire to please our great God and sovereign king.  Messy grace is fueled by a deep desire to penetrate the nations with the gospel of Jesus Christ.I received this book free from the publisher.

"Faith Alone by Thomas Schreiner is  much-needed treatment of the doctrine which was rediscovered during the days of the Protestant Reformation, namely, justification by faith alone.  The author makes it plain from the beginning that he does not intend to offer a comprehensive treatment of this doctrine.  Rather, he guides readers through a tour of the doctrine of justification.  The contours of this fascinating tour are informed by history, theology, and biblical/exegetical arguments.Dr. Schreiner is unique among theologians as he fairly represents opposing positions and graciously refutes them.  His stance toward Rome, in particular, is refreshing and sure to pose a challenge to Roman Catholic thought.Despite the gracious intent of the author, his arguments are robust and biblical.  His allegiance to the Sola Scriptura principle is evident throughout and his love for the doctrine of justification by faith alone is clear.I commend this work highly and expect it shall receive a wide reading.www.baldreformer.wordpress.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22EMHUUPXZ5KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310515785#wasThisHelpful","R22EMHUUPXZ5KL","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The legacy of President Ronald Reagan is securely established in history. Liberals can scoff and moan but the fact remains; Ronald Wilson Reagan is one of the most influential Americans of all time. Indeed, Reagan is not only one of the loved and respected presidents in American history; he is also one of the most effective.Most books focus on the life of President Reagan and work hard to establish his presidential accomplishments. Craig Shirley's new masterpiece, Last Act: The Final Years and Emerging Legacy of Ronald Reagan takes a different approach. Shirley sets out to help readers see Reagan in a different light and in a different context. This book serves as a lens for Americans to view President Reagan in his post-presidential days, including the days which followed his diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.Last Act begins with President Reagan on his death bed. The author highlights Reagan’s life and legacy from different perspectives - including friends, family, and foes. One of the constant themes that weaves through the book is the deep and abiding love that America has for the 40th president of the United States.We would do well to listen to the words of Reagan's old arch nemesis, Senator Ted Kennedy who offered these fitting words, upon hearing of Reagan's death:He brought a special grace to the White House and the country in everything he did. We often disagreed on specific issues, but he had an undeniably unique capacity to inspire and move the Nation. On foreign policy, he will be honored as the President who won the cold war. It was more than the fact that he was a superb communicator. Some attributed at least part of his success to the fact that he was a superb communicator. Some attributed at least part of his success to the fact that he had been an actor. But his deepest convictions were matters of heart and mind and spirit, and on them, he was no actor at all.Last Act: The Final Years and Emerging Legacy of Ronald Reagan bears the marks of a book which is informed by thorough research and careful study. Craig Shirley should be commended for his clear writing and respect for the 40th president of the United States. Last Act is not only a tribute to one of the most beloved leaders in American history; it is a gift to the American people.The legacy of Ronald Wilson Reagan speaks for itself and will continue to reverberate throughout history. Antonin Scalia notes, “Ronald Reagan needs no one to sing his praises.” Justice Scalia may be on target. But the fact remains: History will not stand by in silence. The legacy of Ronald Reagan will endure for generations.I received this book free from the publisher.

"He was a Augustinian monk, transformed by the sovereign grace of God. His newly regenerated heart beat with passion for Jesus. His mind was devoted to the sacred Scripture. This former Roman Catholic turned Protestant rebel was mightily used by God to influence a nation and eventually the whole world for the sake of Christ’s gospel.But one of the key themes in Luther’s life was the other love of his life, Katherina Von Bora. This fascinating love story emerges in Jody Hedlund’s new book, Luther and Katharina. This work of historical fiction captures the pathos of a woman who left the “safe” confines of the abbey. Safety was a relative term in the 16th century abbey, since the Roman Catholic church was plagued by corruption, heresy, abuse, and sexual sin.Luther and Katharina underscores the heavy works-based orientation among the faithful. At one point in the story, one of the former nuns asks with chagrin, “Do you ever wonder if we should have stayed?” “What if God is displeased with us? What if He’s punishing us for forsaking our vows?” She continues, “What if we’ve thrown away our best chance at salvation.” Such a sentiment not only characterized the church in the 16th century. It is still a part of the warp and woof of the Roman works-based system.Additionally, the book captures the tension between genders in a 16th century context. The author does a formidable job of fairly representing a male dominated culture, “without horns and without teeth,” as Luther might say.Hedlund is a colorful writer, with an ability to turn a phrase and guide the imagination of the reader in the right direction. She demonstrates a good working knowledge of Reformation culture, including the priesthood of believers, cardinal doctrines such as justification by faith, and the repudiation of celibacy.Luther and Katharina is a terrific historical read designed to awaken a thirst for authentic relationships which are grounded in gospel reality.Highly recommended!I received this book free from the publisher.

"Some people love him; others hate him.  But one thing is certain about Bill O’Reilly.  The popular host of the O’Reilly Factor makes history interesting.  The “no-spin” Irish-American journalist began a series of killing books, with the publication of Killing Lincoln.  This effort was followed by Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, and Killing Patton.  O’Reilly’s latest offering, Killing Reagan has sparked a bit of controversy, since unlike the other characters, Reagan was not murdered.Readers will not be surprised that at the heart of this book is an insiders look at the assassination attempt of President Reagan.  The would be executioner, John Hinckley Jr. is rightly portrayed as a psycho-path drifter who will go to any length, including killing the President of the United States to impress the actress, Jodi Foster.But readers may be surprised at how O’Reilly portrays the President.  The author carefully paints a portrait of the 40th president and includes details that are making some readers uncomfortable and even upset.  Make no mistake: the king of no-spin in unwilling to leave any stone unturned in this book.Apart from some of the more controversial elements of the book, O’Reilly includes fascinating discussion about Reagan’s relationship with Nancy, staff members, Mikhail Gorbachev, and of course, the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher.This book will draw criticism from liberals.  But it will also invite the critical response of conservative who revere Ronald Reagan.  But it is clear that O’Reilly  writes as an unbiased journalist here.  He has no bone to pick. He has no axe to grind.  He merely desires a telling of the facts.  The end result is a fascinating read that ultimately honors the 40th President of the United States.  Killing Reagan is a memorial to one of America’s great leaders.  It is a vivid reminder of the importance of freedom.  This is the story of Ronald Wilson Reagan - patriot, promoter of liberty, and President of the United States of America.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8WMWK6C2XQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627792414#wasThisHelpful","RP8WMWK6C2XQW","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Modern day readers in search of a thriller packed with action, intrigue, and espionage turn to authors like Daniel Silva, Vince Flynn, or Tom Clancy. Readers looking for historical drama may turn to Dan Brown or Bernard Cornwall. When I learned about the chance to read and review Mike Evans novel, The Columbus Code, I jumped at the opportunity. Initially, the book appeared promising and seemed to offer not only a good story but an inside look at the mysterious figure, Christopher Columbus. Unfortunately, the storyline in this book drags and the characters are not developed in a way the holds the attention of the reader. But the inability to hold the attention of the reader is not the greatest concern. The chief problem with The Columbus Code is the scanty discussion about the famous explorer. A small portion of the book is devoted to unwrapping the story of Columbus. Personally, I was disappointed with how The Columbus Code unfolded.I received this book free from the publisher.

"They call him the ""Wacko Bird.""  Other words are often used to cruzdescribe the Senator from Texas: He's accused of being ""extreme,"" ""out of touch,"" ""crazy,"" and  ""arrogant.""  The media has caricatured him as a right-wing lunatic.  The liberals in Congress have tried to discount him and marginalize him.After reading, A Time For Truth by Ted Cruz, I can say with confidence that the Senator is a man who means what he says and says what he means.  He is committed to conservative values and is willing to pay a personal price for standing up for those values.A Time For Truth is the story of an immigrant's son - a man who learned the value of hard work, honesty, and integrity at a young age.  It is the story of a Princeton graduate (cum laude) who walked away with an undergraduate degree in Public Policy.  Cruz went on to graduate magna cum laude from Harvard Law School.  The liberal law professor, Alan Dershowitz calls Cruz, ""Off-the-charts brilliant.""  Yet the Senator from Texas is portrayed as a ""dummy"" and an ""extremist.""A Time For Truth sets the record straight.  I have a sneaking suspicion that Senator Cruz will get the last laugh.  Time will tell if he has the right stuff to secure the Republican nomination for President of the United States.  But one thing is for certain: The Senator from Texas is unwilling to waver.  He is unwilling to back down.  He is unwilling to compromise his conservative principles.  The ""wacko bird"" is just getting started!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOM5U3V0Z8DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTSKHTU#wasThisHelpful","R1QOM5U3V0Z8DL","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My introduction to Alex Kershaw took place several years ago as I spiespoured over his excellent book, The Longest Winter.  Kershaw is back again with another historical gem, Avenue of Spies.  The book chronicles the life and legacy of Sumner Jackson and his wife, Toquette.  These brave people joined the French in their pushback against the Third Reich during the heart of World War II.Kershaw is a master story teller who has a special gift for transporting readers into the heart of Paris, a city that was overtaken by Nazi thugs.  He carefully guides readers through the historical drama, noting the tragic turn of events for Mr. and Mrs. Jackson and their family.The author educates readers by helping them understand the worldview of Hitler's henchmen as well as those who fought against the Third Reich.  The attention to detail is breath-taking.  The scenes are memorable.

"One thing that marked my childhood was hearing Billy Graham preach several times.  I saw him preach at the Kingdome in Seattle in 1976 to a capacity crowd, the largest crowd in the history of the infamous dome.  I saw him preach in Spokane as a teenager and saw him in his last Crusade in the Tacoma Dome in 1991.  I remember being impressed, even as a child with his boldness and courage in the pulpit - characteristics that never faded from the world-famous evangelist.Boldness and courage are two words that describe Dr. Graham's most recent offering, The Reason For My Hope.  After seventy years of ministry, the message remains the same.  The message is the simple gospel message that Christ came to die for sinners, securing forgiveness and eternal life for anyone who believes.Graham weaves personal stories and anecdotes throughout his gospel presentation.  The narrative is warm.  The message is compelling.  It is no secret that Billy Graham proclaims a message that is peppered with doctrinal convictions that find a home in the Arminian camp.  The debate between Calvinists and Arminians will likely continue until the coming of our Lord.I still have fond memories of seeing Billy Graham preach the Word of God.  I have since come to some soteriological conclusions that differ from Graham.  But my respect for the man has never wavered. Billy Graham is a consistent, faithful, Christ-follower.  He has finished the race strong.  He is a faithful witness to the reality of Jesus Christ and his gospel!I received this book free from the publisher.

"What is the criteria for a successful church that is growing and impacting its community for the sake of the gospel?  While many churches point to attendance numbers or the size of one's campus, J.D. Greear argues in a completely different direction.  Greear says this: ""Jesus' measure of the church is not seating capacity, but sending capacity.""  Pastor Greear effectively makes this case in his newest book, Gaining By Losing.J.D. Greear is the Pastor of Summit Church in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.  His previous books, Jesus Continued, Gospel: Recovering the Power That Made Christianity Revolutionary, and Stop Asking Jesus Into Your Heart have been an immense encouragement to me, personally.Gaining By Losing is equally encouraging.  The author argues that churches in our generation who make an impact learn to send people - ultimately to plant the church.  In part one, the author develops his philosophical and biblical case for being a sending church.In part two, the author presents readers with ten principles, what he refers to as plumb lines for being a sending church.  These plumb lines are biblical, practical, and have been field tested in the church that Greear pastors.At the heart of the book is an appeal for churches engage in systematic discipleship.  The author argues, ""Every spiritual gift serves the larger purpose of making disciples.  The gifts are varied, but the mission is the same.""  In the final analysis, ""The future belongs to churches that send.""Gaining By Losing is a much-needed book in our age of pragmatism and man-centeredness.

"After serving in pastoral ministry for nearly twenty-five years, I can testify that the most discouraging moments occurred when the people of God failed to look favorably on theology.  R.C. Sproul rightly laments, ""We live in the most anti-intellectual period in all of church history.""  Frankly, many pastors have the battle scars to prove it.  I know I do.Kevin VanHoozer and Owen Strachan serve up a timely antidote to this troubling, anti-theology age we find ourselves in.  The Pastor as Public Theologian presents a fresh vision; a vision for ""reclaiming the vocation of the pastor-theologian.""  But the authors have a larger vision that unfolds throughout the book.  Their vision extends to local congregations.  They too need to reclaim the vision and vocation of the pastor theologian.Part one explores biblical theology and historical theology.  Part two explores systematic theology and practical theology.  Each chapter is drenched in biblical wisdom with an eye on kingdom priorities.This book stands in the same stream as David Well's excellent works, No Place For Truth, God in the Wasteland, and The Courage to Be Protestant - to name a few.  The great strengths lie not only in setting forth a description of the problems in the church but in the prescription for moving forward.  Such a move entails  pastors who are theologically motivated and theologically driven.  These pastors offer up theologically rich sermons which equip, edify, and send the people of God to the nations.The Pastor as Public Theologian is a sweeping book.  It is, in many ways an epic accomplishment. Indeed, VanHoozer and Strachan achieve their goal in setting forth the biblical case for recovering the biblical portrait of the pastor-theologian.The Pastor as Public Theologian is a profoundly encouraging book.  Pastors who are serious about their call should read and devour this excellent material.  Some pastors will find themselves repenting for embracing a secularized model of the pastorate.  Others will be re-energized to boldly proclaim the truth for God's glory and the good of God's peopleHighly recommended!4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FS43A5U0ICPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801097711#wasThisHelpful","R1FS43A5U0ICPV","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gospel-spreading, Jesus-loving, and worldview-shaping.  These short phrases describe a special man.  This man was bold, unafraid, and merciful.  He was filled with compassion for people and longed to see social justice in America and around the globe.  These are only a few brief descriptions of the former hatchet-man.  This man served under President Richard M. Nixon.  This man served time in a federal penitentiary.  His name - Charles Colson.Owen Strachan provides an invaluable service to the church in his latest book, The Colson Way.  While the primary target is American millennial evangelicals, the author's message should reach all age groups and is destined to not only inspire a new generation of leaders but also warn against moral decay and worldview erosion.  The book is a primer on the importance of loving one another and making a mark for the gospel - a gospel which is characterized by truth, grace, forgiveness, love, and mercy.Strachan explores the formative years of Mr. Colson and walks readers through his days in the White House which ultimately led to a short stay in the ""Big House.""  The Providential path of pain that Colson travelled led him to a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.  As a result, his life was transformed by Jesus which resulted a series of unexpected events that would have an effect on people around him and thousands of people who never met him.The author chronicles the various ministries of Chuck Colson, especially Prison Fellowship which spans around the world and offers hope, peace, and forgiveness to prisoners.Strachan summarizes the Colson life creed:His God-given role in the kingdom was to go to the needy, the suffering, and the forgotten, and to minister grace to them ... As a former prisoner, disgraced in the public eye, he never lost sight of just how freeing the gospel truly was.  He knew what it was to have lost everything, to be at the mercy of routines and regulations that were not of his choosing, and to taste shame and guilt that left only to return.This fascinating book not only introduces readers to the life and legacy of Charles Colson; it also serves as a primer for living with a bold faith in the public square.  It is a clarion call to young evangelical leaders.  It is an invitation to proclaim, defend, and live the truth in a world which is hostile to the truth of the gospel.This much-needed book will serve the church well and prompt much discussion and debate.  Better yet, it will lead a new generation of leaders to the front lines where the battle is fought, and where our Commanding Officer beckons us to heed His sovereign call.Highly recommended - 4.5 starsI received this book free from the publisher.

"""I believe; help my unbelief!"" cried the father of a demon possessedpiper boy (Mark 9:24).  This cry of anguish is the cry which necessarily emerges from the mouth of every believer.  Why?  Our faith is growing.  Our faith is incomplete.  We are works in progress.  We still have much to learn.  In fact, Barnabas Piper argues, that questions are normal, even healthy in the Christian life.  This is the essence of Piper's newest book, Help My UnbeliefWhen the man in Mark 9 cried out, ""I believe, help my unbelief,"" he was uttering more than a mere statement.  Piper adds, ""Requests can stem only from belief, even it is just the tiniest inkling of belief.""  This kind of reasoning should breathe hope, strength and confidence in believers who doubt from time to time.  For the very act of doubt, precipitates saving faith!  Once again: we are in process.  We are still growing.  God is in the process of refining our faith.  And he will complete the good work he started!Piper introduces readers to the idea of ""believing doubt.""  He says, ""Believing doubt will always anchor in God's character and word as unshakeable and then take on questions that harass and attack.""  While much harm can come from doubt, Piper maintains, ""Doubt can save us from much trouble and lead to much knowledge ... Doubt that seeks the truth and stems from the belief that God is the source of all truth.""But the author also presents the idea of ""unbelieving doubt.""  ""When unbelieving doubt poses a question, it is not interested in the answer for any reason other than to disprove it ... These doubts are the wild monsters that wreck faith and destroy the simplistically peaceful Christian lives so many people try to lead.""This doubt can surface in several ways - intellectual, emotional, or even theological.  Truth be told, every Christian battles with unbelieving doubt.  This is why the writer of Hebrews says, ""See to it that none of you has a sinful unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.""God has given us certain evidences of saving faith which include repentance, prayer, and humility: ""Through repentance, prayer, and humility believers move away from unbelieving doubt and grow in holiness.  The refusal to do these things is a spiritual red flag and evidence of wanting to be one's own god.""Piper discusses disobedience as unbelief: ""Disobeying the command of God is disbelieving His character ... He [God] is authority itself, the essence of perfect, flawless authority.  To disobey is to deny this about him.""  Piper also discusses obedience as belief.  In a statement to is dripping with the wisdom of his father, he adds: ""Obedience is not the end; God's satisfaction in us and our pleasure in Him are.  It doesn't feel tangible in the moment, but as we grow in belief, we will find it gaining power over the desire to sin.""  Pure Christian hedonism!Walking in obedience to God is not a magic formula or a recipe for perfection in the Christian life.  The author rightly notes, ""Belief [which is to say - obedience to God] does not mean sin will go away ... True belief is that which perpetually, magnetically pulls us toward the 'not yet' of Revelation 21.""  Believing the promises of God and being satisfied with all that God is for us in Christ leads us in the direction of the new earth where Jesus will make all things new!Help My Unbelief is a plea for a faith which is transparent and vulnerable.  It is a call for vibrant Christian living in the face of unanswered questions.  And if offer hope for people who are desperately looking for answers.  The search for answers is welcomed here.  Indeed, the search for truth is a vital part of the Christian life.  The book is a call to action; action which is grounded in biblical faith.  While faith may waver and is ""prone to wonder"" as  Charles Wesley wrote, we can be assured that God will never leave us or forsake us.  He will complete the good work he started.""I believe; help my unbelief"" represents the tension, the need the promise for every follower of Jesus.  We do believe.  We do live every day in great need.  Our belief is imperfect, so we cry out for help.  But that cry come from a place of belief.  We hold fast to God even as we feel pulled by the current of doubt, fear, and temptation.""- Barnabas PiperHighly recommended!I received this book free from the publisher.

"Reformed Dogmatics by Herman Bavinck (1854-1921) is arranged like a standard systematic theology text and includes seven branches of theology overall.  Bavinck was a seminal thinker in his day and deserves to be read in ours.  The new abridged volume by Baker Academic is a welcome addition to the growing number of theological works in print.The writing, while dense at times is easy to follow and offers readers a Reformed framework which stands in the tradition as writers such as Warfield, Hodge, and Edwards.Perhaps an assortment of citations will give readers a better idea of Bavinck's style and theological convictions:The entire life of the Christian is dedicated to the worship of God - we are not our own; we are God’s.  We belong to God completely and always, in life and in death.Sin, therefore, is never an arbitrary matter, merely a whimsical displeasure of a jealous God.  Sin is knowingly breaking God’s command and flows from a heart that rebels against God.… The human heart and head can rest in God’s will, for it is the will of an almighty God and a gracious father, not that of a blind fate, incalculable chance, or dark force of nature.  His sovereignty is one of unlimited power, but also of wisdom and grace.  He is both king and father at one and the same time.Mystery is the lifeblood of theological reflection.  From the start of its labors, dogmatic theology is shrouded in mystery; it stands before God the incomprehensible One.  This knowledge leads to adoration and worship; to know God is to live.The content of the Christian faith is the knowledge of God in his being and in his works.Even the abridged edition weighs in at 777 pages, so readers will need to demonstrate a measure of discipline and patience in order to reach the finish line of Dogmatic Theology.  But the time and effort will be well-spent and one dives into the deep end of the theological pool.Highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYJ9L26W46I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801036488#wasThisHelpful","R3MYJ9L26W46I4","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each year, I put together a “top ten list,” books that have personally encouraged me; books that I would commend to others.  It is unusual to include a booklet in such a list but after reading Iain Hamilton’s, What is Experiential Calvinism this book will certainly make the top ten list in 2015.Calvinism is quite possibly one of the most misrepresented system thoughts – both in the church and in the marketplace of ideas.  Christians and non-Christians alike slice and dice this theological system into a cruel concoction which has nothing to do with Calvinism.  This twisting and maniacal maneuvering made famous by the likes of critics such as  David Hunt does nothing to serve people.  Rather, it confuses the unsuspecting and irritates those who no better.But Hamilton makes this much clear.  While Calvinism as such is a theological system, it is much more than a system.  It is at the very warp and woof of biblical theology.  “Experiential Calvinism” writes Hamilton, has one preeminent concern: to glorify God.”A substantial part of the book is committed to summarizing the main components of experiential Calvinism.  The author presents eight in particular.  Instead of summarizing each point, readers are encouraged to dig into Hamilton’s work so as to discover the deeper realities behind each component.  The eight points are summarizes as follows:The experiential Calvinist honors God’s unconditional sovereignty.  The author cites B.B. Warfield, who argues, “Calvinists are humble souls, who, in the quiet of retired lives, have caught a vision of God in His glory and are cherishing in their hearts that vital flame of complete dependence on Him which is the very essence of Calvinism.”The experiential Calvinist cherishes God’s grace.The experiential Calvinist has a deep sense of the sinfulness of sin.The experiential Calvinist lives before God’s face.The experiential Calvinist shapes all of life by the revelation of God’s unimpeachable holiness.The experiential Calvinist is content and satisfied with scriptural worship.The experiential Calvinist pursues godly catholicity.The experiential Calvinist cultivates communion with God.I stand with a handful of other Reformed minded people who take exception to the so-called Regulative Principle which is described in the sixth component.  Hamilton obviously writes with the best of intentions but get boxed in by a mindset which canonized the past and neglects elements of contemporary worship.  Certainly, there is much drivel in the contemporary music scene.  But much good is being accomplished as well.  To ignore some of the songs being written by artists such as Stewart Townend, Matt Redman, and Chris Tomlin is a mistake. Perhaps 1 Corinthians 10:31 should guide this discussion about worship.This of course, is a minor criticism in light of the whole.  Indeed, this concern is a mere “bump in the road” and should not distract readers from devouring the rest of the book.  Iain Hamilton has served the church well by boiling down the essence of Calvinism which will lead people in the right direction for all the right reasons.What is Experiential Calvinism is a must-read.  It is both corrective and Christ-centered and offers the right blend of admonition and encouragement.  My hope is that thousands and thousands of people will literally consume this little book and benefit immensely from the godly wisdom here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOKOEX382RD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601783795#wasThisHelpful","R1VOKOEX382RD1","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“I preached Christ and Him crucified, and many more became empirebelievers.”  This sentence summarizes the essence of the book, Empire’s End by Jerry Jenkins.  It is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that fueled the resolve of Paul the apostle.  It is the gospel that motivated his every action.  It is the gospel that he lived for.  That same gospel, he died for.Empire’s End is historical fiction.  Anytime an author sets out to capture a historical setting in a novel, he walks a fine line.  On the one hand, this genre allows a certain flexibility and enables the writer to utilize what some have referred to as a “sanctified imagination.”  This is entirely appropriate so long as the imagination stays within biblical bounds.  On the other hand, this genre poses difficulties for some readers have difficulty separating fact from fiction.Jenkins does a good job of painting a portrait of Saul of Tarsus, the religious zealot who is miraculously regenerated on the Damascus road.  He shows the tension that exists in this newly converted man as he faces people he hated only moments before.Jenkins develops several biblical characters and fictional characters that keep the story moving and help show the cultural context that Paul ministered in.While the novel reads easily and holds the attention of the reader, there is a propensity to get caught up in the story while forgetting the actual historical context.  Whether that is the fault of the author or the reader is left for the jury to decide.Overall, Empire’s End is an enjoyable read.  The intent is clearly to magnify the great God as his purposes unfold in the life of his servant, the apostle Paul.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TVWHKYF90U8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617950076#wasThisHelpful","R3TVWHKYF90U8W","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The two words that immediately come to mind when consideringTimothy Keller’s new book is: rocket fuel.  Keller’s book is a supercharged approach to expository preaching.Preaching: Communicating Faith in an Age of Skepticism stands alone in book market that includes several approaches to preaching.  Some books provide preachers with the nuts and bolts or the mechanics of preaching.  Others focus on the rationale for expository preaching.  Keller’s work includes both and so much more.Readers will be drawn to a few important items that stand out in this work:The Centrality of the GospelFirst, Keller is relentless about the necessity of gospel preaching.  He stands with C.H. Spurgeon who famously admonished preachers to “preach a text and make a beeline to the cross of Christ.”  Keller repeatedly challenges preachers to preach “Christ crucified,” to “preach Christ through every theme of the Bible.”  Wherever the preacher finds himself in the biblical text, he must alert the listener to the person of Christ and the completed work of Christ.  It is this feature that makes Keller’s work unique and should propel is work to the required reading list of every Bible College and Seminary course that pertains to preaching.The Importance of the HeartSecond, Keller focuses on the heart in biblical preaching:Preaching cannot simply be accurate and sound.  It must capture the listeners’ interest and imagination; it must be compelling and penetrate to their hearts.  It is possible to merely assert and confront and feel we have been very ‘valiant for truth,’ but if you are dry or tedious, people will not repent and believe the right doctrine you present.  We must preach so that, as in the first sermon on Pentecost, hearers are ‘cut to the heart.’Dr. Keller walks readers through a critical discussion of the heart which is “the seat of the mind, will, and emotions, all together.”  Critical to this discussion is the idea that expository preaching must move the heart to action.  Keller notes, “It is all-important, then, that preaching move the heart to stop trusting and loving other things more than God … So the goal of the sermon cannot be merely to make the truth clear and understandable to the mind, but must also be to make it gripping and real to the heart.”  Thus, Keller highlights the primacy of both the heart and the mind.  To exclude the mind in the preaching endeavor will lead to contentless preaching.  But to exclude the heart will necessarily lead to preaching which is void of application.The standout feature of this section is Keller’s treatment of Jonathan Edwards and his approach to the heart in preaching.  Edwards refuses to pit the heart against the mind and argues for a view of preaching that integrates both.  Keller does a terrific job of expounding Edwards’s work, Religious Affections and the impact such of view has on preaching.There is much to commend in Keller’s work on preaching.  Readers are encouraged to dive in and benefit from this godly man who has mastered the preaching task.  May the rocket fuel in Keller’s work launch many sermons into the stratosphere for the glory of God!Other titles that will serve preachers well include The Supremacy of God in Preaching by John Piper, He is Not Silent: Preaching in a Postmodern World by Al Mohler, The Kind of Preaching God Blesses by Steven Lawson, and Preaching and Preachers by Martyn Lloyd-Jones.I received this book free from the publisher.

"Performing Under Pressure: The Science of Doing Your Best When It Matters Most  is a fascinating book that seeks to provide readers with ""pressure solutions"" to help ""immunize themselves against the sabotaging effects of pressure.""  These ""pressure solutions"" are, in the final analysis, the ""short-term strategies for overcoming pressure.""The authors make it clear in advance that ""managing the pressure of the moment will allow you to perform closer to your capability, which increases your likelihood of being successful.""The book is supported by thousands of hours of research and suggests that ""helping people manage pressure in their lives is an untapped strategy for unleashing their creative and intellectual potential.""Part 1 gives an overview of the nature and science of pressure.  Readers learn the difference between stress and pressure and why they feel ""heat"" in a pressure filled moment.  This section is truly worth the price of the book.Part 2 includes twenty-two pressure solutions.  These strategies are designed to help readers work through periods of pressure and respond appropriately.Part 3 includes long-term strategies and practical help for people who face pressure.  The authors encourage readers to wear a COTE of Armor, a clever acronym that stands for confidence, optimism, tenacity, and enthusiasm.  The authors reveal, ""The emotional blending of confidence, optimism, tenacity, and enthusiasm makes up the fabric of that coat.  With these attributes, you can immunize yourself against pressure so that your capability isn't diminished or compromised by it, giving yourself your best chance to succeed.""The main criticism I offer is that the book relies heavily on evolutionary theory.  The irony of this approach is that the data presented is based on time-tested and pain-staking research.  To rely on, and place so much stock in a theory such as evolution that will never be proven, detracts from some of the otherwise sound principles.However, readers who embrace historic Christianity (as I do) should be careful not to discount what the authors present.  For all truth is God's truth.  There is no reason to reject a given principle if the principle is supported by Scripture, reason, and experience.Performing Under Pressure is a worthy and helpful read.  It contains many practical suggestions that may be tailor-made to different people at different junctures.I received this book free from the publisher.  I was not required to write a positive review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y59SJUYAD9K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PESWC#wasThisHelpful","R2Y59SJUYAD9K0","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have yet to meet a person who enjoys pain and suffering.  Yet suffering is a part of the warp and woof of life.  It is not a part of God’s original intent for creation.  Since Adam’s first sin, pain and suffering have been an abnormal part of the cosmos.  Suffering is an unwelcome guest who bullies his way to the table and makes demands – much like a  soldier a bloody battlefield.Walking With God Through Pain and Suffering by Timothy Keller addresses this topic with candor and clarity.  Keller leaves no stone unturned here.  The book is organized into three sections:Understanding the FurnaceKeller introduces the problem of pain and suffering and explores some of the philosophical challenges that Christ-followers must understand and address.“Nothing is more important than to learn how to maintain a life of purpose in the midst of painful adversity,” writes Keller.  Yet our culture has a tendency to respond to suffering in ways that are helpful and wrongheaded.  The moralist response to suffering is to “do good.”  The fatalist’s response to suffering is to “hang in there” and “endure.”  The dualist response to suffering is “purified faithfulness.”  And the secular response to suffering is focussed on “technique.”  A combination of these erroneous responses to suffering litter the current milieu and produce a generation of confused and discouraged people.Keller rightly alerts readers to the importance of worldviews and their relation to the subject of pain and suffering.  Ultimately, the matter of pain and suffering is a matter of faith.  “Faith,” writes Keller “is the promise of God.”  He adds, “We can be fully accepted and counted legally righteous in God’s sight through faith in Christ, solely by free grace … It means freedom from fear of the future, from any anxiety about your eternal destiny.  It is the most liberating idea possible and it ultimately enables you to face all suffering, knowing that because of the cross, God is absolutely for you and that because of the resurrection, everything will be all right in the end.”Facing the FurnacePart two provides readers with the theological muscle – a crucial part of the battle.  Keller unpacks the doctrine of God’s sovereignty and provides a painful but biblical rationale for the role of suffering the lives of people.At the heart of this discussion is an important look at the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.  The author summarizes, “That is, in order to satisfy justice, in order to punish sin so that in love he could forgive and receive us, God had to bear the penalty for sin within himself.  God the Son took the punishment we deserved, including being cut off from the Father.  And so God took into his own self, his own heart, an infinite agony – out of love for us.”Keller’s treatment in part two travels great distances to help resolve the problem of evil – the so-called “Achilles heal” of the Christian faith: “So while Christianity never claims to be able to offer a full explanation of all God’s reasons behind every instance of evil and suffering – it does have a final answer to it.  The answer will be given at the end of history and all who hear it and see its fulfillment will find it completely satisfying, infinitely sufficient.”While Keller never attempts to provide a comprehensive answer to the problem of evil, his treatment of this thorny subject is some of the best in print.  He may not satisfy the disciples of David Hume, Voltaire, or Sam Harris – but he does give ample ammunition for believers who are looking for honest answers.Walking With God in the FurnaceParts one and two explore the philosophical and theological angles of pain and suffering.  Part three helps readers with practical application.  They are given practical tools for “walking with God in the furnace.”  The very notion of walking with God in the furnace assumes pain – pain that some are unwilling to admit.  But practical experience reveals that we live in a broken world; a world which has been torn to shreds by the consequences of sin.Keller urges readers to walk with God in suffering: “If you go into the furnace without the gospel, it will not be possible to find God in there.  You will be sure he has done terrible wrong or you have and you will feel all alone.  Going into the fire without the gospel is the most dangerous thing anyone can do.”  So the gospel is the first and last defense of every Christ-follower; indeed it is the hope of the watching world.Second, the author stresses the importance of weeping during seasons of adversity.  Elijah serves as an example of a man who cried out in great agony.  He was a man unafraid of weeping.  Such an approach is not only honest – it is a sign of emotional health.Third, Keller demonstrates the need for trusting in God during days of pain and adversity.  Joseph is portrayed as an example of a man who trusted: If the story of Joseph and the whole of the Bible is true, then anything that comes into your life is something that, as painful as it is, you need in some way.”  Jesus too, demonstrated trust in his Father and points believers in the identical direction.  Keller continues to alert readers to other tools that they should utilize during their dark days.Walking With God Through Pain and Suffering is a watershed book that deserves to be read.  Christ-followers will no doubt be encouraged by this Christ-exalting book; a book which drives readers to the cross of the suffering God.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQXG8M1KPEZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525952454#wasThisHelpful","R3LQXG8M1KPEZ1","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The seventeenth century theologians at Dort responded swiftly and decisively to the rising tide of Arminianism.  The official response came as a result of the Synod of Dort which convened in 1618-1619, over one hundred years after John Calvin's birth in 1509.  Their response is summarized in the famous TULIP acrostic:T - Total depravityU - Unconditional electionL - Limited AtonementI - Irresistible GraceP - Perseverance of the SaintsSo while the formulation of Calvinism as we know it today did not originate with Calvin himself, it is important to understand that these doctrinal moorings originated with the apostles and Jesus himself, 1500 years before the birth of John Calvin!This reality becomes clear in C.H. Spurgeon's little book, ""A Defense of Calvinism.""  Spurgeon's Calvinism, edited by Stephen McCaskell is an updated version of Spurgeon's original work.  The author has edited out much of Spurgeon's Victorian language which will be a valuable service for most readers.Spurgeon was a unashamed Calvinist, a label is wore until his death in 1892.  He held that ""Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else.""  In Spurgeon's Calvinism, the Prince of Preachers walks readers through the five points that were formulated at Dort.  Readers familiar with his style will be drawn to his passion for Scripture and his ability to relate the doctrines in a unified whole.  While Spurgeon's treatment of the doctrines of grace prove to be unshakeable in the final analysis, the real highlight of the book is its ability to draw worshippers to the throne of God.  Spurgeon's Calvinism is a fitting introduction to this biblical way of viewing God's purposes in redemptive history.""The old truth that Calvin preached, that Augustine preached, that Paul preached, is the truth that I must preach today, or else be false to my conscience and my God.  I cannot shape the truth; I know of no such thing as paring off the rough edges of a doctrine.  John Knox's gospel is my gospel.  That which thundered through Scotland must thunder through England again."" - C.H.

"Sin and salvation.  Grace and greed.  Mercy and justice.  Good and evil.  Truth and lies.  God and the rejection of God.  These are just a few of the themes that emerge in Victor Hugo's monumental work, Les Misérables.Bob Welch, author of seventeen books has been touched by Hugo's story and has a passion to share that story with his readers.The title gives away the central purpose of this well-written book.  Welch provides readers with a short, crisp introduction to Les Misérables and rightly argues that ""context matters.""  Once the context is in place, the author takes readers on a journey through this classic work and carefully enters the mind of Victor Hugo.I was originally skeptical and wondered if Welch was prone to exaggerating and embellishing the story to make a quick buck.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  Welch carefully weaves his way through the story and picks up on themes which are ultimately tied to real life situations.  The gospel weaves in and out of these life lessons.  The lessons could easily be developed and utilized in a small group setting.52 Little Lessons From Les Misérables is a book worth reading and digesting. It is a book for all kinds of people - believers and unbelievers alike as one of the final citations illustrates so well.  The author writes,Challenged by an agnostic to tell the Christian message in ten words, Will Campbell, a Yale Divinity School graduate and former director of religious life at the University of Mississippi, said it like this: 'We are all bastards but God loves us anyway.'""Yes, we - les misérables.""

"Reading an instructional book on the game of golf is a study in contrasts.  I would rather watch paint dry than reading some of these books.  On the other hand, some of these instructional books are quite inspirational and helpful.  Dr. Michael T. Lardon's book, Mastering Golf's Mental Game is of the later sort.The book is organized into two parts.  Part one  details what the author refers to as the six components of mental excellence, which include: (1) Attitude, (2) Motivation, (3) Control, (4) Optimization, (5) Concentration, and (6) Mental Plan.The components are thoroughly research and have been field tested in several arenas.  Most importantly, the six components of mental excellence have been tested on the golf course.A chapter is devoted to each quality noted above.  The author carefully describes each quality and backs the concept up with at least one case study.  Additionally, each chapter includes a practical homework assignment where readers (or golfers in this case) can apply the principles that are presented.Part two includes the ""Mental Scorecard.""  Dr. Lardon essentially takes the philosophical components in part one and applies the lessons which can be immediately utilized on the golf course.The primary ingredient in the mental scorecard is the ""pre-shot pyramid which is designed to fine tune the golf game of everyone from amateurs to professionals.  The pre-shot pyramid includes three critical components, namely - 1) Calculate, 2) Create, and 3) Execute.  Golfers are encouraged walk through these carefully defined steps which will theoretically improve one's score.  The author presents a workable system wherein golfers can apply each principle set forth in the book.Mastering Golf's Mental Game is a fascinating read that will be of tremendous help to golfers who seek to lower their scores.  The writing is clear and concise.  The case studies help show how the principles work in the real world.  Essentially, the author presents a system; a system which is designed to renovate the mind and lead to positive results on the golf course.I received this book free from the publisher.

"""Read my lips.  No new taxes.""  These are the words that enter the minds of most Americans when then think of President George H.W. Bush.  It is an unfortunate turn of events that the President was placed in a position where a decision to raise taxes become a necessary compromise with Democrats.President George W. Bush writes about his father in the gripping biography, 41: A Portrait of My Father.  The book represents the first attempt of son who served as president to write about his father who also served as president.The book spans the life of George H.W. Bush from his days growing up to his college years at Yale, his military service, numerous federal positions, not to mention his time in the oval office.  Several reviews note sharp criticism for 41 but nothing could be further from the truth.  Perhaps the most revealing insight into the life of the 41st president is his unfailing loyalty to country and comrades.  George H.W. Bush was not a war monger as suggested by the liberal left.

"2014 marks the 500th anniversary of the birth of John Knox, the Protestant Reformer who risked life and limb for the sake of the gospel in Scotland and much of western Europe.  Steven Lawson retells the story in his newest work, John Knox Fearless Faith.The author guides readers though the fascinating account of Knox's life - a life filled with pain and persecution, powerful preaching, and passionate appeals.  He portrays the Protestant Reformer as one who ""remained stout of heart and strong in conviction"" even as he neared the end of his life.  Lawson observes, ""To the very end, Knox was preaching Christ and Him crucified, exalting his Savior and extolling his Lord.""John Knox Fearless Faith is a boon for discouraged pastors who have experienced the sting of false accusation and the pain of persecution.  It serves a sort of theological balm for pastors who are lonely in ministry and on the verge of throwing in the ecclesiastical towel.  In a few short sentences, Dr. Lawson rightly summarizes the fiery Reformers passion for truth and his steely resolve:  ""Through these many dangers, Knox persevered in his ministry, boldly preaching the Word and trusting God for the outcome.  Beneath his frail body was an unshakeable confidence in the sovereignty of God.  He believed that his times were appointed for him by an all-powerful God.  He knew that he was invincible within the allotted time of the divine will.  His faith remained strong in the One who orders all things.""As Knox approached his final years, his commitment to God grew yet deeper.  The opposition he faced never subsided, even to the end, but neither did his confidence in God.May pastors find strength in this godly man whose birth 500 years ago marked church history and changed a generation.  May John Knox fuel our resolve to boldly preach God's Word and wield the mighty sword of Reformed truth for the world to see and savor.  May pastors lead the next generation of Christians who live with the integrity and the zeal of Knox.  May they rebuke and admonish carnal professors who seek to divide Christ's church.  May they be inspired by his example as they champion the cause of truth and challenge every rival from Rome, Mecca, Salt Lake City and every heresy that poses a threat to the gospel!Semper Reformanda!www.baldreformer.wordpress.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NT0H2ZD6GYVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ2X0TM#wasThisHelpful","R1NT0H2ZD6GYVU","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"C.S. Lewis is widely trumpeted as one of the leading Christian thinkers and apologists of the 2oth century.  His seminal works, Mere Christianity and The Problem of Pain have equipped a new generation of Christ-followers.  Creative works like The Great Divorce have stimulating the imaginations of thousands.  And who could forget his landmark series, The Chronicles of Narnia which continue to sell like hotcakes over fifty years later.Alister McGrath is a leading authority on C.S. Lewis.  Like Lewis, the author teaches at Oxford University where his interest in Lewis blossomed.If I Had Lunch With C.S. Lewis is a basic introduction to the life and writing of the Oxford don.  McGrath arranges a series of imaginary lunches with Lewis where they chat about subjects that matter - friendship, story-telling, learning, theology, apologetics, and suffering.If I Had Lunch With C.S. Lewis is a perfect introduction to entry level readers who are not familiar with the literary genius.

"I have to be honest.  My expectations for most books on marriage are pretty low.  So many books on Christian marriage these days are filled with cliches and pop psychology.  Biblical wisdom is overshadowed or replaced altogether by pithy sayings and readers are left wandering in a postmodern wasteland.Craig and Amy Groeschel's book, From This Day Forward  is a different kind of book.  Readers looking for a theological treatise should turn to Tim Keller's, The Meaning of Marriage for a more comprehensive and robust treatment.  But that is not a criticism of the Groeschel's book in any way.From This Day Forward is a straightforward book that offers help for married couples or couples planning to be married.  The authors present five commitments to ""fail-proof"" their marriage.The authors urge readers to:Seek GodFight fairHave funStay pureNever give upThe defining feature of From This Day Forward is the unwavering principle of the life-long covenant of marriage.  While the five points offered above provide practical help for couples, the covenant of marriage is the thread that holds the five commitments together.  The book is grounded in Scripture and is written in an easy to read format.  I'll be adding this to my list of required reading for couples in pre-marital counseling.I received this book free from the publisher.

"Over the past twenty-five years, I have read books on prayer by thekeller Puritans and Reformers, the Quakers and the contemplative writers, the Desert Fathers, and even some living authors who think they have something unique to contribute to the discussion.Timothy Keller's newest work, Prayer: Experiencing Awe and Intimacy With God is quite frankly the best book I've ever read on prayer.  This short review will only touch the tip of the iceberg; so I encourage readers of Veritas et Lux to read this incredible book for themselves.Keller's work is divided into five parts:Desiring PrayerUnderstanding PrayerLearning PrayerDeepening PrayerDoing PrayerThe book aims to show that  ""prayer is both conversation and encounter with God"" and demonstrates that prayer is both ""awe and intimacy, struggle and reality.""Keller rightly notes, ""A book on the essentials of prayer should contain three components: the theological, experiential, and methodological.""  The author succeeds in presenting a lucid theological framework for understanding prayer.  He presents the experiential side of prayer by citing numerous Scriptural examples and drawing on the work of many Christ-followers in Church history.  And he sets forth a workable methodology, which in the final analysis includes many different forms that may appeal to different kinds of people.""  Keller's book is biblical, engaging, God-centered, gospel-centered, and Spirit-fueled.Prayer: Experiencing  Awe and Intimacy With God will confront readers with the God-centeredness of Jonathan Edwards, the earthiness and practicality of Martin Luther, and the theological precision of John Calvin.  This work will undoubtedly be used by God to encourage faithful prayer, enlist new prayer warriors, and revitalize a church that has neglected the important discipline of prayer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N04Q4ERUX0TR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIXGIO#wasThisHelpful","R3N04Q4ERUX0TR","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Levin's book, Liberty and Tyranny made quite a splash when it was originally published in 2009.  Even though the book is a bit dated now, I think it's relevance is even greater now that President Obama's failed policies have taken root.Levin lays his cards on the table at the beginning: ""Conservatism is a way of understanding life, society, and governance.""  Indeed, conservatism is a worldview; a way of seeing the world and playing a part within it.All of the arguments in Liberty and Tyranny find their genesis in the minds of the founding fathers: ""The founders understood that the greatest threat to liberty is an all-powerful central government, where the few dictate to the many.""  Or as President Reagan once said, ""The most frightening thing to hear when answering the door is, 'Where from the government and we're here to help.'""Liberty and Tyranny is really an expose on the Statist ideology.  Of course, the Statist is consumed with power as we have seen displayed in the Obama administration.  Levin makes it clear that the ""Conservative does not despise government.  He despises tyranny ... The Conservative is alarmed by the ascent of a soft tyranny and its cheery acceptance by the neo-Statist.  He knows that liberty once lost is rarely recovered.  He knows of the decline and eventual failure of past republics.  And he knows that the best prescription for addressing society's real and perceived ailments is not to further empower an already enormous federal government beyond its constitutional limits, but to return to the founding principles.""So with the backing and historical muscle of the Founding Fathers, the author presents a cogent case for Conservatism  by confronting Statism with bold arguments and common sense American values.  He tackles matters of the free market, welfare state, environmentalism, and immigration among others.I highly recommend Liberty and Tyranny by Mark Levin.  It will serve as an encouragement to most Americans but will be a source of irritation for social progressives.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVP0OVU39JG5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FA0IK6#wasThisHelpful","RVP0OVU39JG5P","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jesus Continued by J.D. Greear is a book about the Holy Spirit.  The subtitle is a better description about the big idea in Greear's book - ""Why the Spirit Inside You is Better Than Jesus Beside You.""  If nothing else, the subtitle is bound to prompt discussion about the role of the Holy Spirit.  Ultimately, if the discussion follows the basic flow of the book, the discussion will, in the final analysis prove fruitful and worthwhile.Part One: The Missing SpiritIn part one, the author makes an absolutely crucial point that runs through the rest of his work, namely - we cannot fulfill the Word apart from the Spirit.  That is to say, the Spirit of God uses the Word of God to transform the people of God.  Eliminate the Spirit from this maxim and the result is dry academia which influence no one.  Eliminate the Word from this maxim and the result is fanatical extremism which may influence some people but is utterly useless.  Greear makes it clear that Christians must be ""led by the Spirit and taught by the Word.""The author discusses the role of the Spirit in the Christian life.  He adds, ""Devotion to the mission of Jesus and the fullness with the Spirit of God, you see, always go hand in hand ... The primary objective of God's Spirit is to complete the mission.  To know him is to be devoted to that mission.  Without him, we cannot hope to succeed.  With him, we cannot fail.""Greear clearly describes the role of the Spirit in the life of the believer and reveals the benefit of the indwelling Spirit which is better than ""the Jesus beside you.""Part Two: Experiencing the SpiritIn part two, the author helps readers understand how to experience the Holy Spirit.  He notes that Christians experience the Holy Spirit in at least six specific ways:In the GospelIn the Word of GodIn our giftingsIn the churchIn our spiritIn our circumstancesGreear gives practical illustrations how the Holy Spirit is experienced and offers biblical support throughout.Part Three: Seeking the Holy SpiritPart three combines the best of parts one and two and challenges readers to surrender afresh to the Holy Spirit and to expect personal and corporate revival.  He encourages readers to pursue the ""ordinary means of grace"" by 1) repenting of sin, 2) preaching the gospel faithfully, 3) saturating themselves in the gospel, and 4) persisting in prayer.Readers are urged to seek the Holy Spirit in prayer and living by faith in the promises of God.  In the final analysis, Greear writes so that Christians will see the Holy Spirit is beckoning them to follow him.Several features not only make J.D. Greear's book noteworthy; these features make this book one of the best Christian books of 2014.1. Jesus Continued is saturated in the Reformed tradition.  While the author writes with Reformed convictions, his focus is on the Holy Spirit which should encourage charismatics and challenge Reformed thinkers.2. Jesus Continued is a fresh look at the person and work of the Holy Spirit by a pastor who has a heart for theology and a love for the people of God.3. Jesus Continued presents a pneumatology which is Scripture-soaked.4. Jesus Continued is a personal work and practical work.  While this is the work of a top-notch scholar, the writing is simple enough for a high school student to understand but will also challenge seasoned pastors.I highly recommend Jesus Continued.  I trust that it will receive a wide readership and that God will use it in mighty ways.  May Christ-followers surrender afresh to the ministry of the Holy Spirit!I received this book free from the publisher through the BookLook  bloggers program.

It is living your personal life and leading your professional life in a way that acknowledges that when the stakes are high, the only thing that moves the needle from failure to success is the right attitude.""  Jake Wood points leaders in the right direction with such a mindset in his book, Take Command.A former Marine sniper turned businessman, Jake Wood shares his life experiences with readers with a systematic approach which is easy to read and apply to daily life situations.The author presents eight lessons for leaders.  These lessons are not mere theory; these lessons were forged on the battlefield and the business world.  Relevant quotes from famous military leaders are found throughout the book.The lessons are organized in four broad categories - prepare, analyze, decide, and act. Wood's life experiences in the military and business world make the life lessons come alive.  His approach is humble and inviting.

But more importantly, DeYoung writes books which are biblical.

This fine work will thrill conservative Christians and enrage liberals and postmodern compromisers.At the end of the day, our approach to Scripture is what really matters.  DeYoung summarizes: “Submission to the Scriptures is submission to God.

"The debate over the sovereignty of God and the free will of man originally heated up between Augustine of Hippo and Pelagius in the 4th century.  This debate has raged throughout church history and does not show any signs of letting up.  Arminians accuse Calvinists of serving a ""tyrant God"" who plays the role of a puppet master, making free will an illusion.  Calvinists accuse Arminians of serving a ""timid God"" who is weak at the knees.Hand in HAND by Randy Alcorn addresses the thorny issue of God's sovereignty and the free will of man.  Alcorn does not promise to end all arguments.  But he does enter the ring as a sort of ""theological referee.""  The author is a former Arminian theologian who has since turned into a Calvinist.  While Alcorn prefers to say that he is a 4 point Calvinist, since he is uncomfortable with particular redemption, he is committed to Calvinistic presuppositions.  This theological shift allows the author to sympathize with Arminians and provide some good teaching points for Calvinists who tend to be overzealous.Alcorn begins by reassuring readers that the subject should be discussed and notes six important reasons for  pursuing the matter:1. To develop a deeper appreciation for God and his Word, which reveals him to us.2. To help us mirror Christ's humility.3. To embrace all of God's inspired Word, not just parts of it.4. To foster unity in the body of Christ.5. To avoid fatalism and crushing guilt.6. To prevent us from becoming trivial people in a shallow age.The author surveys the biblical data which point to the biblical reality of God's sovereign control over all things as well as human responsibility.  He notes how these two realities intersect, creating a paradox not a contradiction.One chapter is devoted to addressing the matter of Open Theism, a theological cousin of Arminianism which denies God's definite foreknowledge of all things and affirms the libertarian free will of the creature.  Alcorn makes it clear that both points are patently rejected in Scripture.Several features make Hand in HAND a worthy book; a book that will likely win the Gold Medallion Award:First, Alcorn writes with the proper tone and spirit.  Much of the debate the occurs over these matters produce more heat than light.  Dave Hunt's Book, What Love is This is a good example of this mean-spirited approach which caricatures a given theological view.  Alcorn approaches the subject with humility and gentleness and invites readers of differing opinions to pay careful attention to the arguments.Second, misunderstood terms are clearly defined.  The author does a good job of providing working definitions that are biblical and understandable.  The clear terminology should help in future debates between Calvinists and Arminians.Third, the lines of orthodoxy are clearly drawn.  Both Calvinists are Arminians are included in the so-called box of orthodoxy.  This point is of great value, especially when both schools of thought accuse each other of heresy.  Alcorn invites both sides to engage in meaningful debate without name calling.  Additionally, Alcorn rightly notes that Open Theism is outside of orthodoxy.  Any theologian who refuses to grant God the ability to possess definite foreknowledge of all things has moved outside the perimeter of orthodoxy.Fourth, a determinism continuum is presented.  Sadly, many readers and students of theology are unaware of the theological landscape which includes many views concerning determinism and free will.  The author clearly describes and defines these views: Hyper-Calvinism (outside orthodoxy), Compatibalism, Molinism, Libertarianism, and Open Theism (outside orthodoxy).Fifth, Biblical Calvinism is presented correctly.  Apart from the merits of particular redemption which could be debated at another time, the author does a terrific job of presenting Calvinism as a biblical system which is passionately God-centered; a system which promotes evangelism and engagement with culture.  Additionally, the author demonstrates repeatedly that Calvinism embraces the notion of free will, (what Alcorn prefers to call ""meaningful choice"") by pointing readers to the definition popularized by Jonathan Edwards - ""choosing according to one's strongest inclination.""Sixth, all readers are admonished to trust a sovereign God.  In what proves to be the best chapter in the book (chapter 10), the author encourages readers of all theological backgrounds to trust in a God who is sovereign.Hand in HAND will not be received well by Open Theists and Hyper-Calvinists.  Some Arminians and Calvinists may be bothered as well by some of the content.  But as a pastor who has travelled a very similar theological path from Arminianism to Calvinism - and even attended the same Bible College, I trust that thousands of people will devour Hand in HAND in the days ahead.  There is no doubt that Alcorn's work will spark questions and stimulate debate.  But my prayer is that the debate will produce more light than heat.  And in the final analysis, people will be drawn closer to the Savior and bank on his all-sufficient grace.  Indeed, he is sovereign over all!www.baldreformer.wordpress.com5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R297SFIB1TK2QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYWVYVO#wasThisHelpful","R297SFIB1TK2QG","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jim Cymbala has a warning for the church.  The warning is an urgent plea.  The stormwarning is for every Christian.  Cymbala is afraid that the influence of the church is on the decline in America.  Biblical competency is at an all-time low.  Pastors are leaving the ministry.  Young people are jettisoning the Christian faith.  Trinkets are peddled but theology is minimized.  Pragmatism is celebrated but prayer is downplayed.  These are themes that the author develops in his latest work, Storm: Hearing Jesus For the Times We Live In.Cymbala offers a prescription for these perilous times.  His solution is a return to prayer and a reliance on the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  The author writes with certain degree of boldness which may offend some.

"The Trinitarian Devotion of John Owen by Dr. Sinclair Ferguson is the latest installment in the Long Line of Godly Men Profile Series, edited by Dr. Steven Lawson.  Ferguson presents a readable introduction to the most well-known Puritan, John Owen.The book includes five chapters which overview Owen's life and theological commitments.  Chapter one focuses on his life as a pastor and theologian.  Owen's upbringing is discussed and his pastoral experience is surveyed.  Additionally, the author touches on Owen's tenure as vice-chancellor at Oxford University.The remaining chapters overview Owen's theological framework which focuses more narrowly on his robust doctrine of the Trinity.  Sinclair Ferguson carefully summarizes Owen's pursuit of the God in all his glory as expressed in the three persons - Father, Son, and Spirit.  Ferguson adds, ""To become a Christian believer is to be brought into a reality far grander than anything we could ever have imagined.  It means communion with the triune God.""  The author demonstrates how Owen regarded the Trinity as a chief cornerstone of the Christian faith.  Numerous primary sources are cited and explained.  In addition, Dr. Ferguson provides helpful analysis along the way.  He beautifully captures the essence of John Owen's devotion to the Trinity.The Trinitarian Devotion of John Owen is a perfect introduction for the beginning student of the Puritan divine.  But this work is also suitable for veteran students of Owen as well.  Ferguson bring his typical scholarly approach to the table but writes with the heart of a pastor/shepherd.  This work should help revive further interest in Puritanical studies and is a welcome guest at the table of these godly men.  My hope is that Ferguson's work will catapult readers to Owen primary sources - a practice which is certain to encourage, edify, and equip a new generation of Christians.I received this book free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

"Edwards on the Christian Life by Dane C. Ortlund attempts to summarize the theology of Jonathan Edwards and pays special attention to his remarks on the Christian life.  For Edwards, living the Christian life is about ""enjoying and reflecting the beauty of God.""The author successfully achieves his goal by directing readers to twelve questions which capture the essence of Edward's God-entranced worldview.  Consequently, the following themes emerge:Beauty, new birth, love, joy, gentleness, the Bible, prayer, pilgrimage, obedience, Satan, the soul, and heaven.Each theme is surveyed from the perspective of Jonathan Edwards.  Historical highlights are included in order to provide a much-needed perspective and many primary sources are cited.  For the scores of people who believe that God's wrath is Edwards's controlling attribute, Ortlund provides a necessary corrective: ""Not sovereignty, not wrath, not grace, not omniscience, not eternity, but beauty is what more than anything else defines God's very divinity.  Edwards clearly believed in these other truths about God and saw all of them as upholding and displaying and connected to God's beauty.  Yet none of them expresses who God is in the way that beauty does.""Ortlund beautifully captures the theology of Edwards in this rather short volume.  The work is accessible to a wide range of people but never at the expense of solid content.  Of the multitude of secondary source books which explore the theology of Jonathan Edwards, Ortlund's work is among the best.Despite, the high praise offered above, I must take exception with one of Ortlund's statements which takes aim at  Steven J. Lawson's book, The Unwavering Resolve of Jonathan Edwards.  Ortlund charges  Lawson of ""succumbing to hagiography regarding Edwards.""  Clearly, Ortlund has missed the intent of the Long Line of Godly Men Series where pivotal figures in church history are introduced and commended as pillars of the Christian faith.  Anyone familiar with Steven Lawson understands his chagrin with the postmillennialism and paedobaptism that emerge in the Northampton preacher.  But the series is merely designed as an introduction to these pivotal figures, not a detailed exposition.  Taken seriously, Ortlund's accusation should cast a dark shadow over every biographical account of figures in church history.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Ortlund's book is his criticism which he directs toward Jonathan Edwards himself.  The criticism here is rightly placed and balanced.  His critique is timely and alerts students of Edwards to weaknesses in his theological infrastructure.Edwards on the Christian Life is a well written book which should provide ample discussion for anyone interested in America's greatest intellectual.

How does one summarize the thoughts of a 1,100 page book that towers with truth; a book that takes readers to the top of the theological mountain?  Anyone who attempts to read and devour Systematic Theology by John Frame will be faced with such questions.  Indeed, while the oxygen is scarce at the top of this theological peak, readers will be delighted to enjoy the view that Dr. Frame presents.  As one might expect, every branch of systematic theology is explored.  The author invites readers on a journey which introduces them to God who relates to creatures as their covenant Lord.  The three lordship attributes are articulated throughout the book - control, authority, and presence.Several thoughts help capture the essence of this incredible book.  While some will be put off  by such thoughts, my hope is that a majority of readers will be motivated and inspired to pick up Dr. Frame's work.  This powerful book is marked by at least ten features:It is God-CenteredIt is Scripture-soakedIt is unashamedly CalvinisticIt is conservativeIt exposes liberal scholarship and lays bare its erroneous presuppositionsIt is biblicalIt is mind-penetratingIt is heart-softeningIt is personalIt leads readers to worship GodSystematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief  by John Frame is a theological tour de force.  This weighty volume is drenched with Scripture and is drowning with biblical wisdom.  I cannot think of any other writer who has influenced my thinking, outside of Jonathan Edwards himself.  This work is a true labor of love, a gift to the church, and a tool that will sharpen the minds of Christ-followers and serve as a heart-tenderizer for many years to come!Highly recommended5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2739XWEMNUGVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8OJAOW#wasThisHelpful","R2739XWEMNUGVI","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These days there is no shortage on political books.  Both liberals and conservatives are making the rounds in the publishing industry.  Many books are filled with drivel and propaganda.  A few are worth reading and prove very helpful.  Dr. Ben Carson's new book is numbered among the helpful books.One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America's Future is not your typical political work.  Make no mistake, the author wastes no time in grinding his political ""axe.""  But Dr. Carson comes with a different tone.  He is a non-nonsense conservative; the kind of conservative that makes social progressives squirm.  But even liberals  who disagree with the author will find the good doctor a welcome voice in the political world.One Nation begins with Carson's address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C.  Readers who are unfamiliar with the author would do well to carefully read and digest his remarks.  Again, he is an unashamed conservative but shares his views with boldness and humility - a combination which is rare these days, especially in Washington.Part One: Causes of Disunity and DeclineIn part one, Dr. Carson alerts readers to the multitude of cultural ""brick walls"" that prevent our nation from thriving.  He tackles political correctness, elitism (a favorite among the liberal ""elite""), and bigotry, among others.  He accurately describes each problem with grace and tact.  Readers who are paying attention should be shaken by the depth of the problems which unfold in part one.Part Two: SolutionsIn part two, the author presents workable solutions to the problems he raised in part one.  He stresses the implementation of humility, cultivating a listening ear, and even-handed compromise, all of which are all but absent in Washington D.C.Part Three: Who Are We?Finally, Dr. Carson returns to the United States Constitution.  Unlike progressives and some liberals who maintain the Constitution is a ""living document,"" the author returns to the original intent of the founding fathers.  He stresses the importance of visionary leadership, role models, and morality - all necessary for a nation to thrive.One Nation addresses all Americans - black, white, hispanic, Latino, and Asian.  Dr. Carson speaks to every person as a unique individual; an individual who is created in the imago dei.  But the most important feature of this book is the hope that Dr. Carson wields.  The  author waves mighty sword of freedom with boldness with the hope that other Americans will join in as well.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKJNB46WXLZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L7VH0#wasThisHelpful","R3TKJNB46WXLZ5","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gospel-Powered Humility by William Farley is a supercharged powder-keg for radical, humilityGod-centered Christian living.  There is much to commend in this little treasure.  A simple review will not do it justice.Part one overviews the problem which faces every human being.  That problem is identified as a soul-numbing sin - the sin of pride.  Of course, the remedy for pride is humility which is defined upfront by the author: ""Humility is the ability to see spiritual reality, to see things as they really are.  It is the capacity to see myself in God's light, in the context of his holiness and my sinfulness.  In other words, it is the ability to see self, and this world, through God's eyes.""Farley underscores a major paradox that runs through the book: ""The proud man think he is humble, but the humble man thinks he is proud.  The humble man sees his arrogance.  He sees it clearly, and as a result he aggressively pursues a life of humility, but he doesn't think of himself as humble.  The proud man is completely unaware of his pride.  Of all men he is most convinced that he is humble.""  The author exposes and addresses this paradox throughout the remainder of his work.Part two applies the gospel to the humble  man.  The author shows how people are humbled by God's wrath, the final judgment, the sinfulness of sin, gospel-centered faith and preaching.  This section hits readers between the eyes and does a terrific job of revealing the biblical categories for life change.Finally, part three addresses the fear of man and humility in leadership.  The practical application in this section is certainly worth the price of the book.Gospel-Powered Humility is one of those books that never made it to the best sellers list.  William Farley writes with strong biblical conviction which is laced with pastoral wisdom and sensitivity.  If readers long for a feel-good book that panders to sin and strokes the ego, look elsewhere.  But if readers are looking for truth which transforms, look no further than Gospel-Powered Humility.www.baldreformer.wordpress.com5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2LNBYVEP5GZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GCDXJK#wasThisHelpful","R3I2LNBYVEP5GZ","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Daring Heart of David Livingstone captures the account of the well-known 1595555927_bmissionary who sought with all his heart to bring the gospel to Africa in the 19th century.  Jay Milbrandt, professor at Bethel University is responsible for the meticulous research and for producing the final product.Milbrandt guides readers through the adventures of the daring missionary who faced wild animals, hostile tribes, sickness among his family members, and eventually death itself.But this is no ordinary missionary biography.  Indeed, Livingstone had a passion to bring the gospel to the nations.  But he also sought to end the slave trade in Africa.  Milbrandt describes all the events which eventually led to the abolition of the slave trade.  But interestingly enough, as the author notes, ""Livingstone died perhaps believing he had failed in every respect.  Yet, in the few short years after his death, everything Livingstone had worked for had come to fruition.""This book is vivid reminder that faithfulness and persistence matters.  It is a reminder that God is never obligated to reveal the fruit of one's ministry in this lifetime.  Any fruit that is revealed is a result of the amazing grace of God.  It is this grace that Livingstone found his comfort and his strength.  It is this grace that fueled his resolve to make a difference in the lives of people - in order to spread a passion for the glory of God!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SAM6JTN1SJMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5QWZ2C#wasThisHelpful","R3SAM6JTN1SJMQ","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heaven on Earth by Stephen J. Nichols attempts to capture the essence of Jonathan nicholsEdwards's vision for living in between heaven and earth.  The author confronts the typical negative response to Jonathan Edwards who is regularly caricatured as a mean-spirited Puritan who is preoccupied with the wrath of God.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  Anyone familiar with Edwards admits that the Puritan divine preached unashamedly about the holy wrath of God.  But limiting the essence of his thought to eschatological fury is short-sighted and wrong.Stephen Nichols skillfully alerts readers to the passion the resides in Jonathan Edwards to live a God-centered life on this side of heaven.  After introducing the broad strokes of Edwards's biography, the author recasts some sermons which were penned by Edwards.  In these sermons, readers will note that Edwards emphasized the pursuit of pleasure, a theme which has been popularized by John Piper in his best-selling book, Desiring God.  Piper gets to the core of Edwardsian thought in his pithy statement, ""God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.""Nichols unpacks the emphasis on charity and works of love that emerges in Jonathan Edward's writing: ""It is the absolute  and indispensable duty of the people of God, to give bountifully and willingly for supplying the wants of the needy.""And the happiness of God's people is clearly revealed in the work of Jonathan Edwards: ""The happiness of the saints in heaven consists partly in that they serve God ... When the creature is in that state that is most agreeable to the proper perfection of its nature, then it is in its most happy state.""Stephen Nichols successfully accomplish his objective in this short introduction to the worldview of Jonathan Edwards.  My prayer is that newcomers to Edwards will read this excellent book and be drawn to read the primary sources.  My experience with Jonathan Edwards over the last twenty-five years has been nothing short of revolutionary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A26I8TCLLV7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00295AIDI#wasThisHelpful","R1A26I8TCLLV7R","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have over one hundred and fifty books on my ""to read list.""  Most of them are big books; important books.  Most of these books are theological in nature.  They address the big questions in life.  They stimulate my thinking.  They warm  my  heart.  These books lead me closer to the Savior.So why would I pick up a book about a burned out corporate executive who took a  job on a ""wing and a prayer"" at Starbucks?  Why would I pick up a book about a guy who lost everything and traded a life of affluence for a blue-collar job and a green apron?Perhaps the Starbucks label drew me in.  Or maybe the tagline by Hartford Cournant worked its magic with the word, ""inspiring.""  Whatever it was, this little book edged out a bunch of good books and captured my attention for five or six hours.How Starbucks Saved My Life is the riches to rags tale of a high-paid advertising executive who was not only fired but also threw away his marriage and ended up jobless, without health insurance and faced an expensive surgery to remove a tumor in his brain.The book is readable from start to finish and is extremely difficult to put down.  The author utilizes his writing experience to lure readers in - a story that is both compelling, inspirational, and heartbreaking.The most important character in Gill's book is a twenty-eight year old African-American woman who hires the unemployed executive.  She emerges as the hero who mentors a man old enough to be her grandfather.  Crystal motivates, encourages, and even scolds Michael Gill.  In the words of Gill, she ""saved my life.""Another interesting feature of Gill's book is the management philosophy of Starbucks.  He characterizes the coffee giant as a business who cares for their employees; a business who takes care of their employees.  Indeed, Starbucks is an organization that truly makes every guest feel special.How Starbucks Saved My Life is a story about a man who comes full circle.  Gill admits his failures.  He owns up to his mistakes.  And in the final analysis, he celebrates his victories.  It is a story about the power of humans who connect with one another.So why would I pick up a book like this?  Is it possible that every person wrestles with the same kinds of things that Michael Gates Gill struggles with?  The deepest answer to this question for belongingness is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ - a point that is never addressed in the book.  So the tension runs thick as the author beautifully expresses his need for belonging and connectedness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EY6NRHQ347A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WCWUVS#wasThisHelpful","R3EY6NRHQ347A5","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several years ago, I set out to read about as many of the United States presidents as possible.  Reading about the great leaders in America's history; leaders like George Washington, John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Ronald Reagan is an unforgettable experience that tends to leave a mark on each reader.During this political season filled with failed policies and lackluster leadership, I set out to read about a few men who may one day occupy the Oval Office.  The first book is written by the Vice Presidential candidate, Paul Ryan.  His book, The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea is a transparent look at the Wisconsin native and his vision for America.Readers will be impressed with Ryan's unassuming style.  He's a small town boy with big dreams for America.  There's no political pretense here; just well-thought out ideas that Ryan proposes in order to rescue our country from the clutches of the Obama administration.Several reforms are proposed by Paul Ryan.  The first proposal he presents is entitlement and health-care reform.  The goal here, according to Ryan is to begin by repealing Obama care, the prized jewel of social progressives.  Ryan makes it clear that he intends to save social security, medicare, and medicaid.  But the current policies will, in the final analysis lead to economic disaster.  Ryan proposes commonsense solutions which promote competition among insurance companies and doctors which will ultimately drive down prices; not to mention put more money back into the pocketbook of Americans.The second proposal includes an economic growth component.  Ryan addresses the growing national debt crisis which is over $17 trillion and rising.  He addresses the liberal proclivity to tax and spend.  Ryan adds, ""The bottom line is that when you tax something , you get less of it.  So when we tax prosperity and success, we get less of each - and we need more of both so we can get the economy working for everyone again.""Third, tax reform is on Ryan's agenda.  He is in favor of a reduction of the corporate tax rate and argues in favor of a simpler tax code.  Ryan's reforms would mean ""that no business or family would pay more than 25 percent of their income to the federal government.""  And many Americans would pay considerable less under the Ryan plan.Fourth, ending cronyism and corporate welfare.  Ryan notes, ""Cronyism is integral to the progressive approach to governing.""  A brief look at the Obama policies only confirm this notion.  Ryan concludes, ""Americans need to know that their government is on their side - encouraging robust competition that will best serve their interests and grow their economy - rather than on the side of big, established corporate players.  Capitalism and cronyism are not compatible, and it's time Republicans made it much clear to voters that we are the party that stands for a competitive economy suitable for growth.""Fifth, Ryan makes a good case for regulatory reform.  ""Going forward,"" he writes, ""we should ease the regulatory  burden on the economy, and the best way to do that is to bring meaningful cost-benefit analysis back into the system, reconnect the law with the lawmakers, and restore the balance between the branches of the government.  True regulatory reform can restart economic growth - and produce the energy we need.""Sixth, aggressive immigration reform should be a key plank in the GOP platform.  Ryan's ideas are among the best I've read as a pathway for citizenship is offered and accountability required.Seventh, sound monetary policy will guide our country into the future.Finally, a twenty-first century national defense strategy and foreign policy.  Ryan refers to this final component of his plan as the ""missed opportunity"" of the Obama administration.  Moving forward will require a strong military and a foreign policy that builds bridges with our allies around the world.There's something strangely refreshing about Paul Ryan's approach.  Readers will notice that this man is devoted to his family and country.  He just happens to be a politician.  Here is a man who has strong gifts  in the field of economics and understands how to apply a supply-side approach in the current climate.  Paul Ryan is a strong leader with strong values and a heart for the American ideal.  Whether he ever ends up in the Oval Office is anyone's guess.  One thing is true: He knows the way forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32UPW6UPMWPFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H25FL0U#wasThisHelpful","R32UPW6UPMWPFB","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some write to entertain; some to educate.  Others write to amuse or inspire.  Barnabas Piper writes to encourage.  He writes to encourage both pastors and their children.Piper writes from experience.  His dad is Dr. John Piper, former Senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Barnabas Piper is a Pastor's Kid.  He, like every other PK understands the pressure and pain of living under the roof of a pastor.  Any doubters need only read a riveting sentence at the beginning the book: ""The call of the father is not the call of the child, but the ministry of the father creates an anvil-like weight on the child ... And it is this pressure, in part, that drives so many PK's to break.""Barnabas Piper performs a vital service for the Body of Christ in his book Pastor's Kid: Finding Your Own Faith and Identity.  This is a candid inside look at the deep struggle which occurs in many PK's.  Some PK's rebel; others hide their emotions.  Some actually thrive.  But all will admit to living a life of sacrifice; a life that is something akin to living in a pressure cooker or a fishbowl.Piper alerts readers to the kind of scrutiny that every PK faces: ""It creates a tension in which it can be difficult to genuinely make ourselves known, and so PKs become both the best-known and the least-known people in the church.  In most cases there isn't a single person or particular group of people doing the watching.  It's a collective, disorganized, largely unintentional effort on the part of the church as a whole.  At best it is bothersome; at worst it is suffocating and warping.""Piper writes from two angles in this excellent book.  First, he has plenty to say to PKs.  A lot of the advice comes through the backdoor as the author reminds every PK of this important reality: They are not alone.  It's as if he says, ""If John Piper's son struggled in many ways, it should not come as a surprise if you struggle too.""  So Barnabas Piper not only writes from experience; he writes with great empathy and compassion.  There is a wealth of wisdom here that every PK should benefit from.But the younger Piper has much to say to pastors as well.  He pulls no punches and shares his wisdom with candor and humility.  Most readers will no doubt wonder, ""I wonder what his dad thinks about that sentence?""  Piper's advice to pastors will cut deep but will in the final analysis prove helpful.Like Piper, I write from experience.  I write as one who has served as a pastor for nearly twenty-five years.  But I'm also a PK.  So I've seen both sides of the fence.  Both sides have challenges but both sides are filled with opportunities for growth and sanctification.  Pastor's Kid loaded with practical advice for pastors and their children!One of my life goals is to teach in Bible College or Seminary; to train and equip the next generation of pastors and theologians.  If God opens that door in the future, Pastor's Kid by Barnabas Piper will be required reading for every student.  It's that good.  I am confident that Piper's work will travel far and encourage many people.  May we heed his words, hear his heart, and respond with God-centered resolve.4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2JUXNFSMBO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JW4T9OI#wasThisHelpful","R3H2JUXNFSMBO2","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will never find me bungy-jumping, surfing, skydiving, or dangling from the face of the Half Dome in California.  However, I do enjoy reading about the adventures of other people who put their necks on the line for a thrill.  Row For Freedom by Julia Immonen is a classic example of adventure, courage, and sacrifice.  But the ""thrill"" of the row is secondary.  The author has a greater purpose in mind.  This purpose is in fact, the grand theme of the book.Immonen recounts the true tale of her journey across the Atlantic with four other brave women.  What would motivate these women to risk their lives by rowing across the Atlantic?  First, they were shooting for a world record.  But what really grabbed my attention was the second goal, namely, to raise money to fight the horrible sin of human trafficking.The author provides some biographical detail which concerns her life as  a child in Finland and her subsequent move to the UK.  Her dream to row the Atlantic is met with several challenges along the way but she and her sisters succeed.The story is gripping, fast-moving, and begs readers to finish in one sitting.  The book is raw, emotion-filled, and challenging.While the story is moving in many ways, I must confess that the most disappointing part was the gospel which is barely recognizable.  While the author is quick to give God credit, the gospel is never articulated in a clear terms.Row For Freedom is a gripping book.  The real beauty of Row For Freedom, however, is Immonen's obvious hatred for human trafficking.  It is her antipathy for this vile practice that motivated her to keep rowing, an antipathy that needs to spread to people of influence and conviction; people willing to make a difference one person at a time.  My hope is that the book will receive a wide reading and alert millions of people to the evil of human trafficking - a wicked industry that enslaves 30 million slaves around the world.  To that end, the Row For Freedom will not be in vain.  Slaves will be liberated and the world will be a better place.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookLookbloggers.com book review bloggers program.

"Leadership Lessons, by Ralph Hawkins and Richard Leslie Parrott is a case study about the failure of King Saul.  The authors raise need at the beginning of their book by providing a biblical rationale for studying a failed leader.  Colin Powell reveals the test of leadership failure: ""The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you stop being their leader.  They have either lost confidence that  you can help them or concluded that you do not care.""  Leadership Lessons helps prevent Secretary Powell against.The second part of the book introduces readers to ten failures on Saul's part:1. Saul failed to handle authority humbly2. Saul failed to break out os his tendency to isolate himself3. Saul failed to think before he spoke4. Saul failed to act when the time was right5. Saul failed to lead the people, but let them lead him instead6. Saul failed to promote or make necessary changes7. Saul failed to love the people8. Saul failed to be true to his own ethics9. Saul failed to admit failure or concede  to David10. Saul failed to consult GodThese ten leadership failures capture the essence of Saul's life and his failure as the King of Israel.  The authors are to be commended for excavating these failures and warning readers from committing the same sins in their sphere of influence.The third section discusses ways to avoid the pitfalls of King Saul and his leadership failures.  Boiled down, the authors argue that Saul's failure can motivate and aspire leaders to excel in their respective arenas.  In other words, leaders can learn from Saul's mistakes.Leadership Lessons is filled with practical tips for serving people with humility.  One criticism that must be noted is the propensity to turn Saul's sin into a personality disorder.  Whenever one promotes the notion of ""personality disorder"" the next step is some form of ""therapy"" to remedy that personality disorder.  But in Saul's case, his leadership failure was the result of sin.  It was sin that led him down a path that ultimately destroyed his rule and reign.  It was sin that led to his untimely death.  And the cure for sin is not therapy.  The cure for is the gospel of Jesus Christ.My hope is that leaders will benefit from this book.  Much can be learned from the sinful example of King Saul.  So much more can be gained by grounding our leadership is the saving message of the gospel of Jesus Christ!I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze®.com  book review bloggers program.

"Peter Jones has been writing about paganism for many years now.  While many are put off by the term ""pagan,"" Jones is simply offering the critical components of a worldview which is growing with a vengeance.  The troubling news is that many Christ-followers are either unaware the tentacles of paganism or could care less.The Pagan Heart of Today's Culture offers a clear look at paganism through the lens of three isms, postmodernism, Gnosticism, and  polytheism.  Jones unpacks each worldview in a clear way and alerts readers to the deadly toxins that affect countless numbers of people.Ultimately, Jones defines paganism as ""direct mysterious-mystical access to 'the Spirit.'""  The author demonstrates how the three worldviews described above intertwine and result in the strange but deadly brew we know as paganism.  He cites Romans 1:25  where Paul the apostle boils down two distinct approaches to spirituality:The worship and service of nature-creation - ""Oneism.""The worship and service of the Creator - ""Twoism.""The first approach to spirituality results in the wrath of God for failing to honor God as we ought.  The second approach to spirituality is the path commended by Scripture.Jones warns readers, ""Any system of thought that attempts to describe the world exclusively by the world is in principle Oneist.""  Whenever the creature and the Creator are blended into some kind of synthesis, the spiritual results are not only devastating - the results are damning.The author shoots a metaphorical flare in the hopes that Christ-followers will be alert and respond appropriately to the danger of paganism.  In so doing, he argues that Christians will need to do at least two things:They must have a clear understanding of the coherence of Oneism.They must affirm the glorious superiority of Twoism and fearlessly declare the gospel of reconciliation with the personal Creator, possible only through the atoning blood of Jesus the sole mediator between Creator and creature.As usual Peter Jones does not disappoint.  His passion to equip believers is evident through the book.  I commend The Pagan Heart of Today's Culture to Bible-believing Christians.

"The word, “evangelism” strikes fear in the hearts of many Christ-followers.  But nothing could be more backwards, for the people of God possess the greatest news in the universe.  A holy God sent his Son, the Lord Jesus to die in the place of every person who would ever believe.  Sinners may receive the hope of eternal life by banking all their hope in Christ and the benefits he purchased for them on Calvary’s cross.J. Mack Stiles helps Christians develop confidence in the responsibility to tell the nations about Christ in his excellent little book, Evangelism.  The author rightly responds to churches who turn the evangelistic endeavor into a mere program.  Rather, he encourages the church to develop a “culture of evangelism” which is “built on people filled with the power of God’s Spirit proclaiming the gospel of God’s grace in the context of their everyday lives and relationships.”  The main theme, then, is built around an entirely different paradigm; a mindset that can and should dominate every local church.Stiles endorses a modified definition of evangelism that I rather like: “Evangelism is teaching the gospel with the aim to persuade.”  Such a definition works well in the pulpit, classroom, local park, and coffee shop.  Francis of Assisi may have been well-intentioned when he quipped, “Preach the gospel, and if necessary use words.”  But wordless evangelism is no evangelism at all (no offense to The Wordless Book – which actually uses words, in the final analysis).  Stiles speaks emphatically, “There is no evangelism without words.”  Such a gospel should include important words that include God, man, Christ, and human response.The culture of evangelism that Stiles favors emerges clearly in chapter two.  The author dreams of churches committed to eleven ideals:A Culture Motivated by Love for Jesus and His GospelA Culture That Is Confident In the GospelA Culture That Understands the Danger of EntertainmentA Culture That Sees People ClearlyA Culture That Pulls Together as OneA Culture in Which People Teach One AnotherA Culture That Models EvangelismA Culture in Which People Who Are Sharing Their Faith Are CelebratedA Culture That Knows How to Affirm and Celebrate New LifeA Culture Doing Ministry That Feels Risky and Is DangerousA Culture That Understands That the Church Is the Chosen and Best Method of EvangelismSuch a culture becomes a reality when God’s people put the gospel at the center of every activity.  The gospel emerges in every song, every sermon, and every classroom.  In this gospel-centered culture, people are equipped – prepared and passionate about presenting Christ to lost people.J. Mack Stiles has written a fantastic book that I commend to Christians – not only to read, but also to absorb and apply.  Perhaps the harvest is just around the corner!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4MLDZCJ71JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG093E#wasThisHelpful","RT4MLDZCJ71JW","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the late 80's I read Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.  That was a profound experience as Covey revealed areas of weakness that needed to be excavated in my life.  A similar thing happened as I poured over the pages of Essentialism by Greg McKeown.McKeown sets forth his basic proposal at the beginning of the book.  It's what he calls the basic value proposition of Essentialism: ""Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.""The author essentially argues that business leaders who attempt to fit more and more into their lives have a tendency to decrease their effectiveness.  Many leaders run from one meeting to the next and never really get anything accomplished that matters.  The ladder to the top is time-consuming and requires a ton of sacrifice.  The problem is that most people sacrifice the wrong things and consequently place the truly important things - like family, friends, and faith on the wrong altar.  The end result of a life of frustration and regret.The path of Essentialism is a totally different paradigm.  The Essentialist asks, ""Am I participating in the right activities?""  The Essentialist learns to tell the difference between activities that make a lasting impact from the ones that merely steal time.  ""Essentialism,"" argues the author, ""is not about how to get more things done; it's about how to get the right things done.  It doesn't mean just doing less for the sake of less either.  It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.""At the heart of McKeown's book is a refreshing strategy for daily living: ""Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.""  As such, the book militates against much of what most leaders consider to be conventional wisdom.  Much of the book, then, is counterintuitive as it jettisons the typical workaholic approach to effectiveness in the marketplace - especially in America.The book is comprised of four parts.  Part one, Essence, describes the core mind-set of an essentialist.  Part two, Explore, helps readers determine which activities are trivial and which ones are considered a part of the ""vital few.""  Part three, Eliminate, discusses how we can cut out the trivial from our lives.  And part four, Execute, provides practical help for engaging in the necessary activities.Essentialism is not a ""how to"" book.  It merely provides the philosophical framework that helps ensure effectiveness without sacrifices the things that really matter in life.  But this framework is worth embracing and building into the fabric of one's life.  I found the book stimulating, encouraging, mind-bending, and even convicting at times.Essentialism stand among the best reads of 2014.  I heartily recommend it!I received this book free from the publisher through the Bloggingforbooks.org.

"A few days ago as my family entered a bookstore, my eight year old son shocked and thrilled me when he asked, “Hey Dad, where can I find the Peter Jones books?”  My son is asking the question that scores of Christians should be asking.  Enter Gospel Truth, Pagan Lies by Peter Jones.It is not trendy.  It never made the New York Times best sellers list.  It is probably not on the shelf of your local Christian book store.  (It wasn’t available at the store I was in). In fact, most people have probably never heard about Gospel Truth, Pagan Lies.  But this is a very important book that needs to be read.Dr. Jones clearly unfolds the differences between biblical Christianity and paganism and calls Christ-followers to spiritual discernment: “We need to wake up.  Anti-Christian but very spiritual paganism is flooding our land.”  Jones notes, “There are only two kinds of spirituality – Christian or pagan.  The two systems have nothing in common, and are as different as the truth and the lie.  But paganism loves to disguise itself in Christian clothes.”Jones unpacks the five tenets of monism and contrasts these erroneous components with a Christ-centered and biblically informed worldview.  I am intentionally omitting the specific points in this review in order to lure readers to Jones’ excellent work.Gospel Truths, Pagan Lies should be required Christian reading.  Parents need to read it for the sake of their children.  Young people need to read it in order to recognize the errors of monism and how these lies have infiltrated their culture.  Jones reminds us, “Paganism is like a downward spiral.  In the vortex at the bottom is Satan and the worship of evil … Biblical theism is like an upward spiral that brings us into the light of God’s presence.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2539LQW9CD90M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1579212085#wasThisHelpful","R2539LQW9CD90M","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Kouzes and Barry Posner have been offering help to leaders for years now.  Their seminal works, The 1118911296_bLeadership Challenge, Credibility, and the Truth About Leadership have helped me immensely as I grow personally and pastorally as a leader.  Indeed, thousands of leaders have gained great insight from the works of Kouzes and Posner.The newest treasure by these fine men is entitled Turning Adversity Into Opportunity.  The book is short but don't let the size fool you.  Like their other works, this little book is definitely worthy of a careful read.The book is built on the premise that leadership is hard; leadership is lonely.  But leaders navigate their way through difficult storms and actually use the stormy days as a catalyst for success.  Kouzes and Posner present six strategies for turning adversity into opportunity:Broaden the ContextDefy the VerdictFully Commit to What's ImportantTake Charge of ChangeEngage OthersShow You CareMy hope is that these six principles will attract interested readers who will devour the content and learn how to turn adversity into opportunity.  At the end of the day, Kouzes and Posner invite readers to embrace adversity for a purpose.  In what proves to be the most important sentence in the book, the authors add, ""Let's get excited about the adversities.  Yes, that's right - excited.  They are not brick walls.  They are turning points.  They are there to ask you what you want and how badly you want it.

"Several months ago, I titled a sermon  Grace Works based on Titus 2.:11-14.  Verse 11  reminds us that grace has appeared in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.  This grace has saved us.  This grace has transported every believer from death to life.  This grace saves us, sanctifies us, and secures our future with Christ.  Indeed, grace works!  So when I learned about the new book by Douglas Bond, entitled Grace Works I requested a copy from a company I write reviews for.  It was a great decision!Douglas Bond is concerned; deeply concerned.  He along with a handful of evangelicals including R.C. Sproul, J.I. Packer, Jerry Bridges, John Piper, and Tim Keller are concerned that the gospel is being eclipsed by works-based righteousness.  John Calvin had a similar concern in the 16th century: ""We must exercise the utmost caution lest we allow any counterfeit to be substituted for the pure doctrine of the gospel.""Douglas Bond alerts Christ-followers to this gospel counterfeit in his latest book, Grace Works.  The author shows how this counterfeit gospel has emerged throughout church history.  He demonstrates the subtle shift that took place in European churches that once glowed with Reformation fervor.  He cites several examples of how the gospel has been distorted and continues to be distorted in the contemporary church.At the heart of the book lies a concern that many believers appear to be confused about the biblical gospel.  While many give lip-service to the doctrine of justification by faith alone, many continue to add requirements which muddy the ""waters of grace"" in the final analysis.The author cites Tim Keller approvingly who says, ""It is only in the gospel of Jesus Christ that you get the verdict before the performance.""  Bond adds, ""Every other religion requires performance before the verdict.  But in the gospel, Christ has stooped down and perfectly obeyed for us, as our substitute.  Jesus the righteous one was righteous in our place.  By the grace of the gospel, performance will follow, but in justification the verdict is already in: we are forever righteous in Christ.  That is immeasurably good news!""Yet, a stunning number of professing evangelicals are repudiating justification by faith alone by adding requirements which is tantamount to a works-based approach.  The road back to Rome may be paved with good intentions, but thoughtful observers can hear the gnashing of teeth.Bond warns readers of the subtle ways that law creeps into the gospel, especially when pastors and Christian leaders make obedience a requirement for justifying grace.  Bond adds, ""Serious error arises when trusting and obeying are required as concurrent actions the sinner must do in the context of his justification.  Trusting is not sufficient - which is the same as saying that faith alone is not sufficient; you must also obey the law to win God's final favor.""  Several examples are cited and once again readers are warned to flee from the city of Rome.Douglas Bond is to be commended for writing a book that is timely, especially in light of the so-called New Perspective on Paul movement.  The gospel shines brightly in Grace Works.  The doctrines which were rediscovered by the Protestant Reformers are put on display.  The law is put in its proper place as a tutor which leads us to Christ.  Readers are reminded that the law cannot justify; nor can the law sanctify.My hope is that Grace Works receives a wide readership and that thousands of people will be equipped in gospel-centered reality.  My hope is that many will see the errors of the Roman road; that they will turn back and swim in the waters of free grace and be refreshed by the sola's of the Reformation!I received this book free from the publisher through the NetGalley I was not required to write a positive review.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKWCNG9OOUKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596387432#wasThisHelpful","R2CKWCNG9OOUKW","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jonathan Edwards is the greatest theologian that stood on American soil.  It should come as no surprise, then, when one learns about the able individuals that sprouted forth from Edwards family tree - physicians, lawyers, university presidents, and even a vice-president.  Aaron Burr was Thomas Jefferson's vice-president, of course.  Burr was also Jonathan Edwards grandson.  So when I learned about a new book that chronicled the well-known showdown between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, I eagerly devoured the book.Duel With the Devil is the story of the unlikely pairing of Burr and Hamilton, two attorney's who combined their efforts to represent and defend a man convicted of murder.  Courtroom drama, political maneuvering, and personality conflicts weave throughout this tale.  Paul Collins is the author who has a gift for transporting readers to a historical setting - in this case, 18th century America.While many are familiar with the duel between Hamilton and Burr, most are unaware of their work together on this murder case, which  consumes most of the book.Students of American history will be pleasantly surprised by Collins work.  Here is a combination of a writer with John Grisham-like ability to tell a story and Dan Brown-like attention for detail.  The book is filled with historical tidbits but reads like a very fine novel.I received this book free from the publisher through the Bloggingforbooks.org.

"The ""gospel"" has become somewhat of a buzzword in evangelical circles.  It's a funny thing because the gospel is at the very center of the Bible and God's redemptive purposes.  So it's counterintuitive to claim the very idea that the gospel has become a buzzword.  Christ-followers knowingly or unknowingly validate a ministry, band, or organization by attaching the label, ""gospel.""  In most cases, this approach is a good measuring rod of the validity of anything or anyone which claims to adhere to the historic Christian faith.  But in some cases, it is a mere word that carries no more meaning that a sticker on a product.  In this sense, the word becomes another piece of Jesus junk.  Thankfully, the book under consideration does not fall into the later category.The Gospel by Ray Ortlund is the latest in a series of books in the 9Marks series, edited by Mark Dever.  I've read nearly all the books in the series.  They're all good and are chock-full of sound biblical counsel.  Each of the books is designed to help establish and nurture healthy churches.  I commend each book to pastors, leaders, and Christ-followers who love the church and have a passion to see Christ's glory penetrate the nations.  It's almost unfair to compare the books because each one stands alone and is an important contribution.  Having said that, Ray Ortlund's book stands head and shoulders above the others.Ortlund establishes the beauty of the gospel in the introduction: ""God, through the perfect life, atoning death, and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ, rescues all his people from the wrath of God, with a promise of the full restoration of his created order forever - all to the praise of the glory of his grace.""  With this definition of the gospel in place, the author defines the purpose of the book, namely -""to show how Christ puts his beauty into our churches by his gospel.""The first sentence in the book provides a framework for the rest of the journey through this wonderful little treatise: ""Gospel doctrine creates a gospel culture.  The doctrine of grace creates a culture of grace.""  He adds, ""Truth without grace is harsh and ugly.  Grace without truth is sentimental and cowardly.""  Unfortunately, many churches reflect the later.  But Ortlund is not deterred.  In a short chapter devoted to expositing John 3:16, he unpacks the wonder and majesty of the gospel of grace.  The gospel is compared to other so-called hopes that are offered up in the marketplace of ideas.  But the conclusion is simple: ""Every other hope is based, explicitly or implicitly, on how deserving we are.  Only the Christian gospel is based - clearly, boldly, and insistently - on how loving God is to the undeserving.""  In short, ""Gospel doctrine creates a gospel culture, and it matters.""Ortund maintains the gospel is for the church: ""The doctrine of grace creates a culture of grace where good things happen to bad people.""  As such, the author guides readers through a stunning exposition of Ephesians 5:25 - ""Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.""  Again, the culture is ultimately affected by the power of the gospel.  It is the gospel that makes us holy.  It is the gospel that makes us acceptable in the sight of a holy God.The author draws the attention of readers to the comprehensive nature of the gospel.  The new heaven and earth are presented.  In other words, as Ortund writes, ""This present heaven and earth, will be renewed.  God will restore this creation that he made, owns, and loves - this creation where we ourselves feel at home.""  At the end of the day, the gospel produces a culture which is brimming with hope - the hope that Christ will make all things new!This is a book worth reading and reading.  It is a book that needs to be absorbed and assimilated into the fabric of every local church.  The Gospel should be placed in the hands of new believers and veteran believers.  It should be gifted to non-believers who express an interest in the gospel.[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGYOXH5A1IFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG07ZY#wasThisHelpful","RWGYOXH5A1IFU","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been reading books about the church for almost thirty years now.  Most of the best material is being churned out by Mark Dever and the boys at 9Marks.  Tim Keller's, Center Church is a welcome guest in the growing list of books on ecclesiology.Keller sets out to communicate one central message which is summed up in the subtitle: Doing Balanced Gospel-Centered Ministry in the City.  Center Church is encyclopedic in nature.  It covers every subject conceivable and is a helpful tool in every pastors prospective tool chest.The discussion about gospel contextualization (chapter 7) is deeply encouraging and highly instructive.  The author notes, ""Contextualization is not - as is often argued - 'giving people what they want to hear.'  Rather, it is giving people the Bible's answers, which they may not at all want to hear, to questions about life that people in their particular time and place are asking, in language and forms they can comprehend, and through appeals and arguments with force they can feel, even if they reject them..""Keller warns against the temptation to use contextualization as a clever means of compromise (which I find many pastors doing).  He adds, ""The call to contextualize the gospel has been - and still often is - used as a cover for religious syncretism.  This means not adapting the gospel to a particular culture, but rather surrendering the gospel entirely and morphing Christianity into a different religion by overadapting it to an alien worldview.""Center Church is filled with helpful instruction on doing gospel ministry in the city.  It is a long read but worth plodding through for the treasures along the way.Highly recommended for pastors who love the gospel!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V9M0WFHQS4EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JSGB5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3V9M0WFHQS4EX","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Masha Gessen has a story to tell.  This Russian journalist draws the lines clearly and writes in terms that are understandable and inspiring.  Gessen tells the story of the ascension of President Putin in The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladamir Putin.Gessen writes, ""And with this, the transformation of Russia back into the USSR was, for all Putin's intents and purposes, complete.""  This sentence, in my mind proves to be the most important sentence in the book.  It is also the last.  The previous 269 pages set up the trajectories that make this sentence possible.  Those pages tell the story of a former KGB spy turned president and deemed the most powerful man in Russia and one of the most influential men in the world.My aim is not to disrespect the author in any way who has written a fascinating account of the rise of Putin.  However, the best and most interesting part of the book takes place in the epilogue.  Here, the author reveals her real hopes and fears as she explains the protests that took place in nearly one hundred cities in Russia in December, 2011.  The major strokes reveal a deep love of freedom, transparency in the press, and a respect for the heritage of her motherland.Gessen's work will no doubt raise questions and answer questions at the same time.

"Bart Ehrman is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  His Christological musings have caught the attention of scholars and pastors alike as he repudiates much of what passes for conservative scholarship.Ehrman maintains that Jesus thought of himself as Messiah, but did not think of himself as God.  He argues that Paul understands that Jesus is an angelic being.  He holds that Jesus is not God.The authors of How God Became Jesus respond critically to his Ehrman's primary assertions, some of which are noted above. Frankly, How God Became Jesus contains a wealth of apologetic material in the title alone.  The title itself runs contrary to Ehrman's latest work, How Jesus Became God.Michael Bird, Chris Tilling, Craig Evans, Simon Gathercole, and Charles Hill gather forces to respond critically to Ehrman's arguments.  The writing is scholarly and offers a rather systematic response to Ehrman.  Readers can decide for themselves if the authors are successful.  In mind, they do succeed, although not without some concern.  There is a degree of sarcasm that surfaces in some of these responses, which in the final analysis does not pay proper honor to their opponent.  I would prefer that the responses were informed by Paul's words to Timothy - ""And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness"" (2 Timothy 2:24-25, ESV).I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze®.com  book review bloggers program.

The authors present the purpose of the book in advance:To name and illustrate the causes of Mission Drift.To help clarify the mission of a given organization.To equip organizations with safeguards to reinforce and protect them.To bolster their claim, Greer and Horst advance several principle-centered propositions that serve leaders who cast vision, guard the values, and carry out their respective mission:Mission Drift is a crisis facing all faith-based organizationsMission Drift is pervasive, but it is not inevitableMission True organizations believe the Gospel is their most precious assetMission True organizations make hard decisions to protect and propel their missionMission True leaders assume they will face drift and build safeguards against itMission True board members have clarity about their missionMission True leaders set the cultural tone for the organizationThese are just a few of the propositions that the authors include.  The book contains a wealth of information that is based on solid research that is recent and relevant.  The authors provide several examples of organizations who maintain their mission as well as one's who drift.  The conclusion is that Mission True leaders stand ""unwaveeringly upon the Truth of the Gospel.""  These leaders are unwilling to compromise.  These leaders refuse to capitulate.

"""A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.""  So says King Solomon in Proverbs 25:11.  These wise words are the biblical basis for John Piper's new book, Seeing Beauty and Saying Beautifully.  Nearly fifteen years ago, Dr. Piper embarked on a series of books called, The Swans Are Not Silent.  The beauty of these books is found in a combination of brevity, historical narrative, and theological depth.  The books set out to introduce key figures in the history of the church - from Augustine, Calvin, and Luther to Bunyan, Wilberforce, and Cowper.  The newest volume introduces readers to George Herbert, George Whitefield, and C.S. Lewis.The author's aim, as he says, is ""to probe the interrelationship between seeing beauty and saying it beautifully.""  And he accomplishes his goal by pointing to Herbert, Whitefield, and Lewis by demonstrating how these men pointed others to see the beauty of Christ.Piper spends much of his time laboring over the poetic effort of these men: ""Poetic effort is the effort to see and savor and speak the wonder - the divine glory - that is present everywhere in the world God made, in the history God guides, and in the Word God inspired.""In the final analysis, Piper urges those who communicate Christian truth to do so in a beautiful and winsome way: ""It means that as you try to find words that seem worthy of the worth of what you have seen, the worth of what you have seen becomes clearer and deeper.""  Do do any less what appear to cheapen and weaken the message.This is the sixth volume in the Swans Are Not Silent series.  Each book stands alone and is brimming with joy and hope, which are centered in the person and work of Jesus Christ.  The newest edition is no exception.  John Piper continues to equip and encourage his readers.  Over and over again, he proves, the swans are not silent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE2WZFCA1NHGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCS49WK#wasThisHelpful","RE2WZFCA1NHGT","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been almost twenty-five years since I first read The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey.  Since then, many of the principles that Covey explores have been a part of the fabric of my life.A few years back, I had the opportunity to read David Allen's best selling book, Getting Things Done.  Like Covey, he added some ammunition that helped in the area of personal productivity.Matt Perman picks up where Covey and Allen left off.  His new book, What's Best Next contains the best of Stephen Covey and David Allen.  But Perman's work contains a significant difference.  And the distinction he introduces makes all the difference in the world.  Matt Perman helps readers understand how the gospel transforms the way we get things done.What's Best Next is filled with practical hints that will ramp up personal productivity - but never as an end in itself (which appears to be a flaw in both Covey and Allen).  Perman argues that personal productivity should have an end game.  Personal productivity, should enhance our ability to help people.  He adds, ""We should care about personal productivity not simply for our own sakes but also for the sake of others.""Anyone familiar with Covey or Allen will freely admit that these writers have the best intentions in mind.  And I have personally benefitted greatly from their work.  But Matt Perman is concerned first and foremost with the gospel of Jesus Christ.  He helps readers understand how their productivity can be enhanced in four specific areas including personal life, work life, organizational life, and society.What's Best Next is one of those books that is nearly impossible to review in a comprehensive way.  Principles could be explored that the author promotes and productivity hints could be shared.  But readers would inevitably be cheated - because this book is a gold mine.  It deserves to be read by every person who has a passion for the great commission and the great commandment.  Simply put, it will enhance one's ability to serve God and people with maximum effectiveness.The aim of Matt Perman is to ""reshape the way you think about productivity and then present a practical approach to help you become more effective in your life with less stress and frustration, whatever you are doing.""  The author succeeds, and then some.  I cannot recommend it highly enough!I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze®.com  book review bloggers program.

"Leaders understand the true nature of the task before them.  But true leadership must stowellbe redefined, according to Joseph Stowell.  His newest book, Redefining Leadership seeks to draw leaders to a ""character driven leadership experience that will produce maximum outcomes.""Stowell presents two distinctly different kinds of leaders: Outcome leaders and character-driven leaders.  The former are referred to as ""instinctive"" leaders, the later - ""kingdom"" leaders.  The author describes kingdom leadership which is ""measured by the life of a leader who cuts a wide and impactful swath of positive influence.""  This is the kind of leader, in the final analysis, who makes a difference in God's kingdom.The book is arranged in three parts:Part I: A Redefined PriorityOutcome-driven leaders focus primarily end results while character driven leaders live exemplary, God-pleasing lives.  Character-driven leaders ""use their organization to build stellar people, who in turn build a thriving culture that produces maximum corporate outcomes to the fame and glory of God.""The author address potential pitfalls and ""delusions"" that character-driven leaders need to avoid.  This brand of leader has his eyes fixated on the One who humbled himself and became a Servant to all, namely, Jesus Christ.Part II: A Redefined IdentityPart 2 introduces the concept of ""followership.""  The author maintains effective leaders ""choose to identify themselves, first and foremost, as followers!  Followers of Jesus.""  He adds, ""Only when we have a firm grasp of our identity as a follower of Jesus are we equipped to effectively lead and influence others.""  Three qualities mark the leader who is committed to the notion of followership:Follower-leaders count it an honor to follow Jesus.Follow-leaders actively pursue Christ.Follow-leaders are found in the ""Way"" with Him.Part 2 proves to be the heart and soul of the book as the author spells out the importance of ""moral authority"" and the importance of humility in a growing leader who commits himself to the ""Way"" of Christ.Part III: A Redefined LeaderThe final section surveys the core competencies of a leader which is grounded in the kingdom priorities of Jesus.  This leader relies on the strength that is granted through the indwelling Christ.  Indeed, he is committed to the kingdom agenda that emerge in Matthew's gospel.  Such a leader manifests qualities such as repentance, forgiveness, meekness, and mercy.Redefining Leadership is a book which is totally unique.  Few books devoted to the topic of Christian leadership are filled with the depth of wisdom found in these pages.  Both young and seasoned Christian leaders would do well to pour over these pages and benefit from Dr. Stowell's wisdom.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze®.com  book review bloggers program.

"Everything rises or falls with leadership.  In the local church, this kind of leadership begins with pastor/elders.  As such, I believe that the fruitfulness of our churches is dependent upon men who exert strong, humble, and God-centered leadership.  Godly leadership is informed by at least four critical assumptions:It must be anchored to the Bible.It must be guided by unshakeable convictions.It must be based on God's blueprint - for he has an order for his church.It must be intensely spiritual.Church Elders by Jeramie Rinne another fine selection in the 9 Marks Series, edited by Mark Dever. Rinne begins with some basic presuppositions which are designed to guide prospective elders down a path that is both biblical and practical.The author outlines the qualifications for the office of elder as set forth in 1 Timothy 3, Titus 1, and 1 Peter 5.  The discussion is elementary but is nonetheless very helpful.  In addition, the terms for elder are surveyed (pastor, elder, overseer, and bishop).  There can be no misunderstanding that the terms are synonymous, a feature that seems to be misunderstood by many people.Elders are called to shepherd the flock.  Therefore, they are called to:Engage in relationships with the flock.Minister with the intent of growing the flock in Christian maturity.Readers should not be surprised that elders should participate in the teaching ministry of the local church.  This fact is the key factor in distinguishing between men who are called to serve as elders as opposed to deacons.  The elder must be ""able to teach"" (1 Tim. 3:2).  Rinne makes it clear that this teaching ministry is not limited to the public preaching of God's Word.  It may include biblical counseling, one-on-one discipleship, classroom instruction, or small group gatherings.  The important take-away is that a qualified elder is able to teach God's Word - which means he also has a good handle on God's Word.Additionally, elders are called to protect the doctrinal sideboards of a church family: ""He must play both doctrinal offense and defense, 'holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it"" (Titus 1:9).Elders are to pay attention to the flock and hold God's people accountable to their faith commitment as well as their membership commitment.  They are charged with watching over the straying sheep.  The author notes five kinds of straying sheep which include sinning sheep, wandering sheep, limping sheep, fighting sheep, and biting sheep.Elders must be humble men.  Rinne adds, ""The simplest and most effective thing a church can do is to develop an intentional process for screening potential elders, and then be sure to select humble men.""  Men must serve in plurality.  There is no hint of a lone ranger eldership in the New Testament.  The author rightly notes that elders always serve as a team - in plurality.Church Elders by Jeramie Rinne is a terrific introduction to the subject of biblical eldership.  Readers interested in a more comprehensive treatment may turn to Thabiti Anyabwile's work, Finding Faithful Elders and Deacons.  For the best survey of this subject, I commend Biblical Eldership by Alexander Strauch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LR4ELVCMI1A1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG07DG#wasThisHelpful","R1LR4ELVCMI1A1","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some guys are telling stories from the comfort of a stool.  Others are ranting about politics or psychology.  Many are waxing eloquent about pop culture and exploring the benefits of modern technology.  These well-intentioned fellows may hold an audience and they may attract a crowd.  But one thing is for sure: they're not preaching.David Helm sets the record straight in his excellent book, Expositional Preaching.  Four sections make up this book which is a part of the 9Marks SeriesContextualization""Contextualization in preaching is communicating the gospel message in ways that are understandable or appropriate to the listener's cultural context.""Helm is quick to admit that contextualization is necessary in a solid expositional preaching ministry.  However in many pulpits, contextualization has eclipsed the Bible.  The author helps preachers understand some of the tendencies that can overrule the authority of Scripture in the pulpit.One instance that is explored is the popular devotional practice, Lectio Divina which has origins in the Roman Catholic church.  This questionable practice places more emphasis on the subjective which ends up marginalizing theological knowledge:  ""Lectio Divina advocates a method that is spiritual as opposed to systematically studious.  It substitutes intuition for investigation.  It prefers mood and emotion to methodical and reasoned inquiry.  It equates your spirit to the Holy Spirit.""  Simply put, this devotional practice ignores exegetical tools and sound hermeneutical methodology.  Let the preacher beware!  Lectio Divina is only one example which is cited.  Readers can investigate the other pitfalls for themselves.ExegesisSecond, the author alerts preachers to the importance of biblical exegesis which should drive every sermon.  Unfortunately, many preachers are bypassing this crucial aspect of sermon preparation and moving directly to application which is in the final analysis, a deadly mistake.The overriding theme that emerges in this chapter is the importance of knowing the Word of God and understanding the original intent of the author.  But Helm warns, ""Exegesis is not enough.  Done in isolation, exegesis alone can lead to preaching that is either overtly intellectual or merely imperatival.""Theological ReflectionThe author encourages a robust adherence to biblical theology and systematic theology as these disciplines inform the preaching task.  In particular, systematic theology offers at least three advantages:1. It holds you in the faith.2. It helps you connect to the gospel from particular genres.3. It hones your ability to speak to non-Christians.TodayFinally, a positive case is advanced for contextualization.  Now that the preacher has done his exegetical homework, using the tools of biblical and systematic theology, and sound hermeneutics, he may advance to work on contextualization.  He is concerned here with three important elements:1. The makeup of his audience.2. The arrangement of his material.3. The application of his message.The great strength of this book is its brevity.  The author clearly defines his terms and sets preachers on a course which is determined to lead to fruitfulness in the pulpit which will serve many congregations well in the future.  More comprehensive treatment may be found in Lloyd-Jones work, Preaching and Preachers and John Piper's, The Supremacy of God in Preaching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RM36YG4J25C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG08WG#wasThisHelpful","R3RM36YG4J25C","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Biblical Theology is ""interpretive perspective reflected in the way the biblical authors have presented their understanding of earlier Scripture, redemptive history, and the events they are describing, recounting, celebrating, or addressing in narratives, poems, proverbs, letters, and apocalypses.""  So says, James Hamilton in his latest work, What is Biblical Theology?Hamilton is no stranger to the world of biblical theology.  In 2010, he wrote God's Glory in Salvation Through Judgment, a book that I devoured and greatly benefitted from.  In many ways, What is Biblical Theology? could serve as a sort of introduction to the earlier work as it summarizes the important discipline of Biblical Theology.The sub-title accurately reflects the essential nature of the book: ""A Guide to the Bible's Story, Symbolism, and Patterns.""  One important question that Hamilton addresses is, ""How is God going to bless Gentiles in Abraham's seed?""  Ultimately we learn that ""all families of the earth will be blessed in the seed of Abraham, Jesus the Messiah"" (Gal. 3:14-16).  But Hamilton leaves no room for ambiguity here: ""Gentile Christians enjoy all the blessings given to Israel in the Old Testament"" (Eph. 1:3-14).The emphasis on continuity is a breath of fresh air, especially to one like myself who was trained with the presuppositions of classical dispensationalism.  The remainder of the book explores these and related themes.  In the final sense, the author seeks to draw readers into the drama of the biblical plot line.  Of course, he should receive high marks for writing a book that mines out the deep truths of Scripture in clear and winsome ways.Readers who are interested in other works of biblical theology should turn to The King in His Beauty by Tom Schreiner and Kingdom Through Covenant: A Biblical Understanding of the Covenants by Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35OXI95S4XVXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GO9AJWK#wasThisHelpful","R35OXI95S4XVXK","A2WLRNFTHI67WX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WLRNFTHI67WX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Simply put, The Beatles are one of, if not THE most covered music artists in history.  It started early on too!  In 1966, guitar-maestro Chet Atkins released CHET ATKINS PICKS ON THE BEATLES, an exemplary tour de force of the early Beatles music by the King of Pickers.  Staying honest to the melodies with just a little flavoring, it is one of the best acoustic cover albums out there.  Jose Feliciano infused many of his covers on his first few albums (he made a whole lot of Beatles interpretations early on; his first three albums have no less than 11 highly stylized interpretations) with terrific jazz interpretations.  Check out his version of Norwegian Wood sometime.  Jazz artists of course do the best with the Beatles.  George Benson went into the studio mere weeks after the release of ABBEY ROAD and released THE OTHER SIDE OF ABBEY ROAD, one of the best fusion jazz albums of all time (IMO), and GRP artists laid out I GOT NO KICK AGAINST MODERN JAZZ in the 90’s.So what is so special about this 2013 once again acoustic tour of the Fab Four by a jazz guitar virtuoso (who nearly invented “shredding” all by himself and then left the hard fusion jazz arena before he could lose his hearing)?  The special kind of treatment that Di Meola gives to his guitar sounds is virtually owned by him.  There is no other guitarist who comes close, even his long-time friend and associate Paco De Lucia has his own flavor, as did and does Carlos Santana, another  heavy hitter in the Latin influenced guitar arena who has also ventured into the fusion jazz world.  Feliciano, a virtuoso in his own right, comes close in a few of his machinations, but Al Di Meola stands out from the pack and always will.  He was one of the most underrated and underappreciated guitarists, who during the release of his first three solo albums, got some “negative” reviews by ignorant tin-eared critics who actually said he needed to “grow”.  This during a time and market where almost each and every artist was a pioneer in their field!As a “jazz” artist, Al does not cover artists or their music.  He interprets them, flows in and around them, plants new seeds in them, and nurtures the parental melodies while extrapolating the artists visions into new dimensions and layers.  This is what good jazz artists do, whether they are feeding off of classical music, Amercian standards, or rock.  What Al used to do in the fusion field was incredible but what he has done in the last couple decades with acoustic flamenco and jazz guitar has been astounding, and with the Beatles he has captured the pinnacle of both and fused them into an ocean of fantasy landscapes where people who love Beatles music can experience a different kind of psychedelic trip.  This is the best Beatles interpretation I have personally enjoyed since Benson’s OTHER SIDE… way back in 1969.  There have been some good ones, even great ones, but this one stands up and hails from an entirely new and lovelier universe.  It is immersive, delicate and yet multi-textured and formidable.  The finger work is amazing as always with Al, but the sheer beauty is beyond description.  You simply have to hear it to understand, and words just fall short.Who is going to love this album?  Anyone who loves acoustic guitar work, especially virtuoso talented guitar work.  Anyone who loves Al Di Meola (that’s a given).  Anyone who loves The Beatles and loves really good “covers” by the likes of Feliciano, Benson, Tommy Emmanuel, The Edge, Santana, Mark Knopfler, Earl Klugh, Steve Howe, Pat Metheny, and a host of others who have made notable notes after Beatles music.  Lastly, anyone who loves and appreciates beautiful music that is more complex and ear bending than can be allowed as background music (go ahead, put it on, try to do something else, see how far you get before you are captured and held hostage to the strings).Another way of rating this album:  Wow!!!Musical Notes:The overall approach of the album is Al Di Meola starts out simply with some gorgeous finger picking on staples (In My Life, And I Love Her, Because, Michelle, I Will) which, in each course served, begins to extrapolate about half way through, wrapping you up in the song and initially grabbing your attention with the fact that he is overdubbing several guitars, but the fingering execution is regardless just stupendous and enviable even if you are Eric Clapton or Jimmy Page.  “Percussion” is light, tapping on hollow bodies, feet and hands courtesy of Al and his producer.  Immediately recognize that this elegance and beauty was contrived in the ghosts of John and George, right there in The Beatles own Abbey Road Studios.  Because will floor you when you realized this has become and improvisational tool and it took you so long to notice!  Just like Ramsey Lewis’ take on Michelle, Al has mutated this song into an elegy of distinct impromptu proportions.  About halfway through this journey, the journey turns into a “trip” because when you have arrived in the psychedelic era of [ER, Penny Lane, Blackbird, I Am The Walrus, A Day In The Life, Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite, and With A Little Help From My Friends] our clever Al displays some inhuman form on those fingertips.  You might say, “well Blackbird isn’t exactly a ‘trippy’ song” well once you hear the amazing runs Di Meola can do on just one guitar, you will be flying with the Blackbird.  Needless to say the other Beatle hallucinogens become putty in the hands of this master and your experiences will be all blessedly new and fantastical.  The album closes with two stunners.  If I Fell is like actually falling… over a waterfall, lacking the depth of imagination to put this feeling into words is just hopelessly hoping you might share my image, and all I can utter is you had to be there.  The finale of She’s Leaving Home is singularly the most beautiful acoustic guitar work I have heard from anyone, including Al, in literally decades.  It is an OMG moment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6ERPTUH0L54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1SM5UA#wasThisHelpful","RZ6ERPTUH0L54","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Incredibly, every modern reviewer, including professionals (AllMusic and others) seem to get the technical information about this album entirely wrong while still getting the gist of the critique entirely right.  For those of you who would, for whatever reason, want to purchase this album, here is the correct historical information from a die-hard Renaissance fan who actually purchased all of these albums when they first came out (and why).After the breakup of the Yardbirds, the great McCarty/Relf duo went into the studio with some recruits, including sister Jane Relf and Yardbird Samwell-Smith (as producer) to hammer out two albums (one was not even released in the UK or USA) which were effectively psychedelia inspired progressive folk rock leaning towards something akin to Quicksilver Messenger Service meets It’s A Beautiful Day.  The resulting album sales were lackluster at best and during some turbulent personnel changes, what tumbled out of the dice cup was the “Annie Haslam led” Renaissance V2.0 or what we used to call fondly Mark II.  PROLOGUE was introduced to me by a Philadelphia gal (us west coasties were rather ignorant of Renaissance other than by word of mouth, but they were extremely popular in the northeast New England and Atlantic states).  I was already moving into “progressive rock” even though we did not call it that at the time.  What one found with Renaissance was a breed of classical inspired rock fused with progressive experimental folk music, mainly acoustic based guitar and piano with operatic female vocals, occasional male lead with miss opera in the back, and very Russian classical piano providing incredible arpeggios and acoustic folk guitar laying down complex melodies, all with high art poetry set to music.  ASHES ARE BURNING continued the same only with more acoustic guitar atmospherics provided by Dunford who had “returned” to the main fold of the group as a co-leader.Renaissance, in the opinion of many, including myself, were the best of the classical music inspired prog rock bands, chief among them Yes and Emerson Lake & Palmer.  Of the three, Renaissance far outshined by simple virtue of their ability to remain so consistent from song to song and album to album through no less than five perfect 5-Star deserved rated albums from PROLOGUE through NOVELLA.  Annie Haslam’s vocals are beyond great, and without her the band would have been terrific, but she brought an insane beauty to what was already near perfect in sound.  TURN OF THE CARDS, and SCHEHERAZADE just brought perfection to new definitions, and it all culminated in the incredibly beauteous NOVELLA.  After that, they began a slow slide into modern prog rock based light and almost “adult contemporary” music, but the whole of the 70’s belonged to Annie and company in the pinnacle of classical art progressive folk rock, at least for more than a few of us.After NOVELLA (’77), while working on A SONG FOR ALL SEASONS, their record company released a double album budget fare called IN THE BEGINNING.  This was in 1978 long before the advent of CDs were even thought of by the public or producers.  Hard core Renaissance fans who had played the heck out of their vinyl LPs, to the point of some major groove wear, and dust grinding, needed replacements for their early Renaissance albums and this release looked entirely promising!  No there were no times listed on the back cover, just the original lineup of songs in proper order from PROLOGUE and ASHES ARE BURNING, the songs were even broken out on the cover with the original album titles so you thought you were getting both LPs released as a double set anew.  Okay, so one quickly found trouble on two major fronts.  However, the reviewer(s) who have quoted missing times are greatly exaggerated (yet no less frustrating) and the premise that this CD was released this way and execs needed to be called and bashed in the 80’s is entirely fruitless since this CD is a release of the original double LP as it was released in 1978, and if the exec said it was for the fans, he probably thought so with all integrity and was most likely unaware that IN THE BEGINNING was already a sour note from a decade before!If you are a new comer and can purchase this for a low price to satisfy your curiosity, it will not hurt in the slightest to pick this up.  I did just so I could have “something” before the remastered CD’s of the original releases came out (which I bought as it happened), but I have hung on to this CD and listened to it from time to time just as a filler in my car or office computer and there is nothing harmful or obdurate about it.  As a cheapie for the novice it is actually a perfect introduction (though I would still steer you immediately to the original releases 1st).  What is “wrong” with it is this, you do the math yourself and then if you read reviews here or at the all music guide, you will be forearmed with the truth.  The last song on PROLOGUE, Rajah Khan, had a heavy electric guitar introduction before the entire group started up the song proper.  The song was 11:31 on the original vinyl album and is that long on the CD release.  On IN THE BEGINNING it is 8:57 missing the guitar intro and fading out just a hair early.  Missing just about 2 and  minutes, almost all of that was the guitar intro.  It is sad for those of us in the know, but it hardly constitutes damage for a “sampler”.  Finally, the title track and last song on ASHES ARE BURNING, thought by some to be their finest moment, though I believe it marks the line between the era of “finding themselves” and “achieving perfection”, has an early fade out during another electric guitar solo (though this time it is a lead solo during group performance, and it hurts somewhat more than the other faux pas).  ASHES on vinyl LP and CD is 11:20, and IN THE BEGINNING fades it out to end at 9:29 or about a minute and 20 seconds early.  That minute and almost a half was a lot of nice guitar work, but don’t pay attention to these over exaggerators who say there are five and six minutes missing from these songs.What I do not get, to this day, is why the record company re-released both LPs as a double and cut the length of the songs to begin with, since there was no time constraint issue.  There has never been a satisfactory answer and never will be.  However, to rub salt into the wound and give a Renaissance album release on CD one star is a bit much and for me, all their original studio albums are 5 star affairs of beauty and enrichment, so a compilation which has inherent defects due to an original defect should not penalized so heavy.  The sound of this CD is just as good as most 90’s released material, in fact better than most, and you don’t have to crank up your stereo to hear it as you do many things from this era.  My complaint is that most remastered CDs are too loud and we lose the peaks and valleys from our music.Judge for yourself and decide if you want to pick this up at a bargain price from some third party seller, or spend more and get those 5 fantabulous albums which will be listened to over and over once you lay your ears on them.  Renaissance was one of the most beautiful progressive rock groups to ever plant their trees in our yards.  Their vocals were beautiful beyond my beloved Moody Blues and Mamas & Papas, their instrumental craft better than other progressive rock or folk acts from any era, including the “classically trained” ones, and the sum of their work had 5 or 6 albums which are entirely perfect in musical execution.  Beware!  The three albums which followed these two are even monumentally better than these!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B43TNQ3LPHGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DQX5#wasThisHelpful","R3B43TNQ3LPHGM","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SKIN is Melissa Etheridge’s HARVEST.  There are more than a handful of artists who make a somewhat career out of moping, and very few of those are good at it.  Depression can be a great artistic herald (ie. Vincent Van Gogh) and send others running fast as they can to get away.  Take Rod McKuen poetry set to music on record.  Hmmm.  That takes a very special mood.  But Neil Young probably made the best ever self-flagellating album in HARVEST and there are only a few hard-hearted critics who may try to shoot that down, it is one of the preeminent albums in history and in the top 10 certainly of folk-rock history.  In 2001, ME gave us SKIN, an epic which must stand side by side with HARVEST in being both a triumphant work of art, and a soul-baring autobiographical tour of open-veined emotion.  I’ve listened to this on and off for about 14 years now.  When the mood strikes, it is easy to play this and that gold paper bag colored one back to back.  Wow.  Now Neil had The Stray Gators to back him up on most of his myopic tour, one which would garner him astounding praise, but Melissa has unfortunately not gained that same critical evaluation, especially from something so personal, honest, and displaying of so much raw unplanned talent.  She virtually plays every instrument but the drums on the entire album (save one track with Manning jr on keys).  This is a lonely gut-wrenching testament with so much inner beauty about to burst forth, any Etheridge fan who passed this over has got to be blind.As much as I love YES I AM, and her eponymous debut, wild crashing rock-heaven and soul –churners both of them, this one, for me, holds a special place, sometimes above them.  In the 1960’s rock had two true femme voices: Slick and Joplin.  We lost one and the other joined the Prog fray alongside ladies like Anne Wilson and then Pat Benatar into the 80’s.  The 70’s only had Anne and Nancy Wilson, really, as vocal chops were concerned.  Yes, Carly and Carole, and Joni lead us through those times as well, but they weren’t gut-wrenching power-punching sirens like Janis and Grace.  Pat Benatar was the next true siren, for at least two decades, but... We needed a formidable warrior again in the women’s camp, and in 1988 Melissa not only rocked our socks off, she stuffed them into our (men’s) mouths and that girl can not only sing, but she’s a class act songwriter too, so full of talent it drips from her fingertips and lips.  By 2000 AD, Melissa had laid down a half dozen primo blues-rock classics fully laden with everything from woeful folk tunes to down and dirty in your face power rock.  Since the release of this Etheridge Ripped Open classic, she has really only gotten better and better, like a fine wine, what more can you ask?  But if you take SKIN as the crossroads, the point in time and place in her life where she either gave up the ghost, sold her soul to the devil, or moved on down the line with her chin surely set up and straight ahead, you will find this to be the most rewarding sharing you can ever do with an artist.  You share the journey, the pain, the fatal last look at a possible tomb, and then you share revelations of forgiveness and healing.Melissa would face more tragedy in short order, cunningly the evil one laid that trap upside her only after she finally found some great happiness and released the album LUCKY after this one.  But the trooper marches on in our lives and she stands up and sings for everyone, not just for herself.  Melissa Etheridge is selfless, she is as modest and shy as any artist we will ever find, but she has beliefs, she has compassion, she has philanthropy, and she stands up to champion those who cannot for themselves.  It is here in this testament of her own will that you can find the inner strength, the inner beauty, and the inner turmoil that makes up one of the greatest living artists of the music industry.  Don’t pass over SKIN, it is there for touching, that is why she made it, so you can feel what she feels, and so that she can feel us through her music.Thanks Melissa, I am so very glad you shared this with us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3UDS7U0TGRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005LODB#wasThisHelpful","R1O3UDS7U0TGRN","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you who missed out on either Progressive Rock 101 or American History in college, the cover of Kansas’ eponymously titled debut album is from the famous John Steuart Curry mural which can be found painted on the wall of the Topeka Kansas State Capitol building.  The mural depicts John Brown holding the Bible (with Alpha & Omega) in one hand and a rifle in the other.  Brown was what some consider the nations first domestic “terrorist” though that is arguably disputed.  He was, for all intents and purposes, a militant abolitionist who took up arms against slavery and with a band of followers, was willing to commit murder and acts of rebellion for his cause.  John Brown was right in his beliefs but wrong in his actions to promote those beliefs.  From this famous mural, we get a sense of what Kansas, the band, are all about.  They were both a harmony and a dichotomy.  Especially on this album.  Some of their music is outright boogie rock from the schools of JJ Cale, Humble Pie, and Savoy Brown.  But the other half of the equation is classic 70’s art/prog rock.  This sets up an unusual balance on their early albums, especially this one and SONG FOR AMERICA (which in my opinion are the best Kansas albums to own).If you are uninitiated into the Kansas cult, on this album you will start off with that boogie rock stuff: “Can I Tell You”, Bringing It Back” (JJ Cale), then settle into a beautiful acoustic ballad “Lonely Wind” (more profound and prettier than Dust In The Wind from a few years hence); then back into a hard edged boogie prog rock vehicle called “Belexes” which pretty much starts the whole Progressive journey through the rest of the album, complete with sophomoric spiritual lyrics and messages from the exploratory consciousness of the mid-70’s.  Do I sound rather cynical towards an album I have rated so highly?  Well yes really, and intentionally so.  We were all young once, naïve with inclinations to spread hope and positive vibes, and we should be so now.  Lyrically, Kansas is from the same mold and motif of many of that era’s musicians.  This album manages to hold on to a greater contrast and mutual respect between the music and lyrics, as well as between the Middle American Pride and the Counter-Culture Spirituality.  On the following SONG FOR AMERICA, the title track continues the thought process of this albums closer, an ecological message, but the musicianship raises up to the kind of music Yes was producing, especially on the YES ALBUM (Starship Trooper, All Good People) and it is pretty evident just from KANSAS that they are heading that way immediately.  Lyrically though, they are not nearly as cryptic as Yes, nor do they ever venture into that enigmatic code process.Kansas ends up being a band which appeals to both liberals and conservatives, right-wingers and leftists, and they have always managed to straddle the line of both political and spiritual philosophies.  Therefore, they are essentially the perfect Middle American band.  You do not have to be over-educated in The Arts to “get” Kansas.  You do not need to know that “Journey From Mariabronn” smells suspiciously like Hermann Hesse’s Narcissus and Goldmund” or that “Apercu” (and Belexes before it) uses motifs from Puccini’s Turandot.  What you need to know is that Kansas IS heavily invested in the classical influenced sounds of 70’s prog-rock, lots of arpeggios, triplets, and time signature changes.  There is ELP, Yes, and Genesis influences galore, but the difference is that there is a subtle likeability to Kansas music which is not present in those others.  The root of Kansas’ music is that over-arching feeling of Heartland Rock which is definitively and distinctly present in their music, and much of that comes from Steinhardt’s violin which is always weaving itself in and around the music, bringing a wonderful gutsy sound to what would otherwise be just another prog-rock band we all listened to and shelved in the 80’s.  Let’s be frank, instrumental solos are not the forte of Kansas, and is obviously missing from this band’s music, instead relying on grand group ensemble playing, but this is exactly what makes them terrific at what they do and represents Kansas the band, and Kansas the state, in the best light.(caveat to that last statement, there IS a rather nice drum solo in the final track of SONG FOR AMERICA).If you are not “new” to Kansas but decidedly want to replace your vinyl records with CD’s after all these years, I have to steer in one of two directions.  Either pick up the modestly priced recent “Classic” box (first 5 LP’s with bonus tracks in mini LP sleeves housed in a cheap advertising card-stock box) which has all the recent remasters (remastered too loud for my tastes, cutting off the peaks at both ends) or (best decision) get at least KANSAS and SONG FOR AMERICA in the original 1990 Kirshner label reissue but it get the Japanese import version (it was pressed by Sony Japan) as these have the cleanest original sound, comparable with the original LP engineering.  They sound pristine with all the analogue notes perfectly preserved.  You can find them inexpensively enough from third party sellers on Amazon, just be sure to inquire with the seller if it is the “made in Japan” version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QDTUEWKNCEZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GMWN4#wasThisHelpful","R3QDTUEWKNCEZE","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the evolution of what came to be called (affectionately) “California Rock” and/or “California Country”, there were a number of hidden and not so hidden faces behind The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, James Taylor...  Some of these were JD Souther, Kenny Edwards, Andrew Gold, Wendy Waldman, and some studio talent like the incredible Waddy Watchel who managed to show up on more than a few of these artists albums.  Quietly accompanying all of them was Karla Bonoff, seemingly peeking out from the shadows, enough to pen three songs on one #1 hit album by Linda Ronstadt, the singer she is most often compared with.  But Karla was anything but hiding in the shadows, she was just overlooked in plain sight, and all of the aforementioned artist knew and respected her.At 16, in 1967, she and her sister had already demo’d and cut an album under Bruce Botnick (The Doors) at Elektra.  Unfortunately that disappeared into Neverland, her sister became a teacher and Karla wandered off to hang around The Troubadour and make friends with the artists listed above.  With Kenny, Andrew, and Wendy, Karla formed Bryndle (which would be revived in the 90’s), which at the time was compared to The Mamas & The Papas but more progressive along the lines of The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac (the revitalized California Fleetwood Mac).  Obviously ahead of their time, the recordings didn’t make a big hit and Bryndle broke up, but not before attracting much needed attention on all four members.  Kenny and Andrew went with Linda as The Stone Poneys, Wendy and Karla began illustrious songwriting.  Linda loved Karla’s songs and once she was a solo hit maker, Karla would get more attention from Linda who already had eyes on Karla’s material, and they would become long time friends.  ""Someone to Lay Down Beside Me,"" ""If He's Ever Near"" and ""Lose Again"" enriched the fabulous HASTEN DOWN THE WIND album in ’76, enough so that Columbia approached Karla to make her own album, along with much the same musicians and talent that went into HASTEN DOWN THE WIND.KARLA BONOFF was released in ’77, produced by none other than old friend Kenny Edwards.  I Can’t Hold On became a hit single, and in my old home town of Seattle, it was a #1 hit in the Pacific Northwest market.  Now she was opening for James Taylor and Jackson Browne, getting tons of exposure, and hey, folks noticed that girl could sing!Karla has some terrific albums, all of which have their own magic, but for many fans, this album, KARLA BONOFF was the special one which grabbed us first and holds first place in our hearts.  She may not sing with the “power” that Ronstadt had in their day, but many often like her pleasantly more so because of that.  Her voice is beautiful, like a breath of fresh air, like birdsong in a tree grove, it relaxes, it does not use special runs or vocal exercises, it is down to earth, folksy, and just plain likeable to loveable.  Her songwriting is equally beautiful, with all the right metaphors in all the right places, it reaches the heart without need for distillation.Her solo albums and her Bryndle works in the 90’s are some of the best and most beautifully poetic albums out there.  If you are “familiar” with Karla and wondering where to start, this is the logical spot and actually is the best place to start.  If you are new convert because of Bryndle or by way of some other vector, take this, KARLA BONOFF, and you will soon be on the road to RESTLESS NIGHTS, WILD HEART OF THE YOUNG, and NEW WORLD.Every song on this album is delicately poignant, whether it is a slow and low piano centric love ballad, or a more gut-digging lament with Waddy bending the guitar strings on the rosewood neck.  The songs are pure, full of heart, and timeless in their relativity to humanity, to womankind, and to the love-struck.  This music is not rock, it is not country, and you really cannot even call it “pop” without an argument, so let’s just call it Karla and let it be that.  Try some Karla on for size, she is perhaps one of the top five contenders for most underappreciated artist in the history of music.  She should have been a superstar, but maybe it is for the better this way.  She still tours and there is still plenty of Karla to go around for everyone who discovers her.Be sure you purchase the Columbia CD which says “Digitally remastered for Compact Disc by Joe Gastwirt at Digital Magnetics”, the sound engineering is perfect, the volume levels are perfect (no loudness, no lost lows), and the warmth of vinyl is still present.  I don’t know about the BMG release, but they are usually good.  The SBME Special Markets release sounded tinny to me and I replaced my copy recently with the 1990’s Columbia release and boy am I happy!  Look for it from 3rd party sellers at the top of the page under “new and used”.  Query the seller to be sure you are getting the release version you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10107OW32MQ4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GMZGS#wasThisHelpful","R10107OW32MQ4D","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Led Zeppelin and Peter Grant formed their own private label (under the umbrella of their parent company Atlantic), their first release on the label was not a Led Zeppelin album.  That honor went to the newly formed “super group” Bad Company (June 15th, 1974).  Why “super group”?  Bad Company was formed by two ex-members of Free (Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke), Mott The Hoople’s killer guitarist Mick Ralphs, and King Crimson’s uber-bass maestro Boz Burrell.  These three groups were high class acts in the UK with a solid following in the USA.  The product of these four talents together formed a whole sound which was greater than the sum of the parts.  There are some arguments amongst fans as to which is the best Bad Company album, but in sales figures, this debut outshined all later albums, and most critics agree this was an astounding “Debut” from some such an assembly of rock veterans.  STRAIGHT SHOOTER, which followed (also being released as a deluxe remaster) was quite good and only sold a fraction less and slipped one notch on the charts to just barely equaling BAD COMPANY.  From there, each subsequent release sold less well.  I believe that was because this album, the self-titled BAD COMPANY worked on every level possible as a perfect album release.The most amazing factoid of BAD COMPANY is that every single one of the 8 total original tracks has either charted as a hit single, or has been a classic rock staple on FM radio ever since its release.  One song, the bluesy Ready For Love, was actually guitarist Mick Ralphs’ and was previously recorded by Mott The Hoople on All The Young Dudes.  Every composition and recording is simply a perfect track, highly worthy of setting up this album as the initial Swan Song release and deserving of every heap of praise garnered by a Led Zeppelin album.  The songs are pulse pounding Rock Steady numbers and include not only blues-rock-centric classics but a gospel-tinged ballad (Don’t Let Me Down) and an acoustic lyrical gem (Seagull).In addition to the remastered original album release (with fantastic engineering easily equaling the deluxe remaster releases of the Zeppelin catalogue), the bonus disc has some choice material as well:Superstar Woman (released as a re-recorded track on Paul Rodgers solo Cut Loose album, this is the original recording for the debut album which was not included).  It would have fit well on STRAIGHT SHOOTER but never managed to get included there either.Little Miss Fortune was the B-Side of Can’t Get Enough, not a bad track but it was obviously not good enough for BAD COMPANY.  Here it sits nicely as a bonus track.Easy On My Soul was an original Free track (featuring Paul Rodgers of course) from the Heartbreaker LP (’73), here it was re-recorded by Bad Company and was the B-Side to Movin’ On.  Solid as a bonus track but lacking the fortitude for the original LP.Of the alternate takes, demos, and LMS Studio session takes, the demos are interesting, the alternate sessions are more than interesting (fun to listen to), but as with the expanded Led Zeppelin deluxe packages, the real magic is in the remaster of the original LP.  This is a solid entry into the new Led Zeppelin/Swan Song catalogue releases, and worth every penny of your purchase.  Boomers and older fans will obviously be the largest market, but new listeners who have found an ear for classic rock cannot go wrong with this classic blues-based rock album, one of the finest ever produced and now tweaked even better with modern engineering.  The saddest part of the Bad Company story is that each album successively got weaker after this monster debut, but STRAIGHT SHOOTER is also available as a remastered deluxe package and was a worthy followup with Good Lovin’ Gone Bad, Feel Like Makin’ Love, and the epic Shooting Star.  Some even consider it a “better” album but the sales figures and chart position slipped just a tad and most fans agree BAD COMPANY is the best BC album with SS running a close second.  After that is was a slow but steady downhill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17OJY3RSS48KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8RIO36#wasThisHelpful","R17OJY3RSS48KM","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just HAD to have this set.  I am not a Dead Head.  Nor am I a “casual fan” of some of their hits.  If you fall into similar category, this is the set for you.  I had four Grateful Dead albums in my original vinyl collection: AMERICAN BEAUTY, of course The Album to own of theirs; then WHAT A LONG STRANGE TRIP IT’S BEEN a double LP, the best compilation album they took an active hand in releasing, a solid collection of what The Dead considered to be their best studio and live material; TERRAPIN STATION, a progressive rock turning point for the band and what I consider to be their best overall sounding album ever; and finally the oft-maligned SHAKEDOWN STREET, somewhat of an (at the time) urban R&B influenced adventure.  These four albums covered all of the styles of the two decades of original GD material and were all that was needed for a cross-genre loving something-more-than-casual fan.This new double disc, and for the umpteenth time entitled “The Best Of..” release is perfect for one such as me.  It is arranged conveniently in chronological order, covers almost the entire Great Garcia period over multiple labels (thank you Rhino), and hallelujah! It has the entire Terrapin Station suite, unedited and unabridged.  The engineering/mastering is superb!  Pristine!  Immaculate!  If only WEA could have come up with a less used titled.Now you can ride along with Captain Trips on his long strange journey from acid folk-rock tales through San Francisco laid-back acoustical Americana, through non-traditional experimental jazz-rock-improvisations, through art-rock/prog-rock symphonics, through Lowell George’s Little Feat influenced R&B, and on into the 80’s culminating in modernized but soft around the edges arena rock messages and anthems like Throwing Stones.  It is 50 Years folks, and how appropriate to release this now!THE BEST OF THE GRATEFUL DEAD really gives you an in-depth, without drowning, submerging into the music of one of the most celebrated and cultish bands in the history of music.  Their offspring is enormous, their influence insurmountable.  Garcia, along with Kantner and Slick of the Airplane were the royalty of the Haight-Ashbury scene and the three of them often worked together on many projects, melding the two bands into a brief Golem which produced forerunners of the Progressive Rock movement.Disc One will set you right up in the counterculture of the 60’s, blow you like a leaf in the wind across the American Beauty which is the folk-rock-Americana movement of Dylan and Arlo, right into the medium-is-the-message era of early 70’s art.  You will catch wisps of everything from Baez to Pink Floyd on the trip and be able to stop and smell the roses (American Beauties no less) along the way.Disc Two starts off really heady, Dead Heady, with their penultimate symphonic rock composition (Terrapin Station is nothing less than epic modern Homerian poetry, a mythos of grand proportions), then you get a tour of 70’s urban decay, and then what can only be called sociopolitical lessons in the era of Reganomics and The Iron Lady.As is usual with Rhino, a lot of good remastering work goes into the production, I have yet to be displeased with a Rhino engineering job (with only a few exceptions where the source material is wholly compromised and then it is as good as it gets).  The HDCD sound here is the best yet of any Dead album I have heard on CD!If this is not your brand of ear-candy, then skip it, but if you want to take a long strange trip back with me, get this and stay away from the other three BEST OF THE GRATEFUL DEAD releases which are both insignificant and lack-luster compared with this one.  For the young, repressed, or those who just plain “missed it”, you should at least dip your toe into this water.  Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Jefferson Airplane/Starship, Donovan, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd; there is just one more name missing from this group of artist who literally changed the landscape of music in the 60’s.  Add The Grateful Dead to the list and you have the murderer of “the music” on the day the music died.  These are the artists who started it all, a ball rolling which is actually still rolling today, it’s just that no one today wants to push it in another direction.  We need a positive force to change it, something like The Grateful Dead would do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192J7WBAG15GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5OCXSC#wasThisHelpful","R192J7WBAG15GT","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The review as written is below, This is an UPDATE due to the curious and sometimes spurious reviews which have been thus far posted and due to the comments added to this review (you should read them for more facts.  Fact of the matter is that there is considerable debate as to whether or not these albums in this box set are actually remastered or not.  The result of three other people besides myself, who have purchased this set and been able to compare it with some of the previous releases and remasters, is that this box set is indeed remastered once again, and the sound IS better, clearer, and lacking previous defects (loudness, distortion, etc).  As well, there is sufficient overseas (European) information on this release to verify that the label did indeed remaster these albums, something which has been lacking in the press releases of our side of the Atlantic.  Please don't be swayed by some of the caustic reviews and comments posted here, I can honestly attest that I DID NOT waste my money on a sham release designed to part me with my green leaves..............................................................................................................The Bee Gees began their career as an English folk-rock-ballad company, somewhat of a twist on The Beatles who were the standard for gold in 1967.  Their amazing harmonies breakthrough was quickly identified and unique on songs like The New York Mining Disaster, To Love Somebody, and on up through classics like Lonely Days, and How Can You Mend A Broken Heart in 1972.  By ’73 through early ’74 however, The Bee Gees had started to tail spin with flunking singles that failed to chart well, if at all.  In 1974, they served up a new dish a la Ahmet Ertegun (their Atlantic label executive) and with the help of Robert Stigwood.Teamed up with soul music producer Arif Mardin, The Bee Gees recorded and released MR. NATURAL which toned down the balladeering and made a few baby steps into the R&B direction.  Not a great success by any measure it did prove to be a major turning point for the band and is represented here in the first disc.  Charade, Throw A Penny, and the title track are really the best tracks on the album (though Dogs is also a standout) and are often found on “best of” compilations.  One is always of a mind to compare MR. NATURAL with the Philly Soul sound of Hall & Oates.In 1975, Eric Clapton guided his RSO label mates, the brothers Gibb, to Miami for their next recording adventure, where he was actively having much success on his own from those studios.  The Bee Gees headed straight away to rent 461 Ocean Boulevard, get a tan, and record the fantastic MAIN COURSE (which IMO should be considered their best 70’s album, it prefigures “disco”, has excellent pure R&B musicianship, and their most creative vocals).  You will find some folk-ish tunes, Songbird, and Come On Over (made into a hit by Olivia Newton John).  Many will find Wind Of Change to be the best song on the album and in fact it makes a perfect trilogy with Nights On Broadway and Jive Talkin’.  Songbird IS a beautiful tune, Fanny a solid hit single, Country Lanes a typical BG Ballad, and Edge Of The Universe is another terrific pop-rocker.  MAIN COURSE is the definitive encapsulation of what made the Bee Gees great in the 70’s.  It is not hyper-disco over-the-top glitter ball music, but an even-handed adventurous Pop-R&B masterpiece.Disc 3, CHILDREN OF THE WORLD is where the disco legacy takes off and disc 4, SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN is where the brothers reached their apex in the genre.  Nothing at all wrong with these albums, you just have to be definitely “in the mood” for that era.  Disc 5 collects the singles (A and B sides) and songs from Saturday Night Fever (of course).  It is unfair to type-cast these albums as “disco” as there are other quality tracks which are neither disco nor R&B, but the over-arching sellability of these during that period was indeed the dance magic and the trademark falsettos which were brought to the table.  CHILDREN OF THE WORLD works as a follow-up to MAIN COURSE, but SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN seems somehow flawed, even when this was the pinnacle of their success.  What is missing, is the other brothers.  Barry is now lead vocal on nearly everything with Robin and Maurice supplying “most” of the backing (even some backing vocals are Barry over-dubs).Disc 5 is just pure fun, and needed for those who want to cover this period with all of the studio tracks.  The one item missing is the single Long Version of You Should Be Dancing which tones down the vocals and ups the ante on musicianship.The sound quality on these discs is nothing short of terrific.  My last compilation of The Bee Gees was the 4-disc set TALES FROM THE BROTHERS GIBB which is comfortably remastered but not to the quality of these.  Audio levels are not “loudness wars” and engineering is beautiful.  You get thumping without baridroning, you get crisp clear highs which don’t make the dogs howl, and the atmosphere is enveloping.  Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RED4619O6BZ48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKFJMCY#wasThisHelpful","RED4619O6BZ48","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With War you have to remember that they were two things:  War was a “Platinum Jazz” group which fused together every available genre of the late 60’s and early 70’s into a gumbo of artistic freedom rarely seen from other contemporaries of the period.  War was also a Billboard chart topping Soul/R&B act with all of these hit “singles”.  As the title implies, The Hits is a compilation of the Singles (with the exception of Spill The Wine which is the only full length version on this disc), and since the CD does not indicate the track times at all, neither on the back list nor inside the skimpy insert, one will not know this until after purchase.  It IS rather disappointing to not get the full length versions of Slippin Into Darkness, The World Is A Ghetto, and Gypsy Man as these were my personal favorites among their jazzy funk jams.  This is especially true when one realizes that the CD is barely 50 minutes long with near 29 minutes to spare for added length on tunes.  I had all the original vinyl LP’s and reviving that set in CD would be costly (but to be sure I will work on it as time goes by) so if you are in my shoes, expect the worst and be happy with the singles for now.For the unfamiliar contemplating this adventure in retro music, here is what to expect.  Lyrically, as with many 70’s classic rock artists, the songs often take on a “socio-political” stance.  The music has been called “laid-back California funk vibe” which does not mete out justice.  They were funk-rock, jazz, latin-rock, rhythm’n blues, with a splash of Jamaica-Mon thrown in for good measure.  They were a transcendental cross-racial multi-ethnic line-up from 4 continents surrounding the Atlantic ocean and the music appealed literally to everybody who had ears and two foot-tapping feet.I got my copy for five bucks at the blue box store when Amazon still was selling it for three dollars more, but now they have lowered the price to equivalent, so if you are totaling up enough for that free shipping, go ahead and get this (barring your need for the REAL War albums) or just drop by Wally World and pick one up for the change in your pocket.  I only give it Three Stars for the already stated disappointment in skimpiness, but if you just want some car stereo jams and want to enjoy some funked up jazz-rock hit singles from your youth, or while you are IN your youth, then by all means, call this one a good investment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AXNBKC0RQNA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043ISH8C#wasThisHelpful","R2AXNBKC0RQNA6","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with the same release of Best Of The Guess Who, I am rather disappointed with the resulting surround sound quality and mix. I should have left this one alone too, but it was in my box store and I have been ""Experimenting"" with these releases lately.  It still seems to me that certain ""progressive rock"" albums were meant to be quad and others not and a recent indulgence in some classic rock artists, like The Guess Who and the Best Of Bread album before you now, has vented a whole new crop of Quad releases (even if they were never released as quadraphonic albums in their day).Despite this original album release dating back to 1973, it is now dated and not the ""best"" compilation you can find. If you are not so much interested in a rather sub-par surround album as you are in having a good sounding CD release of Bread's best tunes, you need to consider the Elektra (and later Rhino remaster) release of Anthology with 20 career spanning singles, a much more involved and better sounding compilation. The stereo analogue to digital transfer is beautiful, the remastering equally magnificent, and the song selection includes all of these doubled with every fan favorite track off of all of their albums.Now if you are interested as a ""collector"" then you might just want these limited and numbered releases. So evaluate your requirements before deciding to plunk down double the cost of another product you might find more fully satisfying. The one is strictly for collectors and mad enthusiasts of Bread, a group which defined the soft rock genre.It would have been far better to at least attempt to do this with Anthology, if not with the limited 6 album output of Bread.  Yes this album had its moment in the sun but again, there is a far better Best Of collection out there to attempt a multichannel experiment on.  In fact the gentleman reviewer who claims missing 8 songs, including Aubrey, is actually thinking of the Anthology release, since this one originally came out before Guitar Man (album).If you are a neophyte to SACD quadraphonic albums, this might sound great to you.  If you compare it to other releases which were actually recorded and engineered for Quad release in the 70's you will find distinct short comings.  And if you compare it to some incomparable ones like Dark Side Of The Moon, failings become readily apparent.  In the end, you must decide the value and trade off.  I was a little disappointed, but I have Anthology to go to for fulfillingness and this one for a slight pleasure of surround sound.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MCB9U69BMBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S2SYRHO#wasThisHelpful","R13MCB9U69BMBW","APPV1ZDETO7B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APPV1ZDETO7B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this story of Jared, at first he kind of reminded me of Simon because he stalks Mara. In fact, Jared was just like Simon, he would do do anything for Mara. I wish I could give this book, more the five stars...How the book starts, Jared is stalking Mara he finds her crying he goes to here and try's and make her feel better. Well after that we see Jared and Mara spending allot of time together, Jared is telling Mara all this stuff he want to do to her sexual things, she doesn't want to believe him because he is a ladies man, but something happens and Mara turns to Jared for support and comfort. This book is great, there is fun flirty scenes, hot loving scenes. We see Jared and Mara come to life in each page, of course we see the rest of the Sinclair's... This book is a must read, you will love it....I am not going to ruin it for you, but this is a must read.... I Can't wait for the next book Evan's book.

"This is a great little storage unit for all your pets' toys.  Whether it is toys, squeakies, balls, blankets, pillows, leashes, water bottles, etc., this is the place to store them.  The wicker basket is well made, strong, neutral color, and spacious.There is a latch that works well, keep it open or closed.  The wicker is tough, stable and a tight weave.If you have a pet with toys and what nots,  more than one, you can store everything in one place!

"I guess money belts are becoming more high-tech to prevent thefts.  Apparently, this one is designed to protect  against electronic pickpocketing and identity theft.  And that is where the belt compartments are lined.  And according to the product page, it is RFID protected.I do not know what RFID protection is, and there is no definition on the catalog page.  However, if it is protected against electronic thefts, then that is one good reason to purchase this,  especially if you travel abroad!There are several pockets and an inner pockets for easy access to credit cards.  The zippers pull easily, especially with the aid of the zipper ribbon pulls.Also, one pocket, the length of the belt is located in the backside.  It would be great for airline tickets, but keep in mind that it is not easy to get to that pocket if you are wearing the belt.  But, yes, that long pocket is very useful for tickets.My only concern about this Protection-Lined material is that it is hard, not soft.  It has the propensity to get sweaty under the clothes.  When it is heavier, it is not as flexible underneath clothes.But, for the protection of your cards, it may be beneficial to use this, figure out how to use it without interference and how to use it comfortably.  That is up to you....

"Anybody who does yoga, knows that your clothes must be flexible for those challenging poses.  These shorts are very comfortable, lightweight, and the stretch is perfect.  There is a thick waistband and, if the waistband is not enough support, there is a drawstring.  The waistband is a couple inches, and, what is good is it has three line stitching.  This means the waistband will not go wonky!  It is secure!I do other exercises in these shorts too, so, they are perfect workout shorts.  This is not polyester,  it is  87% Nylon and 13% Spandex.

"If you are used to the regular shower heads that are mostly used, you will like this rainfall effect  I love that it is 8"" wide spray of water.  The water completely covers you.  The pressure is good.What I also like is that this is stainless steel, very very thin, and lightweight.  It is easy to install, doesn't take much.  I also like that this is simply one type of spray.  I don't need various pulsating sprays;  I just like it to be 'full""  and with the 8"" it is wide.Very nice spray!  The polished chrome should fit the decor of almost any bathtub/shower stall.

"The Bugzi Stroller Hooks are not only great for strollers, but any other device where you need to ""hang"" an object.  The hooks are thick, well made, and with a sturdy velcro that goes over a bar.I used these on my mother's rollater.

You can spread it for two hooks, or, you can create a stronger hook by closing this hook to make one.I keep this for my nephew's visit to the home.  Taking him to the retail stores with a stroller, always creates a need to hang things, bags, water bottles, gadgets, purses, coats, snack bags, toy bags, etc.And, one of the neater things is to hang this in a closet for hats, pats, umbrellas, glasses, etc, etc.These are strong, and the gray are quite inconspicuous.

"What I especially like about this wallet, is that it is small enough to fit in a regular purse.  But, it is also large enough to carry as a wallet/purse...for the times when you just when you do not want to carry a complete bag around.I can pop my phone in here, ipod, etc and with all my credit cards, cash, I can walk around places, without having to lug a purse.  The purse measures close to 8"" in length x 4"" high.  It is patent leather, meaning, it always maintains the beautiful shine.  You can use this formally,  or very casually.  It works both ways.What is also a good feature is the carrying strap.  This is wide enough, you don't have to scrunch to get your arm through.  When I go into a large store, I always fear leaving my bag, so I just pop this on my arm and it stays!There are two compartments, with zippers that flow easily.  The zippers have small metal pulls, making it easy to grab!  One side of the wallet is for the credit cards.  Each side of this credit card compartment has slots for the cards,  and.....  two spots to place dollar bills, without folding them.The other side is where you can place a cell phone, ipod, etc.,  and there is a zipper for cash.Very attractive wallet, sufficient to hold a lot of cards, and other small necessities.

"Usually wear a small/medium in winter gloves and these latex gloves fit perfect. They fit really snug which is great when working where you need precise finger movement and don't have slack at the tips. They are really nice and thick so you know they will over protection as well and won't rip or get a whole when bumping your hand on somewhat of a sharp object.

"This is an excellent trimmer. It has great battery life. I take about five to ten minutes to quickly trim and groom my beard a few times a week without charging. If for some reason the battery dies I can connect it to the power cord and still use. Other trimmers won't let you do that. You either have to charge it and unplug it when  you need to use it. Not with this one which is really convenient. It has a lot of precise adjustments you can make with attachment a or b. This version doesn't have the slide up precision trimmer but it is practically the same thing. It works just as well. The trimmer is very quiet and it feels as if it is not even on with little vibration. It has a great look and a nice and comfortable feel on your hands. Cleaning is very easy as you can use water. Just make sure to oil it after rinsing it and before use for prolonged blade life. Overall an excellent trimmer with lots of precise adjustments with just two attachments.

Sometimes I don't have enough time to have milk and cereal before heading to work and I'll use this. It is leak proof and haven't had any problems with any leaks at all. It is very easy to clean as well. Plus, it collapses after you are done to save a little space. I also use it a lot for gaucamole and chips. Keeps the chips safe and the gaucamole air tight.

My wife's car has a 1 1/4 inch receiver while my car has a 2 inch receiver. Since we both use it, it was much more convenient for me to purchase an adapter that downsized my receiver 1 1/4 inches rather than attaching and reattaching the 2 inch adapter to the rack. It is easy to adjust to fit certain bikes if needed to. On the swagman it was easy as well but the SportsRack has bigger knobs and are easier on the hands. If you need to open your trunk the center bar collapses to access your trunk with having to remove the rack entirely. All in all, this rack is great and will probably last very long. My Swagman has been on the road thousands of miles through hot deserts to heavy rain and I believe this Sportsrack will perform as well. Only upsides to the SportRack is the locking feature, the ease of use to adjust for bikes with the knobs and the extra straps to secure the bike wheels. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Install a hitch on your car if you don't have one. These are much easier to use, faster to set up and safer. I used to have a trunk rack and that was a pain each time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR0CTR8R023KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8K9S4Y#wasThisHelpful","RR0CTR8R023KO","A3DOPYDOS49I3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DOPYDOS49I3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are so much fun that I even enjoyed these with my kids. These are a great alternative to legos. I think my sons were bored with the legos and these came in at the right time. The pieces are made of great materials. They don't look cheap and looks like they will last for years of play. The pieces aren't tiny either where you will loose some pieces in the carpet. Kids don't need any manuals and they just started building. Its great for their minds to use their imagination and build whatever they choose too. Although, you can build the specific designs that are included. Had to purchase a plastic bin to keep these organized and prevent them from mixing with their other toys. Overall, this a great play set for kids who love building.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20SD6HWF3TWTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBXLCTM#wasThisHelpful","R20SD6HWF3TWTO","A3DOPYDOS49I3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DOPYDOS49I3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This worked perfect for me in my garage. I have a Kicker iK501 stereo system that has excellent sound but no bluetooth. Hated having to go to the stereo to check on my texts or to make any song changes. It was either a new stereo system with bluetooth which was not gonna be cheap. This was a cheap alternative that I was able to add to my already great sounding system in the garage. The setup couldn't be any simpler. The sound coming out of my stereo is just as good or better than when it was with my aux cable. I can work in the garage and have my phone with me and change the song wireless. It has excellent range too. I've gotten inside the house and was still able to stream music.

"This a great bare bones brad nailer. It works great and hasn't jammed. Compared to my other brad nailer this gun is basic and does it well. It does have a jam free tool release and adjustable muffler. What I like about my other gun that this one does not have is dry fire lockout, depth of drive and the swivel air inlet. I used this Arrow nailer for a day and was able to live without those certain features. The gun is well built and feels solid.

"Works really well on my kids. It has a nice fragrance that is not overwhelming. One of my kids has thick hair and I can use a bit more on him than my other son who has a bit thinner hair. Works great on both of them but have to use more on my kid with thick hair. A little bit goes along way. I use about half a dime size on my kids who has thick hair. It gives him no shine which I like and style it to the side. It is not strong but keeps his hair in place for the day. I use about a 1/4 of a dime size on my other kid who has thin hair.

My skin is very sensitive and any application can irritate my skin at times. Not the case here. It washes off fairly easy with just water.

It doesn't add that much bulk to the phone although without it the phone feels good in your hands but unprotected. The privacy features are great for those who are paranoid. I am one of those and that helps with your paranoia. The other great thing about the privacy features is that it helps protect and keep the lens dust free and clean.

"This system takes a bit of patience and I wasn't expecting instant results. I opened the package as it was neatly packaged and started reading every document included. Depending on your skin tone and hair this system may or may not work for you so make sure to check that before making your purchase. An important step is to avoid sun exposure unprotected two weeks prior and two weeks after a treatment. Once you familiarize yourself with how the system functions and read the user guide you will feel much more confident in using the device. You'll have to shave the area you want to treat. There was no pain experience for me but there might be a bit for some as some have mentioned but just make sure you set the skin tone hair color setting. With time your hair will grow a bit patchy. After more treatments you will notice less and less hair. My advice is to just follow the steps and be patient. Once you are done with the treatments you can enjoy smooth hair less skin sans shaving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86X56EK6H2SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJO6DYS#wasThisHelpful","R86X56EK6H2SS","A3DOPYDOS49I3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DOPYDOS49I3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cool design and cool features. I have to get up at 5am and getting up is a pain with an alarm. Sun doesn't rise until 6:30 or so waking up while it is still dark is tough. I have heard from friends about these waku up lights. It has made getting up early way more comfortable. The clock is not that big of a nuisance for me as some are making it seem. I assume some people like to have their room completely dark to fall asleep. I need a bit of light plus some white noise in the background. Falling asleep that way makes it easier for me and the wake up light makes is much easier to wake up. I don't use the sounds or radio for alarm. I usually have my phone set but I end up waking 20 minutes into the light going on and turn my alarm off. I can wake up without having the alarm going on and waking up the roommates.

" 0:24 MinsThis is a new version of vinyl that Silhouette America is rolling out. It is wrapped in clear plastic. The old version came in a clear tube. I prefer the old version. When I first purchased my cameo I was using the Silhouette branded vinyl. Worked flawless every time. It cost me more to use Silhouette brand that I decided to save money and buy a different brand. All that did was actually waste more money since it didn't cut well and never got the right settings on my cameo to use other brands of vinyl. So, I decided to go back to Silhouette vinyl and again no problems and it worked flawless all the time. Now, Silhouette came out it a new version of vinyl. The backing paper has Aslan, some other text and grid lines. When I use if for large cuts like large letters or numbers I have no problem with most of the time. Most of the time I do work that deals with small cuts and small details. The biggest problem is when I try to remove the transfer paper from the vinyl. As I try to peel the vinyl that is masked, the backing will come along with the vinyl. I posted some photos to show what I am trying to explain. This creates a headache and slows down the work flow. I have tried tweaking the settings and changing the blade. No luck. When I was using the old vinyl from Silhouette that came in the clear tubes I never had a problem. Which is why I paid the premium of using Silhoutte since I didn't encounter problems with it. Now this new version is reminding me of the off brand vinyl I was using. I hope they bring the old version back or someone can give me some tips or settings I can try.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D234Y16VP6YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW8W4KC#wasThisHelpful","R1D234Y16VP6YG","A3DOPYDOS49I3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DOPYDOS49I3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very solid piece of equipment. Installation is super easy and the instructions made it very clear. If you have the tools the installation will be quick. If not, prepare to ask for some loaners or take a trip to the hardware store. A stud finder is not necessary but it makes installation more accurate. Once you find the studs mark the spots and drill pilot holes. Then start driving the lag screw. A ratchet makes driving the lag screw much faster too. As far as the bar goes it is a solid piece of equipment. It feels and looks strong and I am sure it will last. I am about 5' 8"" and I have no problem with headroom.

We have wood floors and they look clean but after using this vac and steam for the first time I was wrong. The vacuum is great and picks up the tiny little crumbs the kids leave behind. After steaming I looked at the pad and was amazed at how much dirt there was. After the entire floor was steamed the wood was squeaky clean. My kids were running around at one point and it sounded like I was at a basketball game. Just read the directions and you will be good to go. I always jump into using things right away but I read the manual now. Overall a great vac and steam. Worked perfect for our small floor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAFR0YXTQZZHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O24CFMQ#wasThisHelpful","RAFR0YXTQZZHD","A3DOPYDOS49I3T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DOPYDOS49I3T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a nice and cheap set for small networking job. The only great thing about this was the network tester. Everything else sort of sucks. The crimper worked a few times. If it weren't for the tester I wouldn't have any idea the cable was bad unless you hook it up and see for yourself on the network. The crimper wouldn't crimp all the pins down. The connectors sucked as well. Once you were able to crimp the pins the retainer clip wouldn't hold once plugged in to the device like the router, etc. I had to lift the clip and then plug in and hope it wouldn't pop off. This is a nice set for a small job. The only thing you will be able to wanna keep is the network tester.

"Update: The company kindly sent a second pair of scissors. Great service.This is a well made protect but I'm disappointed at how intrinsically dull the blade is. Safety wise this pair is a great option though as the scissors are injury proof. Seems like this would be far better on a short hair. On my long hair it feels like using school safety scissors from grade school 85% of the time.

"This insert shelf bust dress is a popular style lately. In past years trying to buy this style in vintage over a 26 inch waist was near impossible. Now due to the miracle of vintage reproduction it is available for most sizes. This fits like the Garden Ophelia but the fabric is lighter weight. In most other brands (Trashy Diva, PUG) the bust on this style runs smaller proportionately which is a pain if you are buxom. Kudos to Lindy Bop for actually sizing the bust up ALONG with the dress waist instead of making the shelf more or less the same size and depth as the mediums and larges. This is a great dress if you are buxom but may not work with you are not. If you aren't busty I'd say go by your waist because the dress has some stretch. If you are busty your bust will be very emphasized.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLOT69J00PDKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8PAJT6#wasThisHelpful","RLOT69J00PDKG","A1LZQMF73C3QCG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LZQMF73C3QCG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Whereas Genefique gives almost overnight results, this is a product that needs a generous application and nightly use for about a month. It is more of a skin rebuilder than refiner. I like it much better than strivectin and idealist but compared to Avon Pro-erase I don't think I'll buy retail. As a gift or if you get free samples sure, but this is hugely pricey in it's full size. The two samples I bought from the wonderful seller were VERY tiny and the applicator. Consistency is like diluted toothpaste unlike Genefigue which is like an easily absorbed serum. I'd use this at the chin area or anywhere you have repeated acne marks and dryness but I'd never use this on the cheeks or forehead. Once again, this is a superior product but if you are going to buy retail there are MUCH stronger products for the same price as visionaire like Prevage or Brazilian 30% peel.

"I am a big fan of NPR, especially Wait Wait Don't Tell me and Car Talk. I usually use TuneIn Radio as my go-to app for listening to NPR on my phone, but after finding this official NPR app I thought I'd try it out.DESIGNThe app has a very clean look with big buttons along the bottom and intuitive tabs along the top that allows for quick access to your listening history, currently playing and upcoming programs. If you click on the ""hamburger"" icon, you'll see additional features like sleep timer, feedback, donation and suggestions, which is a cool feature where the app recommends new things based on your past listening history. The overall design is minimalist and attractive, and on an almost three year old HTC One M7, the app runs smoothly with no delays or hiccups.ADD-ONS & PERMISSIONSThe permissions required by this app from my testing matches the list on the Amazon store page. They are overall harmless, including the coarse GPS location request, which is most likely used to find your local NPR station. All the read and write access to storage is most likely used for the extensive cache scheme used by the app to ensure smooth streaming. I noticed this while looking at the app size on my phone. It took up about 13MB, which isn't bad. But after about 30 min of listening, the app cache had accumulated about 38MB. I cleared this while the app was playing and it didn't show any ill effect.The only add-ons were Google mobile ads and Google analytics. I didn't encounter any ads while using the app, which was a pleasant surprise. So maybe the mobile ads module is just dormant or extraneous. The analytics module is so the developer can analyze anonymous usage patterns and tweak and adjust the app in future releases.POTENTIAL PROBLEMSThere were two issues. First, it's not clear how to exit out of the app. Pressing back doesn't do it completely, as the circle icon still shows up in my notification area. Took me a while to figure out - you have to click pause in the notification area control first to trigger the close button to show up. I hope NPR will make it easier to close in an update.Second, the app uses a lot of data. I think this is because it caches everything to ensure a smooth playback, which is great and I love it. But this might be an issue if you're on a limited data plan, which is most folks nowadays, and listening on the go using your mobile data.SUMMARYThis is a very well designed app, with a clean and attractive user interface and smooth streaming even on older devices. It's dedicated to NPR and nothing else. If you're a NPR fan, definitely check this out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QCKEEZG8FRY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015958XVS#wasThisHelpful","R3QCKEEZG8FRY6","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an avid amateur photographer, I love my Nikon DSLR and my small lens collection. I, however, hate lugging my entire setup around. I still do it, mind you, but it’s certainly no fun especially when traveling long distances via air (case in point, my recent trip to Yellowstone). So, when VicTsing reached out with a request to test out their new 3 in 1 lens kit for mobile devices, I was very intrigued. Obviously, it’s not going to match up to my Nikon setup, but it’s not supposed to be given the price point. I was excited to see if it actually can add some extra dimensions to mobile photography, since nowadays phones are probably the most accessible cameras – and you almost always have it with you, unlike the Nikon.PACKAGING AND BUILD QUALITYThe kit came in an attractive package with a color user’s manual pamphlet. The fisheye lens is in one assembly, while the wide-angle and macro are combined in series in another lens assembly. VicTsing included two clippers, which is a nice touch as it cuts down dramatically on you having to constantly screw/unscrew lenses. There’s also a nice carrying pouch. The lenses themselves are made of plastic, which is expected. The threads on the lens and clips do fit nicely, and the overall build quality is very nice – better than I expected, to be honest. The instructions aren’t 100% clear, but I was able to figure it out after playing with it for a few minutes. I mean, who reads those instructions anyway, am I right guys? Nevertheless, I’ve attached pics of the package, lenses and the instructions. Notice on the package it says it fits HTC phones – more on that later.TAKING PHOTOS AND PICTURE QUALITYI tested the lens kit on the following devices:1. HTC One M72. LG Realm3. HTC Rezound4. Apple Retina iPadThe first problem I encountered with the phones was that the clip didn’t open wide enough for the phones with their cases on. I prefer slim Seidio cases than tough Otterboxes, so I was really surprised. I ended up having to take the cases off for all the phones before I could properly clip the lenses on. Well, all except one – the HTC One M7. The clip is just not long enough to reach the camera lens on the phone. I’ve attached a pic showing the discrepancy. Basically, this led to 1/3 of the photo’s left side completely out of focus. I informed VicTsing, as at the time their Amazon product page said the kit supports HTC phones. VicTsing’s rep promptly apologized and has since removed HTC from their product page. This is still not exactly true, since it does work fine with the older HTC Rezound. Just not the One M7, and presumably M8 and M9 since their camera lens location didn’t change much.I had no problem with the iPad, even with the smart cover on.As for the photo quality… well, these are plastic lenses, so I was pleasantly surprised by the resulting photos. I am attaching normal/wide/macro/fisheye shots – hopefully they give you a good idea of the field of view and quality. It was somewhat tricky to get the lens to sit perfectly flat against the devices, since the tiniest gap will result in out of focus photos and other aberrations. I found the easiest way to align the lens with the device’s sensor is to flip the phone or ipad over and look directly through the lens.SUMMARYIn the end, I think these are fun, cool shots and the kit gives me some additional options for mobile photography. The fisheye especially can be really cool if done right. The macro is surprisingly good, but you need to have perfect lens placement and very steady hands. The price point is great, and this would definitely make for a nice little gift for the shutterbug in your life. Just keep your expectations reasonable.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"This mini “floater” - not sure if the manufacturer was aware of the name’s somewhat unfortunate connotation when in a watery environment :) – is designed to hook up to your GoPro or other waterproof devices, or really just any small item that you would want to carry into the water with you. The hook has a quick release that allows you to easily detach the camera if needed. The entire contraption seems pretty well made. I took it to the pool for testing, and indeed it was able to stay afloat while attached to my GoPro 3+ in its watertight enclosure. The bright yellow band looks nice and definitely makes it easier to spot.The strap was a bit tight for my wrist though, and I have average to probably slightly skinny wrists. On one hand, it definitely feels securely attached, which is good. But it’s tight enough to be slightly restrictive, almost like a mini blood pressure cuff right on the wrist. There is a single button can be undone, which is what I ended up doing. With it undone, it’s more of a forearm strap, which doesn’t put the camera in ideal position for taking shots, but it’s quite a bit more comfortable. For this reason alone, I think this is really more of a 3.5 stars product. Since Amazon doesn’t allow half-star ratings, I decided to round up because the product does perform exactly as described, just not as comfortable as I would expect without unbuttoning.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"This is a standard issue vacuum wine preserver. The general idea is that you can preserve an unfinished bottle of wine for a few more days by reducing the amount of oxygen the wine is exposed to, which causes oxidation. Personally, I am 50/50 on the idea, since I feel like you’re also sucking out all the flavor and essence in the process, but that’s a fun debate for another day. The pump comes with two rubber stoppers. The product is made in China, and the package is very simple with virtually no instructions. A quick google search should help if you’ve never used this before. Basically, you use a stopper to replace the cork. Then you attach the pump to the top of the stopper and start pumping. There’s no way to know when it’s “done”, since it depends on various factors like the bottle size, how much wine is left, how hard you’re pumping, and maybe the phase of the moon at the time. Okay, maybe not the last one, but you get the idea. Generally though, you’ve achieved a decent vacuum when you remove the stopper and hear a loud pop.The product itself seems decently well made. The seal between the stopper and pump was good. The pump is really just a simple air-tight tube. It’s nice that it comes with two stoppers.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"When this light bulb was first introduced by Philips back in May, it quickly became somewhat viral due to the special introductory price of just $5 - for a two pack. This was unheard of for brand new LED bulbs without any utility subsidies. I bought two packs back in June when it became available at my local Home Depot, and I was so impressed that I ended up making it the primary bulb for my whole house.DESIGNThe bulb looks like a traditional lightbulb, with an almost perfectly circular plastic enclosure on top followed by about an inch of what feels like metal stem. It's rated to produce 800 lumens while drawing 8.5W with a color temperature of 2700K, which is closest to the good old incandescent soft white. The color rendering index (CRI), which is related to how accurate colors are rendered by the light emitted by the bulb, is 80 - this is about average. The bulb's main selling point is its low price point, and this is reflected in a couple areas. First, the rated life is 10,000 hours, or about 10 years at 3 hours per day. This is roughly half of what most other LED bulbs are rated for, which is around 20~22 years or 25000 hours. Second, the light bulb feels noticeably lighter than most other comparable 60W equivalent LED bulbs. This is due to the fact that there's no elaborate heatsink design. Instead, the only heatsink I can see is the inch of metal stem. I've attached a photo comparing this bulb with three other 60W equivalent LED bulbs. The weight is actually very comparable to the Philips SlimStyle, another Philips LED bulb with emphasis on affordability.The bulb is specifically labelled to be non-dimmable, suitable for damp locations but not suitable for use in fully enclosed luminaries.ACTUAL LIGHTING & ENERGY EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCEUsing a Killawatt to verify power draw, I installed the bulb in a standard floor lamp which places the bulb facing upward in an open enclosure situation. The bulb lighted instantly - some LEDs have a slight half second delay but not here. Power draw at the outlet fluctuated between 8.0 and 8.1W - a pleasant surprise as it's actually drawing less than the rated 8.5W. The power draw remained steady, sometimes dipping to 7.9W but mainly around 8W, at 30 min/60 min/90 min/120 min. At the rated 800 lumen output, this is essentially 100lumens/watt, which is very impressive and actually beats out all the other LEDs I have in my inventory, every one of which being at least twice as expensive if not more.Touching the lightbulb while it's on further supports its low power draw performance. After three hours of continuous operation, the plastic top part is barely warm to the touch. The white metal stem is hot, but I can actually keep my fingers on the stem for about 4 seconds before it's uncomfortable enough to force me to pull away. With other bulbs, I have to pull away almost immediately from the metal heatsink stem after 3 hours of runtime. This is really encouraging, as heat is the number one cause for failure in LED bulbs.The bulb is virtually silent. In certain fixtures, such as my bathroom and one older lamp, there is a very faint buzz if I press my ear next to it, literally about one or two inches away. This was a big improvement over my other affordable Philips LED bulb - the SlimStyle. Very nice.The color temperature is 2700K. This is a potential downside for me, since I personally prefer 3000K for daily lighting. This bulb definitely looks ever so slightly yellower compared to my 3000K bulbs. But at its price point, this is something I can overlook.The other potential shortcoming is that it's not rated for use in fully enclosed light fixtures. The main reason for this is most likely heat dissipation. Surprisingly, none of my other vastly more expensive 60W equivalent LED bulbs are rated for use in fully enclosed fixtures, including all the other bulbs shown in the attached photo. The only LED bulb in my inventory that's rated for fully enclosed fixtures is the FEIT 40W equivalent at 7.5W which I bought from my local Costco's through an utility subsidy. Therefore, I can't really hold it against this bulb - just be aware if you have fully enclosed fixtures, they might adversely affect this bulb's lifespan.Finally, this bulb is not rated for dimmers. However, I tested it at a friend's house with an actual dimmer, and it actually was able to dim down fairly smoothly, albeit with some flickering after about maybe 50% brightness. From other reports online, it seems like it's a hit or miss with dimmers with this bulb. Since it's not rated for dimmers, I consider this almost like a bonus feature if it works well enough for you.SUMMARYThe main selling point of this bulb is its very affordable price. The great 100lm/w efficiency is a very pleasant surprise. Combined with a virtually silent operation, this bulb has become my main bulb throughout my house. Of course, the shorter rated lifespan is somewhat of a concern. However, with its price point being so affordable, it's something that I can certainly live with. There's really no excuse to not try out LED lighting with the availability of this bulb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRG0NAL1TOHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1YQVYK#wasThisHelpful","RKRG0NAL1TOHM","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another year, another new iPhone! We preordered two new iPhone 6S this year – both 64GB rose gold, one for AT&T and one for Verizon (I know, it’s complicated when it comes to wireless plans in my family). Both were delivered on launch day back on 9/25, and after over two weeks I think I’ve had enough time to make an accurate assessment of the latest offering out of Cupertino.DESIGNBeing a “S” year model, the 6S is as expected a refinement of last year’s 6. It inherits pretty much the same physical layout – same 4.7” (750 × 1334) retina screen in a body that’s ever so slightly thicker/taller (by 0.2 mm) and heavier (14g or 0.4oz). It’s virtually identical, so much so that my significant other’s old 6 case fits the new 6S perfectly. So if you got old accessories from last year, most likely it will all still work fine on the new phone. The heavier weight is definitely noticeable at first, but you get used to it quickly after a day or so.The only new physical change this year is the addition of “rose gold” as a color option. Don’t let the name fool ya – it’s certainly very pink!NEW FEATURESThis year, the main new features are 3D touch, higher resolution cameras (front and back), faster processor and graphics performance and a couple other software refinement and features.-3D touchThis is the main event. Apple first introduced this concept with the Apple watch, when it was called Force Touch. Interesting sidenote - apparently they changed the name to 3D touch due to the negative connotation associated with “forcing” something, especially with the female customers. Anyway, this feature adds another dimension to the user interface by allowing the phone to sense different depths of touch. Basically, the phone is now pressure-sensitive, just like Wacom tablets but obviously not that many levels of sensitivity. I think out of all the features and changes, this is the most defining and important addition to the iPhone. It allows for a more intuitive flow in apps that support it. Currently, there’s only a handful, and most are Apple’s in-house apps. But it’s only a matter of time before developers start figuring out how best to utilize this additional dimension.-Upgraded camerasThis year Apple finally upgraded the cameras – both front and back. The front camera goes from 1.2MP to 5.0MP, a very noticeable jump. The screen now doubles as the flash for the front camera. All this should make all the selfie enthusiasts out there very happy. For the back camera, Apple bumped the spatial resolution from 8.0MP to 12MP and boosted the video capabilities with 4K video and slower slo-mo video at 1080p (now up to 120 fps vs last year’s 60 fps). In the process, Apple decided to go with a similar sensor size, which resulted in smaller pixel size (now 1.22 microns vs last year’s 1.5 microns). Apple says they used “deep trench” technology to deal with the increase in noise level associated with the smaller pixels. This is where the geek/photography enthusiast inside me kind of rolls my eyes slightly – this technology has been in place in other cameras and phones for a while now and is nothing new. It’s not something magical or revolutionary. That being said, the iPhone camera is definitely one of the best mobile cameras around. The response time is great with minimal shutter lag and shot-to-shot delay. Color balance and exposure generally is good to great, and noise levels in the captured images are generally very low.The camera user interface remains largely unchanged from last year, except for the addition of Live Photos. This feature works by basically continuously capture a 12 fps video stream in the background when you turn on the camera. When you tap the shutter button to take a photo, the phone captures that image in time along with about 3 seconds of video before and after the shot. The result is a photo that when you press down using 3D Touch will come alive. Apple actually didn’t come up with this feature - HTC did it first back in early 2013 with the HTC One M7’s Zoe feature. It’s definitely very cool, but as always there are couple gotchas. First, the resulting “image” is basically a short video, and video clips take up a lot more space than a single photo. Apple was reluctant about how much additional space Live Photo would require. From my various Live Photo clips, it’s about 2 to 2.5 times a normal photo. That adds up quickly, especially if you have a 16GB phone. This was part of the reason why we went with the 64GB version. Second, it’s hard to make use of these proprietary short video clips, specifically in sharing. This was the main problem HTC ran into almost three years ago. Apple has a much, much bigger influence obviously, and I am cautiously optimistic that they will flex their muscles and get Live Photo support quickly with the major social media and other services. Time will tell, though.Still a bit sad that the 6S doesn’t have optical image stabilization like the 6S Plus. Electronic image stabilization is nice but I still prefer optical, especially for video.-Upgraded VideoFinally, 4K video! Okay, so it’s something that’s a bit of an overkill at the moment, since most people don’t have 4K TV sets yet. But it’s a nice feature to have and will futureproof the 6S as 4K TVs become more affordable and more common. Just be aware of the increased storage requirement for 4K video! I do like the improvement to the 1080p slow-motion video – now up to 120fps or twice as slow as before.-Faster CPU/GPUThe new A9 processor is very impressive, despite still being just a dual-core processor. Now clocked at up to ~1.8Ghz or so, which is a healthy 400Mhz jump from last year’s A8 at 1.4Ghz. The GPU performance is very impressive as well. I like Apple’s focus here – most apps are still single or double-threaded, and being among the fastest in performance-per-core is a good strategy vs piling on more cores every iteration. Fact of the matter is, a phone is severely limited by the compromise between battery life and heat dissipation. If I am going to do real work, I would prefer to use a powerful desktop or workstation.One added benefit with the improved A9 is the M9 coprocessor, which among other things allow for constant-on for Siri. This means you no longer have to be plugged in to trigger the “hey siri” voice command. Personally, I am not a big Siri user outside of messing around for fun. But if you rely on Siri heavily, this could be a big improvement.Also, finally Apple gave us 2GB of RAM! I believe this contributed equally if not more to the overall increased speed and smoothness in daily usage with the 6S. One GB RAM is just not enough anymore – hasn’t been for at least a year or two now.-Other Misc ImprovementsThere’s of course iOS 9, which adds a host of features and tweaks. Biggest thing for me personally was the claimed improvement in battery life. Other improvements include a faster Touch ID (I can definitely feel the difference, pretty much instantaneous log-in now) and tougher Gorilla glass and more robust aluminum chassis to prevent a repeat of “bend-gate” from last year. They all add up to a much more refined phone compared to the 6.Also, it appears Apple beefed up the seals in the 6s, and unofficial tests show that this phone will survive being dunked in water for a few minutes. Some are even saying up to 30 min or more. I personally haven’t tested it and will not be doing so for obvious reasons. But it’s good to know the added protection is there if I ever need it.POTENTIAL PROBLEMSWith a little bit over two weeks of daily usage, I haven’t encountered any major issues. There are two potential problems that I’d like to point out:1. Battery life – The 6S actually has a battery that’s about 100mah or ~5% smaller than last year’s 6. This is a bit disappointing for me. I understand the physical limitations with implementing 3D Touch, which required more space from other components. It’s just I am sure I am not alone when I say battery life is one of the few areas where we really need some improvement. Apple claims iOS 9 made up for the smaller battery, but just imagine if the 6S had a bigger battery, or even the same size as the 6. Regression is not good in this department, in my opinion.From my personal usage pattern, the 6S has more or less comparable battery life for light usage. But more intensive tasks like video, facebook, facetime, etc, I feel there’s a slightly decrease in overall battery life. Not enough to cause alarm, but just enough to take away from the otherwise refined experience.2. CPU Chip lottery – This is a fairly new development that came out over the past week. Basically, Apple had outsourced the production of the A9 chip to two companies, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I won’t get into the technical details since that’s a whole other can of worm, but essentially the TSMC chip from informal testing has shown to give up to an extra two hours of battery life. That is not an insignificant difference. There are apps around that you can use to check your phone’s CPU. If your 6S has a N71MAP CPU, then it’s the better TSMC chip. If it’s N71AP, then it’s the inferior Samsung chip. Apple’s official statement as of today is that the difference is negligible. And maybe it is for some people. But as a tech enthusiast, it’s annoying and frustrating. Fortunately, we lucked out as both of our 6S’s are TSMC chips. If I got the Samsung chip, I actually would seriously consider asking for an exchange at the Apple Store.SUMMARYThe 6S is a very nice upgrade over last year’s 6. Refinement is the operative word here, which is what we expected from a S year model. If you have a 6 though, I am not sure if it’s worth the upgrade especially now with carriers doing away with subsidies. But if you’re coming from anything older, this is a great upgrade and should be good enough to last at least two years if not more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXEN2RQRI80Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015E8UTIU#wasThisHelpful","R2FXEN2RQRI80Q","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:20 Mins I’ve tried my share of phone mounts over the years – everything from simple air vent mounts to gooseneck and suction mounts. This Getron mount is definitely one of the best ones I’ve come across.DESIGN & OPERATIONThe mount came in two pieces. You have to completely loosen the knob on the tip of the neck near the ball joint socket before inserting the phone holder. I had it only somewhat loose at first and for the life of me could not push the holder into the socket – I almost broke the holder arms in the process. Fortunately, the thing was robust enough and survived without a scratch. The suction cup is sticky even without locking it down with the latch in the mount’s base. The phone holder has a nice little lower lip that you flip out to rest the phone on. You press a button in the lower right corner of the holder to open up the holder’s arms. The mechanism is actually nicely engineered and well built. I’ve included a short video to show how it works. Personally, I think this is one of the best holder mechanisms I’ve come across. As you can see in the video, it allows for practical one-handed operation, and it really grasps onto the phone once you’ve tightened it. And again, the releasing motion is just cool.The phone holder at its widest will accommodate a device that’s 3.5” wide. That should cover most if not all phablets and big phones, even in a bulky case.POTENTIAL PROBLEMSI was a bit tentative about the sticky suction cup. I love my car – and cars in general – and adhesives plus hours of basking and baking in the sun typically don’t equal good outcomes. Also, I hate residues left by adhesives, especially on my windshield or dashboard. After first testing on several different surfaces – table, kitchen countertop, fridge – and not finding any leftover residue after removal of the mount, I finally summoned up the courage to test it in my car. So far, there doesn’t appear to be any residue issues, so that’s very good. But I also realized that my dashboard’s texture was enough to create problem for the suction cup. This isn’t new – it’s the same with all suction based mounts I’ve tried in the past. A flat surface works best – just basic physics. On the windshield, this mount’s suction is very solid.SUMMARYThis is a solid suction mount with a great holder mechanism. It works best on a flat surface, as with all suction based mounts. I am not sure how long the suction cup will stay sticky – I will report back down the road. At least for now, the adhesive appears to be holding up after about a week of daily usage. And I didn’t see any residue left behind on the surface, which was a top priority for me.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"I’ve completely converted my entire house’s lighting to LED with the exception of a couple candelabra lamps. I decided to start on my conversion by testing out this Lohas candelabra LED bulb.DESIGNThis candelabra bulb is very solidly built, and it’s noticeably more efficient with its rated 680 lumens output at 7W power draw – about 97 lumens/watt, an excellent ratio. Most candelabra LED bulbs I’ve come across are around 300 lumens at 4.5W, or about 67 lumens/watt. The bulb has an impressive heatsink – supposedly made of aviation grade aluminum. It definitely feels robust and hefty to the touch. The LEDs are fully exposed by the clear tip. They are arranged to provide all around lighting coverage. Some people might not find this exposed LED arrangement attractive, but as an engineer and a tech geek, I love the look.The bulb from tip to the base is about 4.25” long. I got the daylight version with a color temperature of 6000-7000K. It is dimmable according to the manufacturer. The CRI or color rendering index is quoted to be greater than or equal to 80. The rated life of 30,000 hours is very impressive and higher than others, which typically are rated for 25,000 hours.LIGHTING AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCEI’ve included two photos, one with this bulb and the other with a FEIT 300lm/4.5W/2700K soft white LED bulb in the same lamp. To better illustrate the difference in light output and color temperature, pay attention to the Altoids box I placed in the middle of the photo. Personally, I prefer higher color temperature as it makes me feel more awake and alert. At 6000-7000K, this bulb is at the high end in terms of color temp and I would typically use this for work or reading. The color of the light is definitely bright white and doesn’t have the dreaded blueish LED tint to it.Using a Killawatt, I was able to verify the bulb’s power draw (runtime/power draw):- At start up, power draw spiked at 7.7W for about 15 seconds then rolling down to 7.2W- 30 min/7.3W- 60 min/7.4W- 90 min/7.3W- 120min/7.4WThis is ever so slightly higher than the rated 7 W draw, but it’s certainly within reasonable range of deviation. Even at 7.4W, the bulb is still at about 91.89 lumens/W, which is still impressively efficient.The heatsink heats up quickly and can get uncomfortably hot to the touch. But that’s actually a good thing – it means it’s doing a good job removing excessive heat from the LEDs.If there’s any downside, it’s the lack of mentioning of operation in damp areas and/or enclosed light fixtures. Typically you’ll find this info on the box and the bulb, but I didn’t see it in either places with this bulb. Since heat is the main cause for shortened LED lifespan, I personally would err on the side of caution and avoid enclosed fixtures.SUMMARYThis is a very efficient LED candelabra bulb with good build quality. The only drawback is its price point. It’s not inexpensive – unfortunately that’s the case with most candelabra LED bulbs. Hopefully the price point will come down as technology improves and cost drops in the future.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

Rest assured, I have absolutely no compunction about exposing products that suck. Just my way of paying it forward for all the other good reviews that have helped me so far :)UPDATE (10/10/2015): heard back from the manufacturer - they do not recommend using this bulb in damp areas or in fully enclosed fixtures. They promised to make that clear in their new bulbs/packaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CH3I3TRA09BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWC3BVU#wasThisHelpful","R1CH3I3TRA09BI","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ipad 4 mini case by Oenbopo is decent cover, but there are some caveats due to the very inexpensive price point.DESIGN & OPERATIONThis case includes a semi-transparent plastic backing and the familiar cover that protects the ipad mini’s screen when closed and folds into two different positions as a stand. The ipad mini simply clips into the plastic backing – no magnetic connection as in the official Apple smart cover. The cutouts in the backing fit the ipad mini nicely. The entire backing does look and feel cheap, but at this price point that is within expectations.The cover feels pretty solidly constructed. It’s attached securely to the plastic backing, and I don’t feel like it will tear apart at the spine holding up it up by the cover with the ipad mini installed, which is a good sign. The cover does have magnets at the edge which comes into play when you fold the cover into its two standing positions. However, the magnets are pretty weak compared to the official Apple smart cover. It will pop open at the lightest touch. However, it does work fine as a stand with the ipad mini installed. Once you have it in position, the weight of the ipad mini helps to prevent the cover from popping open. Still, it’s somewhat annoying and takes away from the user experience.SUMMARYThis ipad mini case works generally fine, but the overall user experience lacks a bit due to the weak magnet in the cover and the somewhat unattractive plastic backing. But then again, the case is very inexpensive at only $5. It’s a great value, without a doubt. Just for me personally, I would prefer to pay a little bit more for a more refine experience after I’ve already shelled out for an ipad mini.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"This universal phone mount has some good ideas in its design, but the overall implementation needs some work. For starters, the mount literally broke apart the first time I tried to use it. The power plug had an extra rubber gear attachment that was way too big for the port. I felt like I was going to break something as I forced it in. When I tried to pull the mount out of the lighter socket, the tip broke off and was stuck solidly inside the socket (see attached photos). I had to use a set of small forceps to carefully extract the parts stuck – the fuse, the metal contact, the oversized rubber gear and the plastic tip. I then had to figure out how to put the pieces back together, which made me a little tentative about using the charger portion of the mount.DESIGN & OPERATIONThe mount is basically a two-port cigarette lighter attached to an adjustable smartphone frame with a gooseneck extension. The gooseneck is probably the best part of the mount – it’s very robust and strong, and did not budge one bit with a phone in the mount. It’s also easily adjustable, although you do have to put some force into it at first.Unfortunately the rest of the mount has some issues. First, the phone holder had issues grabbing onto phones with thicker cases. The problem here is the adjustable arm that moves up and down. The button and the arm itself protrudes too much out into the space for the phone. Even with a slim style case on my HTC One M7 and iPhone 6S, the holder had just enough clearance to hold onto the phone. With an otterbox case on, my phones were too thick for the mount.Second, as I mentioned before, the mount got stuck in my car’s lighter socket and literally disintegrated when I tried to remove it. Fortunately, no damage was done to my car’s socket and I was able to put the charger pieces back together. I left out the oversized rubber gear (see photo), and this made the mount usable. I understand the motivation behind the rubber gear – to add more support for the mount holding a phone. But it was way too big and not very well designed. The fact that the entire assembly failed spectacularly in my first attempt to use it didn’t help.SUMMARYThis mount is a good idea, but it needs to be better implemented. I actually found it useful after I removed the oversized rubber ring. It freed up my vents from my typical vent-based smartphone holder, and it also moved the phone further away from the windshield and the glare of the sun. The gooseneck is strong and robust, as is the hinge. But the holder mechanism needs to be refined to allow for thicker cases/devices, and the charge port plug needs to be designed (probably just remove the oversized rubber ring) to make sure it doesn’t get stuck or fall apart.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"When this light bulb was first introduced by Philips back in May, it quickly became somewhat viral due to the special introductory price of just $5 - for a two pack. This was unheard of for brand new LED bulbs without any utility subsidies. I bought two packs back in June when it became available at my local Home Depot, and I was so impressed that I ended up making it the primary bulb for my whole house.DESIGNThe bulb looks like a traditional lightbulb, with an almost perfectly circular plastic enclosure on top followed by about an inch of what feels like metal stem. It's rated to produce 800 lumens while drawing 8.5W with a color temperature of 2700K, which is closest to the good old incandescent soft white. The color rendering index (CRI), which is related to how accurate colors are rendered by the light emitted by the bulb, is 80 - this is about average. The bulb's main selling point is its low price point, and this is reflected in a couple areas. First, the rated life is 10,000 hours, or about 10 years at 3 hours per day. This is roughly half of what most other LED bulbs are rated for, which is around 20~22 years or 25000 hours. Second, the light bulb feels noticeably lighter than most other comparable 60W equivalent LED bulbs. This is due to the fact that there's no elaborate heatsink design. Instead, the only heatsink I can see is the inch of metal stem. I've attached a photo comparing this bulb with three other 60W equivalent LED bulbs. The weight is actually very comparable to the Philips SlimStyle, another Philips LED bulb with emphasis on affordability.The bulb is specifically labelled to be non-dimmable, suitable for damp locations but not suitable for use in fully enclosed luminaries.ACTUAL LIGHTING & ENERGY EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCEUsing a Killawatt to verify power draw, I installed the bulb in a standard floor lamp which places the bulb facing upward in an open enclosure situation. The bulb lighted instantly - some LEDs have a slight half second delay but not here. Power draw at the outlet fluctuated between 8.0 and 8.1W - a pleasant surprise as it's actually drawing less than the rated 8.5W. The power draw remained steady, sometimes dipping to 7.9W but mainly around 8W, at 30 min/60 min/90 min/120 min. At the rated 800 lumen output, this is essentially 100lumens/watt, which is very impressive and actually beats out all the other LEDs I have in my inventory, every one of which being at least twice as expensive if not more.Touching the lightbulb while it's on further supports its low power draw performance. After three hours of continuous operation, the plastic top part is barely warm to the touch. The white metal stem is hot, but I can actually keep my fingers on the stem for about 4 seconds before it's uncomfortable enough to force me to pull away. With other bulbs, I have to pull away almost immediately from the metal heatsink stem after 3 hours of runtime. This is really encouraging, as heat is the number one cause for failure in LED bulbs.The bulb is virtually silent. In certain fixtures, such as my bathroom and one older lamp, there is a very faint buzz if I press my ear next to it, literally about one or two inches away. This was a big improvement over my other affordable Philips LED bulb - the SlimStyle. Very nice.The color temperature is 2700K. This is a potential downside for me, since I personally prefer 3000K for daily lighting. This bulb definitely looks ever so slightly yellower compared to my 3000K bulbs. But at its price point, this is something I can overlook.The other potential shortcoming is that it's not rated for use in fully enclosed light fixtures. The main reason for this is most likely heat dissipation. Surprisingly, none of my other vastly more expensive 60W equivalent LED bulbs are rated for use in fully enclosed fixtures, including all the other bulbs shown in the attached photo. The only LED bulb in my inventory that's rated for fully enclosed fixtures is the FEIT 40W equivalent at 7.5W which I bought from my local Costco's through an utility subsidy. Therefore, I can't really hold it against this bulb - just be aware if you have fully enclosed fixtures, they might adversely affect this bulb's lifespan.Finally, this bulb is not rated for dimmers. However, I tested it at a friend's house with an actual dimmer, and it actually was able to dim down fairly smoothly, albeit with some flickering after about maybe 50% brightness. From other reports online, it seems like it's a hit or miss with dimmers with this bulb. Since it's not rated for dimmers, I consider this almost like a bonus feature if it works well enough for you.SUMMARYThe main selling point of this bulb is its very affordable price. The great 100lm/w efficiency is a very pleasant surprise. Combined with a virtually silent operation, this bulb has become my main bulb throughout my house. Of course, the shorter rated lifespan is somewhat of a concern. However, with its price point being so affordable, it's something that I can certainly live with. There's really no excuse to not try out LED lighting with the availability of this bulb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6T62W05J8E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUGFFA6#wasThisHelpful","R1C6T62W05J8E8","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I am a chocoholic and I am proud of it. This is my second bag in as many months, and I am about to order another bag. Yup I know, the subscription system for the first time actually makes sense to me with this :) My first bag arrived during July of this year. It was impeccably packed inside its own box, surrounded on all sides with thick thermal insulation and with a ice pack inside. I was a little worried about the chocolate melting in the powerful NC summer heat, but the entire bag arrived in pristine condition with no hint of melting whatsoever.I love the bite-size packaging. They're especially great for an on-the-go quick chocolate fix. My form of self-control is to hide the bag in the highest kitchen cabinet to prevent me going through half of the bag in one sitting. Initially, I didn't like the special dark flavor too much, but eventually I got used to it and even liked it. Even then, it's definitely my least favorite flavor. The other three - milk chocolate, milk chocolate with almonds and extra creamy milk chocolate with toffee & almonds - are deliciously addictive.If you have a chocoholic in your life, this would make a great gift for any occasion.

"I got this as a replacement for my ""daily driver"" since my old New Balance 993 was falling apart. I admit this was a somewhat impulse buy - the price was great and I liked the class look of the blue/black color combo. I typically would go test them out in a local shoe store, but I chose to live dangerously and bought this blind. Very glad I did!First impression - the shoe is fairly light, just ever so slightly heavier than my Brook Ravenna 3s. The shoe box is average width, slightly looser than the Ravenna's but not so much that it's bothersome. The heel portion was a bit loose when new. The first week or so, I had the annoying sensation of wearing a pair of shoes that's slightly too large in the back around ankle/heel. Fortunately, after the second and the shoes more broken in, that uneasy sensation went away and now they fit my feet great. It's a neutral support shoe, which isn't ideal for me since I tend to over-pronate and prefer stability control shoes. So far I've used these as my general purpose, daily work/walk/gym shoes, and they work great in those arenas. I went for a couple of short distance (1 to 1.5 mile runs, about 10 miles total), and my main take-away is that the shoe lacks the cushioning and support found in my rotation of dedicated running shoes, which include Ravennas, 993s and Gt-2000s.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase. I love the shoe's sharp classic look and the price point was pretty reasonable. The level of shock absorption is good enough as my general purpose shoes. It is neutral and doesn't have stability control, but for daily walking and gym, I have no problem even though I usually go for stability control shoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28303HV9VEUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2CEUDC#wasThisHelpful","R28303HV9VEUI","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been a New Balance (specifically the 993) runner, and I only tried Brooks after the local runner shop's relentless recommendation. My first pair of Brooks was the Ravenna 3. And it was a revelation (see my earlier review of the 3 if you want details). I have weak ankle, somewhat weak arch and suffer from over-pronation. I run about 5K three times a week now - low-ish milesage runner. After getting the Ravenna 3, it quickly became my favorite pair in my rotation of the Asic GT-2000, New Balance 993 and the Ravenna 3. After about year and half and about 268 miles (according to my Nike+ tracking), my Ravenna 3 was starting to feel not as supportive. So the logical replacement is a new pair of Ravenna's. Enter my new pair of Ravenna 5.First impression - it continues the slightly skinny shoe box, which fits me perfectly as I have slightly skinny feet. That was one of the main reasons I loved the 3 so much, and I am very happy the 5 has the same fit. Cushion-wise, the 5 feels great. Reminds me of my first run with the 3, when I felt like I was running on small puffs of cloud. I know some runners prefer a harsher feel, but personally I and my knees appreciate the extra support. Stability seems good - I feel like there's good support for my over-pronation tendencies. Again, reminds me a lot of the Ravenna 3 when it was new. I was relieved to be honest, as I had read some not so positive things about the Ravenna 4, and I wasn't sure which lineage the 5 would follow. I've had the 5 since August, and so far I have about 30 miles on them. Definitely very satisfied.If there's a negative, it's the available colors. I got the ""high risk red"", which was really the only option as I thought the other color combos were all somewhat questionable - for my taste. But that's about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GELHWZNVLCFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4JH6Q0#wasThisHelpful","R2GELHWZNVLCFI","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was going on a cross country trip and while I usually don't have any issue falling asleep, I thought I'd try something new and see if help make the trip more pleasant. I got mine from Target. The ingredients are sodium (80mg), GABA, melatonin and 5-HTP (see attached photo). I took a bottle before take-off and promptly dozed off. I woke up about two hours later with a pulsating head-ache, which is really rare for me. Needless to say, I was pretty miserable for the rest of the flight. Fortunately, I was more or less back to 100% the next day after going to bed early. I did some research into the ingredients, and it appears 5-HTP's primary effect is it promotes serotonin production in the brain. Taking 5-HTP along with GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) is an unconfirmed method for promoting sleep. I am guessing each person reacts to these ""supplements"" differently. From my adverse reaction, I definitely won't be trying this again (or any other similar supplements).  Also, it tasted a bit synthetic and left an unpleasant aftertaste.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFEE0ANMMYQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049JYRDO#wasThisHelpful","R2LFEE0ANMMYQG","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an avid runner and I’ve gone through more than my share of smartphone armbands. One of the biggest issues I’ve encountered is a bad-fitting loose band, which is very annoying as I have to constantly interrupt my run to make adjustments. After running with this armband for the past two weeks (typically 5k every other day), I am glad to say it has great fit and hasn’t slid or moved out of place on me. The armband has two slots for looping the Velcro band through (photos attached). I have average sized arms, and it fits nice and snugly using just the outer slot. The inner slot creates a really small fit, and I think most people won’t need that unless you’re super skinny or maybe a kid. There’s also a slot for storing your key(s). It seems snug and tight enough, but since there’s no zipper, I personally wouldn’t trust it for my house or car keys.RUNNING NAKEDYou slide the phone in through a slit in the back. The fit is very tight – with my HTC One M7, which is virtually the same dimension and size as the iPhone 6/6S, I had to remove the phone’s case (even though it was a Seidio slim fit case) before I was able to get it inside the armband. At first I wasn’t sure about running with a naked phone, mainly due to the fact that I take really good care of my gadgets and I was a little wary about the protection or lack thereof. But after a few runs, I actually started to prefer running naked – naked phone, that is. The weight reduction from lack of case helps the band stays in place, which is my number one annoyance with armbands. The only other problem was that the headphone cutout is at the bottom, which makes sense since it’s designed for iPhones. My HTC has it at the top. Fortunately, it worked perfectly after I put in my phone the other way.SUMMARYThis is a good armband that has kept its good fit after couple weeks of running. The price point is pretty attractive too. I have three other armbands of various design, and this one’s definitely my go-to armband now.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing. I am not affiliated with the seller in any way, and my review is a genuine and unbiased account of my personal experience with the product.

" 0:42 Mins This portable LED Lamp by Etekcity is a pretty interesting tool. When I first got it, I was expecting a basic lamp with some gimmicky extras. After using it over this past summer, I've been pleasantly surprised by how practical it and its additional features turned out to be.DESIGN AND OPERATIONThe lamp is made up of a mix of hard plastic shell with a metal band (most likely aluminum) in the middle. The plastic feels tough and not flimsy, which was better than I was expecting. There are two folding metal hangers, and the hinges are pretty tight and robust, and they feel like they won't snap off after a couple cycles. The top and bottom caps unscrew to reveal the AA (it takes 3) and 18650 lithium ion battery (it takes 2) compartments. Towards the lower part of the lamp you'll find a blue button for cycling through the different lighting modes and a rubber covered door housing a microUSB and standard USB for charging purposes.  To turn on the lamp, you pull the top until you reach the trigger point. You can adjust the light output by how much you extend the lamp. When it's in the off position, the lamp is about 3""x3""x5.1"" (see attached photos). Fully extended, it stands about 7"" tall.I thought the way you turn the lamp on was pretty cool. There's just enough resistance as you pull on the top to give a reassuring feeling - it definitely won't slide out on its own if the lamp is held upside down. Pulling up on this lamp made me feel like Dennis Nedry (aka Newman hehe) from Jurassic Park, you know that scene where he's stealing the dinosaur embryos from the cold storage tanks. I've attached a short video showing the mechanism in action, as well as the 4 different lighting modes (hi-white, low-white, red, flashing-red). There's also two magnets on the bottom of the lamp. It's a little weak, barely able to hold the lamp perpendicular on my fridge. I have to fidget with it to get it to stay, and any slight motion or vibration will cause the lamp to slide down. As you can see from the video, there's two other corners with rubber feet instead of magnets. I feel like with one or two additional magnets, this thing would attach solidly to metal surfaces.The lamp is able to draw power from three sources - the 3 AA's, the two lithium cells or via external power source through 5V USB. It also doubles as an emergency battery bank for mobile devices via the USB port, drawing from the two lithium cells (18650 cells are 2200mAH each, for a total of 4400mAH). You can recharge the lithium cells by plugging the lamp into a standard USB charger, but you have to remove the AA's before doing so. The battery bank function is a nice bonus - very practical for camping trips. I tested the lamp with my Eneloop AA's, and the combo worked perfectly.POTENTIAL ISSUESIn addition to the weak magnets on the bottom on the lamp, the only other issue I came across was the lithium battery compartment being a bit tight. I had to really use some force to remove the two 18650 cells.SUMMARYOverall, this is a very useful tool to have around. The build quality is surprisingly solid, and the additional battery bank feature is a nice bonus. I wish the manufacturer opted to put additional magnets on the bottom to make attaching the lamp to metal surfaces more reliable. Perhaps in a future revision.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"I’ve been using Meguiar’s quik detailer for a while now… since the early 2000’s now that I think about it. I started using it mainly to get rid of bird poop, which is acidic and will degrade and eat through the clear coat if left to bake in the sun. And without a good layer of clear coat, not only does your car look really unattractive, but the underlying paint surface is now exposed to the elements. I used to keep a bottle handy in the garage, but now that I am a proverbial poor grad student living in an apartment setting, I no longer have the luxury (and protection) that a garage offers. I threw a bottle in the trunk and it’s a perfect and quick way to wipe off bird poop, tree sap or any other crap that you’ll find on my car. It works especially well if your car has a decent coat of wax. I usually use one or two sprays followed by a few seconds to let the solution dissolve the contaminants. Then it's an easy wipe off.The bottle pictured in the product description has the old style spray nozzle, which is NOT able to be turned off completely. I learned this the hard way after most of my first bottle leaked out in the trunk. The most recent bottle I bought from Amazon contains a new spray nozzle that allows you to turn it 90 degrees to lock it. This is great as now I don’t have to worry about any accidental leaking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WNVTAA5CDH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009IQX90#wasThisHelpful","R28WNVTAA5CDH5","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve always preferred slim, low-profile cases more than the bulky Otterboxes. I am pretty careful with my gadgets and I like to preserve as much of my phone’s sleek profile as possible. My significant other recently got a new rose gold iPhone 6S, and I was tasked with finding a suitable case and screen protector for her new baby. It’s only been a couple days, but so far this case by Easy-Tech has worked well. It does come with a “bonus” screen protector.DESIGN & OPERATIONThe case is a single piece of rubbery plastic that snaps onto her 6S, which has an identical physical layout as the old 6. The material feels slightly slippery according to my significant other. The fit is great, and all buttons (power, volume +/-) work properly. There’s good access to the silence toggle and the lightning connector port. Good cutouts for the speaker and the camera too. As you can see from my attached photos, the pink version that we got matches nicely with the rose gold 6S. There is an Easy-Tech logo in white near the bottom of the case, but it’s subtle and you can hardly see it from normal distance, which is nice.The case included a bonus screen protector. There’s a link in the package material to a how-to video on how to apply the screen protector if you’ve never done it before. This was actually my first time doing this, and I had to reapply several times before it was deemed okay by my SO. Part of the problem was me being a screen protector rookie. But the other part was from the fact that the screen protector does NOT cover the entire front of the phone. Instead, it’s literally just wide enough to cover the screen. I’ve attached a photo that hopefully illustrates this for you. According to the how-to video, this is due to the slight curvature towards the edges of the iPhone. I think it all boils down to cost, as it probably costs more to produce a screen protector that completely matches the slight curvature. It does cover the entire screen, so no issues there. We’ll see how she likes it. If not, the screen protector can be easily removed by gently pulling up at the corner. I had to do this a couple times in my do-over attempts, and I am glad to report it didn’t leave any weird residue on the screen.SUMMARYThis is a decent slim profile case for the iPhone 6 and 6S. It doesn’t offer as much protection as the beefier cases like Otterbox, but it’s a valid trade-off for the slim profile. I’ll update this as we put more mileage on the case. For now, the only con is I wish the screen protector had covered the entire front of the phone.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing. I am not affiliated with the seller in any way, and my review is a genuine and unbiased account of my personal experience with the product.

"I am typically very careful when it comes to using third party chargers for my gadgets, as there’s so much potential for serious problems. My recent encounter with a LG OEM charger (came with the phone) that failed spectacularly – loud popping sound complete with puff of smoke – further confirmed my philosophy that you can never be too careful when it comes to power supplies for your precious gadgets. I am glad to report that after a week as my primary charger, this 2 port 2.1A charger by Crabby Digital have performed without any problem, and I have no problem using it to charge my most prized toys.DESIGN & OPERATIONThe charger is a black square with a nice matte finish that doesn’t look or feel cheap. It’s about 1.9”x1.9”, slightly bigger and noticeably heavier than the iPad 2.1A single port charger. The heft is promising, as it tends to correlate with decent power supply components. The plug folds into the charger when not in use. The two output ports are each capable of up to 2.1A @ 5V. There is a thin blue LED strip between the output ports that light up when plugged in. I tend to avoid LED lights on power supplies if possible for two reasons: they can be annoyingly bright and also cause excessive standby or phantom power draw when nothing’s charging. I am glad to report that’s not the case here. The blue LED isn’t too bright (photo attached), and the charger draws negligible power when in standby, verified by my Killawatt which showed 0.0W with the charged plugged in and the blue LED on.I tested this by charging a retina iPad and a HTC One m8 simultaneously. Since it’s not a Qualcomm quick-charge charger, it only charged the HTC One at 1 A, which was expected. It charged the iPad at full speed at 2A with no problem. The power draw was verified using my Killawatt.SUMMARYThis is a nice 2-port 2.1A charger with a subdued blue LED that’s not aggressively bright. I especially like the fact that it draws negligible power during standby. This means I don’t have to feel guilty about leaving it plugged in when not in use – it’s not wasting power, raising my electric bill and causing unnecessary pollution.Full disclosure: I received a sample for testing.

"This is a decent jump rope that should be fun for both kids and adults. There are some issues related to the design and build quality that could use some improvement or refinement. Given the price point, it’s alright, but not great.DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITYThe entire jump rope is made of plastic material, from the handles to the rope itself. The handles are made of decently thick plastic outer shells held together by small screws. They do feel a bit cheap, like good quality Fisher Price toys almost. On one handle, there’s a small LCD counter that shows you how many reps. The battery compartment is on the back of this handle, secured by two small screws. To change the battery, you just need a small Philips screw driver (i.e. one that works on glasses or laptop hard drives) to remove the two screws holding the battery door. It comes preinstalled with a L1154 alkaline button battery (see photos). It’ll probably last years if not virtually forever, since the small display draws very little power and auto shuts off after a short period of inactivity. Still, it’s good to be able to easily change batteries.The rope itself is also plastic, and is decently thick and should stand up to normal use just fine. The rope length is just barely long enough for myself (I am 6-1).POTENTIAL ISSUESOverall the rope worked well, but I noticed that the counter wasn’t 100% accurate. It tended to add about 2 or 3 reps per 10 reps – so if I did 10 actual jumps, the counter typically would register 12 or 13. After playing with the handles, I realized the counter works when the handle core rotates past a physical counter, which has a slight resistance and clicks when you go past it. On paper the design sounds good. I am not sure what’s causing the extra counts. Since the count discrepancy gets worse when I go faster, my best guess is the counter is somehow “double clicking” randomly, adding extra reps to the overall count. Since the main draw of this jump rope is its built-in counter, this inaccuracy kind of defeats the purpose, even if it’s in the ballpark so to speak.I personally didn’t encounter much tangling with the plastic rope. They can get twisted and more tangly, but you can fix that by untwisting it using the handles.SUMMARYThis is an okay product given the price point. I can definitely see this as a cool toy to give to kids and adults alike. Personally, the counter inaccuracy is just enough to bug me, but it’s still in the ballpark and if that doesn’t bother you, then it’s not a bad purchase.Full disclosure: I received a promotional sample for testing.

"When I first heard about this, I thought it was a joke. Sure, spending my days frolicking and eating and headbutting as a goat is obviously entertaining, but probably only for a few days. Week at most.But then I didn't anticipate the power of licking as a goat. Total game changer. It absolutely adds at least another week - if not two - of blissful fun. No lie.In terms of control, it's easy and intuitive. You use both hands to control the goat's movement (direction/running/jumping/headbutting/licking) as well as the perspective via transparent virtual buttons. You will be running/jumping/headbutting/licking in no time.There are tons of no nonsense things on your goat to-do list. My favorite so far is the firework that leads to Michael Bay Kaboom. The physics is exquisitely modeled and as expected. The graphics is nicely rendered in full 3D. You can change your perspective with the right thumb - great for getting that money shot view. The physics is actually decent. Be wary though - this game is a nice workout for your phone's CPU and graphics processor. On a slower phone, such as my old LG Realm, the graphics got a little choppy when there's a lot going on. It's buttery smooth on faster devices like my HTC One.Overall, it's a funky little game that deserves a look.

"Nowadays portable batteries are more of a necessity than luxury, given how power hungry our various mobile devices are. I received a sample of the blue Lumsing 8000mAh powerbank for testing, and overall I found it to be a quality portable power source that's well built and aesthetically attractive. The only flaw is the lack of pass-through charging.DESIGN & OPERATIONSThe battery bank is indeed very thin - at about 0.3"" thickness. The overall dimension is about the size of the iPhone 6, and slightly heavier, by about an ounce. The exterior is an attractive brushed aluminum casing that feels nice to the touch. Mine was the aqua blue version which looked nice. There are two USB ports - the full size USB is for charging your phone at up to 5V/2.1A, while the microUSB is the charge port for the battery bank (it takes up to 5V/1.5A). A charger is not included, but any standard phone USB wall charger should work fine. There's a power button next to a small flashlight. To charge, you press the power button once after you've connected the phone to the battery bank. To switch the flashlight on/off, you double click the power button. There are two small blue LEDs acting as charge indicator - two LED lit means >50%, one LED means <50%. Overall it's pretty user friendly and intuitive. I wish you didn't have to click the power button to begin charge, but it's a minor issue.A bigger issue is the lack of pass-through charging. If you hook up both a phone and a power supply to the battery bank simultaneously, only the battery bank will be charged but not the phone. This means at you can't just plug them in before bedtime and wake up to both the phone and battery bank being fully charged. Lumsing does not claim to have this capability, so it's not knock per se. But it's very useful feature that can potentially save a lot of time, and one that I've come to appreciate from my various trips using another battery bank that has this ability.Also, this battery only has one output port, so you can only charge one device at a time. Most banks now have two output ports. Although I think it's a valid trade-off for the thin form-factor.DURABILITY & CAPACITYThis is a 8000mAh bank. With overhead loss, you're looking at about 6500mah of usable capacity, which is expected. I was able to charge up my HTC One M7 about 3.5 times, which is about right given that the HTC has a 2300mah battery (it's probably closer to 2000mah now from normal degradation). I didn't notice any abnormal heat issues during charging and discharging, which bodes well for the powerbank's longevity. I will update this section in the future to see how this battery holds up longterm.Overall, if you're looking for a thin portable power source for your own personal use, this is a great choice. Just be aware of its limitations - namely no pass-through charging and only one output port.Full disclosure: I received a promotional sample for testing.

"This arrived in a very nice, premium packaging (see attached pictures), which my significant other appreciated very much. The vibrator itself is made of a soft feeling silicone material that's nice to the touch but firm enough to give an impression that it's solidly built. It takes two AAA batteries, which are not included. It works with either normal single use alkaline or nimh rechargeable batteries. Since AAAs hold less energy than normal AAs, I would definitely recommend some high quality rechargeable batteries, such as the Eneloops I tested with. Most rechargeable batteries are slightly wider girth wise and I am glad to report we had no problem inserting and removing the Eneloops.There are a plethora of modes, and you cycle through them by pressing the button at the end (see attached pic). There's low/medium/high constant vibration, followed by three different intermittent pulse modes and a combination mode.

"Running with today's ever larger phones can be problematic. As someone who's pretty passionate about running, I've gone through my share of armbands and holders. The biggest problem for me is always keeping the bands from slipping couple miles into my run. This can be really annoying as I have to readjust the band periodically and takes away from the running experience.When I first saw this running fanny pack, I was definitely skeptical. I've never used a running fanny pack before. Or fanny pack in general. I was pleasantly surprised when I went for my first run with this holding my HTC One M7 (same size as an IPhone 6, see attached pic). The belt stayed in place and there was very little movement through my 5K jog. I was able to use my phone through the clear window. The zipper in the back completely sealed the compartment, which was great since it started drizzling half way through my run. If there was one negative, it was the fanny pack aspect. For one, you just can't look cool running with a fanny pack of any kind. Two, the lower position on my torso (compared to my typical armband) means added travel for my headphone wires, which increased random movement and chance of tangling. My solution was to lengthen the straps, which were very easy to adjust, and convert the fanny pack into a mini backpack that slings diagonally across my upper chest. At first, I tried with the phone on the front of my chest, but there was still too much movement during my run. But when I moved the phone to my back, it fit perfectly and there was very little movement even during full-on sprint. I love this configuration, and it's a much better option than my armbands which tend to slip after a while no matter how tight I make it.I also like the extra space inside the pack. I can easily fit driver's license and couple credit cards in there easy. And again it's securely sealed with the full length zipper (see attached pic). The material feels quite nice to the touch (another pleasant surprise) - has that underarmour nylon feel to it. This has become my primary running pack now, and it's worth a look if you're looking for a holder that's bigger than average. I will update my review if I run into any issues.Full disclosure: I received a promotional sample for testing.

"This is a nice looking basic belt that's surprisingly well built. It's thick and slightly wider (about 1.75"", see attached picture) than the typical belt, so depending on your pants it might not fit all of them. I made the mistake of ordering one that's too large. I got the 38, for some reason thinking it was the length of the belt instead of my waist size. It still works, but for me personally a 36 would probably work perfectly. My waist size is typically 32 or so, so the advice from other reviewers about ordering at least one size up from your waist size sounds about right.Overall, I like this belt - looks good enough to be dressy and I feel very confident that it will take some beating too as a work belt.

"To be honest, I had no idea beard oil was a thing.

"USB 3.1 type C is the latest revision in USB, and it's got a lot of things going for it - reversibility (no need to worry about which way to plug it in), robust power delivery (much higher wattage), smaller size and of course the high data transfer speed of USB 3.0. This adapter converts a standard USB device into one with a USB 3.1 type C connector. You simply plug the USB 3.0 end of the converter into the device's USB cable and voila, your device now has a 3.1 type C connector.USB 3.1 type C is still very new, but I was able to test this out on a new MacBook Air in my lab, which only has a single Type C port. I tested the following devices: Logitech wireless Marathon mouse (with nano receiver), generic USB 2.0 4-port hub, USB 3.0 4-port hub, Brother laser printer, a Sandisk 64GB USB 2.0 flash drive, and a Sandisk Extreme Pro USB 3.0 flash drive. They all worked perfectly, and the data transfer speed with the Sandisk flash drives were not affected in any way by the adapter.The adapter feels solidly built, and there was a reassuring click as I connected the cable. The size is small and the weight isn't excessive enough to make me worry about putting extra stress on the MacBook Air's port.Overall, this is a useful converter to have around, especially if you have the new MacBook Air with only one Type C port.This was a complimentary test unit - I have absolutely no affiliation with the company/seller.

"I loved the original cut the rope, and I was quite disappointed when the sequel came out loaded down with tons of in app purchases. I know it's the latest trend of the ""freemium"" model, but I never liked the idea. When amazon came out with its underground program, I decided to give this game another shot. It's true - every single in app purchase is free, from the coin combo for getting power ups to the package for removing ads. It's certainly liberating!The big potential issue I saw was the extensive list of required permissions from the Amazon Underground app itself, which is needed to download and run Underground apps. You can see the list of permission on the Amazon Underground app page. To keep things in perspective, the list is pretty much the same as the one required for the Amazon app store app. So yes, you are probably being tracked on some way while using Underground apps, but probably not more than what was done in the past. And it's probably needed to compensate the developers under the ""per minute played"" model from Amazon.

"I've been looking for a car mount for a while that would fit my car properly. I initially looked at the Kenu Airframe for its elegant design. Unfortunately it didn't fit my car's vents, and so I decided to look for a more traditional suction cup based mount. I ended up giving this mount a try due to the gooseneck design, which I thought is a nice feature if it worked as designed. Also the holder bears a passing resemblance to the Kenu Airframe, which was my original target.DESIGNThe mount arrived in two pieces - the base with the gooseneck and the the spring loaded holder. It took me a few minutes to figure out that I had to first loosen the knob on the back of the holder before inserting the gooseneck mount. You can tighten the knob once you've adjusted the mount to your desired angle and position. The holder has a nice range and was able to securely hold an iphone 6, HTC One M7 & M8 and LG Realm with rooms to spare. The gooseneck is very stiff and somewhat hard to adjust. But I actually prefer that as it really doesn't budge even when holding up a big phone. The suction cup has a straight-forward clip that you push down to lock, and pull up to unlock from your car's dashboard or windshield.

"I bought this 3 pack of $15 gift cards during a promotion on Prime Day (bonus $10 coupon). The cards arrived quickly via 1-day shipping even though I picked the no rush option. I received an email confirmation from Amazon regarding the bonus coupon immediately after the cards were shipped out. The cards themselves were easy to use - just enter in the code printed on the back into your Amazon account and that's it.I am sure it's pretty standard nowadays, but still I think it's worth mentioning that these cards never expires and do not have hidden ""service"" fees that eat away at your balance after a certain period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DF1KUSH6NHRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FGQI2I#wasThisHelpful","R1DF1KUSH6NHRK","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tap Sports Football is a s a super simplified football game, to the point where it's too easy and boring. On top of that, there's a lot required permissions and even video ads, not to mention the substantial in-app purchases. I would not recommend it, even as today's free app of the day.GAMEPLAY & CONTROLAll you are allowed to do in the game is play offense. Kickoff is automated. Defense is automated (you select a general strategy). The automated results pop up immediately, without even an animation or anything. As for offense, all you do is choose a general strategy (running/passing/balanced) and then tap anywhere on screen for each play. At first, I thought where you tap would somehow dictate or control the play. Nope. You just tap and the play happens. It's really mindless and boring after about two minutes.You can upgrade with players and coaching staff. This is where the in-app purchases come in. You can blow up to $99 in real world money at a time. And the game promises the video ads will go away with any purchase. Just feels like rip-off overall.ADD-ONS & PERMISSIONSThe game has a lot of permissions:*access to internet*access to coarse location*access to SD card*access to wifi state*access to phone state*access to vibrate*access to receive_boot_completed*access to c2dm.permissions.receiveThis is in addition to the ads modules AppLovin and Google Mobile Ads, which I presume are for the video ads. There's also AD-X tracking for tracking in-game analytics. The presence of ads in a paid app is unacceptable. Coupled with the excessive and questionable list of required permissions, I would stay away even if this is actually a fun game - and it's not.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14F5TFFTFKPKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131L05MM#wasThisHelpful","R14F5TFFTFKPKC","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lalaloopsy Diner is a cute time management game, a la Emily's diner games, except it's designed for a much younger crowd.GAMEPLAY & CONTROLThe premise is that you are in charge of your restaurant's kitchen, and your goal is to serve your customers as quickly and efficiently as possible to maximize your earnings and tips. You can buy upgrades like better cooking ware using your earnings to help improve your efficiency and speed. The game has three difficulty levels (user selectable under the option menu on the home screen), and it defaults to the medium level. It also uses the familiar 3-star system to gauge the player's performance for each level. Both of these should help improve the game's replay value, as it motivates players to try to complete all levels with 3 stars, and then perhaps bump up to a harder difficulty level.There's an intuitive tutorial before the first stage which was very helpful if you're new to this type of games. The controls consist of dragging and tapping the various ingredients, and it was smooth and precise.GRAPHICS & SOUNDThe game definitely looks very cute and geared toward the younger crowd. The graphics are well done and smoothly animated. The voice work and music reminds me of PBS kids shows, which is exactly what the developer was going for. You can turn off the music under the option menu if you prefer.ADD-ONS & PERMISSIONSThere's no extraneous add-ons or dangerous permissions here, and I didn't encounter any ads while testing. This is how a paid app, and especially one designed for young children, should behave. The required permissions are internet access and read/write access to the SD card. The former is used for the links to the developer's other apps, while the latter is used for the app's ability to move data onto the SD card if you have one.The only issue I encountered was that there didn't appear to be a way to exit or close the game properly. Back button wasn't it. I had to use the home button to get out of the app, at which point I noticed it was still running in the background. This has potential to negatively impact the phone or tablet's performance and/or battery life. A quick solution is to use the android multitasking button, and then swipe the app to shut it down. Hopefully the developer is reading and can address this issue with a future update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z758A43JROIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYJADBY#wasThisHelpful","R1Z758A43JROIL","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, this is a nice vibrator and worked as described, but there's some issues with battery removal/replacement especially if you use rechargeable batteries (see details below).GENERAL PERFORMANCEAccording to my significant other, this is a decent product with decently powerful motor inside. The pink panther spots, as corny as they sound, are a nice touch. The waterproof feature seems to be true, as the device has survived multiple washes. The vibration strength knob at the end is easy to adjust. However, if there's something to complain about, it's the location of this knob, as you might unintentionally adjust it during use.BATTERY COMPARTMENT ISSUESThe device takes two AA batteries. We first tested the device using high quality eneloop rechargeable batteries. The product works perfectly with rechargeable batteries, and I would imagine it's more economical and green to do so. However, we ran into problems trying to remove the batteries from the vibrator. Turns out, the inner plastic shell that holds the battery is quite a tight fit for the rechargeable batteries, which tend to be slightly thicker (bigger diameter) than regular alkaline batteries. Eventually, the plastic container fell out of the vibrator (see attached pic #1). It was then easy to push out the batteries using a pen. This wasn't too bad. The bigger issue was the copper strip (see attached pic #2), which popped out in the process and we weren't sure how it was oriented originally. It took a while to figure out that it's suppose to be in the position shown in the attached picture. We almost destroyed the copper strip before figuring it out. Fortunately, everything turn out okay. If you plan on using rechargeable batteries, I would suggest removing the end cap, gently popping out the plastic battery holder, replace with fresh batteries and then push the holder back into the vibrator, taking care to make sure the copper lead strip stays in the same position.After this ordeal, we tested it with regular alkaline AA batteries. The fit is slightly looser, and the batteries will slide out with some tapping without having to remove the battery holder.Hope this helps! We received this complimentary product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R268B1DEQ4J3JB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0107Q8DLE#wasThisHelpful","R268B1DEQ4J3JB","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for Laika is an interesting take on the gear type game with a little bit of Flappy Bird sprinkled on top. It's definitely a bit more challenging than the average mobile game, which might turn off some players who're looking for a game with an easy learning curve. But if you have the patience, this game is actually quite entertaining once you get the hang of it.GAMEPLAY & CONTROLThe premise of the game is that the aliens abducted your beloved pet Laika, and you're an astronaut on a quest to track down and get him/her back. There are two modes of gameplay - story and arcade. In story mode, cute cutscenes tie together stages as you push forward in your quest to find Laika. In arcade mode, you simply run through stages without the backstory scenes. I've found arcade mode to be a nice practice mode, too. And you'll need some practice. This game is definitely challenging, almost frustratingly so when you first pick it up. To get past each stage, you need to pick up the key and then go into the ""cloud"" exit. There are power-ups and bonus items along the way, if you can pick them up. The Flappy Bird influence can be seen in the control - you simply tap when you want to jump. When you hit a ""planet"", it starts spinning and you have to time your jumps properly to move forward.Simple, right? Well, for my first few runs, I quickly discovered the planets spin quite fast when you first hop on. The timing you need is incredibly tight and frustratingly difficult. My eureka moment came when I started tapping randomly out of frustration - it turns out, you can bounce off planets without attaching by jumping right before you attach to them. Also, by doing so, you can also modify the spin rate and even direction of the planets! The timing and spinning become a lot more manageable and doable after I figured this out, and I started to finally have fun instead of trying to throw my phone on the ground in anger. Don't get me wrong, it's still very challenging, but at least it's not mission impossible now.GRAPHICS AND SOUNDThe game has a beautifully rendered look that's smoothly animated - definitely aesthetically pleasing. The music is pleasing, and you can turn it off if you prefer.ADD-ONS AND PERMISSIONSThe game has no extraneous ads or add-ons, and I didn't encounter any ads while playing. The only permission is internet access. Normally this is pretty innocuous, as it's used for links for social media or developer's other apps. However, I didn't see any such links in the actual game, so I am not quite sure why it's there. Maybe it was just leftover code. In any case, I was able to play the game in airplane mode without any problem, so if you want to be extra careful you can do that.Overall, Looking for Laika is an interesting game with a somewhat steep learning curve. But once you get it, it's actually quite entertaining. Just be prepared for some frustrating moments as you get your timing right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DJBPG4OUG09Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XW4A3HG#wasThisHelpful","R2DJBPG4OUG09Z","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always wanted a KillaWatt and after a lot research, I decided on this model. It's basically a derivative of the P4460 Pro model but with the ""made for Dummies"" marketing spin, and it includes the Pro's most important feature - battery backup. This means that when you unplug the KillaWatt, it retains the usage recorded (how many hours at what rate). This combined with the lower cost compared to the Pro made it a no brainer. I bought this in April '15, and since then I've realized that there's a couple points where this model actually wins over the Pro:1. the user interface is more logically organizedThe buttons are clearly labeled and you should have no problem using it without even glancing at the user's manual. There's a dedicated $ button for the cost, followed by buttons that toggle between Watt/VA, Volt/Amp and KWH/Hour. The yellow Pro button at the end allows you to see all the info plus detailed data about your CO2 emission (day/week/year/total) and cost (day/week/year/total).A couple useful pointers that may not be immediately apparent:-to clear the stored usage data, press and hold down the KWH/Hour key in standard mode.-to change the KWH cost to your local rate, go into Pro mode and press and hold the $ button until it flashes ""rate"". Update it to your local rate and press the Pro button to save-to change the pound of CO2 emission per KWH, go into Pro mode and press and hold the Watt/VA button until it flashes ""rate"". Update it to your local rate (you can get this info by contacting your local power company) and press the Pro button to save2. the user manualTrue to its nature as a ""designed for dummies"" product, this KillaWatt's user manual is well written and easy to follow!On the other hand, there's definitely some room left for improvements:1. Lack of backlight in the displayThe display doesn't have any backlight whatsoever. I get that it's probably good for not adding any extraneous power draw, but an option to light it for a second or two would be very useful since a lot of times, the unit would be in a tight spot behind appliances or furniture and it's almost impossible to read the screen without grabbing a flashlight.2. Front plug is extremely tightThe front plug where you plug your device in has an extremely tight fit. I have to really push and pull to plug and unplug devices. Here you definitely do NOT want to pull on the wire alone - it most likely will not unplug and you will damage your device and/or plug in the process. While I appreciate a tight fit for a solid connection, this is a bit overboard. I think a couple other reviewers reported similar experiences, so it's probably not an isolated incident. Just be extra careful when plugging and unplugging devices.The device is rated to take max voltage of 125V @ 15A, or a total of 1875 VA. Another reviewer mentioned that his KillaWatt failed after using it to monitor his electric vehicle. That's probably above the device's rated capacity, which is why it died so quickly. I think as long as you stay within the rated envelope, the device should work fine.I've certainly learned a lot about my various other gadgets and saved some power/reduced my carbon foot print in the process. For example, most of the new cell phone chargers actually don't draw any discernible power when the phone is unplugged. That was a relief as it's a lot easier to have the chargers constantly plugged in. My old microwave with a digital clock was drawing close to 3 watts just idling - I've since decided to only plug it in as needed. It's also fun to verify the performance of my new LED light bulbs - some actually perform better than their factor specs! My toshiba laptop has a nifty software monitoring tool that tells me how many watts it's drawing at any given time. And it turns out, the numbers match up with what I am seeing with the KillaWatt. Overall, I've enjoyed having this gadget and I highly recommend this model!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8PJ9BPQKFMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00685UBYQ#wasThisHelpful","RC8PJ9BPQKFMV","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my first ever trip to Yellowstone earlier this summer. On paper, the hat's design sounds like a winner, with full coverage from the sun for the neck and most of the face. On top of that, I thought the ability to customize the coverage needed is a great idea. In practice, the hat didn't work very well. Although the hat itself fit well for my average sized noggin, the mask and back flaps were a bit loose even after my best attempt to get a tight fit. In addition to making me look like a sloppily dressed terrorist, the flaps and mask were flapping around wildly at the slightest hint of a breeze. Almost immediately after I started on my first Yellowstone hike, I found myself constantly adjusting and readjusting the flaps, which would ride up incessantly. I tried it with and without the mask on in an effort to reduce the flapping, but that didn't help any. I have to admit, it was a bit hilarious getting all the looks from the other patrons. I know I looked ridiculous, which was half the fun, but it was annoying that I wasn't getting the sun protection in return. A buddy had a similar hat, but his was much more robustly built with heaving flaps that actually laid down in the wind - and his didn't have the mask either. I ended up channeling my tourist mode and bought a safari hat from a crazy hat salesman just outside of Yellowstone.I've included a couple photos of the hat (I got the blue version). With the neck flaps and mask removed, the hat is an okay cap. It's just when the extra covers are attached, the material is too thin and light-weight, and flaps around wildly at the hint of the lightest breeze.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZQT8R5UDFSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105E6040#wasThisHelpful","R3NZQT8R5UDFSR","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The water bottle arrived nicely packed - I was a little bit worried about dings to the bottle en route, thankfully it arrived in perfect shape. The pink hue actually looks better in person.

"First and foremost, Piano Master is a game and not a teaching tool. It's just like Guitar Hero, in that you score by mashing the right keys in the correct sequence. Due to the nature of the piano, which actually have keys as opposed to guitars, I suppose there is some value of this as a guide for playing very simple versions of the included songs on the real piano if you really wanted to.As a game, this is actually surprisingly entertaining. I like how customizable it is - you can choose different difficulty levels, number of keys shown (for different screen sizes I guess), what in-game messages and notices you prefer to see, etc. I counted 44 songs, and it looks like the developer is still actively updating periodically with new songs. If that's not enough, you can purchase more song packs that cover various genre of music.The game is clean without any extraneous advertising codes, and I didn't encounter any ads while playing. It does include Google Analytics, which is used to anonymously track the app's usage and performance for further development. The only permissions requested are for internet access, which is most likely for the links that take you to the song packs on the app store.Overall, if you like piano and enjoy Guitar Hero, this could be worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LIXZSUL4CXG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SY3CEW#wasThisHelpful","R3LIXZSUL4CXG4","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Joinz is a mix between 2048 and Tetris. I think it has great promise, but ultimately falls short due to an unnecessarily difficult game design that pushes it from being challenging to frustrating.GAMEPLAY & CONTROLYou slide around blocks trying to match the three goal shapes given to you at the top of the screen. Each slide moves the block as far as it will go in the desired direction. If there's nothing between the block and the opposing wall, it won't stop in the middle or any where in between. Once you got the blocks aligned, you join them by swiping them together. They then disappear and you get more blocks to play with, Repeat until you run out of space to maneuver.The control works fine, but the game desperately needs an undo button. This is certainly a cerebral game and requires lots of planning, etc. One bad move and you can potentially ruin the entire board. Being able to undo, even if it's only one step back, would make this game so much more playable and enjoyable.GRAPHICS & SOUNDThe graphics and sound are nice. Very laid back and soothing. You can turn off the music and sound effect if you wish, which is always nice.ADDONS & PERMISSIONSThe game has Chartboost which is an advertising module. I didn't encounter any ads while playing, so it's most likely inactive. It does have flurry analytics for those who care. Permission wise it seems okay, asking to access the internet (probably for social/facebook) and external storage access.The game does stay as an active program for a while even when you exit out via the back button. This can potentially lead to unnecessary battery drain.SUMMARYIt's an interesting concept and certainly fun and challenging. The problem is, it might be too challenging. After all, a game is supposed to be fun and enjoyable. If you are a puzzle game guru and looking for a challenge, this is certainly worth a look. For others looking for a more casual experience, this might not be the best fit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UD51YB0GJXUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY5586O#wasThisHelpful","R3UD51YB0GJXUW","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earn to Die is the original game in a series of Mad Max type driving game. The premise is simple - the world has gone to crap, and you got to get the hell outta dodge and make your way towards the evacuation point (apparently Seattle) or you'll be zombie brunch.GAMEPLAY & CONTROLThere are three game modes (Story, Halloween and Championship). You start out in Story mode with a basic beater car with minimal gas and performance. You start making runs towards your next checkpoint. Along the way, you'll smash into obstacles and zombies. At first, you won't make it very far because your car sucks and you have hardly any gas. But no worries - you earn money each run for the distance traveled and number of zombies smashed. Then you head back to the garage and choose what upgrades you want to put on your car. Be wise in pimping out your ride. For me personally, I prefer to up the tires and gas tank, followed by engine and blades for cutting down zombies. I've realized it's always more effective to upgrade to the next car instead of pimping out your current car. But since they get exponentially more expensive, it's up to you to find the right balance between saving up for the next car or pimp out your current ride. Decision, decisions!Control is achieved via virtual buttons in the lower corners of the screen. Your right thumb controls the gas pedal and boost (if you have it), and your left thumb controls tilting back and forth (popping wheelies, etc). They work very well, and it took me about 5 runs before the control became second nature to me.GRAPHICS & SOUNDThe game looks very good, even though it's a somewhat dated game. Everything from your car to the stage and background looks great with smooth animation. There's ample carnage when you start causing some damage, and the eye candy is matched with appropriately satisfying explosions and other sound effects.ADDONS & PERMISSIONSThis game is completely clean - no extraneous add-ons or ads or even analytics! The only required permissions are for internet and network state, presumably for the links that take you to facebook/twitter and the developer's sequel to this game. This is how a paid app should be.SUMMARYEarn to Die is a fun game with an intuitive gameplay and great eye and ear candy. Warning - it's very addictive. The clean design without any extraneous add-ons or permissions is what all paid apps should be.

"Floristry is a straight-forward adaptation of the -istry game format with a flowery flair, complete with soothing classical numbers serving as background music.GAMEPLAY & CONTROLThe goal is to clear the entire cube two small blocks at a time by matching cells with identical flowers. You can rotate the cube freely in 3D space by swiping in your desired direction. To select or deselect a block, simply tap it once. Tap another block with identical flower design on it and watch them beautifully disintegrate into nothingness. The tapping was surprisingly accurate on both small and large screen devices (HTC One M9, One M7, LG Realm) ranging from 4.5"" to 5.0"". The game almost always registered the right block. There's various modes of gameplay (puzzle, flower attack, stationary camera, one minute, five minutes, ten minutes) that presents different challenges and adds to the replay value. The only minor detail missing is that pressing back on the game's home screen doesn't seem to exit out of the game completely.GRAPHICS & SOUNDThe graphics is nicely done, with buttery smooth rotations and animations throughout. This was the case even on older devices like the LG Realm. The cube with all the flowers at first glance can be somewhat overwhelming, but it's not bad once you start playing. The background music is a nice collection of classical scores that you'll find familiar and pleasing. And you can turn the music and sound effects up or down as desired.ADD-ONS & PERMISSIONSThe game is very clean with no extraneous or unnecessary add-ons. There's the requisite Amazon licensing and login, as well as Amazon insights (analytics) and GameCircle (social gaming). There are no leftover modules for ads, and I did not encounter any ads during testing. The app only requires permission for internet access and network state - presumably for accessing services like GameCircle if you so choose. This is how a paid app should be.SUMMARYFloristry is a fun little matching game with nice graphics and music and accurate control. There's no extraneous add-ons or required permissions. All in all, if you like matching games and flowers, you should definitely give it a try. It's a certainly fairly priced at $0.99.

"Matchblocks is an interesting game - at first glance, I thought it was going to be yet another Bejeweled type match game clone. I quickly realized it's actually a cool hybrid that crosses two classic games - Tetris and Simon Says (the color matching toy from the 80s). Sounds intriguing? Well read on folks - unless you're partially or completely color blind, that is...GAMEPLAY & CONTROLThe game's premise is simple - blocks of various lengths fall down like Tetris, and the game's over when you don't clear them off the screen fast enough. To do so, you have to click the colors at the bottom in the order they appear on the blocks. A white dot appears in the blocks whose color you've tapped. For example, in the accompanying title pic, you've already tapped blue and purple - you have to tap teal next to clear this block. You can start at either end of each block, i.e. with this example, you could also tap teal, purple and blue to clear it. If you tapped purple by accident, you can clear your selection by tapping purple again. The number of blocks on screen gradually ramp up as you clear levels and move up in difficulty. Basically, it's like the Simon color matching toy, but with multiple patterns presented to you simultaneously in block form a la Tetris. The tricky part is, your clicks register on ALL the blocks simultaneously. So one pattern might clear one or multiple blocks. When I first started playing I felt like I was randomly pressing different color combinations and hoping for the best. I found that you just have to pick the block that's got the easiest pattern and focus on clearing it. This gets challenging quickly as the game ramps up in difficulty and pace.You also get ""obstacles"" which are white circles with various number of dots in them. These number of dots indicates how many times you have to tap each obstacle to get rid of it. There are also bonuses and ""bombs"" that will clear all blocks off the screen immediately.There are four game modes - Classic, Arcade, Time and Zen. I am not quite sure about the difference between classic and arcade, except for the running bar at the top for arcade. In Time mode, there's a running clock represented by the green bar at the top. In Zen mode, you choose how many colors and the difficulty stays constant, so you can keep playing without too much stress.GRAPHICS & SOUNDThe graphics is decidedly retro. Even the menu and help sections have the 8-bit look to them, which was a nice touch. One complaint I have is the choice of colors. The lime green and pale yellow are too similar in my opinion, and I tested it on several devices with good quality screen (HTC One M9, LG G2, LG Volt). I can only imagine this issue being more pronounced on devices that have AMOLED screens, where the colors are inaccurate to start out with.The sound isn't too bad - elevator music with clean sound effects that provide good feedback on your inputs.ADD-ONS & PERMISSIONSThe game has a couple add-ons that might be somewhat worrisome - AdMob and Chartboost (ads), Amazon in-app billing, Flurry. I didn't encounter any ads while playing, so those ads modules are most likely inactive and leftover from the free version. I didn't encounter any in-app purchases either, except for the links to other games by the same developer. Flurry is mostly harmless as long as the developer only uses it for innocuous app analytics (performance, etc).The required permissions are internet access and read/write access to external storage. They are most likely used to link to the developer's other games as well as sharing scores via Amazon Game Circle - should be harmless.Pressing back will eventually close the game completely - I like that.SUMMARYThis is an interesting hybrid of two classic games. It's easy to pick up and play with virtually no learning curve, yet it can get challenging fairly quickly. The color choices could have been better to improve visibility. The developer hasn't updated the game in more than two years - most likely there won't be any more updates. As it stands, it's a fun game that's decently priced. As today's free app of the day, I think it's worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELJ2C9VOYYGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEEZK70#wasThisHelpful","R3ELJ2C9VOYYGT","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My significant other was complaining about how dark her apartment's front door is, and after extensive research I decided to give these solar LED lights from Mpow a try. Here's my take a few weeks after installation:BUILD QUALITYThe lights came in good quality packing complete with a quick user's guide, mounting screws and a pin for the on/off switch (a thin needle will do just fine if you lose the pin). The LED lights themselves are enclosed in a thick plastic housing and feel solidly built - I was expecting worse quality to be honest, so this was a pleasant surprise. The manufacturer quotes a IP64 weather proof rating. This means they certify the lights to be completely dust proof and immune to water splashing in any direction. We've a had a few thunderstorms and one torrential downpour since installation couple weeks ago. So far, the lights are working perfectly.INSTALLATIONI didn't use the included mounting screws. Instead, I used one of those 3M double sided stickers that's rated for holding up 3lbs to put it up near the front door. Single sticker does the job easily, as expected. Was a little tricky making sure the unit received enough sun exposure. You turn the unit on/off by inserting the included pin into the small pin hole to the right of the motion sensor. The light will flash once or twice when you turn it on. Push again to turn the unit off.LIGHTING AND MOTION SENSOR COVERAGEThe motion sensor works as advertised, triggering ""high beam"" when there's any movement within the 10 ft/120 degree area in front of the light. After 10 seconds of inactivity, the light falls back to ""low beam"". The sensitivity was great - if anything it's ever so slightly too sensitive, which isn't an issue for us. I charged up the lights for an entire day before installation. So far, the lights have stayed lit by bedtime. Since it's already light out by the time I get up, I haven't had a chance to verify if it's staying up the entire night. I'll update with an answer if and when I get up early enough one of these days!The light produced by one unit is good enough to illuminate the front door at high beam. However, the color of the light is a bit off from the pictures in the description. My girlfriend's initial reaction the first night she saw the lights in action was that they made her apartment look like a haunted house - eerie was the word that came to mind. This was because when on low beam, which is most of the time, these units produce light that's quite purplish - it's way over the blue-ish tint that I typically associate with the 6500K CFLs in our kitchen. On high beam, the light is a bit whiter, though definitely still more purple than blue. It was bad enough that the GF actually wanted them taken down. Caveat numero uno.The other caveat is somewhat related to the color of the light, and that is the inability to turn off the always-on low light mode. I like the always-on mode, since it adds to overall visibility and safety. But the color of the low beam is just purplish enough to make me wish there's a choice to turn off the low beam mode while leaving the high beam intact. So, the light would be off normally, but the motion sensor would trigger the high beam when there's activity. Alas, that's currently not an option. Caveat numero dos.SUMMARYThis is a well built Solar LED light that has good sensitivity in its motion sensor and good illumination with its high beam. It also has survived multiple thunderstorms unscathed, supporting its IP64 rating. Installation was painless. However, the color temperature of the produced light is definitely eerily purplish, especially with the always-on low beam. This combined with the lack of ability to turn off the always-on low beam mode may be annoying enough for some people. If these two points don't bother you, then I certainly recommend you take a close look at these.UPDATE 6/20/2015: I've had to get up earlier the past week and I noticed the light actually runs out of juice around 5 am. It's still dark enough that I don't think it's being turned off by the light sensor. The way that I have it positioned, it gets direct sunlight from noon to around 3:30pm or so, and this is during June. Will update during winter later this year.Also, last night I noticed the torrential downpour was triggering the motion sensor, causing the light to run at high beam almost continuously. I don't think this is a negative per se - just means the sensor is that sensitive. Of course, this probably means the light will be out of juice earlier in the night than usual.UPDATE 8/30/2015: with the days getting shorter, the number of hours of direct sunlight on the light has decreased accordingly. I've noticed that the light going dead shortly after midnight several times now, presumably due to insufficient charging. Lesson - definitely position these for the direct sunlight - indirect exposure is definitely not enough to keep it charged up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D79G2OK2F2T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RE2AM0U#wasThisHelpful","R1D79G2OK2F2T4","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, Amazing Breaker looks to yet another game where its best quality is the pretty eye candy. After playing through the first few levels, I found myself unable to put the phone down - the gameplay while basic and intutive is surprisingly addictive and fun!DESIGN & GAMEPLAYPremise of the game is simple - you're supplied with certain number of bombs for each level, and your goal is to destroy as much of the glassy object as possible using your ammo stash. To advance to the next level, you must destroy at least 90% of the object (you can see your progress in the counter in the lower right hand corner). As new bombs are introduced, there's a quick tutorial at the beginning of each level showing you how they work. Controlling the bombs is easy with good precision. Scoring is similar to games like Angry Birds - you earn points as well as stars (one to three) for each level. There are 6 stages with 20 levels each, for a total of 120 levels. I am guestimating the average gamer would take probably a few hours to complete the game. The replay value is very good since the star system serves as good motivation for going through completed levels in an attempt to get perfect 3-stars in all of them.The gameplay is surprisingly addictive and satisfying, especially when you get a good combo detonation that takes out a good chunk of your target. Great stress reliever!GRAPHICS & SOUNDThe game has some very nice eye candy - the targets look sharp, colorful and great. The various bombs look great too, and they are accompanied by very nice explosion animations and sound effects. The music is nice - I thought it was nice fit, not too frantic but not too slow either. Overall, the audio visual effects come together nicely for a very satisfying experience.ADD-ONS & PERMISSIONSThe included add-ons and required permissions are innocuous as far as I can tell. It includes Amazon licensing, Amazon Insights (analytics), Game Circle (online scoreboard) and no ads module whatsoever. The permissions are for internet and wifi access. These network accesses are most likely needed for the social networking (Facebook & Twitter included if you like sharing) as well as crash reports. The total installed size is about 52MB.SUMMARYAmazing Breaker is a fun way to kill a few minutes, especially if you need some stress relief. I encountered no ads and no crashes while playing through the game. I did encounter installation problem on both of my test devices (HTC One M9 and LG G4), but I think it might have been related to the Amazon Appstore. For $0.99, I think it's a great value. As today's free app of the day, it's definitely worth a look!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N4V36JDW5SDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJ92MNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2N4V36JDW5SDO","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've bought multiple packs of this for my extra sensitive nose over the past two years, and I can say with 100% confidence that it works just as well as its brand name counterpart Sudafed PE. Both have the same active ingredient, phenylephrine HCL, in the same concentration of 10 mg per tablet. The filler material does differ, but those are suppose to be inactive by design and should not affect the drug's efficacy. This is my first line of defense against running nose. Usually this combined with claritin or zyrtec does a pretty good job clearing up my sinus. There are occasions where my allergy or sinus is particularly bad and this doesn't do much. For those cases, I'll bring out my ""big gun"" or pseudoephedrine (""original"" sudafed) before following up with this as maintenance.I've encountered no side effects whatsoever over the past two years on this, although this obviously will depend on each individual user since everyone's body chemistry is slightly different. The large 72-count box is now on my regular shopping list on Amazon. I would definitely recommend trying this out if you're looking for an inexpensive alternative to Sudafed PE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8XJXTFD9XFJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ2YR8G#wasThisHelpful","R8XJXTFD9XFJC","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this on sale with a coupon that Amazon periodically makes available. It works fine just like any other toothpaste that I've used in the past (Colgate and Arm & Hammer). The Crest's texture was noticeably different - it's a bit looser with what feels like small globules or particles in a somewhat thinner paste compared to what I've been used to. It's not a problem per se, just different. The only minor issue is the taste. It's minty, but tastes a bit too synthetic for me.Overall, no problem and the active ingredients are comparable to other similar toothpastes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLY8ELZH1RGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037LGIH8#wasThisHelpful","RCLY8ELZH1RGN","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a pair of these to replace the wipers on my '96 Pontiac Firebird. GM had designed the '93 to '97 4th Gen F-body (Camaro and Firebird) with a wiper attachment hook that's reversed 180 degrees compare to most cars out there. This makes finding suitable wipers very, very difficult. According to Amazon, these wipers are one of the few that fits properly. When I installed them and they actually fit (you have to remove the preinstalled hook attachment and put in the included larger J hook first), I was about to break out my happy dance. But alas, it was not to be. The wipers ended up losing contact with the lower 30% of the windshield shortly after the wiping motion starts. I tried moving the hook position and adjusting the wiper blades to give it more curvature and tension, but it was not to be. For the area that does make contact, the wipers do a great job - I noticed no streaking and absolutely no noise. This would be a five star product if it actually fitted properly. I wish there's a way to contribute and correct Amazon's database for the fit with regards to '93 to '97 camaro and firebirds with these wipers.If you're looking for replacement wipers for a 4th gen F-body, I suggest looking at the Trico 24-9R. I bought a pair of those and they fit perfectly, wiping the entire windshield throughout the wiping motion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVD0JXKCSMD10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009JKI8G#wasThisHelpful","RVD0JXKCSMD10","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As pointed out by some of the other reviewers, the Trico 24-9R wipers are the exact OEM replacement for the 4th gen F-body (Camaro and Firebird) from '93 to '97. In yet another brilliant design decisions by GM, the wiper hooks on the 4th gen F-body were a reverse J-hook. As a result, most wiper blades simply won't fit or will be turned 180 degrees. There are few that fits, such as the Rain-X weatherbeaters, but they end up missing parts of the windshield. I've literally tried just about every wiper available in my local Advanced Auto and Autozone, and the Trico 24-9Rs are the only ones that work perfectly.If you have a '93 to '97 Camaro or Firebird and need new wipers, this is it! Even better is that Trico sells wiper refills for $7 per pair. They fit perfectly and are a very cost effective - not to mention environmentally firendly - way to restore your wiper performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KC4TNHNKJRIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CRKOI4#wasThisHelpful","R2KC4TNHNKJRIU","A2AZG70U6VI4Y7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AZG70U6VI4Y7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have had several Yamaha receivers, and this one was a much-needed update from my RX-V663. Some of the latest (for this model) improvements are miles ahead of older (five years or more) models.The great things:1. Android/iOS apps are great. They offer superb functionality and control from anywhere in the home network. The UIs are similar so jumping from one device to another isn't a huge paradigm shift. The UIs also display album art and other controls depending upon the connected input device (USB, Pandora, AirPlay, etc).2. HDMI -CEC support is great. Even without programming other components into the remote (which is advisable, as menu, display, return buttons function on BD players), the remote can control other devices.3. Web control from any computer, Chromebook, or tablet in the house is just as handy. An undocumented setup URL to the receiver, exposing all the configuration options, is outstanding. No more searching the manual for the three-fingered salute method of getting to advanced settings.4. On-screen displays and information are great. You can enable or disable on-screen short messages. Missing, though is the display of input channels regardless to selected output DSP or processor. So to determine if a disc is giving me a 2.0 input, I have to enable the on-screen information. Previously (RX-V663) the front display indicated how many channels the receiver got from the HDMI or digital audio connection.5. Assignment of audio and video inputs. Ability to rename inputs (change ""AV2"" to ""Xbox"" or ""HDMI2"" to ""Chromecast"").6. Scene presets. Great to reprogram for a favorite, oft-used input like Chromecast, USB, Airplay. (See below regarding USB input.)7. HDMI pass-through. Don't worry if you don't know what this is. It allows a TV to show what's on a Blu-ray disc player without the amplifier being on; it will switch the input and ""pass it on"" while still in Standby mode.8. Multiple HDMI OUT. You can use #2 for a second monitor, or audio to a sound device, e.g. a sound bar. (HDMI OUT 1 has HDMI ARC, or Audio Return Channel, which carries Dolby Digital or DTS audio from the TV to the amplifier. HDMI ARC does NOT carry high def audio formats from the TV to the receiver! Many people make the assumption that they can plug their BD player in the TV and carry the Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD back to the amp.)9. Multi-channel pre-outs (The RX-V675 does not feature these).10. Two LFE subwoofer outputs. For a medium- to full-size home theater, two subwoofers are recommended.Shortfalls:1. Airplay can barely get through a second song before disconnecting. Tested with iPod Touch and iPad under iOS 7.x, 8.x. Worthless.2. Pandora loses access to the service and give an ""Access error"" regularly. Tapping OK it recovers, but you shouldn't have to. (Comparison: my Samsung SmartTV plays Pandora for hours on end.) Under previous firmware, I had to turn off Network Standby (always on the network), cycle power, and connect again. I no longer have to completely shut it down, but disconnections are frequent. Since the last firmware update (1.60/2.13) songs will start to stutter, and the software on the receiver will just skip to the next song. This is even more of an annoyance.So far that's two Net functions that fail. I have a Netgear Nighthawk R6700 router, the receiver is connected by a b/g/n router acting as a wireless bridge, the receiver has a static IP address, and I've tried numerous DNS nameservers (Google public, my ISP, my domain host), no improvement.3. No video up-conversion from 480p or 1080i component video (RGB) in to HDMI out. My RX-V663 did this, so dropping it from a 700-series amp is a needless cost-cutting measure. I'd have to get the RX-A1030 or better to restore this upscaling. Is this critical? No, component video sources are getting antiquated, and this unit has oodles of HDMI IN connections. Still, it's an embarrassment that a RX-V775 must have a separate component video connection to the flat screen.4. On-screen display of the analog (component) video is ""???"" for 480p or 1080i. Oddly, it's happy with 480i. This is just stupid. I have to use the receiver because I have two devices with component video input.5. USB input cannot be selected with the input selection knob; it doesn't automagically switch to USB when you connect a compatible device. You HAVE to select the ""USB"" button on the remote. Silly, since you're likely to be plugging something in at the front of the receiver and need a way to switch to it. Workaround: reprogram a SCENE button for the USB if you use it regularly.6. The manual continues a tradition of not really explaining some of the options well. Eco modes? Tried it, disliked it, never looked at it again.7. Lack of wi-fi connectivity. (Later models have this built-in.) You either connect via CAT5 Ethernet, or buy a separate dongle. (Yamaha has an expensive one, but search for a ""wi-fi to Ethernet adapter,"" you'll find lots in affordable price ranges, particularly small ones designed for gaming.)BOTTOM LINEFor a model that's a few years out of date (the RX-V777 is the current model as I write this), this should be a bargain where you find it (I presume you're reading this review while researching the model). Depending upon the deal, it may be a lot of receiver for the money, or a second-rate choice next to another purchase option. The network features can be very handy, but the only ones I've found 100% reliable were the web and mobile device controls, DLNA and local area network server are satisfactory in my limited use. As a basic central control for a hi-fi, the RX-V line are good value, and the RX-V675 and RX-V775 offer a lot of flexibility.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AMM6Q6HTD8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B981F2Y#wasThisHelpful","R26AMM6Q6HTD8A","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A great late 90s concert video, and a better bargain than the US$15.99 CD (which has fewer songs, albeit different cuts). You can do as I do, just put it in the DVD player and turn off the TV after starting main video. Some nice little extras too, including multiple angle options on some songs. The latter allows you to select one camera for the whole song (e.g. side to side pan, close on Sarah, wide static shot of stage); you can get motion sickness from the constantly-on-the-move camera, but just watching the singer instead of cutting is a nice change of pace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIFX02E4S1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001ODGH#wasThisHelpful","R1IIFX02E4S1I","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a review of the 2003 single-disc release ASIN:B00005JKFR, which includes extras apparently from the Laserdisc release.

One of the interviewees on the 80-minute ""Making the Earth Stand Still"" documentary mentions ""this Laserdisc release."" The headline for my review is a result of reading reviews of the 2008 release (DVD and BD, timed for the remake release) that identify that ""Making the Earth Stand Still"" is missing, replaced by a shorter piece.

"Predator (Ultimate Hunter Edition) is anything but Ultimate. The 2-disc collector's edition DVD release looked okay, sounded fine, and had so many interesting remembrance interviews, production filming interviews, photos, outtakes, hilarious stories from cast and crew, you name it. The previous BD release left those out inexplicably -- probably so Fox could rerelease again and make more money. Talk about being greedy! So now they release a BD version of the collector's edition, called Ultimate Hunter Edition here, and ... oh no. They did something awful. The reviews on BD review sites are right, the digital noise reduction used on this remaster was turned up to 11, so to speak, resulting in a removal of benign film grain, and in some scenes even details that were captured on film. In some shots, you can't tell - the details are crisp, but in other shots there is such a blurring of the image and loss of details that it looks like one of those pics that people do artistic treatments on in Photoshop. Those pics don't look like the original, and in some shots Predator doesn't look like the film I saw in theaters all those years ago. It's overbaked. Whoever did this just wasn't paying attention to their work.It's known that the stock wasn't ideal for the filming conditions, they were filming in pretty difficult location circumstances, so there was visible grain, loss of focus,... it added to the film. This was a perfect production, but the combined talents of all parties involved made the film bigger and better than it looked. That's part of PREDATOR's charm. You can make a brilliant, original film on low budget and tech (e.g. PRIMER), while Michael Bay makes boring, predictable fluff with unlimited resources. Trying to change how the film looked on its original camera negative is just blundering revisionist history.It's a great disc to get for the extras, many of which are also in HD (nice, Fox). Nice menu design, etc.  But the remastering of the film is awful, Fox ought to be ashamed (particularly considering how great the latest ALIEN remaster is, crisp and clear and looking like it was filmed yesterday, but without any noticeable image ""enhancement."" I'm tempted to get the 2008 BD since reviewers claim it's not the best the technology offered in 2008, but at least the film wasn't overbaked. I got this for $4.99 at Best Buy during Christmas shopping, so I wouldn't consider it a waste of money. But if you're looking for the best value in a single disc for this film, wait for Fox to correct the transfer in a future release, or get the 2008 BD.For those will claim that my results are attributable to a badly adjusted TV, or Blu-Ray settings turned up high, no. My BD player has all enhancements and tweaks turned off so that only the plain disc content is sent to the TV. My Samsung ES6150 LED TV is also adjusted to accurate color representation, with all enhancement and ""correction"" options turned off for BD viewing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRHHEIM67O9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L16FAE#wasThisHelpful","R1CRHHEIM67O9H","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** See my update below **Very nice case for the Mini. Thin, light, holds the tablet very securely. Seems very durable. Super stong magnet will hold it in the easel position for quite a while, even while tapping on the screen (a lot of case makers forget that these devices have TOUCH screens).The bad news, and no surprise here, is that the keyboard for a 7"" table is going to be quite petite. Keys are as big as they could make them, but some design shortcuts to fit them all in this form factor are baffling. The super small backspace/delete button is hardly there.There are numerous function keys that work in iOS 8.1, but the nifty keys to change keyboard (8 supports third party keyboards; I'm a Swiftkey devotee) and make the onscreen keyboard appear or disappear are inconsistent.If you can get a good deal on this case, you oughtn't be disappointed. But don't expect this to make your Mini a laptop replacement. It's still a 7"" tablet.August 2015 update: I'm on my second unit now. Why? The bracket which covers the power button is very weak due to the cut out power button. If you accidentally flex that corner to remove the iPad, or forget to insert the ipad in that corner FIRST and THEN snap it into the other bracket at the bottom (the ""home button end""), you will break the bracket with the iPad's power button. The iPad can slide ever so slightly out of the brackets during use, it's easy to slide it back up, but when this one bracket is broken, the iPad slide more easily, and the power button is held down, prompting for the Shut down screen.Logitech should design this bracket better. Since only two of them hold the iPad Mini in place, they need to be sturdy and resilient to stress. An easily broken piece of plastic ruins this product.

"Great shave cream. The fragrance was a bit weak for the first shaves (about an inch of the tube), but as I use it more, the scent has blossomed. It's a very nice, refreshing scent, nice contrast to Musgo Real Classic. The cream forms a rich, smooth lather, great for double-edged blade shaving. It's also a pretty good value, dollar for ounce.

"After splashing on some Lucky Tiger After Shave and Face Tonic, this simple but effective moisurizer seals in, well, moisture, so your face doesn't dry out. After washing, soaking in a a shave cream, scraping off a layer of skin, then splashing an astringent, the face easily dries out post-shave. A balm like this restores its natural ability to keep the moisture in and not turn to leather. If you don't use a combination after-shave balm (has both the astringent, disinfecting and soothing ingredients, and a moisturizer), then this is the ticket, particularly if you use Lucky Tiger Bay Rum After Shave (which I come to like as both after-shave and after-shower splash).See my ""So you want to shave like a pro"" guide for more suggestions and above-average products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYIU69NCPLEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JU4UL0#wasThisHelpful","R2OYIU69NCPLEM","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great set of high quality shaving products. Gentle face wash to prep, liquid shave cream to lubricate and keep the beard wet (works best with a badger shave brush), after shave tonic to soothe and disinfect the face, and moisturizer to protect and retain moisture. Has a great refreshing scent that harkens back to old times. Comes in a neat, reusable tin. Got this as a Christmas gift and immediately ran upstairs to get out of my bathrobe and try it out.  Gf approved of the results. ;)If, like me, you want to replenish these as they run out, here are the individual products:Lucky Tiger Face Wash, 8 OunceLucky Tiger Liquid Cream Shave, 5 OunceLucky Tiger After Shave and Face Tonic, 8 OunceLucky Tiger Premium Facial Moisturizer, 3.4 OunceI only wish they offered this fresh, citrus and clove fragrance as a cologne. Without my beloved Bay Rum, I've been left to wander the wilderness of contemporary men's fragrances, many of which appall me.UPDATE:Here's my shaving routine, derived from Charles Hix' LOOKING GOOD, barber instruction, and decades of experience.- Wash the face with a gentle cleanser (not bar soap, which can dry the skin) to wet and soften the beard, then rinse with lots of warm water.- Lather up with a good shaving cream (or shaving soap, if you must), using a pure badger brush and bowl. Cream is better because it will retain moisture better (keeping the beard wet), lubricate the blade as it passes, and even protect the skin a little. Some soaps are specially formulated to perform similarly. The real test is, does the blade slide easily across your face as whiskers are sliced off? Does your face feel any discomfort? Does your face dry after the blade has passed? Do you have to keep reapplying lather even before you've passed the blade on that area?- Rinse the blade of whiskers frequently in a sink with standing fresh water. (Don't leave the water running, it's wasteful.)- Done? Rinse the face with handfuls of warm water until all the cream and cut whiskers are gone. DON'T DRY OFF. Leave the water on to rehydrate your face. Be careful not to wash the small cut whiskers into your eyes.- Rinse the shaving stand of lather if necessary. Rinse the razor thoroughly, let it air dry with the blades up to dry first. Rinse the badger brush THOROUGHLY in warm water, until clean. Shake out the excess water (you could even gently towel it dry if you're traveling), let dry with the bristles down (you don't want water pooling at the handle). Set razor and brush aside to air dry.- Dry the excess water off your face. Apply an after shave tonic or lotion. The best products will not have much alcohol or any alcohol at all, as this stings and dries the face. Straight witch hazel is an economical alternative. An after shave tonic should not have much fragrance (fragrances are often based on alcohol), but based on something soothing like witch hazel or other light astringents. Other ingredients will vary. Some after shaves will have some additives to sooth and protect, others will be so light as to dry quickly. All should perform the same duty: soothe, disinfect, protect, and maybe have an appealing scent that doesn't linger.- Apply a moisturizer or after shave BALM. After shave balms may combine the soothing and disinfecting ingredients of an after shave TONIC with a moisturizer for a one-step solution. The primary use of a balm is to moisturize, or rather (since the water you rinsed with hydrated the skin) LOCK IN the moisture you've already applied. There should be no need to wipe or rinse off the after shave tonic; its ingredients will continue to sooth and heal your face. You needn't use a fancy, expensive moisturizer. Aveeno, Oil of Olay, and Neutragena make excellent products that won't cost you too much.- Work the moisturizer into your face to protect it from outside elements. Towel off excess oil if there is any (there oughtn't be, in my view).- Apply a modicum of fragrance (cologne or eau de toilette) sparingly to the warm zones of your neck where you HAVEN'T shaved (the alcohol will reverse all the good you've just effected with care and good products!). Listen up: less is more where great colognes are concerned. A cologne that dissipates and can't be detected an hour later is a rip-off. Ladies will appreciate your cologne if it's barely perceptible ... until they snuggle in close.Some confuse ""after shave"" with cologne or fragrance. Wrong. They have entirely different compositions and purposes. An ""after shave"" that is loaded with alcohol and fragrance is either mislabled, or a lousy product. That famous HOME ALONE poster image is a case of a little boy thinking that cologne is slapped on your freshly washed (and highly vulnerable) face. Resist the temptation for self-mutilation and stick to a proper after shave tonic or balm.See my ""How to shave like a pro"" guide for more great products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C5M15SRMWIPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015WH3MK#wasThisHelpful","R1C5M15SRMWIPQ","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Disclosure: Lucky Tiger/Barbicide sent me a bottle to sample and review.)Caswell-Massey has discontinued my favorite fragrance, a refined and lasting Bay Rum cologne branded Michelsen's Bay Rum. This leaves a huge void in my medicine cabinet. Shame on you, Caswell-Massey, you've been culling my medicine cabinet staples for years....Enter Lucky Tiger.... Lucky Tiger is an American barbershop brand of men's grooming products, produced since 1935. They were hugely popular in the 1950s. Their packaging and ""branding"" is retro and attractive. I've used  the Lucky Tiger premium line of shaving gear, since receiving  their Lucky Tiger Grooming Gift Set for Christmas, and falling in love with the quality, fragrance, and value for money that each product offers. Their liquid shave cream and after shave tonic  are excellent products for the price. A morning shave with Lucky Tiger really starts the day out with some panache.This Bay Rum after shave splash is part of their ""barbershop classics"" line. As an after shave, it's great. It contains minimal alcohol, and some soothing ingredients that will ease your face after a wet blade shave and prior to adding a moisturizer. (By itself it will not protect and moisturize, which is important after a close, wet blade shave.) It's a nice alternative to their premium after shave tonic. The 8 oz. bottle should last you for months. The more I've used it, the more I've enjoyed splashing a little extra on after a shower. That's not typically a man thing (or wasn't until AXE invented the fashion of men's ""body spray""), but let's get past that. It feels great, and your special lady will like it.Make no mistake, this is not cologne, and does not feature the pungent scent of West Indian bay leaf, lime, clove, and cinnamon  that I've come to love in a quality Bay Rum cologne. Lucky Tiger Bay Rum is agentle after shave tonic, and appropriately has only a very  faint trace of fragrance. This is surprising, because the fresh, citrus-y, clove-y fragrance of the premium Lucky Tiger products is quite nice; I'd be happy with a cologne with that scent. Lucky Tiger Bay Rum has a slightly more bracing feel on the face, more so than their premium after shave tonic due to a little more alcohol.I really like this Lucky Tiger product in its retro, barbershop  style (albeit plastic) bottle,... but my search for a refined Bay Rum cologne  continues. Until then, the Lucky Tiger line of shaving goods continues to make my morning routine a lot classier.See my ""How to shave like a pro"" guide for more great products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCM09YMTII6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VTIXKE#wasThisHelpful","R3LCM09YMTII6I","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The iPod Touch runs iOS just like an iPhone. Runs iOS apps just like an iPhone. Has a  great, 16:9 ratio retina display, just like an iPhone. Has a solid CPU like an iPhone (same chip as the 4S).

" 7:37 MinsI bought a new Bamboo Duo stylus as I'm really pleased with my plain Bamboo Solo Stylus (CS100K). The replaceable soft nibs (and, now, firm nibs for a little more money) are a plus, if you are hard on your stylii.I've had compliments and inquiries on my YouTube Android OS tutorials about the Bamboo Solo. The Duo stylus is about 1/2"" longer than the Solo (the cap is longer), so a little more comfortable in the hand. Both stylii have some heft to them (made of brass, apparently), making them comfortable to use. The pocket clip can be removed from both of them making them more comfortable to pick up and hold. The Duo stylus is just as comfortable and nicely finished as the Solo. The pen cap snaps firmly into place over the pen, and the cap sits snug on the stylus end as well (no snap, just a strong fit from the rubber O-ring). (YES, the cap stays put. If you've read reviews that complain about the cap, watch my video all the way through.)Some complain about the nibs, but I'm happy with them. Kept clean, they slide smoothly across my Android and iOS device screens (some with screen protectors). The soft nib smushes pretty well, but the shape of the tip under the nib keeps it in contact with the screen. (Cheaper stylii have foam under the nib, so they can compress all the way to the metal sleeve on the barrel.) The tip actually extends out of the collar, so the nib should not compress all the way to the sleeve.It helps if your screen, and your nib, are clean.Now the bad news.Since purchasing it less than 9 months ago, the Solo received a hairline scratch while in a pocket, and the black finish started flaking off when I rubbed it with a fingernail. Disappointing from something you want to feel good in your hand, and only bought a few months eariler ... Wacom has replaced it under warranty, though! Worth considering when you're choosing between a cheap stylus and this stylus... who's got a warranty to back up their product quality?Now the really bad news.I've read some reviews from buyers who've determined that their Bamboos Duos are counterfeit, and many more reviews from unhappy customers with complaints that indicate their stylus is a counterfeit as well. (E.g. ""Pen cap comes off easily,"" ""rubber nib broke after a few days,"" ""pen clip was bent right out of the box."") In my case,  Wacom replaced my counterfeit with a genuine product under RMA (after seeing pics of the counterfeit). Watch my video review for a comparison of the two. If you have questions about the quality of Bamboo stylus, contact Amazon, or Wacom directly via their Support page. Take good photos of your suspected counterfeit Bamboo stylus.In addition to the video review, I've added pics to the product gallery. Take a look at those for more detail views.* If this review has been helpful to you, please click YES so other unhappy buyers can be alerted to the problem.

"The marketing for this filter is over the top, but the filter in the box isn't all that much better than a micronAir, Purolator, Fram, or other more affordable brands. It's a good, well-made filter. It's doing the job well. It just doesn't seem appreciably better than any other filter I've bought (including Honda/Acura OEM filters, made by micronAir and sold for between ten and fifty, yes, fifty dollars more than those you find on Amazon).The car makers recommend you replace these filters every 10,000 miles, it keeps your interior air clean and smelling nice. Some dealers charge as much as $60 for a job that takes less than five minutes, no special tools, and can be performed by the owner. Like an engine air filter, the more dirt and detritus that gets lodged in the filter, the less effective it is.

"I'm hoping this has the proper fragrance, as my tried and true favorite, Caswell-Massy's Michelson Bay Rum, seems to have died the death of so many of Caswell-Massey's old prduct line.I can't be without Bay Rum. Mixed with witch hazel and some other secret ingredients, it makes a superb, and gentle aftershave lotion. I've only found one or two better. Lucky Tiger after shave is great. But Bay Rum has a distinctive, old fashioned aroma that calls to mind Key West, Hemingway, Cuba, mojitos, swimming in ""Stingray City,"" warm nights dancing in a Puerto Rican discotheque, snapper and fried plaintains, and listening to a hundred coquis singing in the trees.It can also mean going to the Main St. barber shop and nervously getting into the steel and leather chair as all the older, grown men chuckle and rib you about ""when you're grown,"" then go on talking sports or politics or that blonde sauntering by the window. That smell might remind you of grizzled, career barbers who could clipper cut your head with only one eye open, shave your neck, then smack a little this on your to make you feel not quite so young.If none of this means anything to you, might as well just get one of those awful CK fragrances. Many of the expensive, department store colognes smell like a stew of confused smells, anyway. Bay Rum comes from a presumably simpler, but no more innocent time. Things weren't better then, but the memories you have of them mean the world to you. Bay Rum might transport you back.Go ahead and get an old Pan paperback copy of LIVE AND LET DIE and transport yourself to another time, another place.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CHJP3QV4SQQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000053L6W#wasThisHelpful","R3CHJP3QV4SQQM","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used amFilms before on my Nexus 7, and it's such a perfect fit on the tablet that I was a little concerned about this one. Not to worry, there's a little fudge space on the top and bottom, but after a few tries I had it positioned perfectly.[1] Including three in this pack lets you mess one up as a learning experience, and still have two as backup.Screen protectors aren't there to be pristine, they are there to take the scrapes, scratches and gouges that would otherwise fall upon your screen. After a while, they look beat up -- time to replace it! Offering a 3-pack is a great idea.Note about the fit. Though it's a good fit top to bottom (with cutouts for the front-facing camera and proximity/light sensor), the protector does NOT reach side to side. The Nexus 4 has an innovative ""roll off"" shape to the glass for usability, and the protector stops just short of the roll off point on the sides. Fault? No!. This prevents the protector from being caught and lifted by cases like the Poetic Palette SLIM Premium Hard Case (see my review) or the Poetic Slimbook Leather Case (yep, I reviewed that, too) that I use regularly. If you want a perfect fit, don't get these. If you want a protector that won't be mucked up by cases or bumpers, get this.The clear protector is hardly noticeable ... really. I hardly notice it.[1] My tips for positioning screen protectors.... Clean the screen with lens cleaner and then compressed air. Use a rolled up inverted roll of Scotch Magic Tape to position and lift off the cover (NOT your fingernails!). Use a fresh roll of tape to remove any motes of dust that get on the underside. Keep using the compressed air if you have to life and reposition. Use a firm, silicone kitchen bowl scraper or spatula to smooth bubbles out. When you've got it near perfect, YOU'RE DONE. Don't ruin a good job trying to get a perfect job, you'll be take the protector off in a year or so anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11O7KSLO54Z7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATWR0L6#wasThisHelpful","R11O7KSLO54Z7H","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good value case when you need a bit more protection for your phone. The phone sits securely in a back shell fixed inside this ""wallet"" type cover, leaving the charge, audio, power, and volume keys accessible (thought the volume keys are a bit hard to get to). Superb fit, the case closes perfectly without any cards or cash in the pockets. The magnetic clasp is pretty firm, but easy to open one-handed (I wouldn't try this over cement, though).As a companion to the Poetic Palette SLIM Case for Google Nexus 4, I really like this. I use either depending upon my attire, where I'm going, how much protection I need for the phone. The phone charges on the LG Nexus 4 wireless charger from Google IF you position it just right, but I'd take it out to charge.

"Bullitt is known for its signature (and ground-breaking) car chase sequence. The realism, and use of sound and editing to put the audience right in this escalating duel of muscle cars are a revelation to those who haven't seen it in its entirety, and context in the film.But the entire film, one of several that McQueen developed as personal projects, was a revolutionary in the tired ranks of ""cop dramas."" The muted storytelling and subtle way in which plot points developed (more reminiscent of European New Wave productions than regular Hollywood output) require more of an audience than simply showing up. You have to listen to dialog, watch the characters, and realize what's going on through deduction. When you do, the car chase becomes nerve-gratingingly suspenseful from the outset. On a double-bill with Le Mans [Blu-ray] you can appreciate that McQueen had a distinctive tone and intelligence that he wanted his star vehicles to convey. It's a pity that he didn't develop more projects like these.The BD comes with several extras, including a superb full-length bio pic on McQueen, and an in-depth feature on movie editing (which includes details about the car chase and other scenes in Bullitt). A period studio featurette on the film, as well as feature commentary from director Peter Yates, round out list of extras.Other reviews complain about the picture quality. Not every BD is a remastered release of studio print material ... So long as it's not the DVD rendering simply reprinted at BD definition, what you get on BD should be fine -- at a certain price point. These ""value"" BDs don't disappoint me if the rendering and menus are done reasonably well. Compared with the outright terrible The Brothers Grimm [Blu-ray] release, in which colors and definition go haywire in a few spots, this BD of McQueen's signature late 60s production is fine. The colors are consistent and well balanced for the film stock and cinematography of that time.For the current sale price, this BD is a good value IMHO for the devoted fan, or for those who've yet to see this film in its full widescreen, full-range sound presentation (important when you hear that Mustang really rev up).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTE1CW4C2D1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MV90IU#wasThisHelpful","RWTE1CW4C2D1F","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won this product from a web site contest, and have been using it regularly for several months. It provides a smooth, reliable charge for my HTC Amaze 4G phone, generally providing about 2.5 full charges from 20% or so.I also found during travels that this battery doubles as a charger. Just plug in, then plug in the  USB/microUSB cord and connect your phone/device. The Amaze uses an OEM 5W-1000mA chargers and takes up to 900mA during a full charge from 10%. This ZaggSPARQ works great in this regard; I've seen it provide up to 600mA of charge, more than sufficient for the phone.  I found it invaluable during air travel, working in remote offices, etc. The Zagg battery generally charges up from 80% depletion (one light lit) in a few short hours. It does seem to charge up even with a phone connecting that's sucking 300mA-600mA from it; as the phone takes less current, the ZAGGsparq charges up faster. So for travel, this doubles as a power source, and an overnight charger for a mobile device.The case is so-so quality. Not very rugged, so I carry it with a microUSB cable in a Case Logic PHDC-1 Portable Hard Drive Case. It fits very nicely, leaving room for a cable or two, and the hard shell of the Case Logic protects the battery from damage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RG4OJS9HG84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00343D2NC#wasThisHelpful","R20RG4OJS9HG84","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the SwitchEasy products I've bought for my iPod Classic, iPod Nano (3rd gen), and now this. Check my other reviews for yourself. ;)  They give you such a great value for money: case, port plugs, screen protector... In this case, the ""nude slim"" case for the latest (2012) iPod Touch is superb, it just snaps on to the back, giving you a better grip, protects that neat metal finish, and doesn't interfere with anything. The plugs for the lightning port and earphone jack (two of each!) fit nicely.The screen protector is the weak item in this kit. I'm pretty advanced in applying these to devices, and usually get a zero bubble, zero dust application. But I couldn't do so with these. One was trashed, the other is on with a couple of pieces of dust. I think the problem is their adhesive is stronger than 3M Scotch magic tape, which is my preferred way to remove dust motes that get sucked under the protector. Using compressed air and a microfiber, no-lint wipe most assuredly cleaned the screen, but the SwitchEasy screen protector just wouldn't come clean. Repeated attempts to roll off the dust ended up deforming the first of the two included in this. So, one star penalty.If you get a Moshi or other brand screen film, then this kit is still a bargain. I'd give another five star review but for that one glitch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5M3V5IS6ZEXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009I3KJJ2#wasThisHelpful","R5M3V5IS6ZEXX","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tarsem Singh knows how to give us a gorgeous film. And the set design, costume design (the last film work of visionary Eiko Ishioka), cinematography, all make this a visual feast for the eyes. The script, though very witty and smart, ends up with a rather predictable plot. What made me continue to watch was the production values and the cocktail party way in which the film plays with our expectations of the classic ""Snow White and Seven Dwarves"" tale, making fun of the original, with other retellings, and a film version. Fortunately, the film doesn't very often parody itself, so it remains true unto its own world. There are tons of puns and jokes and reverse twists that remind me of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, and I'm sure the filmmakers were well versed in the Rob Reiner classic.Entertaining to the very end, the credits begin with a Bollywood-style music video that would make me buy the BD ... if only they'd included the production number as a full-screen extra as many other films do. But no, the disc gives us other things we probably don't need.The BD is gorgeous, and the film lively and diverting (probably not for younger kids; Julia Roberts had her kids escorted from the set during shots so they weren't exposed to the dialog), I just wish we had that marvelous music video.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEE65YCU3FYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAII0S#wasThisHelpful","RSEE65YCU3FYL","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't ask me why, but my daughter (born 2002) LOVES these episodes.

"1-BD ""Future is Blu"" edition-*- -*- -*- -*-Crisp, clear, good color, and a great lossless DTS-HD soundtrack that'll rattle your windows. As other reviewers have noted, this transfer seems to be mastered from a pristine print. This BD also includes the restored William Walton alternate score in a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, original English mono, and French DD 5.1. That's it. None of the documentaries or commentary, just the film. So hang on to your Collector's Edition DVD set.2-DVD collectors edition-*- -*- -*- -*-The prior single-disc release of BATTLE OF BRITAIN was nice to bring back the memories, but lacking in extras. This two-disc set is superb, has many extras, including a 1969 studio featurette that shows an old friend and former Confederate Air Force flier and his pals who did stunt flying in their own Messerschmitts they'd just bought in Europe. The cast is all-star, everyone at the top of the game, and though not a lot of the film required great range from more than a few, the entire cast's talent gives this film gravitas and immediacy that carries us through to the sudden, uplifting ending.The Battle of Britain is a historic and treasured memory to all Brits, so it's impossible to see this film without considering that enormous weight fell on the production staff to ""get it right"" in so many details. Scenes with Robert Shaw (even more imposing than he was in producer Harry Saltzman's Bond film FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, if you can believe it), Ian McShane, Michael Caine, Trevor Howard, Kenneth More, Susannah York, and so many more take us straight from epic, historical scenery to very personal stories. I don't know how else to put it, they JUST DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THIS ANYMORE. Big budget, large cast, historical dramas like this are celebrated just for being completed ... THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN is an example of this type of film taken to the highest level, along with LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and others. Great script, too, which leaves a lot for you to follow and figure out. Stare into your popcorn for 10 seconds and you might miss some subtle dialog exchange.Laurence Olivier wanted his favorite composer Sir William Walton to score the film, and was put out when his shorter score was replaced with a longer, more rah-rah score by Ron Goodwin. Story has it that Olivier threatened to walk unless something of Walton's music was kept, so the dramatic ""Battle in the Air"" suite remains. This disc lets you watch the entire film with Walton's more reserved score in full stereo.In all, this is THE way to enjoy this film. You could spend a whole second evening going through the extras, and it's worth it. You'll appreciate just how difficult it was to make this film, and dedicated everyone was to overcome all difficulties.The package includes a special slipcover with commemorative image (see my pics in the picture gallery), and three-fold liner notes. Summed up, this ""collector's edition"" (a phrase that's lost its meaning mostly) has as much as you could possible want. Worth the expense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171W0AUCN9HGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ASDFEK#wasThisHelpful","R171W0AUCN9HGP","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are ""Race Tracker"" headphones for use with a scanner in the loud environment around, ahem, a racetrack. (See my pic of the product packaging in the product gallery.) Essentially the same product as those red ones they sell with the NASCAR sticker on them.I've worn these as a corner worker (flag marshal) in several races with a Uniden BC72 scanner, and they work great. A nice feature is the mono/stereo switch on the cord, not the headset earcups where you can't find it while wearing it.Several reviewers have been baffled about the spring being in the rear, not the top like conventional ""studio"" or ""music"" headphones. This is to accommodate wearing the 'phones with a wide brimmed hat when you're exposed to the sun all day, like at a racetrack. The velcro strap goes UNDER the hatband. One reviewer even mentioned the ""wires point upward."" The spring goes in the back, folks, not on top! ... The rear spring is snug on purchase, it CAN be bent gently for a looser fit, though after a few days' wear they did this naturally. Okay, who wants to wait a few days, or weekends -- go ahead and gently bend them, but not too far. Worked for me.Noise suppression (for un-muffled, race-tuned engines, folks, not office conversation or kids' piano practice) is pretty good for an economical headset. I've worn these all day at Turns 11, 17, and 14 at VIRginia International Raceway, where you're as close to the cars at speed as you'll be anywhere (about 5' from racecars going by abut 45-75 MPH). My ears were still comfortable, my hearing just fine, after an 8 hour work day (13 hours at Turn 14).If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Bose ACTIVE noise cancelling music headphones, KEEP LOOKING. These aren't the droids you're looking for! These are PASSIVE hearing protectors and mono/stereo headphones for listening to a radio scanner, or just protecting your hearing from the 90dB+ environment of a race track (or airfield, for that matter). The fact that they sound okay (and I emphasize, only okay, for the price) is because they are primarily for a high-decibel environment where you are blocking out aviation or racetrack noise and listening to a radio. If you want something to listen to music on a personal music player, you can get better over-the-ear or in-ear-monitor stereo headphones for the same price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B9E8GJ67CG5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Z6Q6#wasThisHelpful","R2B9E8GJ67CG5D","A2V7EO331SFUF6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V7EO331SFUF6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:Top notch compressor that allows for two simultaneous hookups and more than enough compression to run them both.Compressor is quiet enough that it shouldn’t cause permanent hearing loss (watch out when letting the air out, it’s much louder)Compressor is just the right size for a “job site” compressor, allowing for near continuous use of air tools and it fits easily in the back of a truck.Built in cord control on the compressor.Perfectly adequate brad nailer with option for a push to fire modification (not included)Accurate depth on the brad nailer.Hook, on the nailer allows you to hang the nailer from a belt, a ladder or the wall when you need your hands free for setting up the next step of the project.I ran 4k nails through the gun to test it and it didn’t jam on me once.Cons: Make sure your wearing ear protection when you drain the air and moisture out of the bottom, it’s way louder than the compressor.Price: Let’s face it, there is a premium for the DeWalt name, there are certainly cheaper serviceable options out there.I’m nitpicking here but I wish the cord was a little longer.

"First, pros and cons then my overall impression.Pros:1. Really light: easy to carry between floors.2. Great suction: no problem removing hair from a sink, or dog hair (short haired dog) from a carpet.3. Easy to push: no motor assistance but it glides well.4. Spinning carpet attachment for stairs: A great tool, hampered in this case by other features (see below)Cons:1. No way to deactivate the roller when cleaning a bare floor.  Which worries me in terms of scratching finished floors and also contributes to noise.2. Really loud… All vacuums are loud, this one is louder than most and probably passes the 80 dB threshold for permanent hearing loss (based on comparison with an air compressor I know is 70 dB).3. Only one extension for the wand means you have to hunch over when cleaning along the base of cabinets or other narrow areas.4. Vacuum has a tendency to tip when the wand is in use: Although there is plenty of stretch in the tubing the vacuum tends to shift and overbalance if you put even a moderate amount of tension on it. WARNING: vacuum form the bottom of stairs to the top (as supposed to top down) so that you don’t pull the vacuum down the stairs and hit yourself.Overall: The Eureka has great suction, and does an excellent job of vacuuming which, ultimately, is its purpose.  However, many of the negatives here make using the vacuum a chore (well more of a chore than just vacuuming), there are simply too many negatives here for me to recommend this vacuum.  This is however, the second Eureka I have had that does an excellent job cleaning so I would recommend looking at other vacuums in their line.As always, if you found this review useful, or didn’t, please vote and let others know.

"If like me, you had no idea a product like this existed, you probably have no idea what it does or how to use it.  The SpyderCHECKR is an additional tool for color management.  Until recently I thought of color management as a two-step process, 1. Calibrate the monitor, 2. Use appropriate color profiles with printer to ensure it matches the screen output.  I was however, ignoring the crucial 3rd step, camera calibration.  Enter the SpyderCHECKR 24.  All you do is take a picture of the color template, load the software and follow the instructions for calibrating.  Then you load the profile into lightroom (or another photo management app) and apply it.  The result is that your pictures will match the colors you saw when you took them, saving a lot of time you would have spent adjusting.What’s the catch?  Depends how much of a perfectionist you are.  To really get perfect results you need to create profiles for every lens/body combination.  In addition, you have to be very particular about the lighting setup used when you photograph the SpyderCHECKR calibration sheet.  You should try the recommend setup.  However, there are numerous users who recommend that you make a profile for each lighting setup you use, the same way you would with white balance.  I would try both and see what you prefer.Regardless, this is a tool that will simplify the color correction part of your workflow, and I highly recommend it to all photographers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BT7I6HCR96FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPS46TW#wasThisHelpful","R1BT7I6HCR96FJ","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will provide my thoughts starting with an overall impression followed by a pro-con format.At least as far as I can tell the Jam Storm is a premium version of the Jam classic speaker.  The biggest difference is the increased battery time (12 v 4) hours.  The other additional feature ""Storm"" is a bottom mounted transducer for bass.  Essentially the device sends vibrations through the bottom of the speaker and into the surface it sits on, turning the surface into a bass.  Unfortunately the results for this vary greatly depending on the surface, how well the speaker is sticking to it, and the listeners proximity to that surface. I got the best results with a decent sized wood table that had some flex in the top.Pros:1) Enough volume to fill a small-medium sized room without any distortion.2) When used for individual listening, provides a vastly superior bass experience to any small speaker I have tried.3) Decent battery life (and accurately listed I got ~12 hours in my test)4) Above average wireless range (still below advertised) (got ~20 ft outdoors without dropping the source, indoors it varied by obstruction but  ~20 ft despite being in different rooms etc.5) Audible indication of actions: I like this feature, but some people might find it annoying.6) Auto off: relatively fast auto off helps preserve battery life.Cons:1) At the top of the volume range there is a fair amount of distortion2) Storm bass does nothing if you are holding the speaker or it is on an object that will absorb the vibrations, like the ground.  Doesn't produce great bass on really rigid surfaces either.3) Bass is limited in affect area: Sound expands  as a cone, the cone from this transducer will be down and up from the source, so if you put it on a flat surface you have to be either above it or in close proximity to really get the effect of the Bass.  Even 4-5 ft away the storm feature doesn't seem to add much.4) Battery seems to drain fairly quickly in standby mode.  I charged it fully then left if for a week and it was dead.5) The charge is not usb, which would be ideal for a portable speaker.6) The charger wall wart is huge and really limits the number of places it can be placed... moreover it will almost always cover more than one outlet on a strip.Conclusion: I feel that the Storm is a mixed bag, is it better than the JAM classic? Absolutely.  Is it good enough to warrant is premium price tag?  Maybe if you love bass, otherwise I would wait for it to drop before you purchase.If you found my review helpful (or not) please click to let others know, and feel free to comment, I track and respond.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REGOYNYVRXBEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3KW0QS#wasThisHelpful","REGOYNYVRXBEF","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the most part the at a glance books are the same formula.  A page of text on one side, a full page drawn graphic on the other side.  However, on many topics I find that they are too superficial lacking the depth to make them true study aids and instead acting as broad strokes overviews of any given topic.  That said, if you want to have an idea about a given system without the depth of Guyton & Hall, or you want more pictures to help you understand a subject, they are useful.I was however, surprised with the depth of ""The Reproductive System at a Glance.""  This book provides much more detail than many others in the series and will give its readers a sound foundation in reproductive physiology, anatomy, and pathology.  Although there were fewer illustrations than in some of the other ""Glance"" books I found them useful and felt they compliment, the text nicely.I won't say I loved this book but it would be a solid addition to your library and I do recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOOOX580JKHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118607031#wasThisHelpful","R2TOOOX580JKHW","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I typically think of vacuums as follows:Uprights, are heavy and great for carpets, but annoying on stairs.Canisters are usually a little lighter, easier to use on stairs and better for bare floors.Cordless stick vacs are more like electric brooms, have relatively little suction and aren't meant for vacuuming a house.This Bissell while primarily an upright tries to combine the benefits of all three categories by offering a cordless option and allowing you to remove the ""capsule"" to carry it up stairs.Pros:1) Decent suction, pulled sand off of an office style carpet with no problem.2) Versatility, especially the ability to go cordless for 20-30 min, which is probably enough to vacuum a small apartment without ever having to worry about the cord.3) ability to change suction settings is ideal for drapes, or other delicate fabrics.Cons:1) Suction could be better.  Left enough dirt residue on a tiled bathroom floor that it still felt grimy and sweeping still collected a decent pile of dirt.2) Weight: the whole vacuum weighs 18.4 lbs.  Not abnormal for an upright, but the capsule weights 13.4 of those lbs making it awkward to carry up the stairs or use to vacuum on shelves or other off the floor vacuuming.3) Stair vacuuming: No spinning attachment for stairs means it doesn't do a great job vacuuming carpeted stairs.4) Difficult to push / Tilt Angle: I found that the vacuum was particularly difficult to push, the vacuum only tilts backward a little bit then the front lifts off the ground (which prevents the vacuum from working well), as a result I couldn't tilt the vacuum enough to get a strong push, and pushing, even across very short carpet was really difficult.5) No carpet height adjustment6) No motor assist.Conclusion:I'd rather have either a dedicated upright or a dedicated canister.

"Feel free to skip to the end if you just want my overall impression.Pros:1. Great protection, I didn't intentionally drop my phone on this or anything, but it is rated against drops of 6' and vibration, and it is a substantial 2 part case with a lip that would protect the face, against face drops.2. Added weight from the ""wallet"" ensures that the case pretty much always lands on the back side further protecting your screen.Cons:1. It's too large: My determination of this is based primarily on the fact that I couldn't get it to stay in any dashboard mounts I tried.  The phone was too thick with this case on and would fall out.2.  Wallet is difficult to open: Practically stuck close and required a significant amount of effort to open.  And there is no easy way to get the leverage required to open the case.  Obviously this will reduce accidental opening, but a button release of some sort would have achieved that goal more efficiently.3. Only enough space for a couple of cards.  IMO you really need space for 3 cards + cash or 4 cards minimum.  Why? License, Credit Card, Insurance Card + either cash or debit card.  This case doesn't provide sufficient storage for what I consider to be the essentials.  But that's my opinion.  Maybe yours is different.Overall: There are cases that are smaller that provide close to or equivalent protection for your phone, there are probably better phone wallets out there.  I would pass on this one, but still if you need max protection and never use a dashboard mount you might like this.As always if you found this review helpful (or if you didn't) please click and let others know.

"I have owned the Bosch DLR130K Digital Distance Measurer Kit for about 6 months and I have compared it to the NWi LSC60 fairly extensively.Comparison: Based on accuracy, consistency, ease of use, additional features, and price***Feel free to skip to the conclusion***Accuracy and ConsistencyConsistency: 3 measurements at each of the above lengths.Accuracy: Tested inside at 5, 10, 20 and 30 feet.Results: At all distances both units were extremely accurate and consistent, yielding results within 1/16 of 1"" of a tape measure measurement.  Additionally they yielded the same results on each of the 3 measurements.Ease of Use:1.  I found the Bosch more intuitive to use, especially in terms of turning the unit on and off.  I initially thought the NWi unit was defective as the power button failed to turn it on... However it turns out the power button turns the unit off and the Meas button turns the unit on.2. Lasers on both units are somewhat difficult to see outside on a bright day but I found the NWi clearer than the Bosch.3. The NWi has a backlight for the screen which helps when measuring in dim light.Additional Features:  Here is where the NWi really shinesFeatures both have:1. Automatically calculate area or volume.2. Display multiple units, ft in decimals, inches, ft + inches, meters.  You can change the units on the Bosch at any time, you can only change the units on the NWi between measurements.3. Memory, Bosch lets you save one measurement, the NWi shines here by letting you save 30.  Additionally if you change the units you are using the units of all saved measurements are saved as well.  So you can go back and look at them in meters or inches.  By contrast the Bosch converts all saved numbers to decimals.4. Min distance: bosch allows 2 inches, the NWi is 4. (rated distances)5. Max distance: Bosch 130 ft, NWi 195 ft (rated distances)Additional NWi features:1. The pythagorean functions (which allow for indirect measurement) are in my opinion the most valuable additional features (I explained each one below).1a. Use as an inclinometer by pressing the angle button 1 time.  Then simply place the inclinometer flat against the angle you want to measure.  (accurate and consistent but needs calibration, on mine 89.5= 90, 44.3= 45 and -1.2=0 respectively)(0.5 degrees at 90, 0 0.7 degrees on my unit).1b. if calibrated it can be used as rough level using that same feature.1c. Press the angle button twice and you can indirectly measure the length of a room by placing the unit in a bottom corner and aiming at the opposite top corner, then measure.  The LSC60 calculates the sides of a right triangle for you and you now know the length of the room.  Great if there is furniture in the way.  You can also use this to measure the height of a building.1d.  If there are no available bottom corners simply go to the third angle setting, then stand at any point in the middle of the room.  Measure the distance from any set surface to one ceiling corner, and then turn the device around and measure to the other corner... the result will be the length of the room.  Again great for real estate use.2. afformentioned backlight3.  The calculator is handy for calculating materials required for a job based off the volume or area in question.  HOWEVER, you cannot save previous calculations, you will have to right down all your results.  Also the calculator deals in unitless decimals (which makes sense since many calculations will change the starting unit.)4. 3 minuet auto shutoffPrice:  And here is where the Bosch really shines.At ~$89 for the Bosch vs. ~$148 for the NWi the Bosch is a better deal if all you want to do is to measure straight lines.  And you can get a backlit version that measures 165 ft Bosch GLM 50 Laser Distance Measurer with 165-Feet Range and Backlit Display for about $94.However to get the angle features you would need to upgrade to the Bosch GLM80 265ft Li-Ion Laser Distance Measurer which would cost 195.  (granted its measured max distance is 70 ft more).  For my money I would rather have the NWi.Conclusion: If you are a real estate agent or are thinking of buying a house, or you are remodeling, consider buying this measure.  Being able to get the distance witout moving all the furniture or taking multiple measurements, is a great feature to have that will save you and your clients time and aggrevation.  Additionally it's not something you cannot easily compensate for with your phone (like the calculator), it is a high end feature that accounts for the high end price.If however, you work in new construction, or mainly need straight lines, or just want to save some money, consider one of the cheaper Bosch units.As always if you found my review usefull (or not) please click the links below to let others know.

"I received both the Wilson Jones Heavy Weight Top-Loading Sheet Protectors, Clear, 100/Box (W21411) and the Wilson Jones Heavy Weight Top-Loading Sheet Protectors, Non-Glare, 100/Box (W21413) to review and naturally decided to compare the two, here are my thoughts. (SKIP TO THE VERDICT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE BREAKDOWN)The tests:1) I took one of each type of sheet protector and used them to hold a petition I was circulating, each petition was handled by a very large number of hands.  I then compared the two afterwards to check for the condition of the petition and the protectors.2) I examined the protectors containing the petition in various lighting conditions.3) I put paper towel inside and then spilled water on them in various quantities.4) I put paper in them and bent them to see how they protected the pages and retained their shape****I didn't try stuffing them, I meant to but kept forgetting, maybe I will update with their capacity in the future.The results.1) Both of the protectors held up well to heavy repetitive use.  The pages of the petition remained crisp and the protectors were still in great condition.  HOWEVER, the clear protectors had a large number of fingerprint smudges, these smudges were not present on the non-glare sheet protector.

The non-glare pages are more like a matte photo and there is a real difference in the amount of glare.  These are perfectly visible in just about every lighting condition.

They provided decent protection for folds and bends, stopping the paper from forming sharp creases.

"I received both the Wilson Jones Heavy Weight Top-Loading Sheet Protectors, Clear, 100/Box (W21411) and the Wilson Jones Heavy Weight Top-Loading Sheet Protectors, Non-Glare, 100/Box (W21413) to review and naturally decided to compare the two, here are my thoughts. (SKIP TO THE VERDICT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE BREAKDOWN)The tests:1) I took one of each type of sheet protector and used them to hold a petition I was circulating, each petition was handled by a very large number of hands.  I then compared the two afterwards to check for the condition of the petition and the protectors.2) I examined the protectors containing the petition in various lighting conditions.3) I put paper towel inside and then spilled water on them in various quantities.4) I put paper in them and bent them to see how they protected the pages and retained their shape****I didn't try stuffing them, I meant to but kept forgetting, maybe I will update with their capacity in the future.The results.1) Both of the protectors held up well to heavy repetitive use.  The pages of the petition remained crisp and the protectors were still in great condition.  HOWEVER, the clear protectors had a large number of fingerprint smudges, these smudges were not present on the non-glare sheet protector.

"I got this case because the magnet in my previous case made the S-pen act strangely at the peripherals of the screen.  It serves its purpose admirably.Pros:1) no magnets means flawless S-pen response2) elastic strap is easy to use and keeps everything closed well3) case acts successfully as a support should you use it in the folded/supported position.4) There is enough extra space in the cover that with some velcro tape you can stick in a small blue tooth keyboardCons:1) doesn't automatically turn off your tablet when you close it (but that is because there are no magnets)2) Doesn't provide much protection against drops or other damage, especially around the edges, so the note does get a little scratched up if your not careful.3) the 4 corners that hold the note in loosen with time, so one of the corners may pop off if is jostled allot.All in all I like the case and feel that it is serving my purposes of protecting the screen.  and for the most part protecting the rest of the tablet.

"We already owned one radio flyer trike so I knew they make good quality trikes.  However, this is a better product in my opinion.  My son loves to pretend he's a garbage man while standing on the back.  In fact he likes it enough to let me put his younger brother in the sitting part which means I can get us to the playground with the tricycle and no second stroller, a definite plus.Two precautions:1. From previous experience I will warn you that you should have some WD40 around if you own one of these.  Once they get any moisture in them they tend to squeak really really loudly.2. Make sure your child is wearing a helmet (always a good idea), the center of gravity on these is pretty high so they are prone to tipping if ridden aggressively.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TUUILS5TXPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5UP64Q#wasThisHelpful","R30TUUILS5TXPQ","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They should have added a more tapered bottom to accommodate smaller cup holders.Nice features:1. If for some reason you have a car that does not have a cigarette lighter this comes with clips that you could attach directly to electrical leads to power the inverter.

"I have a stereotypical boy, who loves trucks and superheroes. But he also loves Disney classic movies so he loves princesses.  I knew he would love this and I was right, he is as excited about this as his Bob the Builder sticker/activity book.My complaint is that it could really be better made and better packaged. There is no good way to store the different components so some of them have gotten lost.  Additionally, because the crayons were individually taped in place and I managed to break 2 of them just taking them out of the packaging.I think this is a great idea, but the execution could have been better.

"Overall I think this is a great “toy” in fact it only has one real (if rather annoying negative).  However, with some prep the negative can be overcome.  I will go over the con and how to fix it first and then I will write about the set’s positives.Con:The set isn’t ready right out of the box.  You need to have specific “ingredients” on hand to complete any given project.  Below is a list of each project and the non-included ingredients.1. Pop for plants: Popcorn kernel, soil2. Growing garlic: 2 cloves of garlic, soil3. Funny Faces: soil, craft supplies (for decorating the pots), gress or chive seeds4. Pineapple Surprise: whole fresh pineapple5. Tri-“pod”: soil, 3 straws, packet pea seeds6. Cloud Garden: Bean seed packet, cotton balls7. Reach for the Sun: seeds for  quick growing plant (herbs, peas, sunflowers), dry erase marker, soil8. Colorful Carrot: Carrot with greenery, blue food dye.9. Roots never rest: Radishes, toothpicks10. Terrific Terrarium: Pebbles, soil, plant seeds (flowers), or sprouted seeds form other activities.Pros:1. This is a great way to teach a child about growing things, it is also a good intro to experimentation and science.2. Can be used as a method to teach a child about responsibility for another creature.3. All the pots are see through so you can see if roots are growing out against the edges etc.4. Comes with all of the hard ingredients you need such as pots and watering can etc.5. Pictures on the cards tell you what you will need, which is good for kids who cannot yet read or are learing to read.6. Pre planned activities provide parents with a good framework to get started.7. Activities are simple and straight forward enough that they work even for a black thumb like me.Conclusion:As I said at the beginning I really think this is a great toy.  However, there is no reason I can think of why at the least packets of dried seeds, food coloring and soil are not included.  It was very disappointing to open this and not be able to do anything right away.Hopefully with the list I provided you will be able to purchase the accompanying materials before you give this to your child and the two of you will be able to jump in immediately.  Once you do you will discover that the recipies and materials that are supplied make a great product.  I gave the set 4 stars because it is so good despite being incomplete.  If it were complete it would have gotten 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ZGUQGYJQPDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2FNH8O#wasThisHelpful","R13ZGUQGYJQPDU","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past I have criticized Green Toys for making toys that don’t do enough to inspire imaginative play.  The toys didn’t come with figurines, space to place figurines, or enough other interactive elements.  With some of their newest offerings they have taken a real step forward.Pros1. The ferry is the same environmentally friendly, thick plastic made in the US style of toy that I have come to expect from Green Toys.  From a production standpoint they put forward a very superior product.2. The toy floats well which is good for a bath toy.3. Interactive parts like a sliding ramp, and the two cars help inspire imaginative play.4. You can separate the bottom of the ferry from the top which facilitates easy drying.Cons1. The ramp that pulls out for loading cars is flimsier then I expect from Green Toys.2. When you separate the top from the bottom the  ramp always falls out.  This is the first toy from this company I have ever owned that has a build flaw.Wishes:1. Would have been great to see a pilot house or a wheel on the ferry2. I wish Green Toys would make a single sized figurine that was integrated across their product line and compatible with all new toys.  This would make for a more interactive environment between the various green toys.  In addition it would help contribute to brand image.Conclusion:Overall a fairly solid effort, the problem with the ramp is the only real reason I did not give it five stars (my son keeps taking the top off and then he can’t get the ramp back in himself).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G5PB0UEMHSGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN6QAVI#wasThisHelpful","R2G5PB0UEMHSGR","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a lot of ways this is an excellent projector.  However, there are some areas in which it falls short.  To write the review I tested the projector inside against a screen with a projected size of around 80 inches.  Additionally, I compared it virtually side by side with a 55 inch LCD TV.  I tested using a 720p HD stream from my laptop, as well as a standard def stream.  I also tested the streams using a Galaxy Tab, and an iPAD, for wireless streaming.  I made a point by point pro con analysis so you can judge for yourself.Pros:1. Plenty of lumens so it is clear and bright even with large amounts of ambient light.  It was nearly identical to the LCD TV, and even with all the lights on I had no trouble differentiating colors and seeing white and blacks at 80 inches.  The picture was surprisingly crisp.2. Looks even better in a darkened room. (I anticipate the same will be true for outside, at night)3. Presentations work beautifully no matter the connection, HDMI, USB or WiFi.4. Over HDMI video streaming was seamless.5. Decent audio quality from the speakers.6. Basic setup was simple.7. Remote has a built in pointer.8. Small portable form factor, and carrying case mean you can easily tote this with you on vacation or to a meeting.9. You can play standard def wide screen content from most devices, iOS, Android, or Windows, which is nice.Cons:1. No included HDMI cable (more problematic because of 2)2. Over USB and wireless, HD video playback was choppy and would not have worked for watching a movie.3. USB was choppy even with SD playback.4. Only uses USB 2.0 which may contribute to the above issue.Conclusion:My dream of streaming video from my desktop home theater PC to the projector so I can watch movies outside is shot.  Equally gone are any thoughts of mounting and wirelessly streaming movies and TV to the projector.  However, this will still be useful for presentations and for the occasional outdoor movie when the weather gets better.  If you are looking for a good image and you don't mind being tethered by a cable this could be a great projector for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301N2J8TAX845/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E87E1OM#wasThisHelpful","R301N2J8TAX845","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The toys didn’t come with figurines, space to place figurines, or enough other interactive elements.  With some of their newest offerings they have taken a real step forward.Pros:1. The rocket is the same environmentally friendly, incredibly well constructed, made in the US style of toy that I have come to expect from Green Toys.  From a production standpoint they put forward a very superior product.2. The rocket comes with two figurines, and splits into two parts.  Moreover the doors on both the top and bottom rocket open to provide space for figurines.  This has led to many a space mission.3. The interior space is easily large enough for multiple figures, and bigger figures then the set comes with.  Our Duplo and imaginext figures have all been on missions.4. Did I mention it was durable, the spaceship has survived re-entry and numerous crash landings,  even the doors stay put.5. No small parts, great if your child has a younger sibling.Cons:1. Nitpicking, but I could have wished for some mobility in the astronauts.  Of course that would have increased the likelihood of breakage and small parts.ConclusionI have to say I am thoroughly impressed, a great interactive toy that shows you don’t need a lot of lights and noises to catch a child’s attention and imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24WT4YC1SQ1P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPRLGVE#wasThisHelpful","R24WT4YC1SQ1P4","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:1. its easy to change up most of the pieces of the car so my 3.5 year old is able to do that by himself.2. ability to customize adds a nice twist to an otherwise basic product.3. All parts seem durable.Cons:1. switching from the small wheels to the big wheelbase is a little tricky (for a small child)2. The wheels freely come off of the rims and thus are easily lost.3. Only one set of large wheels, so you can either put them in the back or front, but you aren't making a monster truck with this.4. When the single set of large wheels are on the front of the car/truck contacts the ground... they are a little too big.Conclusion: These are an average toy, they aren't as customizable as legos, and they don't have the track options that hotwheels do.  In addition there are flaws with the system they have.  Furthermore unless you have more than the one set it won't maintain a child's interest much longer than any other car.

"Oral B makes several toothbrushes that have similar features the 4000, 5000 and 7000 all deliver 40k pulsations/min and 8800+ oscillations/min according to the specs.  The differences come down to other features and price.the 4000 $65,the 5000 is $110the 7000 is $160At each increase in price there are some additional features.  For example, the 4000 does not have a pressure sensor to prevent you from brushing to hard, nor does it have a timer that displays how long you have been brushing and the mode you are in. The 5000 also added a deep cleaning mode that has you brush for 3 min instead of two.  Personally I find the first two features facilitate better brushing habits and make the 5000 a better tooth brush than the 4000.The differences between the 7000 and the 5000 however are minimal.1. The 7000 is black2. The travel case is nicer3. A tongue brushing mode was added.That's it, oh and the tongue brushing mode is just the sensitive mode with a single 20 second timer according to the manual and my experience.For that they are charging an additional $50+.  I have not found that any of these changes improve my brushing or habits.  I see absolutely no reason to recommend this toothbrush as long as the 5000 is still available for sale at a cheaper price.I did not give the toothbrush 1 star because it does work well, and at an appropriate price it would be worth purchasing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K2KYRNTTPO20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ8PR1U#wasThisHelpful","R3K2KYRNTTPO20","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comparative review: Haswell Acer Aspire S7, vs. Sony Vaio Pro 13Tech specs:Aspire S7: Core i7, 256gb solid state, 8gb ram, purchased clean (no bloatware) from Microsoft store for 1200 all in.Vaio Pro 13: Core i7, 128gb solid state, 8gb ram, received fee from Amazon vine (1500 on Amazon)I had the S7 for 30 days, I kept the Vaio because free was a better price.I have split this review based on various features so that you can directly compare, I will have some additional info at the end to wrap up.Design: In my opinion the S7 is the clear winner hereThe S7 (4/5)Pros:1) Round edges make it comfortable to put on your lap2) Cover tilts all the way back so that you can show it to somebody across from you, or more importantly adjust it to any viewing angle (and it also means you can hold it open for presentations.3) Not a lot of body flex which means you can click on the trackpad regardless of the surface you are using.4) Just looks nice.5) Stiff hinge allows  you to open it one handed and holds it in place really well (less typing shake)Cons:1) SD cards stick out of the slot a fair amount so you can't just leave them in there indefinitely. (mitigated by the larger HD space)Vaio (2/5)Pros:1) SD card fully inserts so it can be used as permanent file storage for music etc.2) Sturdy: I dropped it (not on purpose) and all it did was dent the corner slightly.3) USB charger on the power cord is a nice touch.4) Looks decentCons:1) Sharp edges dig into your lap (really hurt)2) Cover has limited movement, in fact I couldn't tilt it back far enough to type on my lap with an ideal viewing angle.3) Slight tilt to the screen and keyboard mean that there is a gap when you close it.4) Carbon fiber flexes a lot so sometimes you cannot use the mousepad because the keyboard has flexed.5) Cannot be opened one handed.Keyboard:S7 (1/5):Pros:1) Sufficient key travel (unlike on the earlier S7)Cons:1) Keyboard has some weird organization choices, like no Function keys, not sure why2) My spacebar only registered in the middle or left side, it missed most hits from the right side, this was a big problem.

"Pros:1. Easy to set up: I used the setup wizard not the app, but I didn't have any issues getting the network set up or getting all my devices connected.2. Excellent wireless coverage: In my apartment the 2.4GHz range is crowded primarily by the signals of our multiple baby monitors.  Due to the interference wireless connectivity in most of the bedrooms was basically nonexistent.  With this router though we have gotten better connectivity on all our wireless devices.  The 5GHz band especially provides a strong signal to every area within our apartment.3. Cloud storage via USB: works well and fairly quickly useful for saving files to your home network from the road.  Enables you to stream your media in HD without a hitch which means I can watch movies on a laptop without having to worry about storing them.4. Capable of streaming HD video: As I mentioned above it has excellent range.  I have not tried streaming HD video to multiple devices simultaneously, but I can watch in HD in my bedroom via the wireless network.  Previously I was lucky if I could successfully stream in SD and consequently I used a powerline to connect via Ethernet.5. Optional guest network so that you can keep your guests out of  your cloud storage.Cons:1. Can't be used as a media bridge:  Odds are that currently none of the things you own have wireless AC, however many of them may connect via the Ethernet (xbox-360, blue ray player, TV, TIVO, AVR etc.)  One way to take advantage of wireless AC right now is to use a media bridge that uses wireless AC as a way of connecting all the aforementioned devices to the internet (you plug them into the bridge and the bridge connects to your wireless network.)  This won't work for that purpose, it can transmit wireless but it can't receive, a lot of the other AC routers have this capability.2. Setting it up so you can access your files via the internet is a pain: If you aren't computer savvy you won't be using this feature.3. The apps are basically worthless: the app for accessing your data, SharePort mobile, will allow you to access your data but I found it very tedious to set up, basically the same problem as above.  Additionally, if you have a lot of stuff on your drive (as I do) then it takes forever to loud a content list (this happens whenever you access the app).  Also it doesn't support .avi format (I haven't tested others yet), and the app doesn't run in the background so you cannot listen to music from your network while you browse the web.Conclusion:Overall for my purposes this is a great router, meaning I get more consistent faster connectivity.  However, I still think there is room for improvement given the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FBZX9CHIBZXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9VB318#wasThisHelpful","R1FBZX9CHIBZXQ","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**First Impressions:**This thing is HUGE, easily bigger than a carryon bag, it looks like it ate 3 regular sized printers.  I had to clear everything off of my dresser so that I had a place to put it.  If you have a small apartment make sure you can actually dedicate the space.  (Also 13x19 paper looks like a gag gift the first time you see it.) If you do have the space though... the Pro-10 is worth it.I know the exact dimensions are already on the web site but keep in mind when choosing a location that (ideally) you want 10 inches behind the printer and 17 inches in front of the printer so that you can fully extend the trays (these can be over open air).Other initial notes:1. There is a handy slot underneath to keep the tray for printing on DVD-Rs.2. This thing ways almost 50 pounds and has to be attached to the computer via USB for setup, so if you plan to keep it somewhere far away from your computer bring it to the computer first and then move it to its final destination, you don't want to have to lug it back and forth any more than you have to.**Now on to the printing:**Many people have mentioned that this printer provides either near lab level prints or lab level prints.  I would argue that this printer, if used correctly is capable of producing prints that are better than you could get from most labs.Why?Complete control over all aspects of the print.What do I mean by ""if used correctly?""Ultimately a great print will have both great print quality (something labs and this printer have in common) and will perfectly match your intentions for color, contrast, and brightness.  Even if you use a calibration tool (I use a Datacolor Spyder4Pro S4P100 Colorimeter for Display Calibration) keep everything in the same color space, and use proof previews in either Lightroom or Photoshop, you will often discover that what you see on the screen doesn't quite match what you get in prints.  If you are printing from a lab this usually means you are stuck with what the results (hey they're ""pretty close"" right?).If however, you to have a printer like this one, you can completely eliminate this problem.  As the title says, practice makes perfect.  Print the picture as a smaller analogue on a piece of 8.5x11 paper, adjust the printer settings to correct for any differences between the print and the screen and then try again.  When you feel you are getting perfect prints, save the settings as a preset (I use lightroom for this but the canon plugin allows for essentially the same thing) and use it as a starting point the next time.  Assuming you are using the same type of paper you should get near perfect results every time once this process is complete.Yah I know this seems like a waste of ink and paper, but most people aren't considering this printer because they want to print more 4x6s of their family.  They are looking to make high quality prints to either sell or frame and hang on their walls, and in either of those instances the Canon Pro-10 will allow you to get not just lab quality prints, but perfect prints.I highly recommend this printer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32X7OJDIK2KAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095F5BBO#wasThisHelpful","R32X7OJDIK2KAW","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Initial impression: Office 2013 provides incremental changes to office 2010.  Most are positive, at least one (that I have encountered so far) is negative, but few actually provide new functionality.Pros:1. Office 2013 feels a little like what office 2010 should have been.  With the getting started templates included in each module  it is easy to see some of the new features.  This would have been more useful when switching from the old toolbar and menu  office to the ribbon driven office.  Still better late than never.2. Mostly familiar if you are used to 20103. Old menu shortcuts (such as ALT, i, R to insert a row in excel) still work.4. Designed for use on a tablet, which is a huge advantage (if you have a Windows 8 tablet).5. Mostly better organized than 20106. Automatic integration of Skydrive (rather than requiring  you to download as an add on)Cons:1. Not enough is different to justify paying for an upgrade from 2010.2. Few novel features. Most of the differences are actually organizational rather than novel, making certain functions more  accessible, but not providing any new features.Pros and Cons by program:Word Pros:1. Integrated PDF editing (mostly for text documents): probably the best new feature.  Still rather than upgrade to office 13 for this you could buy Acrobat Writer which is much more robust.2. Ability to hide all info after a formatted heading makes long documents much easier to use and facilitates the creation of a table of contents.3. You can embed online videos (as supposed to downloading them first)4. Easier alignment of pictures in text.Word Cons: Haven't come across any changes that I didn't like yetExcel Pros:1. Suggested pivot tables (analyzes your data and suggests for you2. More accessible controls for formatting graphs3. Suggested graphs4. Smart filling of tables by analyzing what you have added and using that to create rules (eliminating the need for writing some macros).5. General better organization of ribbons and icons.Excel Cons:1. You can no longer use Ctrl + Click to deselect an individual cell. This is almost a deal breaker for me.  I frequently work with spreadsheets that have hundreds of lines.  If I want to select everything in a column but three rows I would highlight the whole column and then use Ctrl + click to deselect the cells I did not want included.  Now I have to go through and highlight what I want while skipping what I don't, and if I misclick my only option is to start again from scratch.  This honestly drives me nuts.  If I can't write or find a VBA workaround I may downgrade to 2010 because of this one ""Improvement""Outlook Pros:1. Feels mostly the same to me,2. No problem syncing with g-mail3. Default now shoes 1 line preview of e-mails.Outlook Cons:1. Not Microsoft's fault but currently Cozi's toolbar doesn't support Office 2013PowerPoint Pros:1. You can now stream presentations onlinePowerPoint Cons: Nothing jumped out at meOneNote: Still Awesome, but the version for Windows 8 is just as good and is free from the App store.Conclusion:  Office 2013 is a pretty solid offering, but I definitely would not pay to upgrade from Office 2010. If you are purchasing to replace an early version of office I would say the following: If you use excel like I do, probably go to 2010 (unless Microsoft changes this). Otherwise get 2013, The overall improvements make it easier and more intuitive to use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U8H2OWEDXDZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPL2K0#wasThisHelpful","R1U8H2OWEDXDZ4","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a set of OXO Grood Grip measuring cups when I first got married, and I honestly haven't had any complaints.  That said, these are undoubtedly better.Here is why:1. Easier to hang on a hook and keep together.2. Super easy to pour, even slowly. Pours out smoothly rather than running down the side (which was a problem with the originals).3.

"I have split my review into two parts; one for the 323AB Tripod, and the other for the BBH-200 Ball Head. First however, let me describe my previous kit as I will be using it for comparison and reference purposes.Tripod: Manfrotto 055XPROBHead: Markins ""Emille"" Q-Ball HeadCamera: Canon 40D with various lensesVANGUARD 323AB TRIPOD:I evaluated the tripod based on height, weight, build quality, and additional features.Weight: (4/10)The first thing you notice when you pick up the tripod is that it is heavy, nearly 8 lbs.  By comparison my Manfrotto is about 5 lbs (5.3 including the ball head).  I have hiked with the Manfrotto and you feel the weight, I wouldn't recommend taking the Vanguard if you are going to be doing a lot of hiking, or spending the whole day walking around.  Essentially, in my opinion the Vanguard is so heavy that it is primarily suitable for studio, or location work.Height: (7/10)I looked at size three ways, height when closed, height with the legs fully extended, and minimum usable height for (macro shooting).Closed:At over 31"" with the ball head attached, the Vanguard is pretty long, you will almost definitely need to take off the ball head before you can store it in an overhead bin. (Not such a big deal if like me you don't tighten the hex nuts when you attache the ball head).Legs fully extended:In my opinion the tripod you buy, should be tall enough that you can use it with the center column down,  and short enough that with the legs fully extended the cameras viewfinder is at eye level or a couple of inches below eye level.  Fully extended the Vanguard is ~5'5"" tall, which means that the viewfinder is about 5'8"" off the ground (more if you use a camera with a battery pack).  Obviously you can use the tripod without fully extending the legs, but if you are using this primarily in the studio or on shoot locations you don't want to have to adjust the legs every time you set up on flat ground.  I would definitely look for a different model if you aren't at least 6', the Manfrotto I own is 2.5 inches shorter with the ball head attached, and it is also a little tall for me (I'm 5'8"").Minimum Height:You can flip the center column of the tripod upside down, which means you can get pretty much as close to the ground as you can possibly focus.Build Quality & Additional features: (10/10)The tripod appears solid, mostly metal with plastic tabs for lowering the legs.  The tabs can be tightened or loosened by screws so you can adjust the tension.Features of note:1. An orange gasket helps to cushion the center column if you release it with your gear on and it drops quickly.2. Three different configurations for the feet (big rubber pads, rounded rubber or metal spikes) ensure grip on varied terrain, although I have never had any issue with my Manfrotto which only has the rounded rubber.3. There is a hook on the bottom of the center column which you can use to hang your camera bag or another weight to further stabilize the tripod, (or to hang the tripod in a closet for storage). A nice feature my other tripod doesn't have.4. A level on the top of the center column lets you know if the tripod base is level.5. An included tool contains everything you need to attach the quick release plate, adjust the tension on the legs or flip the thread on the center column to accommodate other attachments (really nice to have), and can be attached with a key-chain.6. The included bag is a nice touch and I wish my Manfrotto had come with one; I drilled holes in it to attach a carry strap instead.Conclusion: (21/30)Altogether I just felt the Vanguard is a little too big and heavy.  You want a tripod that you can and will use regularly and this one is just too over sized for regular use.  I would almost unilaterally recommend the 055XPROB over this tripod.  However, if you are well over 6' then this might be a better choice.  Remember before you buy a tripod to look at the maximum height and think about that as it compares to your height.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRJSSU2WMXU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RW6RGE#wasThisHelpful","R3GRJSSU2WMXU6","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The complexity of the main characters builds off of the previous stories, they face more difficult decisions and make interesting choices (I was surprised more than once).Additionally I really liked the emotional energy in this book, pushing on anger, happiness, terror, sadness, and a gamut of other emotions, that really kept me tuned into the book and turning pages.Ultimately I just thought the whole book was well crafted, from the main characters to the supporting characters to the plot elements and everything in between.I highly recommend this book and look forward to the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ORA5R0QWDOUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061284416#wasThisHelpful","R3ORA5R0QWDOUS","A2Y5T1O43P14RP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5T1O43P14RP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay - so the first caveat is that you have to keep your house (or at least your floor) relatively clutter free when it runs.  My cat steals hair bands and leaves them around the house, and my daughter leaves her socks all over.  These two things are not conducive to an operating vac.I have a Mastiff (sheds constantly), a Maltese, a cat (also sheds constantly) and a long haired guinea pig (also sheds constantly).  My daughter, who wears black a lot, was complaining that she was always covered with pet hair and it was embarrassing. I bought this guy to try to get the pet hair under control between cleanings (about once a week).  It runs every day and has done wonders for the pet hair problem.One thing though - as many other people have mentioned, it takes several days of full charge/release to get it to it's full charge. When I first bought it, it would charge 5 or 6 times to do 600 or so square feet that includes my kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Now though, it can clean pretty much the whole thing on one charge.  It also has no problem with area rugs, and it vacuums UNDER furniture (like bookcases and end tables), which is awesome!The only gripe I have is that for some reason it keeps trying to get under my couch and gets stuck - only on one side though.  I have the magnetic band blocking doors so I may need to get another one, but overall this works great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U3K8O3G87WJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOH64IA#wasThisHelpful","R2U3K8O3G87WJ2","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I made the mistake of purchasing too light carpet for my house and of course, I don't want anyone actually walking on it.  I had carpet scraps left over from the install laid down but they kept bunching up and people were tripping over them.  I bought this to replace the carpet scraps.The good: Looks fabulous.  Despite the low price it has a very rich, formal look.  Lightweight so it's easy to move around.  WASHABLE!  Yes, this is the best part since I have pets with muddy feet and a mastiff who drools on everything.The bad: Lightweight (yes, it's bad too).  Because it's so lightweight, it doesn't stay put.  I'm not sure how to make it stay put on carpet.  Were it on hardwood, I would probably use carpet tape.Of course, the fact that it's so lightweight makes it easy to adjust so I just pull it back where it belongs a couple of times a day when I notice it is askew.

"I have been really looking forward to this series as it has been showing up in my FB feed for the last couple of months.  I really loved Ava. She is the daughter of ""The General"" (although I was unclear as to whether he was a were general or just a military general). I hate simpering female leads and while Ava had a few moments, they didn't detract from her strong, dominant personality.  She's not afraid to take the reins, and when she does, she succeeds at what she sets out to accomplish.  Damon is hot and strong.  He is definitely an Alpha male and shows some of the symptoms, telling *his* female what to do, but he seems to do it out of a concern for Ava's safety and not just because he can. After Ava is kidnapped by a rogue werewolf pack, Damon is sent by his leader to rescue her.  When he arrives, he finds out that the ""evil"" red pack has plans to use female werewolves as breeding stock to increase their pack size so they can run out the gray packs.  Damon is instantly drawn to Ava, and Ava to him, but Damon knows that he would lose his job and his pack if he mated with the general's daughter so he resists the attraction.  As he tries to keep Ava safe, they face other dangers that test them and Damon's strength to maintain his distance from Ava.I highly recommend this book.  I couldn't put it down!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZ4USS7QC56Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZM952G#wasThisHelpful","R3LZ4USS7QC56Z","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So - the good and the bad.The goodThis was cheap (as in inexpensive)It looks niceIt went together fairly easily - about 30 minutes by myself (I'm a medium build woman)The drawers are a nice sizeOnce you get them in, the drawers don't just fall out.All the pieces were nicely organized and easy to identify.I think that the 3 drawer pulls account for the majority of the price.  They are nice. (about $5 each at Lowes)I know a couple of people complained about the packaging and damage.  I found it to be very well packaged and cushioned.  It had dividers to keep things from scratching, foam on the ends to keep the edges from getting banged up, and everything was tightly wrapped to prevent movement.I also saw one review where the person complained that the back was cardboard and they threw it away with the packaging.  The instructions now have attached a very eye-catching warning NOT to throw away your packing materials until the whole chest is assembled :)The badThis was cheap (as in low quality - to be expected)I buy a lot of cheap furniture - usually on the drawers, the back side has a ledge so there are 4 ledges on which the bottom sits.  Not so here.  On the 4th edge (the back) you have to pound nails into the bottom to hold it in place.  So....this is pretty much for things like your unmentionables and other lightweight itemsThe plastic slides are horrid.  Difficult to pull out and push in.  I might try some silicone lubricant on them.Actually getting the drawers in is a nightmare.  It took me just as long to put in 3 drawers as it took me to put together 3 drawers.So - why 4 stars?  Well, it was cheap and it looks good.  Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the purchase.  It will do for a few years until it either falls apart or I decide I no longer like it.  The 4 stars is primarily because those plastic rails are awful.If you are looking for something that looks nice but is inexpensive, I would say you won't find much better.UPDATE - so I went to Lowe's and bought 3 drawer slides for a total of $12.  Even adding the additional $$ - I'd say this is a great deal.  It is still cheap, but it looks nice and I suspect it will last for about a year or so.  If it falls apart sooner than that, I'll update my post. I bought 12"" drawer slides (but I think 14"" would work as well and are easier to find) and just matched them up to the existing holes.  No problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUBWN5IDTX32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQAK1WI#wasThisHelpful","R3OUBWN5IDTX32","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted so badly to like these books.  The reviews are so glowing that I kept telling myself that surely they must get better.  Three chapters into the third book I finally threw up my hands and gave up.  The characters have absolutely no depth, there is no plot, and nothing of note ever happens.

"I was immediately hooked.  While I was a bit confused in the beginning as to how the main character knew she needed to see a particular book and where it was, that was ultimately resolved, although later in the book than I had hoped.  Despite this, I was immediately drawn to both main characters and found myself turning pages quickly to see how the story ended.  My only real complaint would be the editing.  That's not against the author, but the editing looked like something I would see in a $2.99 self published book.

While it does a *fantastic* job of keeping the girls in place during Fitness Boot Camp, it is *very* hard to get on and nearly impossible to get off.

"I received an ARC copy in exchange for an honest reviewI have to admit that it took me a couple of chapters to really become engrossed in this book, but once I did, I could not put it down. The story is well written and between the suspense and the romantic tension between Rachel and Patrick, the story was incredible.Rachel James is a young mother with a terrible secret that may cost her custody of her child if it ever gets out.  She has recently moved in with an old friend after escaping a psychotic husband who was in custody for several crimes.  When she finds out he has been released because someone “lost” the evidence, she realizes that her ex-husband has a broad reach that will keep him out of custody and in pursuit of her and her child.  She flees for her life into the arms of Patrick who also has his own skeletons with which he is trying to deal.  Together, they fight for their lives and the lives of those they love while trying to ignore the feelings growing between them.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but found the Angel Killer aspect to be superfluous and confusing.  The “’til death” quotes throughout the book, while suspenseful, but not well explained.  I felt that the book was suspenseful enough with Rachel’s predicament and did not feel that the Angel Killer added anything to the book.  Otherwise, I thought that the book was extremely well written and a wonderful read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OMWEFKKA0SGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPQ5ZVO#wasThisHelpful","R3OMWEFKKA0SGD","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been trying to find a way to keep the sheets on my daughter's bed. She tosses and turns all night and ends up sleeping on the mattress.  She has a loft bed so it is difficult for me to keep up with it and she won't.  I installed these about a week ago and while the sheet is still on the mattress, two of the buttons are missing from the clips.  I'm sure they are in her room somewhere but putting them on is tough and sorting through her room to find them tougher.

The ring around the top of the bottle broke - the grey threaded part (as other people have also indicated).  I went to the Eco-vessel website and while they have various replacement parts, this was not one of them.  It appears to be held on with a thick rubber band so it should be easily replaceable.

"I bought this book because it was in my list of ""other people who bought this book"" for Alexandra Ivy's Guardians of Eternity series.  I thought the description was intriguing and due to the numerous great reviews I bought it.  It was, in a word, horrible.  The comparisons that ran through my head as I trudged through this book were ""soft porn"" and ""Magic Mike"".  Oh, and remember when you were little and you would fan fold a piece of paper, hold it to your nose and do the ""You must pay the rent"" thing?  It was like that.  ""I can't love you"" ""But I must love you"" ""But I can't love you"" ""But I must love you"" ""You can love her."" ""My hero"".  The whole book was a conglomeration of cheesy writing, bad dialog, and little plot.  If you like cheesy porn (the kind where they stick a story line in there just so they can say it's a movie), then by all means, please indulge.  But if you like a little meat to your story, don't bother.  The first HALF of the book is about Jacob and Isabella not being able to love each other (oh but there's the demon she kills - that's the plot for the first half), then the second half is about the two of them being all dreamy eyed at one another (oh, but there is a necromancer that must be killed).

"There is only one book I have ever started and did not finish.  That was War and Peace, but that was only because I couldn't keep the characters straight.  I finished this book because I wanted it to be good.  I really did.  It wasn't.  First, there was so much going on in the book that wasn't critical to the story.  Why does it matter that her daughter got strep?  What did that add to the story?  Anything? Why do we care what she faxed to the kids every night?  What did that add?  As a matter of fact, other than it gave her a ""reason"" for her absolute stupidity, the kids did not serve any purpose.  What was going on with her husband - again, and we care why?  (Oh yeah, the hubby was support for her asinine choices.)  She also had three plot lines going on at once that she *tried* to intertwine but failed at miserably.  The ending was flat, and for lack of a better term ""deus ex machina.""  All of a sudden, everything resolves in about 3 pages.  And the resolution is ridiculous at best.  The story was poorly written, and poorly plotted. Honestly, toward the end, I read the first line of each paragraph and lost nothing.  I should have done that from the beginning.

"I saw this advertised on my Kindle and bought it because it was appropriate for young adults as I'm always looking for books for my daughter to read.  I love that it was set in the Chicago area.  I went to U of I and my brother went to Purdue so I immediately connected. I recognized the mindset having many friends from the Lake Forest and Winnetka areas.  The story itself was good.  I'll admit that I was more interested in Sydney's story and wanted it to work out for her in the end, but that could be because I'm an adult.  Grace's story may be more appealing to the younger set.  As with the other readers, I was a bit annoyed by the editing, but it wasn't so much as to throw the book down in disgust either.

"I don't usually read anthologies as I find that I like some stories but not others and this one was no different.  I bought it because it came highly recommended from a friend on Facebook, and as with other anthologies, there were positive and negative aspects.  I really thought that all of the stories (save one) had value, and added well to this collection.First, the editing was inconsistent.  Some stories were great, others were so poorly edited it made me want to break out a red pen and start slashing.Overall, I really liked the stories.  They had something in there for everyone, from the overweight, to the stick, to the buxom.  I found I could relate to most of them.I think my favorite was ""Found Rhythm"" by LaTessa Montgomery.  The characters were so well developed that you couldn't help but be drawn into the story.  Isa was a strong woman despite her insecurities and I found myself rooting for her to get the guy.  I was engaged right to the last line and it left me feeling inspired.My least favorite by far was Eddie's Ring by A.T. Russell.  It was disjointed at best, confusing, and really made no sense.  The editing was atrocious to say the least and it left me with a bitter feeling at the end.  It really made no sense and at points was a little creepy (why would a married man want to sleep with his grown sister?)Don't let my comments about Eddie's Ring dissuade you from buying the book though.  There were other gems throughout.I really enjoyed ""The Well-Rounded Woman"" by Jude Johnson.  Ever the underdog, the main character finds her own talents and rises to overcome her difficulties she suffered growing up. I enjoyed this one because it demonstrated how one person can bring make things better for others.""I've Never Been to Me"" by Michelle Ann Horst reminded me of a friend I had growing up.  The main character had a lot of strength from the beginning.  That she used that strength to overcome her problems was uplifting and left me feeling happy at the end of the story.""Bones"" by Jennifer Welborn had a romantic undertone but in the end was about her own self discovery and acceptance.I found ""Skin Deep"" by Tina Carreiro to be a sweet story but with a few flaws.  Something that I found a little unbelievable though was how someone with so much talent could have so little self esteem.  The romantic interest was also a bit shallow and dysfunctional, moving from one dysfunctional relationship (his ex-wife had body image issues) to another dysfunctional relationship with a woman with body image issues.  Also, the ending was a little disturbing.  While it turned out well in the end, the means to get there were bothersome.""A Lovely Mess"" by Dawn Kirby was a bit of a mess, but overall, I found it to be a good story.  It is an accurate demonstration of how we can sometimes let how other people see us influence how we see ourselves.  In the end though, this story had a good ending and was fun to read.All in all I would recommend this book as it is a collection of inspiring stories from some great authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OAAXKNJLQE7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COD7L30#wasThisHelpful","R2OAAXKNJLQE7Y","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an HP DV6T Quad.  I bought this to replace part no. 608426-002, 120w 18.5v.  This part is 384023-001.  It is labeled HP so appears to be an OEM HP part.  The replacement is 120w 18.5v.  When I plug it into my computer, it does not register. Just to clarify, I bought this because my computer shows plugged in, not charging.  My laptop works on the battery, it works on the power cord, it just doesn't charge.  After trying several software fixes, I found a note that it may be due to a loose wire on the ac adapter/transformer.  Mine is a bit frayed and sad looking, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Thus, I *know* that there is a problem with this replacement part as my computer does not work when just plugged in with this item, nor does it show on the power symbol on the bottom.  It is *not* a problem with my computer - of that, I am certain.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MLWJ7D4K17V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UACM0Y#wasThisHelpful","R26MLWJ7D4K17V","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I'm going to start off by saying that I really enjoy these books.  They are action packed, and I love the characters.  In each of the books so far, the characters have evolved and become something more as a result of their trials.So why only 4 stars?  Two reasons.  First - there is way too much sex.  I mean, seriously - ask yourself this...you are being faced down by one of the most lethal creatures in the universe.  Do you a) shiver in fear?  b) prepare for attack?  or c) quiver with sexual overload knowing that your recently discovered lover is on his way to help you?  If you guessed c, then you have obviously read the books.  Honestly, I think a little less sex and into you would be nice.The other issue I have is with language.  Ms. Ivy is a great writer, but she needs to move into the 21st century with her language, and needs to invest in a high quality thesaurus.  I'm not quite sure when the word ""groused"" started to bother me so much, but at some time around the middle of book 2, I started envisioning Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (only with somewhat pudgy pigeons) every time someone ""groused"" about their circumstances.  Another complaint is the quirky language.  Yowza, holy guacamole, etc is fine if it's something specific to a character.  But to use that same quirky language for all of the characters in the book is a bit distracting.Overall though, I can forgive the excessive sex drive and the language for the story.  It's a good book once you can get past the quirkiness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GKNLEYAL8QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B60D9ME#wasThisHelpful","R14GKNLEYAL8QZ","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for my little two pound Maltese.  She has 2 full sets of teeth (her baby teeth and adult teeth).  She has always had a little tear staining, but when we took her to get her baby teeth removed, the tear stains became unbelievably dark.  We don't show her so it's not a huge deal, but it was somewhat unsightly.  After doing a lot of research, I found out that Angel Eyes works very well - but then after speaking to my vet about it, I found out that it is an antibiotic!  You are supposed to ""sprinkle it on their food"" - so no dosage control, nothing!  Well, first of all, I have more than one dog and I don't want to medicate all of them, second, my dog is 2 pounds!  What if she overdoses or something?  So, back to the search.  I found this that had very good reviews.  Well, I have used it for 3 days now.  I put it on a soft toothbrush like toothpaste and gently scrub around her eyes.  After 3 minutes, I rinse the toothbrush and use it to remove the ""soap"" (it's not really soap - much more gentle!) from around her eyes.  I gently rub with a soft dry towel, and then let her face air dry.  After only 3 days, her tear stains are much lighter.  I don't know if it will make the tear stains disappear completely, but as I said, that's not a real concern, I just don't want them to be so dark - she looks like a little white raccoon!  So I really think that this is a good product.  Gentle, smells great, and definitely lightens tear stains.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOLTTKUGBYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AWH582#wasThisHelpful","R1NOLTTKUGBYE","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay - when I first started reading J.R. Ward's ""The Black Dagger Brotherhood"" Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1) it was an addiction; so bad that I didn't touch FB until I had plowed through all of the books.This is turning out to be the same. Stephanie Rowe's ""Order of the Blade"" books are awesome!  The characters are extremely well developed.  The story line moves quickly (for the most part), and it's a great plot.  There are multiple stories going on but they interweave very nicely.  There are many excellent reviews here that give a very concise synopsis of the story so I won't bore you by repeating their efforts.So why do I give it four stars?  There are a couple of things.  First of all, while I love the romance, some of it gets rather redundant and annoying.  I found myself skipping pages to try and get through things that had already been said - over and over.  She's so strong but I shouldn't succumb to this, blah, blah, blah.  While I found it annoying, others may not feel the same as it *does* help to develop the characters and build depth.The other reason I gave it 4 stars is that I am a bit of a grammar Nazi.  There is nothing that irks me more than errors in books.  There were not many, but being OCD as I am, it made me clench my jaw and want to whip out my yellow highlighter each time I found one.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not talking errors every other line, or even on every page.  Maybe about 25 or so throughout the entire book so really, not a lot, but as I said - I have a very OCD personality and it just detracted a bit.Overall though - I am sitting here thinking I MUST work, but would rather read.  I highly recommend this book/series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTX442IOEU0V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JE1B1C#wasThisHelpful","RTX442IOEU0V5","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this because I have an older rabbit who pellets once in a while.  If you know anything about buns, they have very small, very lightweight, very dry, very round pellets that roll everywhere when swept.  However, if you run over them with your vacuum, as they get churned up, they start to make the vacuum smell, well, not pleasant.  I bought this so that I could ""pre vacuum"" my floor before running over it with my Dyson to pick up loose hair, dirt and what not.  Unfortunately, it doesn't pick up anything - at all!  With the floor sweeper on, it doesn't do anything.  If I put the crevice tool on, and put it over each individual item I want to pick up and hold it there for a minute - eventually it will pick it up.  Frankly, it would be faster for me to get down on my hands and knees and pick up everything by hand.  There is no suction at all.  The best that this can be used for is possibly a daily vacuum to pick up dust, but it doesn't work on dirt or pet hair at all.  You're much better off buying a cheap broom and sweeping the floor.  Definitely not worth $20.  I would recommend that you save a couple of dollars and buy a Libman Precision Angle Broom instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYHHSG0ON9UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FFUQZO#wasThisHelpful","RFYHHSG0ON9UC","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, this came on Wednesday.  It sat in our living room for a few days before we finally had a chance to put it together.  It took about 4 hours to put together.  I did it by myself (I am a 140 pound woman).  The instructions were very straight forward and easy to follow.  I had a few problems with some of the bolts not fitting properly, but I was able to work through the problem by using a ratchet rather than the included Allen wrench.  Once I got it put together, I used it for about 3 hours (I set up my computer across the arms so I can walk while I work) and I had no problems.  It's not super quiet - you can hear the belt running across the surface (not squeaking - just a sliding noise), and my footsteps (which tend to be heavy anyway) make it sound like a herd of elephants is walking through the room, but for the price, I am very pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD17RPC0ZSF96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048HS02G#wasThisHelpful","RD17RPC0ZSF96","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this ball because I have a bad back and want to use it as a chair to help with spinal stability.  Therefore, achieving the 90 degree angle between my hips and legs is *very* important.  I bought the 75 cm ball because I am relatively tall.  I inflated it, using a level and a hashmark on the wall to ensure that it was inflated to the proper size.  At 65 cm., I was frightened to keep inflating for fear that I might over-inflate and injure myself.  I took it inside and when I sat on it (at 140 pounds) it barely makes a dimple.  Thus, I know I am at about max capacity.  The angle is a little shy of 90 degrees so I guess I'll keep the ball until I can find a better one.

"I bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy SIII (obviously).  My daughter had an Otterbox on her iPhone so I was somewhat prepared for the bulk.  I use a Vera Bradley Smartphone Wristlet as my purse and the bulk of the Otterbox makes it a rather tight fit, while the cell phone by itself fits easily.  However, I feel confident that the Otterbox will protect my phone from my random slinging and dropping (which is pretty standard for me).  Also, because I bought the Defender, I am hoping that if it gets splashed (not dunked) the Otterbox will provide some basic level or protection.  I like the fact that even the screen is encased in plastic, so I am relatively certain that my phone will be protected from all but the most extreme situations.The only thing I would like to point out - if you have never had an Otterbox, it takes the phone from a slim quarter inch to more than double that thickness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2644O0QDLLKZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085JRQPK#wasThisHelpful","R2644O0QDLLKZZ","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay - so I knew when I bought this, I would have some issues.  I have a 2010 Ford Mustang convertible and a 2 pound Maltese.  I was worried carrying her in our laps for fear that a small front end fender bender would make the air bags inflate and kill our poor little pup.  So, I measured between the seats and knew it would be wide enough...but... I don't have the right type of console.  The back section of the console opens and the front part is a drink holder.  When I got the seat, I was right - it didn't work.  However, I was able to take the rear straps and attach them to the undersides of the front seats in the back, then, for the front (which was the real problem), I attached two additional straps with clips and attached those underneath the front seats in the front.  To access my console, I need to unclip the front clips, to tip the seat back.  It works great.  While it did take some jury-rigging to work, it keeps her secure between the seats, and all 4 of my seats are still open for passengers (which was the concern with over the seat options).  We use it with a harness since if she had just the collar and was thrown it would snap her little neck. Once we clip her in the harness, I am confident that she is comfortable and safe.

"So, we have a 2 pound Maltese.  She is scared to walk across the tile to the door, and even if she would scratch, we couldn't hear it.  We bought this about a month ago.  We started by taking her to the bells, and using her paw or her nose to get her to ring the bell.  Then we'd say ""Outside"".  After a while, we would just lead her to the bell (which is on the wall before the tile) and say ""Ring the bell to go OUTSIDE"".  We emphasized the word outside.  We would ring the bell, then tap the wall next to the bell until she nudged it with her nose.  Then we started asking ""Do you need to go outside?""  And she would run to the bell and give it a nudge with her nose.  Now, about 50% of the time, when she wants to go outside, even just to play, she gives it a little nudge with her nose.  We can also get her to go outside by ringing the bell ourselves.  She's still learning, but she definitely associates the bell with going out.  You just need to be consistent and PATIENT!  It won't happen overnight.  Like I said, it's been a month for us, and we are still not all the way there, but we have high hopes.

"Okay - I'm going to start off with a 5 and I'll revise from there.  I'll tell you why I am giving this score when I have not even received the book. I am a well educated individual and teach at a college level.  My husband is a DVM.  I want you to understand where I'm coming from here - I'm not an uneducated lout.  So I saw this commercial on TV and thought hmmmmm....I have a daughter who struggles in math as well.  I thought this might help her (and I might find it useful too).  My husband was also intrigued.  I did some research on the web and found one of his teaching videos (It's about a half hour long if you are looking for it).  As I started watching, I thought...this guy is a quack.  My husband even said ""How much did you pay for that book?""  I hadn't ordered yet...I was still trying to figure it out.  So as I continued to watch, things started to make sense.  He seems to use a combination of chunking and mnemonics to help you work with the numbers.  It's not going to make you a math whiz - you still need to know how to do the basics (add,subtract,divide, multiply), but...if you can do the basics, it seems that this will make you able to expand upon that knowledge.  I'll add more after I get the book and start learning....Okay - have had the book now for a little over a month.  The information contained within is very simple to follow.  At first, it seems as if it won't work, but with practice, it actually makes difficult math problems easy.  It's more for straight calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) rather than the higher level critical thinking involved in algebra or calculus, but it definitely makes those quicker as you don't have to take the time for the basic math.  The memorization skills taught are also very useful.  I have difficult putting names to faces, but now - it is much easier.  It's basic association and mnemonics, but the tips are very useful.  All in all, this is a very good book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MYJUNW6H53A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307338401#wasThisHelpful","R15MYJUNW6H53A","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work from home and sit on the couch pretty much 24/7.  While I'm not overweight, I am definitely a slug.  I bought this after getting a Kinect for Christmas and enjoying the games that came with the console.  I decided that I would use it regularly in an attempt to A) get in shape and B) lose some weight (could stand to lose about 10 pounds).  So far so good.  I drop my daughter at school in the morning and start with a 30 minute work out.  I usually do a couple of the warm up exercises, and then one or two of the routines depending on how I feel.  Sometimes I'll go for 30 minutes, sometimes an hour.  Then, throughout the day, at the top of every hour, I do one 5 minute modules, jumping around from exercise to exercise.  I particularly like the cardio boxing, but I've tried the Bollywood Dancing, the Hip Hop, African Rhythms, etc.  I also enjoy the Run the World modules.  This gets me up, gives me a break, and like I said - most only take about 5 minutes.  I'm hoping it's keeping my metabolism up.  At the end of the day, I sleep like a rock, which is great because I have been dependent upon sleeping pills for about 2 years now.  This is marvelous.  No weight loss yet (after 2 weeks) but I feel energized, and really less moody.  And it's soooo much easier than the gym.  (Like I'm going to pop over to the gym every hour for a 5 minute workout).  And since I am totally uncoordinated, I end up giggly half the time which I know releases endorphins which is a natural mood enhancer.  Okay - maybe it's not all Hoo-Ra and whatever, but it gets me off the couch, I feel pleasantly sore every day (not painfully), and even my family has noticed I'm less moody.  I'd say 5 stars for anyone who wants something just to get them started on a workout routine, but if you are already fit, and looking for something serious, maybe not for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NOOOAL2RZEO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0H9WM#wasThisHelpful","R3NOOOAL2RZEO6","A39F9IIEG14KE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39F9IIEG14KE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"White is a good historical fiction writer of sailing ship sea warfare, but he's not on a level with Patrick O'Brien or even C.S. Forester. He does however give a good depiction of the life of an early 19th century midshipman in the US Navy. The battle scenes are a bit contrived - even though based upon historical facts.This is the first book in a series and the first book by White I've read, so he may very well get better at his craft in later books.

"I've had several of this kind of tape dispenser over the years and like many others had developed a love-hate relationship with them. Either the spring holding the tape would bend beyond redemption or the tape would not cut. So, I would go out and either buy better tape or a new dispenser.Then I got smart and decided to actually read a few reviews before getting another tape dispenser. That's how I happened to come into possession  of this little gem. It works. Not only does it work, but it does a great job. There's an actual tape-holding spring (instead of a metal tab) that won't eventually bend out of shape and become useless. There's a deep tined set of sharp cutting teeth (they warn you about not cutting yourself in several places in the instructions) that easily cut through the tape at the end of applying a strip. You don't even have to apply much pressure to make that cut, which is probably the most pleasurable thing about using this device. Of course it's comfortable to handle and there's the usual tensioner knob to figure out.

It would just leave the light on and you couldn't turn it off from the other 3-way switch - not how it's supposed to  be! I checked the electrical house wiring to make absolutely sure it was correct (and it was) and then I bench tested this Lutron unit.

"This LensAlign specialty ruler is designed for fine tuning long lenses, 300mm and greater. It is best used with Tape's FocusTune software but you can do the fine tuning just with visible observations.Aligning really long lenses is far more difficult than for shorter focal length glass. The main problem is not the ruler itself, but rather the size of the centering and focusing targets that come standard with the LensAlign system. They're fine for up to about 300mm, but greater than that focal length causes you to be so far from the targets that both centering and focusing are difficult to achieve due to the very small size.The construction of the Long Ruler is top notch. Three sections snap together using magnetic connections to create the entire length of the ruler, which then fits perfectly into the LensAlign target hardware.Although not perfect, using the Long Ruler is still the best way to align a long lens, compared to all other methods available.

"Very easy initial setup, even if the instructions don't warn you that the device takes several minutes to complete the boot. I followed the steps for pairing it with my WiFi router signal, and it worked right away. Unfortunately the Almond 2015 is restricted to only working on 2.4-GHz, something that I didn't know about until after I got the unit. The WiFi signal really is nicely boosted (as measured with a smartphone app) and you can clearly see how it compares with the original router signal. The amplified WiFi signal is identified by having an 'Almond' (or lmond) appended to the original network name. The first few days I tested the Almond, I was able to pair it with both a LinkSys 1200A WiFi router and then a Netgear 779S AirCard.I then went to the Securifi site and registered the unit. Then things started to go south. The site kept on telling me to link my device with the Almond. The way this works is that they send a signal to the Almond and it then generates a code on its tiny screen that you're supposed to type in on the Securifi site. I tried this several times without success. On the second day, I couldn't get the Almond unit to connect to the Internet at all, no matter what WiFi adapter I tried - even disabling/enabling, etc. I called the company and they eventually did get back to me several hours later, but by then I became fed up enough to re-box and return the unit.Hugely in Securifi's favor is the fact that I was actually called back by a tech who apologized for my troubles. This communication in and of itself is enough for me to consider buying from them again at some future point. Also, if I had been more patient, I'm fairly sure that the tech that I spoke with would have eventually solved the problems I was encountering. On the other hand - and this is really a message to all tech companies - why the heck should I have to spend hours troubleshooting a brand new piece of technology when no one is paying me to do so?","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JNCTJG9FLU93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQJRXMQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JNCTJG9FLU93","A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These traps are much better made than traditional wood and wire mousetraps. I've been using them in a shed for about a year and see no signs of rust so far (traditional traps placed in the same location rusted very quickly). The placement of bate and the cocking of the traps is superior to what I've experienced with wooden trapsSo why no 4-stars? The bottom line for any mousetrap is will it catch mice. This one does do that job but not any better than those old wooden traps do. I think having a little cup for bait placement instead of wedging the bait under a clip (wooden traps) may be why I'm not seeing better results. With the cup, I often find the bait has been stolen whereas with the wedge method, it's somewhat harder to remove that bait without tripping the trap. I've started using sticky candy (Tootsie roll and Reese's Pieces) to make it more difficult for mice to remove the bait, and this has improved their performance.Overall, I'm satisfied with the MLG traps and prefer them to the old wooden standbys.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W6XTVMDWYHOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVGCCNE#wasThisHelpful","R1W6XTVMDWYHOK","A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case cover is well-made and fits the S5 like a glove. There is no blockage of the ports, camera, microphone, speaker when the case is open. The magnetic closure is just strong enough to keep the case closed in normal use, but it could open up if dropped. The protection is there, but the price of that is having to open the case for use. With the case opened, it is rather awkward to handle the camera - since just wrapping the door around to the back would then block it. This is a drawback of any such full closure protective case, but it is something that is worth it if you really want pocket and drop protection for the screen. The card slot is really not too useful since inserting anything but the thinnest card into it could interfere with the magnet holding the door closed.Overall, I'm satisfied with this smartphone case and have already ordered a similar one for my wife's iPhone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P19GZ868SRIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T05W1QW#wasThisHelpful","R3P19GZ868SRIF","A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keep away from this product.We purchased one - based upon sterling (but in retrospect dubious) reviews and followed all the instructions about filling and boiling water through it twice before actual use. What occurred is that the unit gave off a strong plastic chemical smell. This awful smell persisted even after this initial 'break in period', and would not go away.That in itself should have been enough to return the boiler, but wait - there's more. The directions state that the user should expect rust spots to eventually appear on the inside of the stainless steel pot, even giving instructions as to how to clean these spots when they occur. We've owned a variety of different stainless steel kettles and pots and have only seen such rust spots appear on the very cheapest products.The Secura Electric Water Boiler is built like a house of cards. It's so flimsily constructed that I doubt it would even last several months.

"This carburetor was almost an exact match for the original on my Echo SRM 260S. However, there are 2 major differences. The first is a negative in that the bracket for the throttle cable did not match the original. In fact, It was impossible to install the throttle cable since the new adjusting mechanism and bracket raised flange made the cable too short for it to be attached. The original was composed of a shorter deal consisting of two nuts and the original bracket had an open notch so that you just had to loosen the nuts and slide in the brass threaded end of the cable housing. The replacement carburetor had a closed threaded bracket so I had to drill out the threaded hole, cut off the extra raised flange and cut an opening on the side. Then I just used the original 2 nuts for the cable length (throttle) adjuster.The second difference between the old and this replacement carburetor is why I'm rating it with 5-stars in spite of my previous comments. The newer carburetor comes with a jet mixture adjustment whereas the original had none and was just factory set. This allows you to tune the mixture to achieve maximum power. I was able to just turn that mixing screw back and forth (with the trimmer running at full throttle) until I could get the rpm at its maximum. The increase in power on this trimmer was astonishing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELTQMMI4FWXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0SO7CS#wasThisHelpful","RELTQMMI4FWXV","A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is the MindShift Rotation 180 Pro the best day-hiker? No. Dedicated day packs made by several other well-respected manufacturers are both better balanced and more comfortable. Is the Mindshift Rotation 180 Pro the best photo pack out there?  Absolutely yes. Over the years I’ve accumulated several different day and photo packs and the Rotation 180 is in a class of its own.What makes this the very best photo day-hiking pack ever invented is its clever design. The pack is supported by an excellent suspension system consisting of a well-padded hip belt and comfortable curved shoulder straps. The shoulder, waist belt and sternum straps are all quickly and easily adjustable for the torso of most users. Unfortunately there's no dedicated torso adjustment mechanism (like on some Osprey and Lowe packs) for small, medium or large, but this is only a minor drawback. The back section is padded with foam and covered with a sweat-absorbing mesh. This isn't quite as comfortable as a full air-circulating mesh back, but it's adequate and does absorb sweat.There are additionally all kinds of patch pockets on the pack for small item storage as well as plenty of straps. All the zipper pulls are extra wide easy-to-use loops. The pack comes with a special rain cover that still allows the quick access rotation fanny pack to operate. It’s tucked away in its own small dedicated external patch compartment. Many of the straps that come with the pack have a unique spring loaded gated nylon hook which makes them very easy to attach and remove.Main (upper) compartment access is outstanding on this pack. You can get to the main upper compartment from the top or from the back (the padded back has a double zipper). This is important to me since the main compartment is where I store extra clothing, raingear, food, etc. – as well as extra lenses. This means that you have to remove the pack for upper compartment access, but that’s true for all conventional daypacks.Photo gear or day hiking gear for the main compartment?: This is up to the user. If you want to use it to haul around loads of extra lenses, flashes, etc., then get the Rotation 180 with the internal padded insert. Of course this then leaves you with little extra room for clothing, food, etc. I opted to not get that padded insert and saved several ounces of extra weight and gained a heck of a lot of extra room. I still pack some extra photo gear in the main compartment keeping things protected in either light-weight padded bags or with my extra clothing. I also purchased an optional top pocket for even more storage room, but I have not yet tried it out.Water hauling: The left side of the pack has a compartment that can hold up to a 3-liter bladder. There’s also a conventional pocket for a water bottle on the lower left. This means that your precious photo gear and clothing are kept separate from your water supply – an important consideration.EDIT: THE WATER BLADDER COMPARTMENT WILL FIT A 3-LITER BLADDER BUT IT'S FAR TOO TIGHT. ONCE THE FULL BLADDER IS INSERTED, IT BULGES INTO THE ROTATION (LOWER) SECTION SO MUCH THAT IT INTERFERES WITH THE FANNY PACK. tHE FANNY PACK CAN BE ROTATED OUT BUT ROTATING IT BACK IN WITH THAT WATER BLADDER BULGE MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIT. MINDSHIFT NEEDS TO MAKE THAT WATER BLADDER COMPARTMENT MUCH LARGER AND/OR MADE OF A STRETCHY FABRIC. MY SOLUTION SO FAR IS TO USE A 2-LITER BLADDER (EXCELLENT ONE BY ULTIMATE DIRECTION) AND SUSPEND IT ABOVE THE ROTATION COMPARTMENT WHERE IT CAN'T BULGE IN AND INTERFER. ALTERNATIVELY, PLACING A 2-LITER BLADDER IN THE SIDE PATCH COMPARTMENT WOULD ALSO REDUCE INTERFERENCE WITH THE ROTATION COMPARTMENT.Tripod toting: A tripod can be securely mounted on the front or on the left side of the pack. I tried it out with a 2.5 lb. tripod strapped to the back for a combined pack weight of 20-lbs, and there was almost no back pull on the upper part of the shoulder straps. This is an indication of the good weight balance that the Rotation 180 provides.Protection for photo gear: I generally don’t like packs that have any photo gear on the bottom, since this is where you’re sure to thump down the pack when you eventually take it off. However in the case of the Rotation 180, there’s so much bottom padding on both the pack itself combined with the padded internal fanny pack compartment that this almost becomes a moot point. I still would be careful not to drop the pack on its bottom, just to be safe.Special access to a camera is accomplished by simply loosening the waist belt, lifting the magnetic hook and rotating the entire camera section around to your front. Then you unzip the camera section, remove the camera and shoot. There are plenty of videos of this procedure available, so I’ll just add that it actually works quite easily and rapidly. You can remove this entire camera section and use it as a separate fanny pack if you want. The camera section is big enough for me to have used it to carry a full-frame body with a 300mm lens attached. A typical deployment of the camera – from packed away to shooting – can be done in under 10-seconds, which is really what sets the Rotation 180 completely above any of the other competing photo day packs.Now what I like best about this pack: The Rotation 180 allows me to safely and comfortably carry my camera gear and not have to remove my pack every time I want to take a photo. This is a big deal, a very big deal. It encourages me to take more shots since I don’t have to take the pack off and did around for the camera. It also gives me the confidence of knowing that I can get to my camera in a few seconds if that special money shot opportunity suddenly materializes.Finally, a photo pack that's not a PITA!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1II3AH3MVISL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOEQB3E#wasThisHelpful","R1II3AH3MVISL7","A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another typical Lucas Davenport novel from John Sandford. Like all his other novels, you get the feeling that you're riding on a slightly out of control freight train. The plot is similar to many of his other Prey novels, so there's no big surprise there. If you're addicted to Sandford (I'll freely admit I'm one of the hooked ones) then you'll quickly recognize the story's progression, but I enjoyed it immensely nevertheless.

"This is one of the few plastic pipe cutters that actually specify that it will cut both PVC and ABS.The tool is beautifully designed and manufactured and is extremely easy to use.

I had a special need to get absolutely square and smooth cuts and the Reed shears  were able to do a perfect job.This is a pricy tool, but in this case you get what you pay for.Note 1: The Company suggests that you slightly heat the pipe before cutting to prevent splitting. I did several cuts applying heat and several cuts without any heat in a warm basement. All cuts came out perfect - even from the ends of the pipe - with or without the extra heating.Note 2: The replacement blades for this tool cost about $57 - which is close to half the tool's selling price.

"I have a bunch of this sort of pole tips from a variety of different manufacturers but these Black Diamond tips are the best.

I'll just replace them when that happens. I'd rather have that superior traction.Caution: these pole tips fit best on wider shaft ends. They were too wide for my wife's EMS poles.Hint #1: If the pole tips do not fit tightly enough, just coat the inside with some silicone adhesive or caulking. You can then still remove them but they won't easily fall off by accident.Hint #2: Get several pairs of these (or any) pole tips.

"I've used this mini humidifier for several months and it does work. It sprays up a small fountain of mist that must be adding water vapor to the air. However, it actually does very little to increase the humidity. I have it in a 9.5' X 17' room with a humidistat, and it hardly registers any increase in humidity at all. Of course, this little vaporizer isn't really designed for such a large room volume. But, where are you going to use it otherwise? I imagine it would be fine if you used it in a closet, but that's just not realistic.You can't run this thing (it plugs into a USB port for power) for more than an 8-hour stretch, after which it just turns itself off. To turn it back on you have to unplug it from the USB port and then plug it in again for another 8-hours. I've kept it in an 8-oz container full of water that needs replenishing after about 24-hours or so because the wick is only a few inches long and needs to be at least partially submerged for the device to operate.The wicks that are sold for use with it don't dip very far into a water reservoir (bottle or cup) which is why it must be replenished so often. The Satechi humidifier does need periodic wick replacement, but a single wick did last for a few months of light (8-hours/day) usage.I suppose someone somewhere will have a viable use for this device, but I'm pretty sure at this point that I could have lived without it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0O3GLP4PAOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3AX6R2#wasThisHelpful","R2R0O3GLP4PAOH","A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used these particular Lace Locks  for several years on a variety of shoes and hiking boots and they are the only kind that actually work. I've tried all the other such devices available and only these little gems keep laces tight without slippage. I mean they won't slip even on hiking boots used rigorously through an entire day of climbing. They are also extremely easy to loosen or tighten for boot removal, yet incredibly stay put if you leave them alone. The way they operate is through a simple plastic cam gear that jams the laces against the sides when the slider is moved down. Slide the cam-gear up to loosen and down to cinch the laces in place. It's that simple.Some things to be aware of regarding the Sammons Preston Rolyan LaceLock: The diameter of the lace matters; too thin and there won't be enough surface area for that cam-gear to grab and hold on. Laces that are too thick will certainly hold better, but will be harder to insert into the mechanism. Fortunately most boot laces are just about the right thickness.A trick that I've learned to aid in installing the lace ends into the mechanism is to use a toothpick or a very thin screwdriver of similar small diameter. You can then push the lace ends through (one at a time) until they protrude enough to pull out with a pair of needle-nose pliers. Then, just follow the included directions for cutting to length and knotting.  Use some glue (or just melt if nylon laces) to prevent unraveling of the cut end tips.One last word on longevity, these things last and last. You'd imagine that since they're made of plastic that they'd eventually wear out, but I haven't been able to kill the original one I bought even after several years use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OW2326Z1JBNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007G4UJN6#wasThisHelpful","R2OW2326Z1JBNU","A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finding a glimmer of hope in the economic environment is a challenge these days - particularly in the aftermath of the recession. But business writer Rachel Botsman and entrepreneur Roo Rogers make you feel optimistic about the concept of ""collaborative consumption"" and its potential to alter the way people conduct business - and business relationships. The authors cite many user-friendly marketplaces where consumers share, rent, trade and barter while creating meaningful, human connections. Botsman and Rogers suggest that financial upheaval has paved a pathway to a kinder, more introspective era that will bring out the innate goodness and spirit of cooperation in individuals.

He offers a contrarian and sobering opinion based on his exhaustive research: The high-flying price of gold - that supposed safe haven beloved by spooked investors - will soon plummet to Earth. Jacobs pulls out all the stops - often repetitively so - to back up his claim, and his statistics and data are impressive, though pretty much all focused on his point of view. getAbstract, which never gives investment advice, recommends this thought-provoking look at gold to those worried that their investments could turn to dross.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A6FR3ONV3QIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118239350#wasThisHelpful","R3A6FR3ONV3QIM","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You can read this book two ways, depending on your perspective: If you are a marketer or businessperson selling goods or services, you can marvel at the skill and genuine cleverness with which media buyers and associated digerati companies have mined Internet connections to get beneath the skin of today's consumers. As a result, they are getting ever closer to the marketers' Holy Grail - the ability to target advertising to the right individuals and avoid waste. After all, people like receiving relevant ads, special offers and discounts, don't they? On the other hand - and this is the perspective of author Joseph Turow, professor of communications at the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania - this style of marketing leads to discrimination: Marketers' favored consumers get better offers. Most people have little understanding of the law and find corporate privacy policies opaque. Turow explains (perhaps sometimes with too great a density of detail and jargon) that the public has had no choice in these developments.

Citing their extensive research, the authors show that most brand conversations happen offline and that when firms shift their marketing focus to Facebook, sales generally fall.

"Most firms agree that their employees are their ""most important asset,"" but few firms use their people strategically in today's ""war for talent."" When you ""differentiate"" your workforce, you develop your best employees to fulfill your company's strategic goals. Your job as a manager is to deploy talent as you would any other strategic resource - because that's what it is. So instead of using across-the-board spending to educate and develop all workers, you are more likely to realize your strategic goals if you allocate more resources to develop the people with the highest potential. Differentiating means identifying the right employees to ""train harder and advance faster."" Brian E. Becker and Mark A. Huselid (who co-wrote The HR Scorecard) and Richard W. Beatty (their co-author on The Workforce Scorecard) explain why a differentiated workforce strategy is crucial. Then they outline a step-by-step process for identifying which employees have strategic talent and for managing them to achieve your company's goals. getAbstract recommends their tactical approach to workforce management to business owners and human resources professionals who are eager to make strategic use of their troops.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38B3A72H53NH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142210446X#wasThisHelpful","R38B3A72H53NH5","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Deloitte executive Cathleen Benko and former executive Anne Weisberg say companies must abandon the traditional notion of a corporate ladder - on which you can only go up or step off - in favor of a new metaphor, the ""corporate lattice,"" which views career paths across a grid - instead of a ladder - allowing for growth along varied paths. getAbstract recommends this book's solutions to senior managers and strategists charged with attracting, retaining and advancing a highly productive workforce, to those stuck on or off the corporate ladder, and to those who guide employees through career transitions and growth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZOCTNIHPIWL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1422110338#wasThisHelpful","R2ZOCTNIHPIWL8","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heartbeat of Apple's success is deep reverence for design. The late CEO Steve Jobs had a vision for Apple that included using design to create ""insanely great"" products to wow customers and provide an exceptional user experience. That's why people wait in line for days to be the first to own the newest iPhone or iPad. It's also why the company is a runaway financial success. LUNAR president and designer John Edson examines the seven design precepts underlying Apple's success and explains how to apply them to your business. Edson regales readers with first-hand experiences and provides an inside look into Apple. If Apple were to design a book, it would look like this beautiful volume, with its clean white cover, glossy stock and elegant typeface. getAbstract believes designers and business managers should embrace and learn from Edson's report on Apple's successful devotion to design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGSYWYFCYTZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118290313#wasThisHelpful","R3FGSYWYFCYTZN","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"White-collar employees are working harder than ever. Many get to their offices early, leave late, work through lunch and stay at their desks over the weekends and on holidays. Yet these workers are often minimally productive. Robert C. Pozen, a former CEO who lectures on management issues at Harvard Business School, offers solutions for this dilemma in this sensible manual about time management, productivity and focus. His advice, which particularly applies to knowledge workers, is sound and generally useful. It seems like common sense, not new or flashy, but Pozen is good at helping you build confidence by establishing concrete processes. getAbstract recommends Pozen's helpful guide to professionals, managers, knowledge workers and all who want to boost their time management and productivity skills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M42FOUVQ6RFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062188534#wasThisHelpful","R3M42FOUVQ6RFW","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Organizations have different values and viewpoints. Some are ""extractive,"" which means they drain the maximum financial value out of their coffers at all costs. Ownership strategy specialist Marjorie Kelly contends that the extractive nature of capitalism led to the 2008 recession because ""financialized ownership"" pushed the economic system beyond its tolerance. Some organizations, in contrast, are ""generative"" and base their structure on ""sustainability, community and sufficiency."" Kelly's impassioned arguments in favor of a generative, sustaining economy could strike some readers as pie in the sky, though she offers numerous real-life examples of global businesses pioneering fresh approaches to ownership.

"Management consultants Don Edward Beck and Christopher C. Cowan based this 1996 study on potentially game-changing work that professor Clare Graves completed 30 years earlier. The authors describe a series of spirals as the basic construct in the life cycle of a person, organization or nation. All the spirals or levels in this ""spiral dynamic"" system can be present simultaneously, and they are infinite - they place no limit on human or group development. Anyone who has worked with other people will find that spiral's levels look familiar and make sense. A less useful book might end by describing the levels and their values or ""memes,"" but here, the authors supply dozens of examples and a detailed blueprint for putting knowledge of the levels into practice to help people and groups change. While smart and applicable, the book is difficult to parse: It is stylistically flawed, the editing is shaky and the structure is baffling. After reading the introduction and chapter 1, readers should skip to section 3 - a rich, interesting description of each level on the spiral. After this, getAbstract finds, reading chapters 2 to 8 - which cover the actual application of spiral dynamics - will be far more rewarding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T40WDBUUS2PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405133562#wasThisHelpful","R2T40WDBUUS2PV","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many executives make decisions without consulting experts, weighing facts, considering options or engaging in thoughtful analysis. They trust their intuition and act accordingly. Such decisions often prove ruinous. Knowledge management experts Thomas H. Davenport and Brook Manville propose an alternative decision-making process - ""organizational judgment"" - that relies on the collective wisdom, expertise and reasoning of well-informed, collaborative groups. The authors cite case studies of varying strength (some really intriguing and useful; some perhaps not quite as piercing) to illustrate how organizational judgment proves far superior to the ""golden guts"" of prominent individuals who are subject to the same cognitive biases as everyone else. getAbstract recommends this perceptive analysis to all decision makers and organizational leaders.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKMGM2MV3EEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142215811X#wasThisHelpful","R2NKMGM2MV3EEF","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Management experts Linda D. Sharkey, Nazneen Razi, Robert A. Cooke and Peter Barge acknowledge the common characteristics and competencies of good leaders but argue convincingly that global leaders need additional, unique skills. The authors have sufficient impressive knowledge of global business to write knowingly about global leadership based on their experience alone. Yet this work stands out because they add their analysis of past and new research, including surveys and interviews with some 150 global leaders, and they use that data to test their assumptions. This uncluttered, interesting read includes new, useful and, in one case, even surprising findings. Of course, the authors offer the inevitable global leadership basics, but they present these core concepts in a succinct, relevant way as they build toward a logical, evidence-based framework that features practical tools and guidelines for developing global leaders. getAbstract recommends this book to board members, executives, leadership development experts, HR officers, and actual and aspiring global leaders.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VYDMJ5WMIL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071790519#wasThisHelpful","R21VYDMJ5WMIL4","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the late 1970s, China first began to open its economy and edge toward capitalism - a process that, perhaps, evolved into a conscious policy direction only when Deng Xiaoping declared in 1992, ""To get rich is glorious."" In this transition, China decided not to adopt the West's approach. Instead, it altered capitalism to fit Chinese culture, traditions and sensibilities. In the interim, China has experienced an ""economic miracle,"" achieving an outstanding annual growth rate. Meanwhile, the United States faces economic challenges. Therefore, contends economist Ann Lee, the US should change how capitalism works within its borders. She says America could learn from China's policies, such as its inventive adaptation of capitalism and certain aspects of its governance. A former stock research analyst and now a New York University professor, Lee is a frequent US media commentator. She offers a pessimistic - though sometimes fond - view of the US and the West, and a positive - sometimes excessively so - view of China. (For instance, China does help African nations, as she says, but often in exchange for their natural resources.) Both points of view may seem contrarian to most Westerners, so Lee's treatise could well be instructive - and she may more candidly reflect beliefs held in China than most US coverage. While always politically neutral, getAbstract suggests her iconoclastic, controversial book to those who are interested in her take on how China's economy grew, how it works and whether it offers ideas that might benefit the West.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB01YI9QXI44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609941241#wasThisHelpful","R1XB01YI9QXI44","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book's title refers to three key aspects of innovation: the need to innovate now, the speed of approaching singularity and the direction of innovation, and greed for what success looks like today, though the author actually warns against greediness.

"Do you feel as if you see ""Made in China"" everywhere you look? Financial Times correspondent Richard McGregor explains why and more. He unveils the secrets of one of the most mysterious organizations in the world: the Chinese Communist Party. If you think a communist organization controlling a major global economy is counterintuitive, you're probably right. But McGregor explains how it all happened - and the roles that various entities such as business, the Chinese military, and the nation's regions and cities continue to play. Understanding how an anticapitalist, communist country became one of the world's economic powerhouses means dealing with a cast of thousands and a dizzying array of names and roles. And time is marching forward as China's new head of state, Xi Jinping, is now replacing Hu Jintao, the leader at the book's center.

"Philosopher Adam Smith himself was skeptical about the real-world results of his ""invisible hand,"" but you'd never know it by the way modern-day free market fundamentalists try to push every regulation out of the way. As Cornell economist Robert H. Frank notes in his assault on the ideological force field that has blocked much US government action, naturalist Charles Darwin identified the problem: Evolutionary incentives benefit individuals, not groups. Frank uses that insight to argue that government must abridge some personal gains for the greater good. Frank is an economics professor, and his book sometimes falls into a challenging didacticism. But he writes with admirable clarity and verve, and - while his prediction that the world will one day recognize Darwin as the father of economics is perhaps a reach - he has done nothing less than provide a fresh intellectual foundation for progressivism.

"""Performance analysis"" (PA) allows companies to determine their needs and assess their accomplishments based on data, not guesses or hunches. Whether you're looking to improve your employees' skills, upgrade your company's support systems or forecast trends, accurate PA is the key to success.

Business moves so fast that any delay in PA risks making its information obsolete. But working quickly need not mean a drop in quality, argues education technologist Allison Rossett. With clear explanations, charts and testimony from ""the trenches,"" she illuminates the path to accurate, applicable performance analysis. getAbstract believes her insights and advice are a valuable guide for chief learning officers, organizational development staffs, and HR officers or consultants who seek to lift their workforces or clients to the next level - and who prefer to look before they leap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIKOKHCKKWEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0787988480#wasThisHelpful","RUIKOKHCKKWEC","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"India has 1.1 billion people, about one of every six human beings on Earth. Until recently, most of these people were desperately poor. But while abject poverty remains an extremely daunting problem, many Indians are moving quickly into the middle class, a shift that offers a foundation for sustained growth and development. Editors Anuradha Dayal-Gulati and Dipak Jain - working with numerous informed contributors - provide an intriguing road map to the Indian marketplace, with insights about the prospects and challenges in several pivotal industrial sectors. This statistics-heavy compendium is thorough, though the style and quality of each chapter varies from one author's contribution to the next.

"Managers who try to coach their employees often make wrongheaded assumptions about what their staffers think. They offer unhelpful advice about what staffers should do to improve their work, and this is exactly what coaching should not be. Human Resource Development Hall of Famer John H. Zenger and his colleague Kathleen Stinnett spell out everything for managers who haven't a clue about coaching or how to conduct coaching sessions. getAbstract recommends discovering whether you need this helpful manual in much the same way that the authors suggest using when you conduct coaching sessions: by asking questions.

"Judging from the hype, globalization is either the best thing that's ever happened to the world and its economy or the death knell for civilization as we know it. The truth lies somewhere in the middle, and that's where economist Pankaj Ghemawat wants to lead you in this smart, exhaustive study of the realities of the ""semiglobalized"" world. Given that there's no turning back, he posits that a more realistic approach to globalization will result in more fairness, greater productivity and increased affluence for developed and developing countries. His formula for making the planet a better place calls for free and open markets with judicious, appropriate regulation. Although the book doesn't dwell on concrete proposals, and it becomes increasingly theoretical in its last two sections, Ghemawat does a superlative job of debunking exaggerated fears about globalization and highlighting its realities. getAbstract recommends this intelligent look forward at the potential of ""World 3.0.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7WUPTRZ48LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142213864X#wasThisHelpful","R1C7WUPTRZ48LF","A1NATT3PN24QWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NATT3PN24QWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The rules of business engagement have changed dramatically in recent years, and the traditional predictive model most business schools teach no longer suffices in the modern world. Babson College professors Danna Greenberg and Kate McKone-Sweet and researcher H. James Wilson present an anthology of academic papers that describe the college's experience teaching hands-on ""entrepreneurial leadership."" It also redefines the goal of business as reaching beyond profit to create social, environmental and economic value. This book of faculty papers from the Wellesley, Massachusetts, college offers an innovative, compelling model of leadership education, though like most anthologies it suffers from repetition and widely varying writing styles. Each chapter includes case studies and course descriptions from Babson, where students start and run businesses as part of their education. Although this collection may be a public relations bonanza for Babson, getAbstract recommends it because it shares enlightening insights about business education for professors, administrators, management students and today's leaders.

"In Tom Hanks's 1992 hit baseball film A League of Their Own, an exasperated coach tells his all-female team, ""There's no crying in baseball."" Maybe not, but emotion plays a role in every other business. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand your emotions and those of other people. EI derives from seeing and interpreting cues that indicate how you feel and how others feel. Such insights can be powerful tools for helping people reach their potential. This small volume by coaching experts Stephen Neale, Lisa Spencer-Arnell and Liz Wilson contains explanations, examples, case studies and worksheets to help you develop EI and use it in coaching.

"Why did the 2008 financial crisis occur? What steps must regulators and banks take to avoid similar disasters in the future? And how can individual investors protect themselves?

His position lends authoritative heft to his admonition to Wall Street: Make stewardship of your clients' interests your primary mission. By extension, he exhorts everyone to take responsibility for safeguarding the Earth's future. Though Taft's treatise is, in some ways, a fiduciary reiteration of familiar, sound advice - be nice to everybody - getAbstract recommends his thoughtful, knowledgeable and impassioned appeal for professional and personal accountability.

It has to draw you in and explain the specialty item and that Mr. Evans-Hylton does very well.He starts by explaining nuts and the different types and then how to roast them. considering how many recipes in other books call for roasted nuts I'm surprised it took someone so long to come up with a chapter on them. he is also the first person to tell me to soak chestnuts before roasting, Had I known that last year I might have spared myself and my wife  some very trying moments as unsoaked nuts started exploding!He then gets into recipes starting with small, simple snacks and building towards more complex recipes so this doesn't just tell you HOW to work with nuts, it teaches you as the book evolves leading you carefully into more complex works.In the end this is a wonderful niche cook book.

"In the late 20th century the people at TSR put out several supplements for games to deepen quality of play. Some were about particular races or classes or campaign ideas. A few were about world design , things like how to plan a world or how medieval castles worked which would add color and a sense of factual base to a game. Then we came to this: Arms and equipment.  I’d hoped it was about unusual stuff but it is not. It is for the person lacking any imagination or education. (How many of those are there in role playing?)There are a very few pages of things like clothes and gear like lanterns but far and away this is full of information for people who don’t know what chain mail is and who can’t tell the difference between a short sword and a two handed sword and page after page after page on pole arms so you can tell the difference between a glaive and a bardiche.  When D&D first came out there were articles on this in Dragon magazine, there were supplements with explanations of these and there were things called libraries with BOOKs to look them up. Now in the information age it is even easier to find out what the flock this stuff looks like.If you don’t have an imagination to tell you a short sword is, well, SHORT compared to a longsword then odds are you aren’t playing these games. If you don’t have the curiosity or intellectual ability to look this up you aren’t the person playing these games in the first place-go back to robbing freshmen of their milk money behind the gym and trying to impress the JV cheer leaders.While many of the TSR supplements are very good, this one is a complete and utter waste of time and money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXQIR0UBGKGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1560761091#wasThisHelpful","RPXQIR0UBGKGS","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the  first film, set in Edwardian England as Daniel Radcliff investigates an isolated mansion haunted by a vengeful spirit. Unfortunately the sequel set in World War Two was  not where near as good, loaded with historical errors with an ending that is beyond muddled.The film starts out in 1941 when children are evacuated from London in the blitz to an isolated mansion in the countryside, and pits a young teacher against the evil title character. From the very first frame, historical errors start popping up. It shows people sheltering from bombs in the London underground in 1941.  All well and good but all this was done in 1940 and people at the worst of it did not actually shelter on the tracks-as the trains kept running this would have been...bad.There are also referenced to LMF- lack of moral fiber, official cowardice. Great but this term was used in WW1, by the second war Shell shock/combat fatigue was recognized as the wound it was and treated. Such historical errors go on and just detract from the knowledgeable viewer's enjoyment.The biggest errors was the lack of the local village. In the first film the village full of paranoid locals is a key element balancing Radcliffe's sensible character. In this we only get occasional visits from the local doctor and that's it stripping away completely one of the key elements of the first film.Lastly the end of the film, the final conflict is so murky and dark I felt like I was watching an old radio show, yeah think about it.  In the first film dark shadows were highlighted by small islands of light, in this it is all dark. I guess that it is supposed to show that the teacher is struggling in the dark but the audience shouldn't. I honestly couldn't tell how she went from a hall way in the house to the bay. I hate to give spoilers but it was so badly done that I lost all interest.I thought about giving it a 3 star review , it started out with so much promise but the ending was so weak, so poor so badly flawed that it had to go down to 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R384AZWD82QWDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047FUSKQ#wasThisHelpful","R384AZWD82QWDN","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who don't know Vera Britain was an early feminist, a person who fought the needed battle for women's education in the early 20th century. Unfortunately her autobiography-upon which this is based- when compared to autobiographies of her contemporaries such as ""Goodbye to All that"" ""There's a Devil in the Drum"" or ""Memoirs of an infantry officer"" is slow, plodding and full of self righteous  and full of somewhat pedantic prose.I'd hoped that freed from her personal narrative the film would tell the story of this woman who having fought for the right to go to university became vastly disillusioned with the world seeing the best and brightest of her generation became chewed up by the horrors of the first world war.Unfortunately this was not to be. Most stories like this start out with people having happy lives that are slowly poisoned by the war, but in all honesty Vera of the film seems like what my dad would have called 'a right old misery.'  Even as a young woman she seems to be in a perpetual funk about this thing or that thing so as her world is torn apart by war, it just seems that she merely switches the target of her ire from one thing to another rather than discovering new levels of herself.The only time she actually seems happy are a few brief scenes of her engagement but overall she is portrayed as a completely unlikable and unsympathetic person who would make the likes of Sylvia Plathe say 'lighten up already!""As my wife said you wanted to feel something for her but she is so one dimensional, always upset about SOMETHING that you just don't care.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WE5L0FKJ8BHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P0WZRW#wasThisHelpful","R2WE5L0FKJ8BHU","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of a series of supplements done for AD&D in the mid 1990's giving players a chance to explore other time periods rather than just classic high fantasy.

Too many just recounted history of the period but in  Age of Heroes we have a really good example of how to. how to set up an adventure in a classical world, and how to write this sort of supplement.You don't need this to play  a good game, but this will certainly help you setting up a different world than is normal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YON12NKSWOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1560768142#wasThisHelpful","R29YON12NKSWOV","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I appreciate how difficult it is to make a tarot deck. you have to produce scores of pictures all of which follow the theme but you want to have your own impact indeed you have to work very hard to make a deck unusable. Unfortunately Donaldson and Pracownie have put that level of work in.I won't quibble over the artwork for its own sake. That is subjective. What I will take great exception though is how the pictures don't really match the themes. I mean that's the whole point of the ART on tarot decks. I mean you can just memorize what the 4 of cups or 3 of staves are by rote but the idea is that the art is supposed to convey some of that message within the picture and they just don't. I mean just to pick and choose 'temperance' shoes what looks like a goblin jumping at the viewer. Strength shows a dwarf sitting and thinking and  the hermit shows a dwarf standing with an ax in his hands-maybe these should have been reversed? the 'hermit' dwarf seems to more embody strength. The devil, a card meaning greed, shows the dragon Smaug burning a town, fair enough. the very next card, the tower, shows the same dragon, in almost the exact same position burning a valley. the images are almost identical. The magician card shows Gandalf-fair enough, entirely predictable. But so does the heriophant. again the wizard at a nightsky. uh, yeah. little enough to tell between them.The minor cards are even worse as traditionally they show the items names. I mean the 3 of swords is supposed to have a picture showing 3 swords. The 8 of coins shows 8 coins, and so forth, but these don't and the images again do not convey any sort of meaning. it just goes on and on and on. If you have a child who wants to play at reading cards without any real meaning or who wants to look at pictures of dwarves and such, groove, go for it. If you're looking for a usable deck, pass it by,pass it by.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2BAQQT4LH88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1572816775#wasThisHelpful","R3L2BAQQT4LH88","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the end of the film Gettysburg, there were small vignettes about the facts of each of the principal characters lives after the movie. not enough to be distinct but enough to slake the idol curiosity of the casual student. For all intents and purposes Robertson has done the same here creating a book with 70 mini biographies of people he feels were important. Each is 4-5 pages long and just enough to answer the question 'I wonder what happened to...?""It's cute and for the passing student of the era, a nice little resource so long as the person you're asking after is one of those in question. A great many of the choices though seem to be less  people who shaped america than personal interests of the author. I think we ALL know what happened to Custer after the war (just a little off the top) and some, like George Pickett, who did darn little sort of makes you question his statement that these were people who shaped america during reconstruction. I could think of others who did not appear but so can pretty much anyone with a passing knowledge of the period.What we're left with is a very nice little reference book, like an osprey monograph it's not the last word on the subject but it can cover basic questions and maybe set you in the right direction if you're looking for something more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J0V2W5Y6D1BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426215622#wasThisHelpful","R1J0V2W5Y6D1BK","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first encountered the stories of Dr Darwin decades ago in a paperback that had three of the short stories and I loved them but couldn't believe there were only three. Now, long years later I came upon this work, more stories, and all of them wonderful. My long wait has been rewarded!Living in the late 1700's the grandfather of Charles Darwin was himself a scientist and scholar and noted physician with an interest in mysteries and the unusual. Sheffield, a noted hard science fiction writer took this and molded it into almost Sherlock Holmes like adventures set in 1770's Britain. I don't give spoilers but an example is that he is lured up to Scotland with legends of a great beast that lives in a lake, but as he gets ready for the investigation, he discovers there's another reason the local Scots have gone to such extreme measures to get a famous doctor to the highlands.In another a man invites the doctor to examine his wife. the gentleman is sure his wife is going mad because at night she swears she sees people moving on the great fellside beside the house.  A brief examination convinces the Doctor that the lady is not only not mad but has very acute eyesight. so if she's not hallucinating then she really is seeing something and if so what? Faeries, demons, ghosts, or maybe something more mundane-smugglers or poachers. Still the good Doctor has to have a look.these are the themes followed wondrous possibilities with plausible resolutions. And just so much fun in the telling!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22G0FD1QRVFOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074343529X#wasThisHelpful","R22G0FD1QRVFOB","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bryant & May and the Burning Man is the latest police thriller from the pen of Christopher Fowler dealing with the slightly loopy members of the Peculiar Crime Unit.It’s fall and London is wracked by riots as people protest the inequality of the banks and lack of punishment for bankers who are financially irresponsible. The PCU members watxch with a sense of detachment until they are called in. A homeless man sleeping on the steps of a bank that was firebombed by the mobs needs to be identified and dealing with riots no other section has the manpower to spare but as things unfold they realize it was not a case of someone being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but someone targets for death, murder. When another man dies under equally weird circumstances it becomes clear someone is using the riots to cover their tracks as they commit murder, but who or even why, the victims seem unrelated, is the mystery.The real job of the PCU books is the way fowler and by extension his characters, look at the world. Although a serious mystery the detectives seem to have sprung from the same sensibilities as Douglas Adams. The book opens with a memo from the team leader to his crew informing them, among other things that builders have discovers a lock of support under the first floor interview room so please keep fat witnesses away from the middle of the floor. Detexctive May (good people skills) and (knowledgeable curmudgeon) Bryant drive their team leader to distraction with their ideas, theories and antics (“The last time I want on vacation you filled my office with Tibetan monks!) but they do get results.So if you’re looking for a good mystery with a slightly off kilter look at the world, then this is for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LMSRR131797B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345547683#wasThisHelpful","R3LMSRR131797B","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"it's hard to say what I don't like about this because there's so little I like. My dad had a watch like this in the 70's and thought it would make a nice change from my usual leather strap watches. The problem is this watch doesn't know it it's supposed to be for adults or children. It is really large, the face is really big and very simplistic. you only need a face this simple if it is a small watch but the freaking thing has a large face and you don't need the numbers to be THAT big unless you're still using Sesame Street as a learning tool.The strap is very large, VERY large, like I put it on and it was not just sliding down my arm but out over my hand. I'm no pip squeak but this just seems too much, a massive band and childish face. it's like something for a near sighted Lou Farigno.Add to this the box was not clean. The cardboard box the presentation box was in had popped it's seams and the presentation case with in it was badly stained. I don't think that can be blamed on amazon shipping because the presentation box was inside the shipping box and THAT was inside the amazon wrapping.

"The makers of blades have nearly put themselves out of business by driving up costs. Back in the late 80's I would use an electric shaver for my chin and upper lip and a blade for my neck and cheeks. A nice firm smooth shave. But as the price of razors went through the roof , I found myself more and more using just an electric razor for everything day to day.  I kept a real shaver with proper brush and all for special occasions but in general it was the electric shaver.Now this comes along. At less than $10 for 8 razors it is reasonably priced IF you can get 2-3 uses out of each shaver. At a single use it can be a little steep but if these last then you're looking at a reasonable price for the item, something badly missing of late, and might see a return to proper shaving.Yes this takes a little longer than the electric job but it does do a better job and if they've beaten the price issue, i'm sold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FKM6ZQ93GB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBUYGAI#wasThisHelpful","R14FKM6ZQ93GB1","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think the difference is that that way it is easier to share and even if eating solo it takes longer to each the nuggets one by one so you'll find it more satisfying as a snack.flavor is a personal matter. My wife and I enjoyed the chocolate snacks. The other ones seems a little...lacking with a flavor best described as the sort of thing use in libraries to meant the spines of old books. That having been said, a box of 21 snacks for nearly $40 +S&H? Get real!

"Sure this has a pretty face and it hopefully keeps good time but this has some serious problems. My wife looked at it said it was pretty, probably too stylish for casual wear and then it went south.My wife is petit but this watch isn’t. The picture makes it look small but in fact the face is about the size of a half dollar which means this is very large on a woman’s wrist. Considering a woman’s watch goes for ‘delicate’ then the woman wearing this would have to have a pretty hefty arm to make it look delicate.The second serious problem is the clasp. With any buckle in existence since the 17th century the tongue has moved independent from the frame. That’s how a buckle works. In this case the tongue is fixed, ridged as a spike sitting down from the frame. It doesn’t move and the space between the tongue and the other side of the frame is too small for the strap to get in. We couldn’t get it on her arm.We spent about 20 minutes trying to figure it out. Instructions included told how to set the time and changer the battery but not how to put it on a wrist. With this we’ll have to either see if a jeweler could explain it to us, or just buy a new strap.Sure this looks pretty but it’s pretty hefty in size and impossible to put on as it is.

Although a wizard Harry has more in common with Sam Spade or Spenser than he does Gandalf and Dumbledore mixing magic, wise cracks and pop culture references.These short stories are just as good for their writing quality.

"I really like Ace Atkins. he did what I thought was impossible, he picked up a beloved character from a dead author and breathed life back into him. All too often such attempts are travesties of the original but through several books Ace has captured the essence of Spenser and allowed Boston’s best PI to live on beyond his creator. The style still holds here, but the story is a clunker.Spenser is hired to investigate a town where a local judge is coming down harshly on juvee’s and as he investigates it seems there are kickbacks, pay off and a hopelessly corrupt town. People who’ve tried to look into this are silenced, but of course Spenser is far too tough to be intimidated by redtape or thugs.On his own or in familiar settings Spenser is fine but the town becomes unbelievable. Every time he’s facing down corrupt cops/judges/clerks etc it is just too much, the sense the town couldn’t possible exist without this level of corruption without someone noticing. Usually Spenser deals with a person or company under the general radar but here it is the entire town and the fact he doesn’t makes calls to big city reporters he knows or senior state police or FBI contacts for at least information while he could just rolls through town, it’s as if the town doesn’t really exist in the real world but through a mystical portal and it’s just too much. Every time he hit the corruption in the city, the plot just dragged. Add on a sub story about a boy going through the system, which I started skipping  way through, and it is possibly the worst Spenser story since “The professional.”I think he, Ace, was trying for dystopian but the corruption is so endemic that you can’t believe it hasn’t come to the attention of other sources before Spenser hits the town.  that the point, you can’t believe it. It is so dark and evil that it badly interferes with the suspension of disbelief.Ace does good Spenser. He has a wonderful feel for the character and the style but here the story itself becomes too impossible and too clogged. I look forward to Ace’ next attempt but this one? pass it by.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5LI3QGB5ZRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170847#wasThisHelpful","R2V5LI3QGB5ZRR","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is for the casual home owner taking care of little jobs around the garden and for that it works just fine.The problem is the wand. Mine has not started leaking but as several other testers have reported this problem it seems to be a serious problem of build consistency rather than a design flaw.

"Diane Davidson has been writing cozy mystery’s about a caterer for years. and now she has put together a cook book based on what her protagonist, Goldy, creates.The concept is pretty simple Caterers get invited to all sorts of places to provide food, like Victorian servants, if they do their job no one notices them but they see everything and when they keep getting involved in murders at events, well….Diane has done a good job making a cook book, not an anthem to her characters. With chapters arranged by the topic, not book, and the name of the book where the dish came from is supplied along with interesting commentary about the dishes’ inspiration and this is what really makes the book. any cook book will list ingredients and how to assemble them but a good cook book makes you want to do it, small little anecdotes about the meal makes it sound like something fun to try.The recipes themselves are not over the top. Each takes about a page total and while different do not seem to contain many hard to find ingredients, (I’m still looking for pickled walnuts for a Jennifer Patterson recipe from the 1990s!) so it’s not going to strain anyone with a decent pantry or local megamart to create these. A few pictures would have helped. Diane explains how these drive up the costs of cook books but still, she says presentation of food is important but the reader is left to wing it.I haven’t tried any of these yet but they look interesting and I’ll update this when I know how they work out. As an interesting aside I’m not sure I’d want the patronage of Diane or the business of Goldy. A great many of the restaurants Diane cites as sources she also says have closed and when Goldy goes somewhere, people actual die.

"This is very much like the Norelco shaver I’ve been using for years so I was excited to give this a try. 360 rotating head, good. Nice little stand to charge it in, good. Easy to clean head, good. Actual job shaving-not so good.This is a design I’m comfortable with in my hand and I like the little stand it comes with. The charger cord fits in the base and it’s just a little frame so it doesn’t take up too much space but it looks so much more tidy than the shaver just sitting on the side. The head pops open easily for cleaning which is good. And the shaving head pivots all over the place for access. I was really excited about this.And then I used it. The multiple rolling heads works really well on the difficult parts of your face, the chin, under the nose, those areas where the rolling heads do their bit. The problem, ironically was having done a good job on the tough stuff, it fell down badly on the easy stuff, the long lines of the neck and jaw line. The 360 head was working so hard to rotate it really wasn’t handling the long flat plains. I was very tempted to put the damn thing down and get out just a regular razor to cut those as it would be less awkward, faster and safer as I was growing frustrated with the shaver.In the end I found this very frustrating. Remington in the past has made very good typewriters and rifles but lately they seem caught up in producing shavers with gimmicks and with this, the gimmicks are getting in the way of a good shave.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TGG8EZOSLFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8FED5K#wasThisHelpful","R18TGG8EZOSLFG","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While many people read about the civil war for the battles or the legal changes wrought, or the changes to society (Sherman’s march or the siege of Petersburg by example causing a great deal of distress to local populations) another side of the war was race relations.  Not just the argument as to whether the war was about slavery itself but how blacks in federal uniform were treated when at the mercy of the Confederates.To address this Greg Urwin has amassed a collection of essays on the most infamous stories to try and get to the bottom of it. Even today 150+ years after the end of the war there are sides who argue did atrocities happen at all and this is reflected in the essays presented. The Federal investigation of Fort Pillow was led by a radical who painted as bleak a picture as possible and his poor research and political tact are held up by many southerners as proof the massacre never took place, but another writer  shows inconsistencies in the confederate reports prove there was violence, just not co-ordinated.Massacres of black soldiers at places like Poison spring, Marks Mills, Plymouth NC and “The Crater” are reviewed and repeatedly show that while there usually wasn’t a plan to murder blacks in uniform, there was also very little done to hold back individual soldiers from attacking blacks in uniform with people boasting to each other of the vast numbers they killed. While the boasts are clearly exaggerations they show that the men did not see such acts as murder or even wrong.One essay points a rather humorous picture of Prisoners taken at Ft Wagner, there were laws in place for the punishment of escaped slaves under arms but nothing about free born black men under arms. It became a political hot potato as the poor men languished in jail cells, no one wanting to take responsibility for either punishing them, which could lead to federal reprisals or even recognizing them as POW’s, but how do you hold them if they are not soldiers?In the end we are left with a view of the south horrified that ‘negroes’ were being used in war against them, and often incredulous that African-Americans were often competent, efficient, well-disciplined troops. and while politicians might splutter on about dire penalties to be visited on most generals did not have such orders, at the same time they did not do anything to restrain their men from exacting savage punishments on black troops. Nathan Bedford forest may not have ordered the massacre of black soldiers at fort Pillow, but he did damn little to stop it either and this is a pattern repeated time and again at other sites where confederates found themselves facing Federal troops who were men of color.Not all the essays are gems. One particular about the suffering of white officers who led black troops seems to break down to number crunching but overall these strive to present a very balance view of the evidence presented and the deeds done. The stories are well documented often citing witnesses of the events and current news paper accounts-allowing for the variance. although this came out in 2006, in the later haf of the 20-teens, as arguments are again raging over the confederate flag and is it a symbol of racism or ‘what my great great grand father fought for’ it is well to see that a great number of evil , racially motivated atrocities were committed under the ‘battle flag.’","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35JC3VNKGHVLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809326787#wasThisHelpful","R35JC3VNKGHVLF","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With so much middle Earth art work out there this is nicely different as a wall hanging.  While most maps are copies of Tolkien’s own maps of middle earth or the Lonely Mountain this is a floor plan of Bilbo Baggins’ beloved Bag End. with it you can easily see where the dwarves came in and sat, the long wood paneled halls and easily imagine Bilbo and later Frodo living as THE Mr. Baggins of Bag End.For a child who loved the films or book it will be something special to put on the wall. Magical but at the same time, Home.  Which is ultimately what the books are about. having a home.My one problem, that stops this from becoming a 5 star review is it is the Bag end of the Film, not the book.  Yes it includes all sorts of things not mentioned in the film like cold storage and such but it has only one guest room and only two other vaguely named spare/empty rooms.One of the first things in the book “The Hobbit” is a description of Bag End with several guest rooms, the hobbit was fond of guests, and whole rooms full of clothes. None of which is shown here.So wonderful but the discerning reader will notice it doesn’t quite match up to the books and that does weaken it, from a literary link, to a movie prop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YWBVOGQELEQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHQEYVM#wasThisHelpful","R2YWBVOGQELEQA","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I go camping a few times a year and the idea of something small and handy to light fires, meaning you can lighten your pack, seemed like a good idea.Ah, no. IF you’ve been chucked out of a helicopter in the Austrian Alps and it’s an emergency then this will serve but that’s about it.With a little work this does throw sparks but my striker was pretty dull, meaning I had to do work on it to make it functional. This is not listed a DIY.  The lanyard holding it together is sort of restricting since it limits how far apart you can move your hands and the amount of space of the striker it limited meaning this won’t last long.This comes with a little folded page of emergency survival skills like building a lean to and a snare for trapping, but no directions for the tool itself.  So you’re going to waste a little of the limited lifespan on this trying to work it out. Maybe that’s the Bear Grylls part of the item since this isn’t what HE uses. Just something he slapped his name on for a buck.In short IF you know what you’re doing this is ok for an emergency, but odds are if you know what you’re doing, you’ve got a better tool than this to start fires with.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RP36S5DKHBYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DT6TEK#wasThisHelpful","R3RP36S5DKHBYG","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Kingsman we meet Eggy, a London street punk whose late father had been a secret agent. When he gets into trouble in steps Colin Firth, a member of the same organization who owes his life to Eggy’s dad and Colin seeks to repay that debt by saving eggy from his life by giving him the chance to join the same spy network, to become a Kingsman, just as they are heading into their most difficult case ever. So as Firth tries to find out what Tech billionaire Samuel L Jackson is up to, eggy is put into the training program to compete against other applicants for the top spot.You can see it coming. Naturally the student must rise to the role but you don’t mind it’s well done. The problem is that Kingsman is never sure if it wants to be a serious action film or a parody. It does both but if you were to  look at it a James Bond on crack/Arnold in a pinstripe suit/Harry Potter with a machine gun, you wouldn’t be too far off the mark.I enjoyed it because I stopped trying to figure it out and just went along for the ride, though Jackson’s character always talking with a lisp became beyond annoying. he’s such a great actor with such a wonderful voice and he hamstrung himself with a lisp that seemed to leave him in danger of spraying spit all over the set.In the end you just have to surrender to the mania. It’s the sort of movie to watch with a bag of chips and friends who are going to cheer the good guys and mock the bad guys. It is a lot of fun. Will you have a life changing experience with memorable quotes? No. it’s not that kind of movie, then again…","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R389JZ02UV0D2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6OO6GM#wasThisHelpful","R389JZ02UV0D2A","A26TY6GCGBF5HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26TY6GCGBF5HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a universal story, thus its wide appeal to audiences and critics.  The mood is dark throughout the movie which increases the viewer's impatience/desire to understand the primary character's angst and disconnectedness with the world around him.  Multiple themes play into the progression of this cautionary tale which include: being labeled as worthless due to one's finances;  the barriers to those who are poor to succeed or break-free;  and the opportunist's who take advantage of those who have no voice to name a few.Hussein does have those who care about him but they have their own agendas as well and the more he sinks into despair the more he isolates.  When he decides that he will take a stand, he is humiliated and emasculated by the actions of others.  This drives a seemingly ordinary man to snap and do the unthinkable.It took me some time to really appreciate the insights this movie offers and it is well deserving of the acclaim it has been given.  The seemingly low budget feel is part of the movie's appeal and adds to its atmosphere. You won't be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PMXEMCTM5K6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000244FPA#wasThisHelpful","R2PMXEMCTM5K6O","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sharon K. Souza is an author worth watching.  Her book was among some suggested on this website and I couldn't stop until I finished.  The characters are authentic and sound like people you've known and their actions are logical though not predictable.  Ms. Souza captures emotional trauma's aftermath with such clarity and vividness, she should be given her day in the spotlight.The premise of the story is taken from today's headlines.  It hits deep inside each person's psyche as something beyond a few moments of contemplation as the dilemma of such an awful situation to bear and yet the primary characters must live through the moments that follow one breath at a time.  Will faith be enough to sustain them?  How do you hear from God when you are angry at Him?  How do you think when your guilt overwhelms you completely?  How do you love when you feel so unlovable?  These are the questions addressed by most world religions for many eras past and are well managed by a talented author, who guides you through these landmines.Take the journey this book offers, it will challenge you and help you refocus on life's most important messages.

I always keep one in my car so I can use my time effectively when I am stuck in traffic, it is a great way to get your focus off your frustration on to what really matters.I also try keep one handy to give away, if I meet someone needing encouragement.  Many homeless people don't have a Bible, so this is lightweight for them to carry and I keep them enclose it in an individually sealed ziploc bag, so if they get rained on the book doesn't get damaged.

"I thoroughly enjoy the layout of this book and the fact that it presents some of the Serrat's most known works (125 reproductions) and 48 of those are large sized and in full color!  Chances are if you like art enough to go to a museum on occasion and visit art shows/festivals, you are familiar with his work.His post- impressionistic style reminds me of  Manet and Monet but some of his pictures tend to be more bold and the colors more bright.  However, his work incorporates a variety of different scenes including crowds, seaside, water edges to nudes.  While you may not know them by name, this book includes: The Models, 1888, Barnes Foundation;  The Eiffel Tower 1889, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco;  Gray weather, Grande Jatte, 1888, Philadelphia Museum of Art; A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, 1884–85, Art Institute of Chicago (one of my favorites);  The Seine and la Grande Jatte - Springtime 1888, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium;  Fishing in The Seine, 1883, Musée d'art moderne de Troyes; and Bathers at Asnières, 1884, National Gallery, London.  While I did not name all of the pictures you can get an idea by using a search engine because the famous ones are all included.I am a big fan of Abrams Publishing's art books.  Their books at least in the 1980's were high quality (most of my art books are from that era and so I have more than one of them in my collection), the paper barely shows any signs of aging.  They have cloth hardcovers with lovely dust jackets that are very sturdy and they have traveled well among my moves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6IVR57PG0Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810904748#wasThisHelpful","RD6IVR57PG0Q0","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kathryn Ma delivers an insightful tale on the emotions stemming from being adopted.  While Chinese culture is a theme, since it is told from the viewpoint of a young Chinese girl adopted as a baby by a successful American born Chinese Woman, she still a struggles with the questions most adoptees have at some point addressed.  The voices in this story sounded very authentic to me.  While I was not adopted, I have had four very close friends, who were adopted and shared their anguish at still hearing a ""voice"" stating that they were ""abandoned"", ""given away"", or ""unwanted""  despite a loving adoptive family.  While some cope better than others, the unanswered question of ""why"" plagues their relationships and other life choices.  While this was compelling in itself, there are also several secrets that enhance the story and work against a healthy family dynamic.  This coupled with excellent characterizations make for dynamic and twisting plots and subplots.On the surface, the author gives us a fairly common family type.  A successful, never married woman, Charlie, who desires a family.  She raises Ari within a small matriarchal system consisting of a long widowed mother and unmarried sister.  Charlie resists her more successful sister, Leslie, who is more a competitor than sister and their disapproving mother.  While Ari is the primary character, she is unknowingly influenced by the secrets each woman is keeping.  The saying, 'you are only as sick as your secrets' is quite applicable.  As an adult, Ari seeks to find answers and when she discovers Charlie's secret, she attempts to unearth the past but story unravels in unexpected ways, pushing her to greater despair.  As others share their secrets with the reader, we wonder if they can ever find peace with their past and common ground and trust with each other.Ari's characterization was well written and spot on for her age.  Meanwhile, the other main characters were just as believable as well as their reasons for keeping their secrets.  I thoroughly recommend this to readers of family drama.  While it had a dash of immigrant tale, with a splash of war and a healthy dose of teenage angst searching for identity.  It offers the reader a a present day story formed by adaptation to a difference in culture.  However, most importantly it is a story of family torn by secrets and failures.Great accomplishment for a debut novel, Ms. Ma will become a household name recognized for her insight and talent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151PXK8LTHT97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062273353#wasThisHelpful","R151PXK8LTHT97","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long after I finished it, I have puzzled how to review these stories.  Nickolas Butler is an excellent storyteller.  His stories feature ordinary people facing life's limitations and in most stories they weigh in as the 99% up against the 1%.  We identify with their frustrations and applaud their actions (or some of them anyway)!  These stories unwind in such a manner that the reader has to read to the finish.Overall, I liked the stories, a couple in particular have continued to stir in my conscious mind though I've read at least 6 novels and a memoir since I finished this collection.  I don't generally read short stories, however, this collection was time well-spent.I will caution those contemplating the purchase, that some stories contain some brutal scenes and a few violent sexual encounters.  Additionally, some may find the presence of  graphic language and disturbing imagery as too dark, (however, this may not offend everyone but if you avoid this in your reading and viewing then you may want to pass); ironically, these are the same stories I tend to continue to ponder.  I would not recommend this for anyone under 17 except those emotionally mature for their age.  If his other collections are as graphic, then I may not read them.  I understand why he wrote certain stories in a gritty and brutal manner; I felt that the exacting detail given was unnecessary.  That said, I suspect I'm in the minority on this matter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EA250K0K985E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250039835#wasThisHelpful","R1EA250K0K985E","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""To err is human; to forgive, divine."" Alexander Pope in ""Essay on Criticism"".  This is the essence of the primary theme in Lori Nelson Spielman's book, ""Sweet Forgiveness"".  Spielman's writing is compelling with an intriguing storyline and fluid writing.  Her characters are drawn so that we are curious by to their lifestyle and we later see that even glamorous folks don't have an easy life and it isn't as glamorous as it would seem.I was uneasy about the resolution of the issue facing Hannah.  After I finished the book it took me several days ruminating over the plot and the reactions of the characters behaviors that seemed unrealistic to that which happens in real life.  How do I know this? I actually asked for forgiveness from people about 20 years ago and (continue to so quickly even today), for things not nearly as serious and most did not forgive.  I know others that have done similarly and my results aren't usual.  Of course, over time, some that are hurt do eventually forgive but this story's promise is ""they all lived happily ever after"".  A nice story for children and for a beach read, had the wounds in this story not been so injurious.Additionally, I was very frustrated and angry at how she handled the key issue facing Hannah, the protagonist.  She has been plagued by for many years.  I don't generally include spoiler's but I think the serious nature of the issue makes it warranted.  In a nutshell, while a young teenager, Hannah was awakened by an inappropriate touch.  The ensuing havoc devastates many lives.  When Hannah decides to confront the individual, just prior she concludes that maybe she misinterpreted what happened and she was wrong and at fault. HUH?  Yet, the statistics in the U.S. depending on the source says between 1 in 4 and 1 in 2, females are impacted by inappropriate sexual contact from touching all the way to rape before they reach 18 years old by someone they know!  The statistics for males are stated between 1 in 7 to 1 in 5.  This is an epidemic!  Talk to an addictions counselor and most of them will tell you nearly all of their clients experienced sex abuse as children.  Ms. Spielman has done a tremendous disservice to the anyone who has been harmed in such a manner.  It is quite common for those who were molested as children to dissociate or block these specific memories, to live in denial for years sometimes even decades because of this impact of betrayal, they emotionally can't handle the trauma and the lack of safety (and powerlessness) because they must remain living in the situation or lack protection/advocacy.  Nearly every sex abuser claims that their accuser is a liar.  Yes, a few will lie but that is the exception not the rule!  If you don't believe this, look at the most recent update on the Bill Cosby rape accusations, exceeding two dozen.I can recommend the writing and the concept of asking forgiveness is a worthy topic.  As a survivor, I Can Not recommend this story for its handling of a national tragedy that continues to be swept under the rug!  In fact, as I wrote this review I realize that I found this story offensive.If you happen to read Ladybug's review (which is great!), you will see that I left comments stating I intended to avoid this book.

I have been using a well-known and advertised storage system that allows you to fit a lot of items in and then vacuum out the air that remains.  They are a much more compact means of storage overall and so I do still prefer this other brand.

"Kimberly Belle, author of ""The Last Breath"" delivers a riveting story with dynamic characters and a twisting plot.  Her writing style is fluid and sprinkled at times with humor making it a delight to read.  This story captivated me as I kept turning pages instead of eating or sleeping.  This story is way more than a romance!  Belle's mystery writing is better than many I've read.The intriguing premise is who killed the beloved stepmother, Ella Mae?  Gia isn't satisfied with the answers she had been given and is determined that she will find the truth no matter what.  In the meantime, she tries to mend fences with her dying father after sixteen years of silence and he holds a grudge.  Can she reunite this broken family?  Will she find out the truth concerning Ella Mae's? This whodunit will keep you in its grasp until the very end.I could easily see this being made into a movie.  In a remote way the family dynamic, reminded me of ""A Thousand Acres"" although they are totally different stories lines and characters.  The sibling relationships as well as each individual fluctuated and evolved throughout the unraveling of the plot.  I highly recommend that you add this in your summer beach bag!Warning:A note to reader's - there are both sexually explicit and graphic rape scenes in the story; for those who find this frightening or prefer to avoid such scenes this isn't likely a story for you.  I considered these gratuitous in these details and had I known this prior to ordering, I would not have.  I consider this book Rated R, I think some readers would consider this porn.

"Reading Eli Gottleib's ""Best Boy: A Novel"" was a rare treat.  I started it with the intent of only reading enough until my very tired, body and mind relaxed enough to fall asleep, 4 hours later I completed it.  His rich characterizations are intriguing and the plot flows in unexpected ways, resulting in a novel that demands to be finished post haste.We join Todd Aaron, a fifty year old man, who is highly functional man with autism.  Shortly, after a brief history of his childhood, we learn he was placed in a ""home"" for the developmentally disabled after he follows instructions literally, resulting in unintended injury.  Now living at Payton LivingCenter, he is skilled at completing menial tasks, demonstrates a strong vocabulary and has a grasp on variety of intellectual subjects via his research on the internet and reading the encyclopedia; however, he continues to fail to understand the nuances of language.  This leads to a great number of misunderstanding with quite serious consequences.  His greatest challenge is he doesn't know how to explain his lack of understanding and others around him fail to take note; they assume that because he is intelligent that understands their unspoken intentions.  His frustration yields greater anxiety and the facility doctor's response is to keep him heavily sedated creating even further mental inadequacy due to these drugs.Gottlieb's skilled in his ability to put you into Todd's shoes, sharing his confusion and fear.  Establishing greater empathy and compassion for his struggles.  Todd is very sensitive to the intentions of others, particularly when they are operating on behalf of their own agenda although he is clueless of true agenda.  Challenging us to realize that while not everyone relates to the world in the same manner but that doesn't mean that they don't have aptitudes, talents and are still worthy of love and respect.  Another compelling aspect woven into the storyline is the family dynamic, a loving mother, an anger father and a jealous brother, has had a tremendous impact on his perceptions of his present environment.  This in turn demands that the reader consider how we treat others that aren't like us.This story is highly recommended, though it could have been depressing, Gottlieb's delivery made it an unexpected delight that was both intriguing and hopeful!  This is certainly a story, you don't want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YYO2DN2E13H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631490478#wasThisHelpful","R2YYO2DN2E13H6","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the publisher's summary, I was excited to begin reading this story.  While the storyline itself was technically well executed, I found myself getting a bit bored by the middle of the story.  Most of the characters were little more than one-dimensional with the exception of Mudas Summers, the protagonist.  I did enjoy the writing.  Ms. Richardson ability to use flashbacks and is adept at intertwining multiple plot lines is effective in fusing the story to a neat conclusion.I especially delighted in the opening sentence, ""When a lie seeps into the very heartwood of a town, soaks the beams and the posts that hold it up from the earth, the rot sets to its work.""  If the entire story had been so esthetically pleasing to read, it would have earned five stars from this reviewer.A primary part of the story is observing the transformation of Mudas from a teenager to an admirable, courageous adult in the span of a few weeks.  I wondered at the immense clarity with which she grasps the civil rights movement, that continues to grip the country in the summer of 1972 and seems to have had little impact in her small Southern town.  Her parents seem a bit disconnected with her daily life due to their own lifestyles and struggles, many are unknown to her (though these in fact propel the story).  For me, I felt her characterization to be a bit larger than life, however, I suspect other readers may view her differently.  For me only slightly detracted from this pleasurable read.If you enjoy coming of age stories mixed with suspense and mystery peppered into it, this is a worthy read.  The one sex scene was not graphic or overly descriptive.  It is recommended for those 12 and older.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22A9C6WD8TTLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161773733X#wasThisHelpful","R22A9C6WD8TTLR","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I consider this one of the better selections from Film Movement.I found it very insightful.  Set in Czechoslovakia during the 1930's, the Czechs felt safe from German's aggression because a treaty with the Soviet Union and their own preparedness.  Famous and beautiful Hana stars in all the best movies but when the Germans march, her career disappears because she is Jewish.  Meanwhile, Emil, her husband vows to protect her from harm and compromises his ethics as a news reporter to do so.  Surprisingly, this turns out to be the best thing to happen in his career.  Frustrated at her loss of career and then at her husband's sudden rise in popularity with other women and the Germans, she feels betrayed.  Misunderstandings happen on both sides and their confusion fuels fires that no one can handle.Though one reviewer states these characters as stupid, hindsight is 20/20.  Yes, they make bad decisions, but they did so because they believed that hope was just around the corner.  When circumstances change one doesn't always make the best decisions or realize the immensity or consequences of their choice.  When there are many conflicting voices, who do you chose to believe?I liked the unique format of the movie.  It provides great insight into how people are selective in what they believe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39WUHRERBCMYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005AY110O#wasThisHelpful","R39WUHRERBCMYH","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watch many documentaries a year.  I viewed this approximately a year ago and its impact was so profound, I still think on it.  At the time of its filming, it focused on President, Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives (which is composed of 100's of islands, many inhabited) efforts to reduce carbon emissions in large industrial nations because of its impact on climate which he believes is severely detrimental to his country.  These gorgeous islands are a popular tourist attraction among the rich and famous and particularly the Hollywood crowd.  Set in the Indian Ocean, they offer incredible beauty, friendly peoples and amazing resorts but unfortunately, some of the islands have already been abandoned by the people because their land has sunk and more islands are sinking quickly.Convinced that carbon emissions which causes global warming is the reason behind their disappearance, the former President went to the big carbon producing nations asking them to lower their emissions by changing how they operate the biggest offenders.  We watch as he is met with limited concern and lip service.  Eventually, he visits the United Nations and speaks to the entire body, and again meets with ambivalence and at times great indifference among his peers.One can only feel powerless, as he doggedly pursues his task to protect his beloved country, it will remind you of the Greek myth of Sisyphus.In the end, we are told a new President was elected and the viewer wonders why Mohamed Nasheed was not reelected.  I took a point off because this documentary stands on emotion but leaves some questions unanswered (I can't recall at this point).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITEASC3JCHU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PY7TGQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ITEASC3JCHU5","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jennifer Steil has excellent writing skills as one would expect from a journalist.  She weaves many characters into the plot each with their own agenda's in the midst of a very volatile political environment.  It would seem that book is at least in some part based on the country of Yemen based on geography, political instability and her husband's prior posting as an Ambassador.  She manages to effectively use alternating person's narrate their perspectives and incorporates flashbacks to effectively development the storyline.  That said, there were drawbacks to the book as well.My biggest challenge was not relating or connecting to the primary characters.  Miranda is almost bigger than life in her mid-thirties, she would be considered by some a world traveler supporting herself teaching painting to others.  Her dance card of female lover's is nearly mind-boggling.  She is dynamic and the picture of selflessness.  Her political and social values and her dedication to them, particularly advocacy of women's rights is admirable.  She is a free spirit, who suddenly falls in love with a man, an ambassador no less under the most unlikely of circumstances.  She chooses to sacrifice much of what defines her to be a model of diplomacy as his wife.  This near 180, seemed implausible (yes, it could happen).  Her husband, Finn is also an exceptional accepting person, he is the epitome of the ideal ambassador.  Neither seemed to have any character flaws.  If you could call it a flaw, the Miranda is outspoken against injustice.  While I had trouble connecting to them because they were so perfect, I do believe a lot of reader's would enjoy these characters as they are.I also had some issues with the plot, however I will avoid ruining the story.  I found the reason for her kidnapping unrealistic.  I will agree with another reviewer that said she had some unanswered questions pertaining to technical matters involved in her kidnapping.  The author had several good options that she set up to explain the reason Miranda is kidnapped then reveals something unlikely.  Furthermore, Miranda's recovery is minimized.  As a severe trauma survivor and someone who knows quite a few others, I didn't find her recovery at all credible.  Again, many reader's might not be bothered or realize the lack of realism presented.This is Ms. Steil's first novel and as a debut it certainly has strong points, as mentioned earlier.  While there is a few intense violent scenes, they were minimally graphic.  Discussions of abuse suffered in this part of the world were realistic and disturbing but again the brutality wasn't over dramatized.  I would caution readers, who prefer to avoid reading books that are criticize or cynical of Christianity, some might find certain references quite offensive.  Likewise, there are a numerous mentions of female homosexuality acts; while not graphic they are an integral part of this storyline.In conclusion, Ms. Steil is a reasonably talented writer.  I enjoyed the insight she delivers on the life of diplomacy.  She demonstrates an ability to capture certain scenes and emotions quite effectively however, I didn't find this consistently throughout the story.  Her future works may overcome these gaps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT5BR0BFE00EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539029#wasThisHelpful","RT5BR0BFE00EH","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My two recently deceased, elderly Yorkies were quite picky, however this was one of three dog foods they would eat for most of their life (we didn't know about until 5 or 6 years ago).  My rescue dog that I have had for a month chose this over 7 different options given to him.  In the month that he has been here, he gained some weight initially (getting a little chubby, perhaps fear that he always get more?).  Feeling more at ease, he eats a consistent amount and has stabilized at the right weight for his size.  Though, he was abandoned, he found safety at a Humane Society (what a great group!).  They fed him Science Diet (he showed total disdain for it, when he realized we had better food).  In a month, the new growth of his fur is decidedly more soft.  When he first moved in, I wondered why it seemed so much courser than my other Yorkies.  I washed him once with no conditioner shortly after his arrival.  It wasn't until I contemplated his entire lifestyle that I realized it may be in part Fromm Gold!  He occasionally gets small bites of green pepper, carrots, apple and banana and daily Brewer's Yeast with Garlic and Vitamins (this too could be a contributing factor).One of the other great benefits is that the stool is firm (some Yorkies have sensitive tummies), thus I appreciate that Fromm provides readily digestible kibble due to quality ingredients.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone seeking top of the line nutrition for Man's Best Friend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QCY7AJKY8CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LURXOK#wasThisHelpful","R38QCY7AJKY8CJ","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Viet Thanh Nguyen has delivered an opus on the torn loyalties of sub-group within a generation of Vietnamese torn between two vastly worlds.  Having been exploited by other nations over several centuries and most recently, the French occupation of the past 100 years, many of Vietnamese people are weary of Western ways particularly the promises made, as well as, the lack of respect and appreciation for their culture.  Our narrator, a Captain in the Police Special Branch (similar to the CIA in U.S.) is an assistant to a General assigned to Saigon, however, his loyalty is to Communism.  In secret he aids those seeking to subvert those fighting the Communist take over (the U.S. military primarily).  It is through his eyes, the reader learns that no political system or philosophy is without its flaws and more importantly no system is completely equitable.  The value of human life becomes nearly meaningless then the agenda is in jeopardy.  As part of his cover, he is sent to the West to keep tabs on those planning to return to Vietnam in hopes of staging a coup and overthrowing the communist reign.  It is while he lives in the U.S. this second time (he had come temporarily as a college student several years prior to the conclusion of the war)  that he truly develops an affinity to the Western way of life and his Communistic loyalties are challenged and tested in the most heinous of ways.The book begins with the terror during the fall of Saigon in 1975, as we are riveted to our seats hoping that the despair and confusion don't take more lives, we experience a roller-coaster of emotion.  Initially, this portion is gripping and rated a 5 star for its account.  Thereafter, the key characters are followed as they seek to establish a new life in the U.S.  Few experience any opportunities beyond basic subsistence, their skills neither needed or desired in their new land.  The Captain is quite adaptable and begins to assimilate with minimal effort into American culture, while few of his compatriots are barely able function due to the trauma and ensuing depression they suffer.  It is at this stage of the novel where we get a very deep look into the Captain's psychological make-up, its inconsistencies: his development and poor treatment suffered at the hands of others for being a biracial and illegitimate; torn loyalties; motivations; and aspirations.  Just as we begin to think that the lure of the West has begun to take root, he returns to a very different Vietnam than he anticipated.  His ensuing experiences challenge his loyalty to extreme.One ponders throughout his account, who he would be had things been different for him as a child in that era?  Would he have been someone else completely?  In many ways this is a universal exploration of how early experiences mold us and our views not just politically but spiritually, philosophically and morally.  The use of the Vietnam conflict is an excellent platform from which to conduct such an analysis.I deducted one star because the last portion of the book became laborious to read.  It was both an anticlimax and to drawn out.  While I believe that the author did this to make his point more emphatic, the reader becomes somewhat frustrated for the delayed conclusion of the story.  The Captain's character was well developed and realistic.  He is neither all good or all evil.  However, I agree with some of the comments I've read, that the author seeks to impress readers with his: knowledge; command of language; and writing talent.  Yet, as a whole, it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the plot.  If you are looking for a condensed history of end of the Vietnam War, this is a starting point.  I had wished there was more history incorporated but what was included was delivered adeptly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAQD4BA71N9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123457#wasThisHelpful","R1FAQD4BA71N9D","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you who notice that they have a white coating on their tongue, bad breath or little white or red bumps that are sore on their tongue, these are often signs of an overgrowth of candida in the body.Candidais a type of yeast/fungus that exists in the body's blood stream.  Dictionary dot com, states ""any of the yeastlike fungi constituting the genus Candida, members of which may cause athlete's foot, vaginitis, thrush, or other infections. Any of the yeastlike deuteromycete fungi of the genus Candida that are normally present on the skin and in the mucous membranes of the mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina. Certain species may become pathogenic, especially C. albicans, which causes thrush and other infections.""  It is commonly termed Candida.Experts say that everyone has it, the concern is when it is beyond what is normal (check out one of the best books on the topic, ""The Yeast Connection"" by William Crook), which is when it becomes evident a host of different ways including the white stuff on the tongue, women frequently go to the gynecologist when it is severe in other places (and yes, men can have it too, they usually don't have symptoms).Probiotics in general will are a great means to address this because they encourage the growth of healthy bacteria that neutralizes the candida.  TheraBreathe is specifically designed to address candida that manifest in the mouth, which is serious issue since poor dental health can lead to other serious health problems.What causes the imbalance of candida?  Many things, some of the more serious factors are ingesting to much sugar, caffeine, processed foods with sugar or sugar substitutes like corn syrup, dextrose, rice syrup, maple syrup, oils that are reused such as those used for deep frying, potatoes,  products made with white (wheat flour), even to much fruit especially those with high sugar content such as grapes, watermelon, etc.  It is a given that if you eliminate or at least reduce the amount consumed of the above mentioned items, your Candida will be more quickly controlled.While I am a firm believer in probiotics, I have reservations about this TheraBreath product for several reasons.  First off, there is dextrose (a type of sugar).  It also includes sucralose (which is another name for Splenda), according to Prevention magazine, Dr. Mercola and other sources, Splenda is unsafe and can cause a host of health issues including:  Skin Rashes  Flushing  Episodes of Anxiety and Panic  Dizziness and Numbness  Diarrhea  Swelling  Muscle aches  Headaches  Cramping  Bladder issues  Stomach painGranted, you aren't consuming that much but why not just take a probiotic without sucralose and skip the side effects?Another drawback are other chemicals inside each lozenge include: Isomalt, Magnesium Stearate, Natural Flavors (which could be a host of really unappealing things, did you know that beaver anal secretions are often referred to as ""Vanilla Flavor"" or that red food products are made from beatle shells?  I typically avoid any product that has ""natural flavors"" as a catch all phrase, natural is a blanket marketing term used to 'conjure' a pristine farm with only organic substances being used, when it can mean the polar opposite.  Similar to the term ""creamery"" used to describe butter, real butter is made from cream, so it is redundant.  Another marketing tactic is using the term ""Spring Water"", the ""spring"" may not be flowing from a mountain stream but it meets minimal standards to be drunk, in fact, in Florida, it may actually be right from the tap!On the front of the package it states ""8 Sugar Free, All Natural Citrus Flavored Lozenges"", but as I've shown this is all quite vague, we really don't know what is in them.  Isomalt is used as a sugar substitute, derived from the sugar beet and has low calorie impact, however, it is partly absorbed by the body.  It can cause a side effect of stomach cramps (which I get) and a laxative.  According to Dr. Mercola, magnesium stearate is used in keeping machinery used in the manufacturing process from getting clogged.  It has been found at times to have toxic chemicals in it.  Furthermore, the June 12, 2012 article states that  "" Magnesium stearate is not a source of magnesium and has no benefits, but may have a detrimental effect on your immune function as stearic acid has been linked to suppression of T cells. The filler also stimulates your gut to form a biofilm, which can prevent proper absorption of nutrients in your digestive tract"".  The article further states other hazards including: ""Another issue that has been raised in relation to magnesium stearate is the fact that the stearate is commonly sourced from hydrogenated oils such as cottonseed oil. This crop is oftentimes genetically engineered, but even when it's not, cottonseed oil tends to have very high levels of pesticide residues.""  Thus, it may be counter productive to a healthy digestive system.  This is quite ironic since the use of probiotics enable the body to absorb healthy nutrients and improve digestive tract functionality (such as regulate or increase frequency of bowel movements preventing constipation while also preventing diarrhea), thus, it creates greater balance in elimination.In summary, while this product reduces candida in the mouth which is a good thing, unfortunately, there are many questionable ingredients that may create other health issues.  This alone is reason enough to seek another Probotic source, which doesn't incorporate sweetners or other unnecessary extras.  There are many excellent choices out there that offer a wide variety of different strains of probiotics (which can conquer candida quicker) and much more economically.  I think the price of $12.99 for 8 Lozenges, the current price on Amazon as of this writing on May 11, 2015 is absurd for the quantity of product.  Any decent probiotic will improve your oral health.Frankly, if I am feeling poorly, I increase my intake of probiotics because Candida often flourishes when the immune system is working against bacterial, fungal or viral infections.  I always double my regular dose when taking an antibotic as well.  Medication I use is sometimes constipating, so if that is an issue, I take more probiotics.  Try different options and see what your body responds to best.  I won't buy anything with less than a billion colonies per capsule.I am not a medical doctor, this is not to be considered as medical advice.  The information provided is research that I have located and applied to my own body.  Each person is unique and may have different results than I have experienced.

It is 2"" in diameter or 5.1 cm. just a tad to big for him to grip in his large mouth.CHUCKIT CHUCKIT lives up to its claim of a high bounce.  While it does squeak, it requires more pressure than many squeak toys, this level of force may be beyond some arthritic or elderly persons ability to produce.  Furthermore, when force is applied the air hole must be completely open or it won't make noise.I think this would be more appropriate for dogs weighing between 12-25 pounds with wide mouths would be able to get it to squeak.

"Paula McLain has written another smash hit!  ""Circling the Sun"" is an exquisite foray into historical fiction, engrossing the reader from the first sentence.  Between the covers is the life story of Beryl Markham, a woman of remarkable and numerous accomplishments in the early 20th Century, which include being a female landowner (rare) and horse trainer of champion racers in Kenya (also unique), and author.  She later becomes the first woman to fly cross the Atlantic from east to west, (Great Britain to N. America).  This is certain to be a book that makes the New York Times Bestseller List for 2015 and undoubtedly, a feature movie in the future.Initially, the story starts at Beryl's abandonment by her mother and elder brother to return their native England, leaving Beryl in the hands of her father, who starting with little manages to gain notoriety within white society of Kenya.  Beryl learns from a tender age, the theory and practical aspects of breeding and training racehorses and goes on to become famous in her own right.  The story of how she starts with little to achieve great respect and admiration is a very involved tale.  Soon she becomes friends with Karen Blixsen, a coffee plantation owner nearby and eventually Karen's lover, Denys Finch Hatton.  Their complicated triangle of friendship and love has far reaching implications, particularly for Beryl.  I promise I have not spoiled the story, that is why it is essential that you read it!McLain provides a thoroughly insightful look into the colony life and its struggles and secrets which are many.  She writes a smooth story in linear fashion that is strong and powerfully gripping.  If you like horses, this will be a close second to ""Secretariat"" as a  favorite.  Even if horses aren't particularly your bag, this story has such intriguing characters that your fascination with their behaviors will rush you to the finish line.  All though their are many characters within the story, the primary characters are all richly developed; additionally, McLain manages to make them so dynamic that you won't become confused.This book is a keeper, not only do I recommend that you read it, it is something you will want to buy so that you will have it to read again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUH4WBVYOS9UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534182#wasThisHelpful","RUH4WBVYOS9UT","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It might be YOU!I chose to read ""Conversations with Saint Bernard"" because I love dogs and just lost a very special dog very recently.  I was concerned that it might make me sad or I would find it to foolish.  It did neither, instead, I found it very accessible and uplifting.  Author, Jim Kraus writes a very engaging story of a lonely, elderly man needing deep emotional healing and restoration.  Through God's mysterious ways, he develops a different perspective on his life and his value to God as he interacts with Lewis, a Saint Bernard.Kraus writes a solid story with well developed characters and an interesting plot.  I was impressed with his ability to create suspense in a number of ways within this novel making it quite dynamic and fast paced.  I thoroughly enjoyed the characterization of the dog; Lewis' ability to draw others to him and address their hidden pain from the past is both intriguing and inspiring.  I enjoyed these interactions as a metaphor to the healing power of the Holy Spirit.  Likewise, we see people sharing their victories and failures with others as a demonstration of sharing one another's burdens as stated in Galatians 6:1,2 ""Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."" KJV  This is the essence of the novel.This book is a keeper.  I will reread this. I have already promised to share it with another, who needs encouragement.

"Martin Clark delivers a thorough legal thriller that doesn't get overly focused on the details of a typical lawsuit (I recently got scammed by an auto insurance co. after 5 year battle, which included severe, permanent injuries sustained in an auto accident).  This story is a realistic presentation of the people involved displaying flexible morality to score a win.  I have been stunned by the commonness that exists among lawyers and corporate big wigs, it would seem no one is above lying, falsifying evidence or manipulating facts.  Clark has obviously seen this consistent character trait in his courtroom.  The story flows somewhat rapidly and there is a lot of activity as we observe the situation through Lisa Stone's eyes, wife and partner with Joe Stone, at Stone and Stone, a small town law firm that gets caught in the middle of a firestorm over a patent issue.The story works because everyone lies.  Joe Stone is an easy going guy, well liked, considered as the ethical cornerstone of law in his region.  He displays immense patience with town lunatic, Lettie VanSandt, who files frivolous lawsuits like some people go grocery shopping.  When Lettie hits the big time, it is to late for her to receive her payday because she has died during a house fire.  This is when things go topsy-turvy for the Stones and their practice.  Add to this serious indiscretion by Lisa, her action may inadvertently cause their case to be lost, and in turn cause their whole world to be destroyed.  Additionally, when push comes to shove even Joe uses semantics to fudge the truth when talking to the big corporation.At one point, I wanted to give this a five for originality and the realism incorporated into the story.  However, Lisa's character is not the most likeable person.  She runs the gamut of emotions about her bad choice and at times is almost flippant about it's impact.  Her actions include getting her best friend to commit perjury on her behalf is extreme.  However, it is a side of human nature that many people in American society would probably chose.  What bothered me is that she has no consequences after the fact.  Similarly, Joe rationalizes his decision to fib because he rarely charged Lettie in her legal cases (most attorney's would rather have dental work than assist for free).  Additionally, everything got wrapped up in a tidy bow at the end, thus making a fairly realistic story end on an improbable note.This would make a good vacation read.  The story takes you by the hand and leads you through tedious lifestyles in a small town to encounters with a huge drug corporation, its bigger than life CEO (think Branson or Madoff) and its panoply of players with increasing intensity as the story unfolds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LRCVYDWXZ8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353596#wasThisHelpful","R4LRCVYDWXZ8X","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rahimeh Andalibian is a successful woman.  A practicing doctor of psychology and investor/businesswoman, who shares with readers the silent suffering that her family of origin had shrouded their most painful experiences.  When tragedy hits their family only days after the Iran Revolution began with the fall of the Shah in 1979,  major depression sweeps several family members as together they face tremendous terror, which grips each one.  Several go into denial of the facts thinking is best for the youngsters, but this choice is so blinding that impact leads each family member to disconnect from one another to seek a workable path as they struggle for survival.  The strong bonds of love is so damaged that it will be many years and many wrong choices before they slowly reconnect and rebuild; much credit goes to Rahimeh's deep devotion to them serving as the impetus to guide them to a path of true healing and recovery.It took several days of contemplation for me just to summarize only the highlights without exposing the details best told by author.  Although there are a few places in the story where the reader wonders if an event isn't out of sequential order; however, this is a minor defect that does not impact the deeper truths the author conveys.  Rahimeh does an excellent job creating vivid scenes, so that you too can smell the flowers as she walks past the garden and appreciate the grandeur of the Rose Hotel that her father built from the ground up as a very young man with only a dream and no funds of his own, to a elegant hotel visited by tourists to Mecca the world over.  They were admired in their community and quite wealthy.Ironically, her father tries to do a good deed from which springs a misunderstanding that gets lost among the revolution's chaos.  Ultimately, this misunderstanding spins out of control, the result being the family experiences several dire consequences leaving them emotionally wounded, penniless and fleeing their homeland.  They end up living in to a one room apartment in Great Britain and eventually relocate to Southern California to rebuild their lives and finances.  As the children attempt to assimilate into a culture wildly different than their homeland, things turn sour once again.  As Rahimeh struggles to find her own identity and heal her own pain, she realizes this will only happen if each individual family members address their pain and accepts the life paths that others have taken.Rahimeh has done an exceptional job introducing each family member honestly with their strengths and weaknesses (respectfully).  Her courage is admirable, yet she never boasts of her role in the healing that evolves.  The love this family exhibits is tangible.  The story has so many tragedies, it could be a Greek play.  There are frequent mentions of the beliefs and practices of Islam, which are integral to understanding the reasons out of which many of the situations arose.  It is shared in such a way that no one regardless of their faith or spiritual practices would find it as a tool for conversion or insulting to another faith.I recommend this story as an example of the resilience and strength this family found through their persecutions and losses.  There is not a wasted word.  As I read, my interest never flagged.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MJ6V9WFPMKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214790#wasThisHelpful","R11MJ6V9WFPMKY","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have been a Greenies family for quite a few years.  It has been enjoyed by my Two Yorkies as a reward and me for improved dental hygiene and breath.  Since my receipt of this box, we have lost a beloved friend, Liza and added a new friend, a rescue pup, who is in large part Schnauzer.Both dogs enjoy this new version a great deal, they run to separate places to savor this special treat.My one concern is that despite it is grain free it has a modest level of protein (not recommended for dogs that have renal/kidney disease) at 23%.  For older dogs, kidney disease is a silent killer until it reaches advance stages, so please perform blood tests your dog and cats regularly when they become older.Since, I see no ingredient picture posted presently by the company nor reviewers, I will include the ingredients in order as they are listed.  They are: Dried chickpeas, gelatin (source unnamed), glycerin, powdered cellulose, dried potato, water, lecithin, potato protein, natural poultry flavor, minerals (dicalcium chelate, zinc amino acid, iron amino acid chelate, copper amino acid chelate, manganese chelate, potassium iodide ), choline chloride, dried apple pomace, fruit juice color, vitamins (di-alpha tocopherol acetate -source of vitamin E), vitamin B12 supplement, d-calcium pantothentate (vitamin B5), niacin supplement, vitamin A supplement, riboflavin supplement (vitamin B2), vitamin D3 supplement, biotin, pyridoxine hydrochoride (vitamB6, thiamin mononitrate (B1), folic acid, turmeric color.I am not a nutritionist but I have read labels for years and it appears to me these are fairly healthy ingredients (although I don't know what ""natural poultry flavor"" could possibly be and I wonder why they were intentionally non-specific).  Likewise, I have a big question over the source of gelatin which typically comes from bones of cows, with so many drugs and hormones injected into most of the beef in the U.S. (do you know our beef is banned throughout Europe because of the risk factors?) and a statistically significant number of cows are not even meeting the human health standards here in the U.S. are instead being used for cat and dog food, this does raise a red flag for me.  This is the primary reason I feed my dogs only organic dog foods and I only eat hormone free, grass fed beef.Now that I have reviewed these ingredients carefully,i will be more cautious and may stop feeding my pets these treats (although they enjoy them) because the packagings vague disclosure of ingredients, particularly since the gelatin is the second ingredient.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12AB66IMT9Q8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7R7FDW#wasThisHelpful","R12AB66IMT9Q8W","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many adjectives words to describe ""The Underwriting"", a few must include: dynamic, suspenseful, engaging, driven and conniving.  Author, Michelle Miller has unveiled another aspect of the financial world, the creation and release of an IPO.  It is impressively told as compared to  the movie ""Wall Street"" portrayed insider trading.  The writing was so taut and realistic in it's presentation, that it is hard to believe this young artist has written such impeccable story worthy of national and international attention.The characters are plenty flawed, most are driven by either money or power and usually both.  Miraculously, the primary characters are so well written that one can't help at least slightly identifying or feeling a tad sorry for them, because each are blinded by their own ambition, the fear of failure and the lure of success.  As new critical characters enter the mix, they derail even the best laid plans.  Each character is necessary and has an intricately important role to play moving the plot further into chaos.  The gamesmanship is incredibly intriguing and leaves one wondering what could possibly go wrong next?  The ending was satisfying with a few characters seeing life with a different perspective.I highly recommend this book, it is probably one of the best suspense novels, I have read this past year maybe longer.  Yes, I am that impressed.  You will need to set time aside it is so engrossing, be prepared to loose track of time. I read it in 9 hours forgetting to eat, I was so captivated by this complex drama.  That this is a debut novel by the author is almost shocking because the story exceeds the quality of drama, complexity and characterizations published by many popular authors today.  Narrated by multiple persons, there was no confusion for the reader nor interruption to the flow of the story. There are no flaws, in fact, Miller does an exceptional job explaining the key aspects of an IPO in easy to understand terms, so don't let the topic frighten you away from enjoying this engrossing novel, that I believe will be a motion picture.

"Colleen Oakley’s “Before I Go” captured my immediate interest and it never flagged as I rapidly read the pages to discover how Daisy’s deals with her impending death and her desire to protect her husband in the present and future.  Her reactions and plans are fraught with unexpected difficulties resulting in multiple miscommunications and misunderstandings.  The plot is well structured and delivers increasing anticipation for the reader.I liked the main characters, Daisy has nearly her completed her Masters in Psychology, who has “Lots of Cancer” and is always 5 steps ahead in her perception of everyone’s emotional state.  Quite simply she has control issues from which she is totally blind.  Jack is Daisy’s absent-minded husband, who adores her far beyond than anyone realizes.  Kayleigh (who is also 27, like Daisy) is her best friend since Elementary school, her life is directionless and her main entertainment is having flings with younger men, some who are recent high school graduates.  Her strengths are her loyalty, honesty and directness.  Although her role is small, it is important.  Each character is someone that is relatable; a person, you would want in your circle.  For some reason, I thought of Debra Winger's character in ""Terms of Endearment"" when reading certain passages.Though the topic is sad and the reader follows Daisy goes through the various stages of grieving; there is a sprinkling of humor at just the right times throughout the story to lower the tension and makes the reader connect to her even more.  One example is that she deals with her distress medical encounter by stating ‘If there was a Zagat’s guide for doctors, he would have no stars’.  Oakley’s has a gift in using humor to convey a perception of reality.My one issue is that there were frequent mentions of the sexual act (between Daisy and Jack, though they were not particularly graphic) which made this story more believable because our health does impact all facets of life.  However, I do object to Kayleigh’s behaviors because they are more descriptive and detailed which are borderline pornographic, though I suspect it won’t offend most people (most television is much more flagrant).I would recommend this story to anyone who likes realistic fiction.  My former Pastor’s wife set him up with his second wife, when she was dying.  Additionally, I lost three young friends (30 -52) in the mid 2000’s to cancer and I knew that each one was very concerned about how her husband would cope in the future without her.  This is a quick read that will be remembered long after you finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HG226IBJJWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476761663#wasThisHelpful","R31HG226IBJJWK","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laura Dave delivers an intriguing look at all facets of love.  Georgia Ford, the protagonist seeks refuge and direction from her family 5 days before her wedding day when fate reveals a colossal secret her fiancé has failed to share with her.  Upon her arrival home, she finds her world turned upside down with her parents and a brother’s marriage struggling through their own collision courses.  This further causes her to question marriage, love and trust.  In her angst, she tries to break the sale of the family vineyard believing that will solve some of the problems but things don’t always end up the way we expect.As each day passes, she learns more about love beyond the goose bumps stage.  As Dave guides through us through family turmoil, we survey constitutes real commitment to vows, honoring one another, real maturity, what is acceptable and when to forgive and when to let go.I seldom read Chick Lit but “Eight Hundred Grapes” provided some really powerful messages and offered insights that enhanced my appreciation for this genre.  As a bonus, the author spins a tale that is vivid and a plot with twists.  It ends with a possibility for a sequel, though it is a stand alone tale.Though it was a bit of a fairy tale, I was engaged with the characters frailties.  Regardless of the fact that these people were successful profession people with a very comfortable income and reputation, the reality is money doesn’t buy happiness.  One of the most valuable treasures in life is devotion to your partner by loving them enough to see the real individual and understanding their motivations.  This is a life truism.

"It is bright and charming necklace.  Arrayed in Amethyst, Blue Topaz, Peridot, Garnet and the Yellow Stone might either be Yellow Topaz, Yellow Spinel, or Citrine.  The two ribbon strips along the center Amethyst are tiny little diamonds, they can only be observed within a 6 inch or closer look.  The stones are pretty and would brighten outfits that may have a matching shade to one of the colored stones.As you view the picture, it is exactly as presented.  That said, the chain is very light weight and links are extremely small.  The Lobster Claw clasp is very small and nearly impossible to hold open with modest length nails, when I finally got it to open (8th or 9th time), I could not get the amazingly small loop close to the clasp.  In fact, I never managed to get it to hook onto the clasp!  Even before attempting to put on the necklace, I thought I will have to wear pendant on a more larger more suitable chain, it doesn't look balanced compared to the chain in length or link.The bale on the pendant isn't very large, smaller than the center Amethyst.  You may need to take pendant along on a shopping trip to find an appropriate chain, however, I don't know a lot of stores that sell gold plated silver chains (perhaps online).  Gold is a better color choice for the chain, so find if you keep this chain someone to open and remove your necklace when you where it or wear it daily.I'm disappointed that the chain isn't more substantial, this is the second pendant/chain set I've gotten from the ""Amazon Collection"" and the other pendant was similar in size and the chain is the exact size, so the same disparities with the chain was an issue.  All in all, I like the pendant and will wear it possibly on a silver chain since I was robbed over all my gold chains and most of my silver.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTX8BSSFBMPCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLMNQCC#wasThisHelpful","RTX8BSSFBMPCB","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BIC Flex 5 Disposable delivers a smooth shave with no nicks, stubble or stray uncut hair.  As a woman, I think some of us have hairy regions that are probably as challenging as many men's beards.  I really like this razor and I had previously been using a BIC Flex 3 which I reviewed quite some time ago.  I find if you keep the hair from getting stuck between the blades, the razors will last for months.Here is how I do that.  I run the wet razor in reverse on wet hand, at least half of the clogs are cleared.  Then, once dry I tap each of the sides of the razor against the sink basin multiple times removing more than half the remainder of hair, then I take tweezers and run it along the blades and crevices furthest from the handle then repeatedly tap again on the basin.  At this point, it is almost completely clean.I will be buying these again.

"Christie Watson has delivered an emotional powerhouse about love, acceptance and misunderstanding in her story, ""Where Women are Kings.""  Watson effectively and efficiently tells a story about bonds of love that can't be broken despite the pain that intrusive behavior renders.  Though his birth mother, Deborah abused Elijah, it was not with the intent to harm him but to free him from the bondage of a wizard, she believes possesses him.  We soon realize that between her schizophrenia and the influence of greedy preacher that she saw no other choice but to try and remove the wizard herself through horrific means.  Elijah is prisoner to this belief as well and the fear of the wizard ultimately leads to traumatic results for him and others.This taut, fast paced story was so compelling that I completed it within 24 hours.  When the first bombshell is dropped, my shock was so great that I gasped aloud, ""NO!""  and when the second bombshell occurred I was shocked, stunned and tearful.  Reading this tale is akin to listening to a dear friend sharing their own painful experience.  One can only feel this intensity when the presentation of each character is so well developed.  Leaving you to quickly empathize with each person's feelings and frustrations.  Particularly, when each one has compelling compassion for the downtrodden (Obi is a lawyer for immigrants soon to be deported and Nikki works at a dog rescue), their great love for each other and Elijah face numerous tests.  Unfortunately like all humans, they doesn't always express their love or at times, when they do, it isn't perceived as such by the other party in the manner intended.  This is so frustratingly painful because we feel the pain of the characters as they sometimes fail to connect.I didn't view this book as a treatise on race, it was far more a story of the varying beliefs of different cultures (Nigerian vs. British), mental illness, and adoption.  It provided a realistic look at the challenge of adopting an older child (Elijah is 7), that has an unknown history that hasn't been relayed to the adoptive parents.  It is also an insightful view of the challenge of loving someone, who has conflicted loyalties and misconceptions about the nature of his abuse (which is quite common among abused children).Watson's  haunting story that will be remembered long after you close the book.  I hope you choose to read this outstanding story.  It was a realistic account of adoption challenges and the roller-coaster ride of parenting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATVLGOOLKO6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590517091#wasThisHelpful","R2ATVLGOOLKO6Q","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Alan Cheuse proves that he is capable writing about tough subjects.  He incorporates a number of themes: Loss of Innocence; The Impact of Betrayal; The Allure of Money; and Money Can't Buy Happiness are intricately interwoven among the four members of the Bloch family, headed by a former Rabbi, Manny Bloch who becomes the uber businessman with great successes.  Cheuse also exerts mastery of symbolism as it relates to death and the circle of life.  This story is not only a story of the lack of fulfillment even those who are successful find but is a look into the minds of several people impacted by harsh experiences.The rabbi's tragic childhood and his rise to success and ultimately his fall are all narrated by his mother, Minnie Bloch as she relays his story to various friends and to his mistress and ultimately his daughter, who played a role in unmasking him to the world.  Her narration is clear and believable as a Jewish Grandmother.  Cheuse writing is strong through Minnie, whose observations are exacting and at times melodic though very serious as this she comments to Manny's mistress, a holocaust survivor ""...not like the killer in Europe, those who gave you your numbers, they were like lovers and mothers to a dream of murder, nursing it at all cost...""  Her voice is strong and at times generous towards her only son, at one point stating that his deceased father, whom he hears speaking through birds at pivotal life points, encouraged him to make some of his life altering choices.Unfortunately, Minnie is very verbose and so overly descriptive that the reader wonders how long it will take to hear her story.  We also wonder why she doesn't share the details with only one person but that it takes years for her to tell based on the various settings and the decline of her health.  The mysteries unraveled very slowly and I at times became frustrated.  This book was originally published under a different name, ""The Grandmothers' Club: A Novel"" back in 1995, which apparently didn't win a lot of readers.  Likewise, I suspect that one reader/reviewer prior to today’s date either failed to completely read this book or heavily skimmed as the review is full of erroneous statements.  Midway, I was tempted stop but I felt obligated to finish out of respect to the author and readers alike.  This book needed to be on a diet, it could have lost 100 pages and still kept the authenticity and key points viable to a comprehensive story.I gave three stars because although the author is talented and incorporated multiple themes and symbols into the story, it was tiresome.  It appears from the foreword that Cheuse aspires to the literary success of people such as Chekhov, Joyce, Hemingway, Woolf, Malamud and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  It is always wonderful to admire the most talented; however, I, myself do not see this story as accomplishing this goal.I would recommend this to those who like the use of symbolism and immigrant tales.  I wished I had enjoyed it more.Although billing is given to Tova Mirvis, she did not participate in the authorship of manuscript but only in the foreword.  This use of her name gives the book added allure which is in my opinion is a dishonest means to sell more books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSFZK6A4HSBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941493009#wasThisHelpful","R3JSFZK6A4HSBT","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is a hit in my book as well as my very picky Yorkie.  I originally awarded 4 stars because of what I thought were great ingredients.I called the Boutique where I buy my dog food and asked why the owner didn't stock it.  She stated that Avocados are terrible for dogs and it may actually kill them if they eat to much!!  I said, ""Are you serious?""  She told me to look it up, so I went to the ASPCA, and this is what I found ""Avocado leaves, fruit, seeds and bark may contain a toxic principle known as persin. The Guatemalan variety, a common one found in stores, appears to be the most problematic. ""  Since she only carries healthy and organic dog foods (which is one reason, I believe my Yorkies lived way past the typical life span).  My 14.5 y.o. is in kidney failure (FYI, never give a pet DRY Dog Food it further stains the kidneys, don't listen to the vet if they suggest it, especially if they sell it!).  Thus, I tossed the Avoderm bag out!While I won't list all the ingredients, I will say it is packed with some healthy stuff including key vitamins, minerals, amino acids and outstanding herbal extracts that improve digestion, absorption, skin, eyes, muscle and overall vitality.  Here is a list of the first 12 ingredients in the order shown on the Lamb bag: Lamb, Lamb Meal, Garbanzo Beans, Pea Flour, Tapioca, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Avocado, Natural Flavor (since it isn't named, I am wondering what they are hiding), Alfalfa Meal, Flax Seed (Source of Omega 3), Dried Beet Pulp and Dried Chicory Root.  Other noteworthy ingredients incorporated into the blend: Kelp Meal, Avocado Oil, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Rosemary Extract, Sage Extract, Pineapple Stem and Papain.This confuses me, apparently they have some good ingredients but then they stick in avocados which are tasty but to be avoided!  Likewise,  I have reservations about the source of chicken fat especially since many chickens aren't given a healthy diet.  Also of concern is that Flax Oil can go rancid and I don't know if there is a way to prevent this from occurring.  Since not all ingredients are stated we have no idea if there is anything that is a stabilizer/preservative (or if that is a good idea in itself).I will state that typically, I avoid the purchase of products which list ""Natural Flavors"" because it is industry lingo intended to avoid disclosure.  This is mainly done to avoid consumer rejection.  For example, many people don't know that ""Natural Vanilla Flavor"" is actually Beaver anal secretions, which much less expensive than the use of real vanilla bean extract; unfortunately, none of the U.S. food agency's forbid this substitution and it has been going on for years.  Similar terminology or creative renaming is used to cover up the use of MSG in food and vitamins (for which it is often used in formulation process).  Until consumers demand better disclosure for the foods which they or their pets consume, this avoidance of full disclosure will not cease (if interested, see Dr. Mercola's website, it lists the data on MSG), Amazon will not allow the posting of the link.  These are not isolated cases.  Without having more information on the label, we can't really be sure what little precious is eating or what we are consuming.  We only know that the company is not fully disclosing all their ingredients, thus, I have lowered my rating by one star because I believe purchasers have the right to know what they are buying.In addition, my baby enjoyed the Turkey less than the Lamb.  So, I won't be buying that either.I can't recommend this because I don't want to ever even possibly endanger my dog.  I wouldn't have even gotten this had I a clue that it is on the avoid list.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E07IOEUD4K6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1DF4KM#wasThisHelpful","R3E07IOEUD4K6F","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Marauders: A Novel is an intriguing story woven with a rich blend of interesting characters, multiple plots rife with drama, with a dollop of humor.  Tom Cooper's gift for descriptive prose is artful and his talent far exceeds what many respected writers aspire to produce.  I thoroughly enjoyed the rich scenery, regular injections of humor and particularly embraced the idiosyncratic characters as they doggedly fight to survive life in abject shrimping village after the BP Oil Spill.Our story introduces us into the lives of multiple characters but primarily, we follow: the Toup brothers, twin brothers who run a successful business, growing a unique variety of marijuana on a remote island within swamp land in the Gulf; Lindquist, a man who lusts for lost Pirate booty that may or may not be located on Toup land; Hanson and Cosgrove, two ne'er-do-well, stoners looking to make a quick buck; and Wes Trench, a young man, who loves his lifestyle and community but finds everything about the region constantly reminding him of his recently deceased Momma, who died in a hurricane.  Mix these character's together add a slick BP oil Executive in the pot and you have a rollicking ride of chaos, mayhem and gun battles and occasionally death but not all in the same chapter, at least not usually.If you are looking for a fast moving storyline, lyrically written with randomly humorous antidotes thrown at you, this book will satisfy.  While some reviewers compare Tom Cooper to Carl Hiaasen, I may actually prefer Cooper's style.  Though I know some reader's might find that statement inflammatory, I think Cooper demonstrates superior skill in his character development, and he delivers to the reader a deep understanding of each character's identity and a reason to rally's around those with whom they feel kinship.  This is not to disparage Carl Hiaasen's talent or gift for humorous writing.This book has earned a place on my permanent collection shelf and may be reread in the future, when a dose of fun is needed.  I hope that Hollywood makes this into a movie, I would buy a ticket!  Matthew McConaughey could play Lindquist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKVE1GIGD8EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140561#wasThisHelpful","R2BKVE1GIGD8EY","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jonathan Holiff is the son of Saul Holiff, who managed Johnny Cash for almost 20 years bringing Johnny from near obscurity to fame and fortune that had alluded him prior to his management by Holiff.  Relying on film clips, photographs and reel to reel audio tapes of Saul's verbal diary, we are introduced to the thinking of Saul Holiff.  Jonathan tries to unveil and dissect the man that he knew as father in name only.  His father like Johnny Cash was a hard drinker and daily used pills as well.  Holiff's day in day out dealings with a drug and alcohol addled superstar left him totally drained and removed from his role as husband and father.  In the end, his desire for control was so powerful that he chose when to die, without even leaving a note.  Thus his widow, who plays an almost non-existent role in this documentary, Joshua, his brother, (not included in the video) and Jonathan must some how move past this tragedy.We are not informed why Joshua nor their mother do not participate in the film, perhaps, they own sorrow prevented them from doing so.  Jonathan presents to us primarily through the audio recordings made by his father, the summary of his father's life as it relates to Johnny and June Carter Cash (not much real detail, certainly not an expose of them that you haven't already been privy too through other sources); his frustrations when dealing with vendors who are angered by Johnny's last minute cancellations to music executives; and his anger due to his inability to properly parent.  Jonathan had a great deal of conflict with his father and was frequently told he was a disappointment but had no real understanding that this is typical in growing up in a home where substance abuse overshadows every aspect of life.As a study, of a substance abusing household this is as accurate as any example, those who are adult children of alcohols (or addicts) will tell you.  As many children in this environment tend to do, Jonathan left home as early as possible running from his home in Canada to Hollywood to become a manager of stars just like his dad.I liked that Jonathan doesn't play the victim in this movie.  Those survivor's of such homes must choose to walk in forgiveness and love or live their life tormented by the bitterness by all they missed because they didn't have a ""normal"" childhood.  Jonathan has obviously chosen to forgive as his understanding of his father increased.  It is an uncompromising look at the isolating pain, he experienced as he suffered ongoing rejection but never knew how to be acceptable.  This would puzzle any child.  However, that said, I felt he missed an opportunity to explore for the viewer how he overcame his pain of rejection or if he still struggles.  Further, I am so curious why the other family members only got a passing comment but never share the screen with him.I thought this documentary was going to be more focused on Johnny Cash instead of using his name to entice you to watch a true story about a son whose father just happens to work for Johnny Cash but is absent physically and emotionally from his childhood.  I thought it was a story about his father and Johnny's Cash's partnership ""secrets to fame"" or something more to do with their work relationship than the mere fact that Johnny's addictions were part of the reason for Saul's absences.  I felt this usage of Johnny Cash is plain misleading and intentional and thus I deducted a star for that.Furthermore, we only have a limited view of Jonathan's isolation, no one else is included in an interview format be it a relative, a girlfriend, neighbors, sibling or mother contribute their observations.  I am sure his mother had a great deal of her own pain having to parent two boys almost like a single mom at the hands of a verbally abusive husband (this is an assumption based on his treatment of Jonathan, little is mentioned about the parent's marital dynamics).  I do respect that this may have seemed to personal or invasive by his mother, it just wasn't touched on or it's lack of inclusion explained.It was a fair job as a documentary, its limited point of view kept it from being exceptional.  Other title options might have been more accurate, ""A Look at Johnny Cash's manager, my Dad, Saul Holiff"" or ""A Look at Parental Substance Abuse impact on a Childhood"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OU8AZMPSRPUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FM5K3SC#wasThisHelpful","R3OU8AZMPSRPUX","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been using a Bissell ProHeat Turbo Upright Deep Cleaner from over 20 years.  I don’t recall what motivated that first purchase but it lasted nearly 10 years and was great at keeping my whole house clean.*  Then, when I bought my house 20 years ago, I still needed a carpet cleaner for my Master Bedroom since it was Headquarters for my various menageries of cats and dogs particularly for sleeping and of course shedding.  However, I have enjoyed my Oreck Canister Vacuum for over 10 years (it is duct taped for continued functionality but it is a work horse).  So, I believe I can offer an unbiased comparison of Oreck Revitalize Carpet Cleaner and Bissell 8910W ProHeat Turbo Upright Deep Cleaner.Both are easy to assemble.  Oreck Cleaner is substantially lighter in weight and smaller in size than that of Bissell 8910W ProHeat Cleaner.  When the Oreck is in use it is a bit easier to maneuver however, both carpet cleaners require some strength in the upper arm and shoulder areas and I found this painful at times even with the Oreck due to some physical issues I suffer in this body region.  Both operate in similar manner, so I will focus only on the differences.One of the biggest drawbacks I found with the Oreck Cleaner is that it has two separate compartments for water, one to clean and the other is a receptacle for the dirty refuse.  They are so small, they hold very little water.  Their appearance is deceiving as they hold at most 4 cups each though it looks more like 8.  This led to many trips to the sink to empty and refill.  Whereas the Bissell 8910W ProHeat Cleaner has one large tank that holds about liter of hot water and it is comprised of a flexible, plastic, interior “bladder” which is filled with the clean tap water, while the exterior of bladder is the hard tank that fills with the dirty water that has been processed through the carpet.Due to the excessive visits to empty the dirty and refill the clean compartments of the Oreck, thus I had less time to clean the carpet.  Additionally, each time you remove the clean water container, a lot spills into the holding area.  Also, when the cleaner is stopped, water leaks out the bottom leaving a big “puddle” on the carpet or floor where it is setting.  I found this emptying/refilling tedious and required a lot of wasted effort I would not contend with when using the Bissell 8910W ProHeat (although, at times, it also puddles where it sets as well).  Upon cleaning carpet completion you must allow all water tanks to “air dry” because none are designed to wipe towel dry.Both Oreck and Bissell 8910W ProHeat do a fine job cleaning the carpet.  Using Oreck it may take longer to get the same area of carpet clean because of time utilized to empty/refill the water canisters.  When comparing price Oreck’s current price of $400. seems steep compared to Bissell’s $140., you get the same job for nearly 1/3 the money.  Thus, this extra $260 dollar difference is for the perceived value of Oreck’s durability and quality as well as the smaller size which will allow for easier storage (which is significant to many folks).*It’s replacement didn’t last two years, later I purchased the Bissell PowerSteamer PowerBrush Full Sized Carpet Cleaner and it didn’t last beyond 1.5 hours before the motor burned out (this was Brand New out of the box, not reconditioned).  So, I do not have any allegiance with Bissell.  Since this was a comparison between Oreck Revitalize Carpet Cleaner and Bissell 8910W ProHeat Turbo Upright Deep Cleaner, I didn’t want to focus on the bad experience I had with the Bissell PowerSteamer PowerBrush.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O6EIEK340KG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWN6#wasThisHelpful","R2O6EIEK340KG4","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title ""Basic Law: A Mystery of the Cold War Europe"" serves as a fine synopsis of this book.  Written by J. Sydney Jones, we travel back in time to 1994 before cell phones and computers would have quickly unraveled the mysteries that await us in this novel.  As a result of the lack of these impressive tools,  we instead rely on a burned out reporter, as we meander with through multiple countries multiple times, seeking multiple people of whom are made subject to multiple inquiries about multiple issues that reporter Sam Kramer has about his former lover, Renata Muller and her involvement with the current leader of a Neo-Nazi group.Renata is found dead a number of days later after her apparent suicide.  Those who know her can't fathom why this woman, who was so dynamic and full of life would be motivated to do something so drastic.  When Kramer discovers that he was named as her Memoir Executor, a document which he can't locate, his suspicions turn to murder.  The more he doggedly he digs, the more dangerous his life becomes.  Those closest to Renata begin to reinforce his perception that she was in fact murdered.  As in any good story, few key people are who they seem nor are those from the past as we remember them to be.  As the dots begin to connect, more questions arise and people closest to Renata face death attempts, too.  Little is what it seems until major piece of the puzzle is identified and the links between people and situations are much more obvious.Basic Law, ""Grundesetz"" refers to a code in current German law.  In the story, it is stated, ""The law as written decrees membership in both right and left terrorist organizations to be illegal.""  It is basis of the premise of Basic Law that Kramer manages to get confessions from some ugly characters that Renata had been investigating to revealing their activities past and present in Europe following World War II as it relates to Nazism .Yet, this as the underlying premise for the book didn't really wow this reader.  The book starts off powerfully with many curious matters to digest, but the main plot stumbles and falters as new, underdeveloped characters are utilized in moving the story forward.  As we learn the big reveal, it tends to drift as it concludes in wrapping up loose ends, while relevant motivations just seemed to pat.  As a reader, I was much more invested at the start of the story than I was past the middle, primarily because the characters never evolved beyond their introduction.  Jones is talented but I doubt I'll be reading more of his work.  I read a variety of genre's, so I may not serve as the best assessor of his Cold War story writing style, however, I offer a modest recommendation of this book on the basis that he capably delivered a strong action driven plot, despite my disappointment in its weak characterizations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQO9CL3Z0CVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497690471#wasThisHelpful","R2VQO9CL3Z0CVG","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story delivers a great plot and it keeps you guessing until the conclusion.Who is the man, that fathered her young, seemingly promiscuous daughter's baby?  Why can't this guileless young girl tell her mother the truth?  The viewer soon discovers that part of the difficulty is that the young lady is mentally challenged to some degree doesn't always seem to grasp questions.  Though she is sexually developed she has a limited understanding of her world.  Communication between her and her mother is limited but why is she so contrary?  She leads her mother in various misdirections that compound the frustration of both women further.Add to this that they live with very limited funds which is compounded by the fact that the grandfather has just recently died and the baby's father isn't contributing to his needs increases the need to locate the culprit.  The grandmother made a vow to the grandfather that the baby's father would be located, found accountable and give his name to the child so he may be christened before Christmas which is rapidly approaching.  Her anguish is compelling to the viewer and makes for great theater.  Things unfold or more to the point, unravel further and the situation worsens the more she seeks answers.  When unexpectedly she gets a gift from the most unlikely source.  Her shock at the truth in addition to the compassion of others in the midst of her pain makes this a memorable movie for the lucky viewer.Don't let the title or the cover make you quick to judge the gift that is awaiting your viewership.  It is a universal tale that crosses all cultures, races, and ethnicity.  It is timeless piece that keeps you guessing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K34R58H2G2E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009XKLR0#wasThisHelpful","R1K34R58H2G2E0","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buying store brands for multiple decades I found it frustrating to get locate the true color I desired.  I always had to go a lot lighter (blonde) to achieve a middle range color.  I didn't realize that Naturtint was able to deliver its color with such accuracy!  My first purchase, I went lighter based on experiences with other brands, so I wasn't expecting to become a platinum blonde.  Well, they let me return the remaining boxes and I selected Golden Blonde 7G after much agonizing over their awesome selection.  I am so pleased.  It looks exactly like the box shows!  My hair looks natural and it covers my white, gray and brown roots exceptionally well.  Plus, my hair feels soft and doesn't look dry, not even the ends!But my story gets better!  This is a safer alternative to the caustic, paraben laden products on the store shelves and it doesn't burn my scalp (I have sensitive skin).  It doesn't fade either.  I don't have to worry about color change after a few washes like I found with other brands.Yet, the best part is the cost!  If you like your color, you can buy it in bulk (6 pack) here on Amazon and spend the same or even less than what you would on the less effective, more toxic options in the store.  Can you beat that?  No, I didn't think so!I wish I had found this option years earlier!  I guess I'll be satisfied that I now know and I am enabled to pass this well kept secret to others.  Try it!  I found the company very cooperative when I didn't like my first shade selection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EU2D4UCH3SA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E0VWUW#wasThisHelpful","R1EU2D4UCH3SA3","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author, Sarah Rayner does a fine job encapsulating how stress and trauma may lead to despair and deep depression.  She engages the reader with a number of characters that face a variety of challenges including: loss of spouse; divorce; loss of parent; handicapped child; loss of business and financial viability; incest; chemical imbalances, etc.  She deftly incorporates signs and symptoms and numerous healing pathways in a readable almost pleasurable style.  Her storyline includes people of various ages, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.  The book roundly explores that depression can occur regardless of who you are or what you have achieved.The three primary characters meet at a renowned and respected, private mental hospital where each is in crisis.  As they realize that they must voice their situations at least in private therapy, they begin to see themselves and others as opportunities to learn and grow.  Group therapy provides an opportunity to learn which behaviors are detrimental and alternatively those which are healthy coping mechanisms.  Friendships of various types become a support system some are lacking and a honest sounding board in seeing how their thoughts and behaviors have kept them stuck or worsened their depressive state.The story explores the still taboo attitude toward mental illness and why these attitudes keep those in pain from seeking help.  Most people when they experience chest pain, go to the hospital.  Yet, most people who suffer depression won't even share it with a spouse or partner.  Ms. Rayner states that she has incorporated her own and others experiences to bring to light the nature of what depression is and is not, however it is not autobiographical.  I think she has done an outstanding job of explaining mental illness through characters, who were relatable.  The storyline was strong despite that she incorporates many great insights on the causes of depression and offers many strategies to combat symptoms and overcome situations that led to it.  For the most part, it was very realistic.  My one quibble is that most of the main characters transformed into a healthier self at an accelerated pace.  It is unusual for someone in long term clinical depression to make a such great leaps in a few weeks as some did.  Perhaps, she didn't want to add much on their recuperation process as it would lengthen the book and may distract from the key points.  I think that there would have been a way around that but perhaps it was an editor's call.  Thus, I deducted a star because this sends a message to the reader that healing can be easily attained, though this is true for only a small percentage.  Most people don't suddenly get depressed nor do they rapidly return to ""normal"".I recommend this book to anyone who has suffered from depression or currently stuck.  It is an encouraging read.  I think the quality of the information alone should make it required reading for those considering or working toward a mental health career!  It would also be meaningful to those who have known a friend or family member who struggles as well, so that they have greater understanding and offer healthy support.  Ms. Rayner is a talented author.  I intend to read her other novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LQJOHWWFKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250066093#wasThisHelpful","R11LQJOHWWFKU","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, I have been enjoying Tomato & Roasted Red Pepper by Pacific and it is as good/better than Campbell's Tomato Soup in my opinion.  I particularly like that it is a much healthier choice as well.  Recently, I visited Trader Joe's and saw that they have an Organic version with healthy ingredients, too.  YES! (Imagine fist pump here).I made it shortly after my return home.  Though I had to shake (as instructed),  due to injuries, I am unable to do a sufficient job, once in the pan using either a fork or table spoon, I was able to break up the lumps and heat the soup (the lumps occur with Pacific's version as well).  It was simply delicious.  I had to have a second serving.  When I decided I wanted some for lunch the following day, I ended up making a second serving upon completion of the first.  Lesson learned, just make two servings because it is that good.Though I haven't had Pacific's for nearly a year.  I don't believe that Trader Joe's version is inferior in any way.  Presently, the price on Amazon is a bit hard to swallow but in my metro area, the price is more than a dollar less than Pacific's version per carton.  Prices tend to fluctuate on this website as different seller's compete on this site at various times.  My suggestion is to put it in your cart and wait until the price drops then place your order.The quality is there.

"I have been using Turmeric for years, then in April 2010 I was seriously injured in an auto accident and have been using Turmeric and other natural remedies to address nerve pain, inflammation and trauma.  Over this period of time, I have used several different Jarrow formulations which includes: Turmeric Concentrate Curcumin 95 and their newer formulation Curcumin Phytosome which is supposed to be more bio-available (my understanding is that the body is absorbs it more efficiently).  I have also used Terry Naturally's Curamin which has a combination of ingredients to enhance Turmeric's performance.  I've even tried NutriGold's  Turmeric Curcumin Gold which includes various components of Turmeric along with Black Pepper derivative (wonderful for pain relief).  I honestly think all of the above are excellent at what they do.  Being that each individual's body chemistry handles things a little different, one may find one product more effective than another.I found that NEW CHAPTER'S Turmeric Force has been quite effective as a daily supplement for me.  Every New Chapter product I have used I have found to out perform my previous brand as my favorite.  However, I would say this New Chapter's Turmeric Force 320 mg of Turmeric per capsule for my body was quite comparable to NutriGold's Curcumin Gold, which has 500 mg of Turmeric per capsule along with Black Pepper (which may be something my body really needs?).If one compares price points New Chapter's 120 capsules is currently offered on Amazon at $35.99 whereas NutriGold's $27.33 as of today's writing 1/25/2015.  Amazon's prices do fluctuate so if price is an important consideration, then New Chapter may not be your best option.  However, we all have different biochemistry, lifestyles and stressors that contribute to how we respond to any product.I really do like New Chapter Turmeric Force.  I believe in New Chapter's product line as being one of the most superior available to consumer's.  While they tend to be more expensive than competitors, they usually have ingredients not included by a competitor so you aren't necessarily comparing apples to oranges, in all other cases I am more than willing to pay extra.  I had an hour plus long conversation with their sales representative and their commitment to quality and the way they process their ingredients are calculated toward protecting the integrity of the ingredients.  You can't go wrong with New Chapter's Turmeric Force.I should mention that my first New Chapter's Zylamend Softgels for inflammation (which has numerous Anti-inflammatory herbs and spices as well Turmeric), which I have been using for at least 3.5 or 4 years.  It was the first anti-inflammatory that really made a difference for me (I've written a review on Amazon already).

"There is a lot to like about the Freshware 7 in 1 chopper, so I start with what I didn't like first.I clean everything before first use.  So using soapy water and trying to be watchful, I unexpectedly managed to cut one of my fingers on one of the chopping blades, OUCH!  Please use extra caution when washing this unit (it is dishwasher safe).  Which brings me to the next issue, the little cleaning tool is inadequate.  I use an old tooth brush or vegetable scrubber (find one at a dollar store) to get the gunk out.  Clean and dry immediately after use for best cleaning results.This contains many different pieces to the unit so if you plan to use the container to refrigerate chopped items, you have to find a location for all the implements (so you may want to save the box, the entire unit is nearly 15"").  I have a small kitchen, so its relatively large size is a bit of a storage conundrum for me, not a compliant, rather a matter to contemplate if kitchen storage space is an issue.I have issues with muscle strength and arthritis so regular chopping is a major struggle for me.  I was really looking forward to this enabling me to do more fresh food preparation.  Unfortunately, the 7-in-1 is a challenge for me assemble and take apart.  Furthermore, as a result of blade sharpness I use greater caution.A big consideration is how much will you use it?  If you do a lot of cooking or prepare large meals, this will be a great time saver, however, if you are just making a simple salad for one or two, it may not be a time saver.I noticed others saying that their slicers warped and I can see that occurring although I am not sure if you follow the guidelines (particularly about not forcing something too hard through a blade) that this will be an issue.  I also wonder if those with issues used it more than others (it should still maintain its integrity despite this, in my opinion).At it's current Amazon price of $26.87 (with free shipping for a purchase totaling $35.), I think this is a good value for the money, I would expect this to be higher in certain specialty stores but probably lower or similarly priced at a Walgreens or CVS.This product was made in China.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20OM2YP41L2MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPXKQQQ#wasThisHelpful","R20OM2YP41L2MP","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high expectations for Kaui Hart Hemmings' ""The Possibilities"", since I was captivated by her prior novel, ""The Descendents"".  Unfortunately, I have rather mixed feelings upon my completion.Ms. Hart Hemmings is a talented writer, her characterizations are vivid enough that you can identify with them and see them clearly.  The story itself portrayed grieving and its five stages accurately.  The questions that the main character, Sarah St. John, mother to 22 y.o., Cully who died in an accident struggles to find answers are realistic.  She is portrayed as unproductive and adrift as she tries to return to her job as a public relations/sales promoter for Breckenridge ski resorts.  She is so stricken that she can't maintain her poise or civility.  Her only real friend, Suzanne is going through her own grief as her marriage careens toward divorce.  Their interactions are at times tense as they compare their wounds and compete for attention.  Soon Sarah discovers secrets that Cully had kept, one follows another which leads to the entry of Kit, Cully's girlfriend that no one but his formerly estranged father had any awareness.  Kit's big reveal won't be much of a surprise to most readers.  At this point, one feels like one has ""seen"" multiple times on ""Lifetime"" Channel and at least a few times on the Hallmark Channel as well as in a number of different novels.  Thus, I felt cheated since the story meanders along for awhile with everyone wondering about Kit's sudden appearance 3 months after Cully has died; sure I understand they are caught up in their grief but these intelligent, modern people can't suss out her agenda seemed farfetched.Ms. Hart Hemmings is so talented in characterizations and dialogue, it is truly a shame she didn't at least shorten the story a bit.  For me it stalled when Kit just shows up but nothing really happens until some time later.  While this plot device was intended to build suspense, it fails miserably.  Leaving readers frustrated at the key character's naivete.  Additionally, the ending leaves the door open for a sequel, which I probably wouldn't read.If Ms. Hart Hemmings continues to write about grieving characters, I hope she will put more effort toward a more imaginative plot.  I can only recommend this book if one doesn't expect it to be comparable to the originality that ""The Descendents"" delivered.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WDIWBE0BO78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476725799#wasThisHelpful","R28WDIWBE0BO78","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a sample in the mail some time ago.  I really didn't give it a thought until one day I ran out of my brand.  I was super impressed and remain so.  This shaver has three blades that can smoothly cut thick, wiry hair.  I have had a few slight cuts but primarily it was from pressing down to hard (which isn't necessary, as it glides smoothly).  It gives a clean shave and it doesn't irritate my skin!I have had great results and have used it many times since opening.You need to try this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DIO4V3PLPSUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061GFJQC#wasThisHelpful","R2DIO4V3PLPSUJ","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Night Blindness is a fast-paced novel that at times is quite gripping.  The protagonist, Jensen Reilly Ledarkis returns to her home to nurse her ailing father through radiation treatment for brain cancer.  Her return revives all her suppressed pain from the sudden death of her older, teenage brother, Will, with whom she was close.  As she faces the potential of the loss of her father, her guilt at failing to share a secret, as well as her disengagement from her parents after Will's demise, overwhelms her like a Tidal wave.  As she seeks clarity and to reconnect with her parents and her former boyfriend (Will's best-friend), Ryder, she must decide if she will remain hidden within her husband, Nico's shadow or reclaim the life she had hoped for in her youth.Given that I am reviewing an advanced reading copy, I am basing my opinion on what may not be a part of the book in final form.  There were times I had difficulty connecting to Jensen, I don't want to incorporate spoiler's, so I will leave it at that.  Also, situational ethics plays heavily into the story, that is, 'if it feels good do it'.  Unfortunately, other lives are impacted when we do what we want versus what we ought.  This is part of the reason I didn't connect with some of Jensen's actions, but not the only reason.On a positive note, key character's behaviors were entirely realistic given the trauma of Will's death.  Each person's grieving process was well-captured and heartbreaking, and these insights may be considered the book's strongest feature by some.Susan Strecker's debut novel is a compelling story.  She effectively built suspense by keeping secret the events moment's before Will's death.  I would recommend Night Blindness as a worthwhile read as most of us have experienced loss of someone dear.  That said, it is unlikely I will reread it.  I would however consider reading other story's by Strecker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9I7TRP8NS4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042836#wasThisHelpful","R3T9I7TRP8NS4U","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sylvia True has written an outstanding account on the impact that sex addictions can have on partners and family members, some of which are quite unexpected.  Her characterizations ring true, each main character struggling with her own insecurities, the fear of the future and the underlying feelings of betrayal, alienation and raw personal shame as deep as that of those who grieve a loss of life or relationship of an immediate family member.  Each of the women deals with some level of denial and at times feels misunderstood by the addict as well as the others attending their support group.  What starts as a grasping of straws to survive another day evolves into most of the women developing coping skills to face their unknown future and mutual support and compassion for each other.There wasn't a wasted word in this debut masterpiece, though I would have liked it to have been longer, the ending on the whole was satisfying.  Ms. True develops her characters with an artist's sensitivity and clarity.  Anyone who has struggled with a partner with this condition will identify with stages of grief and the questioning of how if their own reaction's influence the problems that ensue.  Ms. True is a therapist and it is obvious that she has vast knowledge of this type of addiction's manifestations and repercussions.I was absorbed from the very beginning.  The women's pain was palatable and likewise, their healing process and friendships were encouraging.  I would not hesitate in recommending this book for it's honest insights as well as its flowing storyline.  This is a must read for those emotionally impacted by this problem as it offers powerful validation in addition to its well written prose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TLKORRTDXE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250051886#wasThisHelpful","R39TLKORRTDXE8","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Patricia Harman, author of ""The Reluctant Midwife: A Hope River Novel"" is a well executed story of intertwining narratives of two primary characters, as they experience great hardships of the Great Depression in a coal mining region of West Virginia.  As the story unfolds we come to appreciate the frailties of Nurse Becky and Dr. Blum and their personal and career challenges.  Harman's characterizations are vivid and intriguing.  One does not need to read the first in this series to understand the situation or character dynamics.The story flows fluidly from Nurse Becky's journey from working as a surgeon's assistant to transitioning into work as a midwife when her close friend, Patience, the region's midwife becomes temporarily bedridden.  Soon, her wonder overtakes her fear of delivering newborns often without guidance, and gradually her clinical detachment crumbles away.  Later, she is employed part-time as a nurse working at a clinic for CCC, a forestry program created during FDR's administration to get young unemployed men trained and equipped for jobs in public works.  Becky efforts enable her to grow into an individual with greater compassion and empathy for others as drama unfolds.  Likewise, through her dedication to Dr. Blum, he also transforms for the better.When I selected this book it was with a slight reluctance.  I wasn't sure I wanted to read the graphic birth scenes I anticipated.  Instead, I found Becky's anguish matched my own and while the situations were descriptive, they weren't overly detailed that I wanted to skip that section, in fact, I found her nurse's notes detailing the events were fascinating as well.  The terminology when used was always explained, so I learned a few facts, too.I looked forward to the time I could next pick up this book and I was saddened as it ended.  However, based on the ending, a third story is obviously in the works.  I have ordered the first in the series not because I have unanswered questions, rather, I enjoy Ms. Harman's creative story telling.  This is was a pleasurable read and I emphatically endorse it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296KNOTADPA3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062358243#wasThisHelpful","R296KNOTADPA3N","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frances Whiting delivers a thoughtful, humorous drama encompassing a variety of relationships in Tallulah de Longland's young life.  ""Walking on Trampolines"" explores the adaptability one must maintain when life's unexpected curves challenge the established equilibrium.  Through Tallulah's (Lulu) commitment to her family, friends and boss, we observe that those closest to her rely on her to point them True North, however, when she commits one irresponsible act, she looses herself.  Her struggle to forgive herself and in turn others will be her turning point.  The challenge is can she do it?The story is full of well drawn, flawed characters which include her 3 close girlfriends, her first love, her dysfunctional family and an arrogant, obnoxious boss who takes on the role of confidant, friend and benefactor.  The first portion of the story explores Lulu's unlikely friendship with wealthy, sophisticated Annabel while attending Catholic school as a preteen.  Once Lulu becomes romantically involved with Josh, they all become inseparable.  Lulu never suspects their betrayal until she catches them de facto.  Lulu is crushed and suffers from long-term depression and suspends all her future plans.  After several years working in her father's plumbing business, she is forced from her nest and works as a Personal Assistant to an infamous national radio personality.  When his belligerent attitude and unseemly language fail to have their intended impact a truce is met and a great friendship evolves.  This projects us into the second half of the story as Lulu comes to terms with her strengths and frailties.  When she finally acquires knowledge that self-acceptance delivers, she charges full on to a life worth living.This is much more than a typical coming of age story, it is also a story of finding one's place in the world.  I tore through the book in two days, the story was vibrant and the characters were fresh and realistic.  The writing was fluid.  I highly recommend this story to others as a read worthy of your time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFFFS6JKJIZR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476780013#wasThisHelpful","RFFFS6JKJIZR2","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Amy Scheibe delivers an intensely driven plot focused on religion, racism, conservatism and politics in this riveting story. The initial set-up was a little slow but it quickly captures your interest as you observe the sharply contrasting main characters. As events unfold their ulterior agendas are slowly revealed driving the protagonist, Emmaline (Emmy) Nelson to question her role. When she refuses to accept the plans made for her upcoming nuptials, chaos ensues.This story is a dramatic thriller. Several characters actions are increasingly more sinister as each attempt to manipulate their community to garner the power they covet leads to increasing community mayhem. The question is how far will they go to accomplish their plans? Why is Emmy's compliance a part of their strategy? How can she remain safe and convince them that she won't be intimidated to do their bidding?This book definitely has movie potential. It is riff with community drama. It is quintessential in its portrayal mid-western politics and culture in a small farming town. In a few minor instances it reminded me of Jane Smiley's ""A Thousand Acres: A Novel"" in her portrayal of family politics and power of land ownership. This is a keeper, it will be something I will reread in the future. Don't let the title fool you, this is a story that you will ponder even after you finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R284LJQDZ5FUKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049679#wasThisHelpful","R284LJQDZ5FUKD","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mary Hogan's ""Two Sisters: A Novel"" is largely drawn from her personal life.  I didn't know that until after I finished the story but while reading felt fairly certain this was based on someone's personal experience, it was too realistic not to be.  The trauma created by the family's secrets are compelling and the fluidity in which it is written was exquisite.  The characters had great depth and their flaws were obvious as the story evolved through interactions and situations and not just summarily given, which in my opinion is the sign of an excellent storyteller not just a formulaic writer.While I raced through the book in less than 24 hours, the novel ended to tidily and thus I have deducted a star.  WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead.  My first quibble is that Muriel, the protagonist is very conflicted by the labels and treatment she received growing up and continuing into her adulthood.  Her personal revelations on her role in the problems and the other family members  contribution to these issues was very unrealistic to me; it was almost as if she woke up one morning after her 22(?) years of mess and sees the complete picture with 20/20 vision.  Additionally, another character, who is mainly responsible for her suffering and shame realizes her own flaws and repents to Muriel for the pain she has caused.  In my experience (and I have a gold star in this arena), people who compulsively lie rarely change their stripes and they typically refuse to be held accountable (I'm not saying it never happens).  While the healing that occurs was a nice way to end the book, it didn't really correlate with the personalities  or dynamics of those involved within the nearly 30 years of drama and deception.I would definitely recommend this story.  The prose was beautifully written and quite vivid.  The characters were exceptionally drawn and dynamic.The plot will appeal to a those who enjoy drama.  Most people will either identify with at least some of the scenes personally or have a connection to the dynamics on some level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6HNSCKE86FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062279939#wasThisHelpful","R2S6HNSCKE86FU","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story is what I consider outstanding psychological thrillers are made off.  Eve Dalladay is not what she appears but as the story unravels via flashbacks, Natty missed the little cues.  Natty is a classically insecure personality with great naivete about how the world really operates.  She is very dedicated to people pleasing which is why her hotel is such a success.  However, this inability to see people as they really are is the reason she never realizes that she is being set-up.  For those people who read or watch a lot of television or movies in this genre, she may be considered weak or stupid but this is her personality make-up and there are plenty of people just like her.Author, Paula Daly has written a complex story, which unravels insights with great timing.  Her characters are well drawn.  She has a good understanding of narcissistic sociopaths as to their thought patterns and behaviors.  If you have ever had the misfortune of knowing one, you will relate to Natty's feelings of frustration, despair and betrayal.The evidence is in: this book encapsulates the horrors of being the victim of a sociopath and subsequent results.  If I were to meet Ms. Daly, I would ask if she ever personally had dealt with a sociopath?  This is one of the best books I've read in this genre in at least a year.  Then again, I've had several sociopaths in my life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XE3I9XXUSNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123201#wasThisHelpful","R30XE3I9XXUSNM","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stanley Bostitch Personal Heavy Duty Stapler Value Kit is nice value for the infrequent user such as myself.  My staples were cleanly in place without any issues when stapling large documents.I found it fairly easy to use (there were instructions otherwise it would have been a bit of a challenge as it wasn't the most obvious place).  I had a bit of a challenge getting the stapler compartment closed once the staples were in place as they raised up as it was 90% closed this happened at least 5 or 6 times until using my left hand, I pushed the staples down while pushing with my right hand to close it.  I consider this a design flaw. Other reviewers comment on these issues as well and some state the loading mechanism breaks and then the stapler no longer functions.However, since I am not going to be a daily user or perhaps even a weekly user, I will report back if it does indeed break.  In the past, I have been happy with my other Stanley Bostitch Staplers but I have used other brands that I am equally satisfied.All in all, I am pleased but since there are a lot of unhappy customers, I can recommend it based on my limited use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4XPYEDC6A1YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHYO514#wasThisHelpful","R4XPYEDC6A1YQ","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Probiotics are known for aiding digestion and absorption of important nutrients which in turn aids in healthier passage of fecal matter more specifically it is helpful in stopping diarrhea and gas.  Good stuff, huh?  Well, it gets better...the better you absorb nutrients in your food, the better your entire body can function as it gets what is required to work at optimal level.  Thus the microflora impacts anywhere mucous membranes are exposed to the environment such as the skin, respiratory tract and genital-urinary tract.I was excited that I could offer these chews to my dog as a treat.  Unfortunately, they aren't very chewy they are almost hard.  I have found this to be an issue with many of my Vetri-Science products -my dogs get Canine Plus Senior daily arrive dried out 90% of the time, although Vetri-Liver Canine Chews are moist, however, my one dog refuses to eat them. This chew has 286 million microorganisms per chew which seems like a lot.  However, the Vetri-Science Vetri-Mega Probiotic capsules has at least 5 billion microorganisms per capsule (this is substantial compared to other brands) and is obviously more than 10 times more than the chew!  However, I don't know what is suggested for a dog and I don't know if the size of the dog is a consideration either.The Vetri-Science Probiotic chew has 9 strains of probiotic plus FOS while the Vetri-Science Probiotic capsule has 8 strains.  Both are very good, as the type and number of strains mean they are more effective.  The chews have dried skim milk as one of the last ingredients which if your dog is lactose intolerant may be an issue.Neither the Vetri-Science's Vetri-Mega Probiotic capsules nor the chews require refrigeration which saves me space since many probiotics do require refrigeration.My elderly dogs do like these chews, they didn't care for the capsule being sprinkled on their food.  Based on their tiny size, I am instructed to cut the chew in half.Price wise as of this writing (Amazon frequently adjusts prices), which is currently at $19.64 per package (just 9 days ago it was $16.99) so it is currently $.33 per chew.  While the capsules compared which price hasn't changed from 9 days ago stays at $22.64 for 120 or $.19 per cap almost half price.If you have a picky dog, you might want to purchase the chews but the value of the capsules plus the substantially higher volume as far as Probiotics makes it a better value overall particularly at the current prices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACCHBK7IE2G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TL3DQW#wasThisHelpful","R1ACCHBK7IE2G3","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sterling Silver Multi-Color Stone Key Pendant Necklace is a lovely gift item for yourself or friend.  The delicate design suggests sophistication.  The stones appear true to color shown on your monitor (at least they did on mine, your results may vary).  They are quite brilliant and it will match a variety of clothing selections. The bottom portion appears as a pretty lattice work adding to the elegance of the piece.  I like that the loop for the chain is placed behind the pendant allowing the eye to focus on the intricacy of the design and the bright stones.  The Sterling Silver chain is simple but classical although a little to small in size and length.The size is a bit smaller than it appears on a standard 15"" computer monitor.  Length wise the pendant is 15/16"" or 27 millimeters approximately.  Across at it's widest point is 7/16"" or 13 millimeters approximately.This is a beautiful piece of costume jewelry (the stones do not look real), however, I wouldn't hesitate to wear this to a party or a dressy day at the office as its design ads flair and refinement to solid colors particular a black or navy dress.

"This movie tried to incorporate many messages into its plot with some success.  The acting by some of the persons was forced and came across as to extreme (particularly the women that is the innkeeper).  However, other key players were much more believable in their parts especially the brother and sister, who ran an orphanage.  Which makes one wonder if it was a result of script or direction given as opposed to the skills of those playing their parts.The sequence of events that lead a successful sports event to be stranded in ""Middletown"" seemed so contrived that I almost didn't finish the movie, however it improved greatly as the story progressed.  The sharing of the those running the orphanage as well as that of the Pastor, played by Steven Curtis Chapman were encouraging, informative and cohesive contributions to the primary plot.I am not sure this would capture the attention of the lost, which is its target audience and that along with the other concerns are the reasons that 3 stars are awarded.While I would recommend this as wholesome family entertainment (I have NO idea why Parental Guidance is suggested, when witchcraft is prevalent in cartoons and this was nothing a 4 year old hasn't heard).  I am not sure I would want to see it a second time.

"The fountain of youth for your hair has been created!  I have color treated hair which leaves it dry.  Additionally, I take multiple medications that further impact it.

I do intend to try the conditioner but it may not be necessary except when blowing drying or curling which dries the hair, since I already have great results from the shampoo.I caution that we all are unique in our body chemistry so this may not work for everyone - as we can see, some others didn't like it.  It is even possible that the formulation will change at some point in the future (I have experienced this with two different shampoos that I originally liked only for the formulation to be altered and no longer have the results I anticipated thereafter).So, if you aren't satisfied with your current shampoo, I recommend you give this a chance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17HQGS3EIKVIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYFAHRS#wasThisHelpful","R17HQGS3EIKVIV","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For those of you that are heavier and most particularly those who are curvy, chances are that you will find the recommendation doesn't accommodate you if stick with the suggestion stated on the size chart.  I thought that since this had the cut away area for the bra, that I wouldn't have to worry.  I noticed some other reviewers have stated that the straps are too thin for comfort (they are 1/2"" wide); I can definitely see how the straps would become uncomfortable after an hour or so of wear -please note they do have plenty of fabric to adjust to your torso but again if you are curvy it may still be uncomfortable.  Add to that it has a hook panel at the middle of your crotch and you must really be committed to showing off a more slender you.

"Wonderful blending of Spearmint and Peppermint along with a few other ingredients, this version has become one of my all time favorite teas.I typically have 40 different tea varieties in my home at any given time, I consider myself a connoisseur.  I often mix teas to come up with new taste options but the Moroccan Mint is better than my mixing of Traditional Medicinals Peppermint and Spearmint in my teapot.This is a moderate delivery, of course, the longer you steep the more intense the flavor.  It is a balanced flavor since the spearmint is the first ingredient.It is perfect for after meals since the benefits to digestion are an added bonus to a great flavor combination.  I like the pleasant mint after taste which lasts for several minutes.  This is definitely something you want to try if you enjoy mint tea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBVK20ZJBX8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QXYRGS#wasThisHelpful","RFBVK20ZJBX8N","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to live next to a cider mill, while this is tea, it is a delightful taste experience.  The hint of cinnamon really entertains the palette.  If you like apples, this is a great tea option especially during the cooler months when hot tea is preferred.I even drink this in the summer iced and enjoy it as well.  This is a tea worthy of trying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6L0OC5VQFC25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z4TDXQ#wasThisHelpful","R6L0OC5VQFC25","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ms. Jennifer Allee has done an outstanding job of presenting a family drama with a heart.  Monica will do just about anything to reconnect with her long lost daughter even when it means bodily harm and humiliation in front of millions.  Unfortunately, sparking a connection with Jess is as hard as creating fire without flint.  Allee does an outstanding job of keeping the reader wondering how Monica is going to win Jessica over after 20 years apart.We ride a roller coaster of emotions as Monica is given the opportunity to meet her estranged daughter on a show much like the popular reality show ""Survivor"".  Monica's initial reticence gives way to the hope of love conquering all; though once on the island she realizes that her daughter is all about the money.  What Monica doesn't expect is the rekindling of her long lost love with Jessica's father, Duncan when he unexpectedly shows up, and she is equally perplexed by the fact that the host makes his own play for her affections.  What a chaotic stew this chef finds herself in the midst of!  The reader can't help but want her to finally find her happiness because she has been denied for so many years.  As she considers her own self rejection and unconscious rejection of others, forgiveness becomes an option.  On the other hand, the reader can empathize with Jess, after all, she had a happy childhood with parents that didn't give her away...I loved reading this story, the author skillfully takes us for a 30 day adventure on a tropical island and makes the days fly by.  This is one of those stories that you don't want to end.  At times it is predictable but it has its surprises too.  It never dragged.  This is definitely a book to add to your pile, so what are you waiting for?  Put it in your cart already, before Amazon sells out!  Might want to pick up some extras to give to your friends in your book club, too?Note to the readers of my review, I do not profit in any way from writing this review.  I have had several close friends over the years deal issues relating to their birth mothers and some of the feelings they expressed are much like those exhibited by Jessica's character.  I liked the fact that this was a Christian book that wasn't in the least preachy.  It offers the matter of adoption instead of abortion as a loving choice made by a lovely young woman.  Its message was positive and inviting that would appeal to all ages and both genders.  I think this would make a nice addition to a church library as well since it is accessible to young readers 13 and up, just like the show Survivor appeals to all ages.It truly earned it's five star rating, if I could give it more stars I would.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HTBSXAIJHZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426768095#wasThisHelpful","R23HTBSXAIJHZC","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pads offer excellent area coverage.  They are very absorbent and I was surprised at the level of competence, when needed they delivered beyond what I would expect from most brands with the exception of perhaps ""Always""!No complaints that the typical user might have.  The backing is plastic which isn't exactly healthy but of course, there is no skin contact.  My research is limited but I have read that popular brands are treated with a lot of chemicals, I am not sure that these pads are not treated because all we know is that the cotton is organic.I would buy these again, although I do think the price is high for the quantity sold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDQEYKA62H6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DGH596#wasThisHelpful","R2LDQEYKA62H6O","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Walter Shaw worked for the phone company.  When the lineman was discovered to have some talent, he was promoted to engineering and got his degree.  The Bell system was so corrupt that it was able to stop him from getting any credit or financial reward for his incredible genius.  Many of the services we have taken for granted where actually created decades earlier by Mr. Shaw.  He became frustrated that he couldn't get recognition, he decided to go off on his own.  If you remember what happened to Tucker with the automotive industry then you can quickly see where this story heads.Word gets out about Shaw's brilliance, the mob keeps getting caught running numbers because their phones are tapped by the FBI.  Walter comes to their rescue inventing call-forwarding which makes the call untraceable at that time.Eventually, the Bell system prosecutes Shaw for using their phone line to test an invention,  Walter goes to prison for several years.  In the end, Bell continues to haunt his life in an attempt at thwarting his every creation.  He died a pauper.This excellent documentary highlights the key events of the telephone's history starting after World War II to the late 1990's after deregulation.  It is another revelation on the power of corporatism against the lone individual.  This is a documentary not to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IFQ3EJEAH0RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRX39O6#wasThisHelpful","R3IFQ3EJEAH0RL","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ms. Bailat-Jones is a gifted story teller.  Her writing is vivid and flowing.  Her protagonist's voice gives us insights into the culture of Japan and into the human spirit.Unlike many synopsis that publisher's offer to whet your appetite for a book that doesn't truly reflect the book's drama, this was by far the most accurate I've read, unfortunately it offers too many spoilers in my opinion.What I did love about this story is Alec's abiding love for his wife despite all the disappointing ways she neglects him.  You feel his anger and his bountiful forgiveness as though you are experiencing it as well.  Likewise, it is her deep despair at their impending parting that drives her to act in ways that are totally out of her character and her own expectations of herself. The role of storyteller, Azami adds balance to the emotional pull of the couple.I would recommend this to those who like drama genre.  This tale is a bittersweet journey juxtaposed against a typhoon that pounds the island.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HW56YFOAYNJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630150029#wasThisHelpful","R2HW56YFOAYNJ0","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a child of depression era parents, I have reused plastic bags for years, my favorite is Ziploc Freezer bags in their various sizes.  These bags are as good or better than Ziploc Freezer bags for reuse in several ways.The seal is super tight keeping air out that means the item remains fresh like it was when placed in the bag!  You get a much tighter seal than any Brand Name plastic bag.  When lunch time rolls around your sandwich that tastes like it was just made!  I buy special bread without preservatives and it drys out just sitting out after 30 minutes, but this keeps it fresh for more than a week, which is pretty exceptional.These are also thicker than anything currently on the market,  (I doubt Ziploc wants me reusing their bags but I find their brand is currently the thickest).  The downside is that its shape and thickness makes it a little more of a challenge to remove all air.  Also, it isn't as long as most freezer or storage quart size bags.  Thus, I have deducted one star.These are easy to clean with a soapy sponge.  Then just hang them upside down over a cup or plastic bottle to air dry or towel dry.  They are ready for the next day.A heads up on their appearance, the bags are not clear as shown, the plastic is opaque but you can still see what is inside.I recommend these for anyone looking to save the environment (every effort makes a difference) and a few bucks.  The downside is that these are a challenge to open and I have carpal tunnel and arthritis and it was a challenge to get open but I find that to be true with most bags be it potato chips or Ziploc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J44GOFUX8DCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LX4G1FK#wasThisHelpful","R1J44GOFUX8DCR","A1VOPP2OFITP7D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VOPP2OFITP7D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know this is a prequel novella and just an intro and not the full story of Fiona and Greg but honestly, after reading this, I think Greg and Fiona are my favorite book couple ever.  I am totally, 100% in love with Greg.  I feel like I want to go back and re-read all the Knitting in the City books and every single mention of Greg because I need more.  He is so perfect.  I really don't like the term swoon-worthy but I don't know how else to describe the feelings I get from Greg.  I love all the witty banter between these two, the debating and the arguments, the way they each hold their own values and opinions.  The chemistry between this couple is the best I have ever read - and I can't wait to get more of them!  I don't think I have ever been more excited for a book than I am for Happily Ever Ninja after reading this novella.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GDPO4NH20S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016XD4WRE#wasThisHelpful","R37GDPO4NH20S","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I loved all the characters - especially Leo and Cora and I can't wait for the next book in this series. I really loved this fast-paced and suspenseful book!

"This was such a good story!  When Calla's tuition check bounces, she's forced to return home to visit her estranged mother, the same mother who wiped out her bank account.  When she gets there, she finds out that her drug addict mom is actually on the run from a drug dealer she owes a bunch of money to.  With nowhere else to go for the summer because of a lack of money, she decides to stay in town and work at her moms bar.  Jax is the first person Calla meets when she enters the bar and they hit it off right away.  Jax wants Calla and doesn't seem to care that she has a scar running down the side of her face.  When the drug dealers that Calla's mom owes money to come looking for her, Calla is caught in their sights.This was really suspenseful and I honestly hated Calla's mom - no matter what she went through in the past she was an awful mother.  I loved Jax and how he brought out the best in Calla, showing her that she was beautiful and her scars do not define who she is.  He was incredibly sexy and so sweet with her.  Calla was a great heroine.  She has had a really rough life but she is strong and driven.  I loved the build up between Jax and Calla - even if it drove me crazy at times.  Although this is a 5 star book for me, there was something that bothered me but it was a minor complaint so I'm sticking with 5 stars on this one and adding it to my favorites list.  I can't wait to read more in this series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RFDENX18529S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G97XWBC#wasThisHelpful","R3RFDENX18529S","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chloe and Cage have been having sex for the last 2 years. Anytime Cage is in town, they hookup. When they are apart, Cage can't keep Chloe out of his mind and he wants more from her - a commitment and relationship. Chloe doesn't do relationships. She saw how much her mom was hurt and never wants to put herself in that position. Even if she loves her hookups with Cage - she isn't ready to give in to the one thing he wants from her - romance.This was a short, sweet and sexy story!

"Cherry and Taylor were high school sweethearts until Taylor enlisted in the army without telling Cherry and left her. Now Taylor is back in town and he's the new sheriff. When Cherry's apartment catches on fire things go from bad to worse when she gets a call right after letting her know her cousin and her husband died in a car accident leaving her their son, Sam. With a family that doesn't think Cherry is capable of raising Sam, her family promises to fight for custody and Taylor steps in faking an engagement with Cherry to give her more stability. Little does Taylor know, the little boy that he is helping Cherry protect is actually his son - he got Cherry pregnant before he left town and she gave the baby up for adoption to her cousin.There was so much drama in this story. Cherry has an awful family who seem to be more concerned with saying hurtful things to her than finding a way to help Sam through the death of his parents. I enjoyed this story, I liked the second-chance romance between Taylor and Cherry although I think Taylor should have had to grovel a little more for walking away from Cherry all those years ago.

She's turned him down repeatedly but when Allie's apartment catches on fire and her and her sister have nowhere else to go, she asks Ethan for help. Ethan is glad to help Allie and has her move into his home. He knows that they have some serious chemistry, if only Allie would give in. The shelter Allie runs is in danger of closing and Ethan volunteers to help her save it, but Ethan doesn't realize the very shelter she needs to save is the very business deal he's trying to win.

"This was such a sweet book! Told in 7 different POV's, each character has a connected story. I did not read the first book in this series but I read the second (and loved it) but I did not feel lost at all while reading this - it can totally be read as a standalone. Still, I would suggest What I really enjoyed about this book was that it wasn't something filled with a bunch of silly drama or couples breaking up. Most of the couples were already established but had things pop up in their relationships that they have to work through, I loved that this wasn't angsty, just a cute, sweet romance.

"Holly is a hard working single mom. She devotes her life to her son and hasn't had much time for herself. Dating, men and relationships are the furthest thing from her mind. She notices her co-worker Ray, how could she not with his handsome good looks, beautiful brown eyes and sweet personality, but she is overwhelmed with the long hours she works and just trying to get by. When Ray suggests they go in together on a lottery ticket, Holly is hesitant but agrees. When they hit the jackpot, neither of them are prepared for how much their life changes.I really loved this book! Ray is the sweetest guy! This was so much more than a story about two co-workers winning the lottery. Holly's life is complicated. Her ex is a controlling jerk and she had the strength to leave him but he still has control over her. Ray is dealing with the recent loss of his mom and trying to fulfill the promise he made to her before she died. I enjoyed the amount of steamy scenes in this book, especially for how short this story was. My only complaint is that I wish there would've been some Ray and Drew scenes (Holly's son.) I hope that maybe this author will turn this into a series - I would love to read Ray's brothers story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BA8OIDSZ0IXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPQHNHA#wasThisHelpful","R3BA8OIDSZ0IXN","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best books I have read this year.  I honestly couldn't put this down. This book evoked so many emotions in me from sadness, anger, hatred, despair, love and happiness. This book had me laughing when I least expected it and it had me crying like a baby. This is a book that I physically threw across the room at one point and ended up hugging it and crying at the end. Any book that can make me so invested in the characters that my husband has to remind me several times, ""Babe, you know this isn't real, right?? It's just a book."" deserves 5 stars. I can't go into specifics without spoiling the book but I will say that I loved each and every character in this story. There were times they made me mad or frustrated me but they were fantastic, complex, beautiful characters. This is one of those books that will stay with me forever. This is going on my favorites list and is a top book of 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI7URM5VMYNNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI1S8#wasThisHelpful","RI7URM5VMYNNT","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a sweet romance! Savannah comes back to her hometown after the death of her mother. She plans to take over her family legacy and run the Bed and Breakfast. She doesn't know that the B&B is actually in financial distress and Logan Park is working for a company to help take over the B&B. Logan was the best friend of her deceased boyfriend, Will. Savannah has always had feelings for Logan but didn't know he felt the same for her. After Will died, she spent time with Logan and they got closer but then he left without a goodbye. Now that he's back and Savannah is in town, they find out some feelings never go away.I really enjoyed this super sweet romance. I wasn't sure how I felt about Logan at first but really loved him by the end of the story. I loved the epilogue for this story - it left me with a huge smile on my face.

"Angelique is returning to work after beating breast cancer. While she was battling the disease, she catches her fiance and co-worker having sex with her secretary in her office. Her law firm gives her a case that should be an easy win for her to get her back to work and get her out of the office. They send her to Red River and if she wins the case, she could be destroying the whole town. Blake is Red Rivers town doctor. He's hired a lawyer to go up against Angelique to save his town. The more time Angelique spends in Red River, the more she gets to know the people and she has to really decide if she should take a chance and go with her heart, or should she put her career first.I'm going to start with my small complaints about this book first - it was a little slow at times and Angelique did drive me a bit crazy with her focus on her career. Other than those two small complaints, this book was really good. Angelique is such a strong woman - to overcome cancer, her fiance cheating on her, and her recovery. She struggled with her body image after having lost so much and having a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. Even though the subject matter was a little depressing, this author did a really great job of incorporating humor into this story. The panty-stealing dog was hilarious. Also, this book had some really hot sexy scenes. I loved Blake - he was such a great hero. This was a really good story and I look forward to reading more in this series and more by this author!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T3WOZNSYT6CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2G6JIM#wasThisHelpful","R2T3WOZNSYT6CE","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After Georgia's mom dies - she creates a list of ways to be brave. There are things she's always been afraid to do but decides it's time to start taking some chances. When her list leads her into situations she wasn't expecting, Georgia finds out how strong she is and how brave she really is.This was such an emotional YA story. There are so many issues addressed in this book from bullying, suicide, death and drugs. I knew this was an emotional book going into it, just from reading the description but I was really surprised by the way this author was able to address these issues and how real this book felt. Personally, I related to this book because when my own mom died, I had a hard time and didn't feel like myself for at least a year afterwards- it was the worst time of my life. I made some poor decisions, I struggled with who I was and I was an adult. For Georgie, loosing her mom as a teen, I wasn't surprised by some of the choices she made and the situations she put herself in. My heart hurt for her and I really just wanted to give her a hug. I loved the way this author brought this all together at the end. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who loves YA.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8LJQT2Q8GZHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1CO8M6#wasThisHelpful","R8LJQT2Q8GZHC","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He's a veteran who was injured in the line of duty. When he meets Natalie, he feels something for her that he's never felt before and he'll do anything he can to protect her.This is the first book I have read in this series and I absolutely loved it! Jake was so swoon-worthy. He was so patient and kind with Natalie, doing everything he could to keep her safe. The sexy scenes in this book were really hot.

She has spent years hating him because of how he treated her afterwards and to make matters worse, he doesn't even remember her. Alec has been back in Falcon ever since suffering a career ending injury and being betrayed by the people he trusted the most. He's hard and doesn't let people in but there's something about Lilliana that won't let him stay away.I loved this book. Alec is the towns building inspector and Lilliana is rehabbing her historic family home so she has to spend a little time with Alec when he comes for an inspection. What happens when he shows up and she's not expecting him is one of my favorite scenes in the book. I loved the chemistry with this couple.

"I've re-read this book more than ten times and it's just as good as the first time I read it.  This is one of my all-time favorites because it has everything I love in a good book - it has a sexy, sensitive, rock star hero, a funny heroine, lots of great supporting characters, a little angst and drama, and a lot of hot sexy time.  This book will forever be one of my favorites(my signed paperback of this book is one of my very favorite possessions) and I can't recommend this book (and this entire series) enough.

"I LOVED this book!  This book had two things that I normally hate in romance novels - #1. a second chance romance with a long separation  #2. flash back scenes.  Normally, those two things would ruin a book for me but the way this was written was brilliant.  This might be my favorite Kristen Ashley book ever.  I cried, I laughed, I swooned.  I hated Logan/High and then I fell in love with Logan.  Millie was fantastic, she gave up everything for the man she loved.  I wouldn't have made the same choices but it was easy to understand why she did what she did.  There was so much going on in this story -there was angst, drama, suspense, humor and amazingly hot sexy scenes.  This was just so good, I already want to go back and do a re-read.  This was my favorite of all the Chaos books and I highly recommend it - even if you don't like MC books - this is a great story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7MWJJ05OUT19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455533254#wasThisHelpful","R7MWJJ05OUT19","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Bella's sister and her husband die in a car crash, they leave behind two little boys that are going to need someone to take care of them.  Bella always promised her sister that she would  take care of her nephews but Noah also promised his best friend that if anything happened to him or his wife, he would take care of their boys.  This puts Noah and Bella in a position where they have to co-parent two little boys  who just lost their parents.  Noah and Bella haven't gotten along when they've been around each other in the past but when they start receiving letters, everything changes..This was a super emotional story that was really well written. I liked both Bella and Noah but my favorite thing about this story was the letters.  There were parts of this book that made me cry but there was also a lot of love in this story.

"Damian is an undercover agent for the US Marshals. While undercover, he shows up at a hotel managed by Tabitha, while trying to take down a drug ring. Tabitha is use to being attracted to bad boys but prefers bad boys with more of a conscience, unlike her ex-boyfriend who runs a drug ring and is forcing her to do things for him to keep her brother safe. Tabitha doesn't know Damian is really an undercover agent named Parker and Damian doesn't know that Tabitha is in a dangerous situation.I loved this book! One of my favorite things about a good romance is the chemistry between the main characters and I loved Parker and Tabitha's chemistry. The attraction between them was so strong. Parker is a bad ass but he was such a sweet guy. The suspense was fantastic and I really felt like this book mastered romantic suspense - there was enough of both romance and suspense that I couldn't put this book down. I have read all the books in the US Marshals series but I think this was my favorite because of how much I loved the hero Damian/Parker. This can be read as a standalone but I have really enjoyed all the books in this series so I suggest if you like this one, to read the others in this series as well. This author does a great job of writing interesting characters with great chemistry and suspense that will keep you turning the pages.

Cowboy is a sexy fireman, he can get any woman he wants and when the quiet librarian doesn't return his advances, she catches his interest.I am really torn on my review of this book.  I really loved this authors first book but this one missed the mark a little for me.  I liked the mystery and suspense in this story.  There were some twists and turns I didn't see coming.  I liked the witty one-liners and banter with some of the supporting characters.  I also really liked that we get to catch up a little with Jake and Emily from Rules of Protection - even though this was a standalone, it was nice to catch up with some of the characters from the previous book..  The issues I had with this book had more to do with the relationship between Cowboy and Anna. I really struggled with their relationship and it made the book slow for me, even with the suspense.

When a local mobster ends up murdered, Cassidy is chosen to go undercover at his strip club to find the killer and get herself a promotion.There were a couple things I really liked about this book.

She's good at her job and doesn't take any crap from the guys at work. I also really liked the suspense. There were a few twists and turns I didn't see coming. This was a fast-paced book that was full of suspense and mystery. There were a few minor things that I didn't like about this book, in particular I felt the romance was really lacking, not just because there were no steamy scenes but also because there was so much focus on the crime aspect, I didn't really feel a romantic connection.

It's more like she's not dealing with his death and is masking her pain. When her friend Zach (Spock) shows up at Wyatt's funeral, he is the only person that can help her through her grief.I really enjoyed this book. There were a few tears, a few laughs, a good amount of steam, a little angst and a lot of friendship. At first, I wasn't sure how I felt about Zoe but as the book went on, I really felt she was a brilliant character. Everything from the issues she was dealing with, her guilt over her brothers death and the way she was hiding herself made her a really complex character. I felt like she was a really strong heroine, even if it didn't seem like it at times. Zach was amazing and he was the perfect match for Zoe. Maybe it's just my own personal preference but I really appreciated that the way this author handled the separation between these characters.

He's never done casual relationships, he's protective and he's really good with Carlie's son Tyler. I absolutely loved the connection between Wes and Tyler from the first moment they meet and that was the exact moment I fell in love with Wes. Carlie was a fantastic heroine - she's been through so much in her life but she never feels sorry for herself. She just wants to keep her son safe.

"This was a fast-paced story, starting from the first page. Undercover cop Jake escapes from prison to try to clear his name. Lucy happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and get's pulled into Jake's problems. What starts out as a kidnapping, turns into more between Jake and Lucy. I really liked the romance between Jake and Lucy - Jake was a good guy even though he had to do some things he didn't want to. I also really liked the suspense in this story. Although I didn't feel like there was a lot of mystery, there was a lot of action.

"4.5 starsMason isn't good in social situations. He doesn't know how to talk to people and at times, he can be quite blunt. Camilla gets a job working for Mason so she can pay off her law school student loans. On her first day, Mason is attracted to his new employee and let's her know by bluntly asking her to have sex with him. Camilla really has her work cut out for her if she's going to teach Mason social skills.I really enjoyed this book. Mason displays a lot of the characteristics of Asperger's syndrome with his high intelligence and difficulty with social skills. He has a hard time with communicating how he feels but it's obvious he feels something for Camilla. I think this author did a good job writing Mason and his difficulty expressing himself properly. My only complaint about this book is that I thought Camilla was a little too hard on Mason at times and I didn't like a certain decision she made towards the end of the book. Plus, I would have liked a little more time with them as a couple and I really wanted an epilogue. This romance in this book was very sweet and there were quite a few sexy scenes. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone who likes a unique hero.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VF3E1NDW0U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WBFP92#wasThisHelpful","R36VF3E1NDW0U4","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first book I have ever read where the heroine is a grandma. Beth and Clint are both in their late forties and have been dancing around each other for a while. I wish I would've read more books in this series because I did feel a little lost at the beginning and I thought it started out a little slow but once this story got going - there was suspense and drama with some pretty hot sexy scenes.

When Drew finally returns to school, he's scared and not the same boy he was before. He has no friends and no confidence. Mia still sees the same boy she has crushed on for years and when they are assigned to the same class project and have to spend time together, they rekindle a friendship. They shouldn't be together but they can't fight the feelings they have for each other.I enjoyed this book but it was a lot more depressing and sad than I was expecting. My feelings were kind of torn on Drew at first but my heart just broke for him. I can't imagine having to live with the kind of guilt that he carried.

It's so hard to leave a review for this and say all the reasons I loved it because they are spoilers but I will say that I loved Sebastian, I loved Shea and I loved the supporting characters.

Cole was a great hero. I loved the banter between them and the amazing chemistry they had. They could've been enemies fighting for the same job but instead they became friends. This book made me laugh out loud with some of the witty and hilarious dialogue - not just between Cole and Pen but also the supporting characters.

"Darker the Release picks up right where Sweet the Sin left off. Caleb and Kelly are still keeping secrets from each other. Kelly is still keeping her identity a secret while looking for the proof of who killed her father and Caleb's involvement in the murder. Caleb is keeping secrets from Kelly, things he's afraid of her ever finding out and leaving him. The more time they spend together, the more real their feelings grow and someone is bound to get hurt when the truth comes out.I really loved this story! I am a sucker for revenge themed romances and this one totally hit the mark for me. Caleb and Kelly are both characters that are complex and I was torn about how I felt about them for most of the book. Some of the decisions they each made were questionable and at times were frustrating. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen and where this story was going to go. The sex scenes in this book were smoking hot and so good! Caleb and Kelly had a genuine connection and were very passionate together.

After a misunderstanding that has Neve running away, Rory knows one night wasn't enough with her and wants to spend more time with his pen pal.This story was a lot more complex than I was expecting. From the description, I thought this was going to be a light and fun story but it wasn't. Rory and Neve both have complex issues they're dealing with. I was really frustrated with Neve at times and didn't understand why she made some of the decisions she did. Rory was awesome - he was really funny and sweet. I loved the letters between the two of them and how they got to know each other before seeing each other. My only problems with this book is that there was so much going on with these characters, it was overwhelming at times. Also, I didn't like the way her past played out.

I am so embarrassed to say that when I first started reading this book, I actually had a hard time understanding the poverty that Kyland and Tenleigh live in.  I thought there was no way in this day and age that people actually live like that in the US.  Then I turned to google and looked up poverty in Appalachia and I cried for an hour.

She does everything that's asked of her. When she finds out she's failing calculus and needs help, she literally runs into Ben. Ben is super smart, he's third in their class, he works two jobs to help support himself and his single mom, and he's hoping to get scholarships for college because he can't afford to go without them. Ben is doing really well in calculus and offers to tutor Paige but in return he wants her to help him transform into the type of guy her best friend would notice. Paige's best friend Zoey is gorgeous and all the guys like her. Ben just wants her to notice him - to know that he is somebody. At least, that's what Ben thinks he wants.There was so much I LOVED about this book. The writing was fantastic, the story was fun but also interesting, the characters were awesome, and the romance was so sweet. I adored Ben and Paige.

"Wow! This book was amazing! Lucas Titan is a billionaire. He's also a huge jerk. He wants people to think that, he doesn't care. He's hard and focused on work. Yve Santos left an abusive marriage to a rich man and swears she will never date another rich guy. She doesn't ever want to depend on someone else, she wants to be totally self-sufficient and achieve her goals on her own. Yve can't fight the chemistry she and Titan have and when she needs someone to have her back, she sees a whole new side to Lucas Titan.This book blew me away. The writing was completely captivating. From the first page, I couldn't put this book down. It's told in dual POV which I think really added to the story. I loved being inside Lucas Titan's head. Yve was a kick-ass strong heroine who fought for what she wanted and was determined to make her own way and be her own success story. I love a strong heroine and Yve Santos was a very strong heroine. Her perfect match - Lucas Titan. He was amazing. The chemistry between these two characters was some of the best I've ever read. There was a twist I didn't see coming, great suspense, fantastic characters, and incredibly hot sexy time. This is a top book of 2015 for me and also going on my all time favorites list. There was not one thing I didn't love about this book!!! Highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB0I8K89XEX4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NAUJNE#wasThisHelpful","RB0I8K89XEX4P","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really sweet story about two people who are closed off and alone.  It's told almost entirely from Nathan's POV.  Nathan is kind of a loner, not letting anyone get close to him.  When he gets a new neighbor next door and smells her cooking, he strikes up conversation, gets a plate of food and they start up conversation all without even seeing each other.  I really enjoyed this story and how Nathan and Kourtney met.  There were a lot of things to like about this one, it was sweet and the second half had some really good sexy scenes.  Nathan was a good guy but had secrets.  Kourtney hasn't had an easy life and she has self-esteem issues.  She's short and curvy and was made fun of her whole life.  At times, her insecurities were frustrating and the story did drag on at times but overall I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35GTTHKJWC61P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01066TZLM#wasThisHelpful","R35GTTHKJWC61P","A3K4HYYXZFODU2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4HYYXZFODU2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 starsCain and Violet were childhood friends. Cain has been in love with Violet forever but put his feelings aside because his best friend was also in love with her. Cain felt like his friend would make Violet happy so he stepped away. Violet and Jeremy happy together until Jeremy died in the war. Years later, Cain is back in town and he's still in love with Violet but doesn't think he should be with her - she will always be his best friends girl. To fight his feelings, he pushes Violet away but he has a really hard time staying away from the girl he loves.I really enjoyed this story. There's something really special about this author's writing - she has this great way of adding humor to her books when you least expect it. A swearing bird - hilarious. This book is loaded with hot sexual tension - I couldn't wait for these to to finally get together. This is really steamy but it takes a little while to get there. I loved these characters and the storyline - a friends to more romance. My only complaint about this one is that Cain did annoy me with how much he pushed away.

"From start to finish this book had me hooked and I couldn't put it down. Holly and Kane are partners in a jewelry heist - they are undercover for the agency they work for. Kane and Holly have worked together before but they have different styles. Kane is a guy who likes to always follow the rules and goes by the book. Holly is more impulsive and goes with her instincts, which sometimes gets her in a little bit of trouble. When Holly and Kane have to pose as an engaged couple to get close to the necklace they need, they can't fight the attraction between them.This book was so good! Everything about this book was perfect - there's suspense, action, sexy times and mystery. The romance was really hot. Kane and Holly together had amazing chemistry and sexual tension.

"This was a sweet, sexy, and slightly angsty romance. I had a really hard time getting into this story but it eventually picked up and I did enjoy it. Declan is a sexy Irish musician who moves to Las Vegas to make some money to pay for something important to him. Melody is an intern for an editor and she is in Las Vegas, staying at her dads hotel while at a romance writers convention. She's been messing up at her job and has no confidence in herself because of her dyslexia. There were a couple positive things I liked about this book such as how hot the sexy scenes were but I also had a few small issues such as how long it took me to get into the story and I really didn't feel much connection to the characters.

"Love this product. Used it to clean up an old Toyota Motorhome engine and it didn't disappoint, although I had to change my oil every couple hours of operation as this product just sloughed off grime from my engine. Now the engine runs much smoother and a slight perceived increase in performance (I have no numbers) and mpg (~11.5 increased to ~13mpg). I was also have trouble with ethanol fuel ruining my lawn mowers carburetor. Started to run really rough and stall every 5 seconds or so during operation. Since using this product this summer the carburetor has really improved, still runs a little rough but it hardly ever stalls anymore. Those two experiences lead me to purchasing this 32oz size bottle. I put one in each one of our daily vehicles to be used when we fill up at the station.

"I like the product. The floss is comparable to the thickness of your normal string floss so it fits between teeth fairly easily. Most picks are either extra thick for more strength, or bordering on razor wire for a strong thin pick. So it really is a ""comfort"" floss in that it is easy on the gums. My only complaint about the product is that the quality has not been consistent. I have place three different orders of this product the first and the last one were great. The middle one was a much lower quality and the floss kept stretching a break during use. With the good quality pack I use one pick per flossing, but with the low quality one I was probably averaging 1.5 picks throughout the bag (some time I would have to use 2, and sometimes only 1).

"I don't use this stuff everyday, but I couldn't live without it during the following occasions: something is in bloom, working outside (e.g. weeding or mowing), or during excessive/thick mucus production. Do not use this during congestion or nasal cavity swelling as you will just put a bunch of water in your cavity that will increase you chances of a ear/nose infection. I use bottled water and microwave the water in the container for 30 seconds to get it at the perfect temperature. I would recommend starting at 10 seconds and increasing the time until you find out what is best for you and your microwave.I like buying these packs because it is the cheapest way to get the product, but I also get to use alternate bottles so I know that they sit dry for over 24 hours.

"Quercetin is a potent antioxidant and touted to be beneficial for many health issues, including cardiovascular health. This alone is a good reason to take such a supplement, however, it is difficult as an individual to test its effectiveness for one's heart. Others have reported improvements in such things as allergies and joint pain. Since I have been taking this product, I have not noticed any changes in my health, however, I do not feel that I can penalize it for the purposes of a one-month review. Since I, too, have problems with allergies and joint pain, and because of the excellent reputation of this brand, I have ordered a larger bottle of Jarrow Formulas Quercetin, so that I can give it what I consider a fair test.

"I really like how this thing is built--it is heavy, and seems very sturdy. I do not think it will rust or break easily. You'll need to hang it on a stout branch, and fortunately I had one low enough to hold it, because it would be fairly hard for me to lift it high by myself once it has five pounds of bird seed in it. It takes black sunflower seeds only, by the way. It's kind of messy filling the thing because as you pour the seeds down the top of the feeder, many of them escape through the holes. So do it outside, or be prepared to sweep up the excess. Attractive feeder, both to the birds and to the human eye. Looking forward to observing birds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282KHAMGZJ25F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HHQ2JY#wasThisHelpful","R282KHAMGZJ25F","A2DB720I9XRX7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DB720I9XRX7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I choose this book because I want to do some traveling and exploring in some of the most beautiful natural wilderness areas, including our national parks and forests. My experience is limited; I have only visited about eight out of the 58 total National Parks, and several of those were very cursory, so I am not knowledgeable enough to say how accurate this book is. In fact, a few of the 32 Parks featured and the additional 26 mentioned in the back section were mostly unknown to me. I found them all to be delightful in one way or another, and certainly worth knowing, so for this reason alone--to discover the Parks in print and pictures, this is book has great merit. The second service the book provides is to inspire one to get out and really take the time to get to know the National Parks. ""Secrets of the National Parks"" has inspired in me an even greater desire to get out and see and experience as much as I can. Last but not least, of course, is that the book is intended as a guide to some of our National Parks, and in particular, how to find places of beauty and even solitude that may be off the beaten path.  This summer I will begin to put this to the test.As I indicated, the subject matter is interesting, and I found the writing to be good and even engaging in many parts. Still it is not so quick to read as a novel, so I ended up spending longer than I had planned getting through the book.  The photography is top-notch, my only complaint is that I wanted more!  You can't expect that four to six photographs can do justice to represent parks that are tens of thousands of acres, so I often found myself on the internet looking for more images and maps.  Each of the featured parks is covered in a six to eight page chapter, including photos and maps. Within each chapter, there are numbered sections about each of the so-callled secrets--usually descriptons of the well-known, or must-see parts, along with some lesser known trails or sections and what they reveal. The numbers then correspond to points on the map, which hopefully will prove their utility once in the field.Rather than discuss all or even several of the Parks, I'd like to adress a few comments to the Theodore Roosevelt National Park (bbl)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HSC8JCCF91BP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426210159#wasThisHelpful","R1HSC8JCCF91BP","A2DB720I9XRX7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DB720I9XRX7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One of her gifts was the Tolo First Friends Tiger, and both tots love both the critters. My grandson immediately began turning all the articulated joints (including the tail, which spins all the way around!). He seems very happy with the little ratcheting noises that the head and arms and legs and tail make when you turn them. An added bonus: someone discovered that if you press the monkey down on his feet, it will make a cute squeak. My grandson played with the monkey and kissed it repeatedly at the party.

"Author and artist have done a good job in presenting a basic outline of Oprah Winfrey's life as a young child--where she came from, what her life was like, and what SHE was like. Oprah was barely even an afterthought in her mother's life, and she landed into the materially impoverished, yet strict and godfearing world of her maternal grandmother, Hattie May, whom Oprah called, ""Mama"". She had chores to do, and she learned them well, yet she made up her mind early on that she would not ""need"" to rely on hard manual labor in the future. She went to church with mama, where the young girl learned to recite scriptures and speak in front of the congregations. The other children made fun of her for this. But Oprah didn't care; she knew that when she grew up, she was going to be PAID to speak. Mama taught her to read before she ever went to school, and Oprah even wrote her teacher a note on her first day of kindergarten telling her teacher that she did not belong in that class. The teacher skipped her up to first grade, where Oprah finally found a friend. I wish the book had gone into a little more detail about this part of her life; it seems a bit abrupt and brief. It only gives the smallest hint, really of the first part of her life, and the rest of her life, I learned from reading online, was also interesting. Hopefully someone will write a longer biography for young children, as I think it is a story well worth telling, and that Oprah is an inspiring role model for all children--boy or girl, black or white.The illustrations are colorful prints from realistic acrylic paintings. I like how they fill every page from top to bottom and side to side. The words are printed over the illustrations in either black or white, depending on how dark the picture is.

"Paired with my excellent Logitech lighted keyboard, this thing puts my Note tablet at the perfect viewing height for me to sit comfortably at my dining table and type away every bit as easily as I can on my desktop, only I don't have to go upstairs to the loft office. Plus I get to do all the tablet-y things like taking pictures, and I can grab the tablet really quickly and stuff it in my purse as I head out the door. It is exactly what I needed and it has increased the utility of my Galaxy at least ten-fold.  Very pleased with this item. I as going to buy a folding easel to make it easier to type, and I probably still will just for travel, as this product does not fold up, but the height and angle are so superior to a plain easel and make for no stress or strain use, that I feel as if I have gotten a new computer in the house!

"I've been bitten by a bug. Suddenly I want to go camping, traveling, hiking--to be outside. I got the tent, and the other stuff. I got some good boots. I thought about getting some trekking poles for balance and to relieve strain from my joints, but, really, I don't know much about them, so I figured for now, I couldn't go wrong with this cool big stick. My Brazos stick came much faster than I thought it would, in fact, it came in time for me to take it on my first camp-out in Texas, which is cool, since Brazos are made in Texas, so it came from Texas to Oklahoma, and I took it back to Texas. Or something. Anyway, I am SO happy with my big Texas stick, and one thing I didn't realize is how handy it would be at night, because I've discovered that my balance isn't all that great when I can't see my feet. Who knew?  I ordered the 55"" one recommended for my height, and it seems right. The leather strap goes around my wrist, and I'm in business.

"These are my first ever hiking boots, so I'm not very experienced, but I did quite a bit of research, mainly online, before ordering these boots. My primary objective, with the limited amount of hiking I will be doing, is to protect my ankles, as my joints in general are wobbly and prone to dislocate, and I want to be safe on the trail.  The Vasque Breeze boots feel very sturdy, and, if a boot could keep me from injuring my ankles, these would do it. I actually prefer the freedom of just walking in shoes--as I said I am not used to hiking boots, so they seem a bit confining right now, but hopefully I will get used to then and be safer than I would if I hiked in lower shoes.  I like how they hold my feet in a very straight upright position, though, as my feet have a slight tendency to turn outward.I compared these Vasque boots to a pair of similiarly designed Merrells which I had ordered first. The Merrells are softer and a tiny bit lighter. I liked those a lot, but I  have a narrow foot and the Merrells, which only come in B width were just too baggy in the toe box for me, so I found these in the AA width, and ordered one half-size up, as recommended and they fit perfectly once I put them on with thick hiking socks.I think the Vasque boots look sharp and have a quality look from top to bottom, inside and out, even if they were made in China. (What isn't these days?).  Looking forward to many miles in my sturdy Vasque  boots.

"Note that this ""Playbook Farm"" is marketed for ages three and up, and, as such, is quite appropriate for pretend and interactive play for post-toddlers. Once you open the box, the red ribbon allows you to pull out the folded-up play book/mat. Taking the book from the front, you can open the pages thick cardboard pages to SIX complete pop-ups, with a simple story line that winds along a path. Each and every pop-up is delightful and well-executed, with animals or moving parts, but the story line is merely suggestive, in my opinion. With this pop-up, the play's the thing! Take the little card-stock figures of people, animals and vehicles out of the envelop in the front flap of the box cover; open the little stands on the bottom of them by pulling apart the two sides, spreading and folding them out; and let them dance along the path, making up words, sounds and songs!  There is also a very simple story printed along the backs of the pages, and this might actually be a good place to begin if you are reading it to a very small child to get them interested before they start to grab the pop-ups.I read this to my grandkids who are almost one and two and they were highly interested in it, as well as the little play pieces and the pop up details. I'll show it to them a few times in the next couple of years before I let them have to to sit and pretend play with together. I've never seen a book with pop-up pages that you can unfold into a large mat before (open carefully as you see which way to turn each page), so this is pretty neat! All the pop-ups from the story combine together to create the whole farm on the land (the mat). They are: 1. a house with a rooster on the top, 2.a large tree with a fenced in area for animals, 3. A horse standing in a wheat field. (I know, what?), 3. A windmill with a working fan, 4. a chicken coop--very cute, and 5.some pigs in their field under a tree.The paperboard play pieces include: a truck driven by a male, a red tractor driven by a female, a farmer standing with his pitchfork, a spotted cow, a spotted pig, a red rooster, a cute goat, a wooly sheep, and a border collie. The animals are wonderful, but they really NEED a bunny and a kitty! They are in the story, and it would add so much for the bunny to hop down the lane, and the kitty to meow and slink around. I think I shall have to make my own before I give it to the kids.Apparently this is the first in a series, as the back of the back states: ""Coming in September 2012: PLAYBOOK PIRATES!"" . Arg!

"This book is different from my other sketching and drawing books in at least two respects: its quality and its teaching. The quality of the book is evident in both the materials used: it is 260 heavy colored pages bound within a nice hardback format, with easily legible text and beautifully printed illustrations; and the writing is well organized and pleasing to read. The teaching concept behind the book could easily serve as a course of study for a semester long class with plenty of material to thoroughly cover the subject of urban drawing. It is not a slavish copy-this drawing type of method book, nor is it one that overly emphasizes drawing mechanics such as shading, perspective and techniques. At first I thought it was really too advanced for me, because I was thinking of something along the lines of an amateur drawing journal, which is becoming quite popular these days. There are plenty of good books along those lines, too. But after studying the book more closely, I found that this book, while certainly applicable to any professional artist, illustrator or designer; still has much to offer the serious hobbyist who wants to learn to make this style of street and urban landscape drawing.The idea behind the book is to show how aesthetically pleasing freehand drawings can be made in our modern world of highly accessible photojournalism, and, especially, computer generated types of creative work. That, in fact, the rise of this type of machine-aided art has given place for freer, more creative styles of rendering work. Author James Richards works almost exclusively in line drawings--both black pencil ones as well as black marker ones--with the addition of color from Ad Markers or Primsa Color Pencils and sometimes hard stick pastels. His drawings are often very detailed, yet have a quality of freedom and spontaneity and movement. Very classy work! He annotates everything, and advices his students to do likewise. You can find a list of suggested supplies near the front, and I've ordered a few of the black markers, as I already have Prisma colored pencils and good, thick Prisma Art markers. A sketchbook with flat, smooth paper will also be helpful. I'm sure my stuff won't look so professional, but I'm going to try out his tips. They are inviting. By the way, Mr. Richards has included several guest authors from various backgrounds with their words and artwork, so you do get that variety.As to book contents, there are three major parts, with one to four chapters each, and the chapters are further organized into smaller sections. PART ONE: LEARNING A LANGUAGE: Chapter 1: The Freehand Renaissance (Art and Technology, etc), Chapter 2: Nine Keys to Exploratory Drawing (Simplify Tools, Simplify Message, Work Small, Simplify Technique, etc.), Chapter 3. Elements and Entourage (People, Vehicles, Trees, Shrubs, etc), Chapter 4. Creating Believable Worlds (Perspective: what you really need to know, Creating Depth, Building up Color, etc), PART TWO: URBAN SKETCHING: Chapter 5: Urban Sketching as Creative Fuel, Chapter 6: Capturing the Place (Tools, Subject, Editing, etc); PART THREE: CONCEPT SKETCHING. Chapter 7: Capturing the Idea (Sketching over Digital Bases, Sketching over aerial Photographs, etc), Chapter 8: Digital Sketching--Drawing without Limits (The Vision, The Reality, Gallery, etc). Along with the two-page table of contents are thumbnail sketches to give the reader an idea of the contents.I like this book because it has a unity of concept and also a feel of a comprehensive whole. I don't think I'll be able to draw like James Richards, but I get what he's saying and it's very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQDNTIEBWDHZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118232100#wasThisHelpful","RQDNTIEBWDHZN","A2DB720I9XRX7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DB720I9XRX7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that this leather case is designed to fit the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, but, on the basis of another review here, I thought I could get it to fit my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. It does not fit. I checked and Samsung does make a different version of the same product for the Samsung Note, so if you have the Samsung Note, don't make the same mistake I did; look for the one that specifies ""Note"".As to the product itself, it appears to be a decent tablet case, especially if you are looking for something that will both protect your tablet, as well as provide an easy way to set your Galaxy up to view it at any angle. When you open the case, the left side has a series of five sets of grooves, with four grooves in each set. There is also a black stretchy band on the left side to use to secure the case over the tablet when closed. Sewn into the inside of the right side of the case is a four-pronged holder apparatus into which you can clip your case. (It is a little bit too small for the Note). I like the fact that the apparatus is made of a tough, yet flexible black plastic-type material. The right, tablet-side of the case swings forward and the bottom edge can be placed along any of the grooves giving you the choice of anywhere from nearly 90 degree upright viewing to a much lower slant--about 45 degrees. The interior has good static-friction to prevent the tablet from slipping once you adjust it to the desired angle. The left side of the case has an oval hole which will allow you to use the camera without removing the device from the case.

"This is my first experience using silicon bakewear, and it went pretty well. The product is lightweight, flexible, but sturdy. As a loaf pan it is longer and narrower than the traditional metal or glass loaf pan. The directions indicate that the pan is to be prepped by running hot water in it or washing it in the dishwasher and then coating it in butter before the first use. After that, no butter or coating is needed. We made a loaf of pumkin bread in it after doing the hot water and the butter, and it baked just fine, only bulging out somewhat in the middle because the silicon walls were too flexible to completely support the weight of the batter. Once finished, it popped right out of the pan, easy-peasy. No crumbs or mess, and the finished product was moist and tasty.

"The table comes folded up in a very small blue canvas pouch which features a carrying strap. I purchased it for car camping basically to hold the cookstove. It could be a bit larger for that in order to hold the stove and a couple of accessories.

"Subaru Forester + Sportz Dome tent = win at car camping. I spent a great deal of time deliberating which ""SUV tent"" to purchase, and finally decided that the Sportz by Napier brand looked like the best bet. They have several choices, and I finally decided to get the ""small one"" because I was planning some solo camping or trips with DH. Only after I ordered this one did I find the excellent company website sportzbynapier, where I found that their dome style is for ""hatchbacks and CUVs"", whereas the others are for SUVs. (except the truck ones, but that is obvious). So I guessed right.  Maybe knowing this will save someone the trouble of trying to decide.I just got the tent today, and had my son who has lots of tent camping experience, basically set it up for me for the first go round, so this is a preliminary report. Overall we decided that it is a very good tent, well thought out and with good features, extremely tall and plenty roomy. We wish that the company had waterproofed the tent, but at least they did include instructions for that, so don't forget to do it. It has an extra rain tarp that shuts the thing down quite tightly, but the windows of the tarp roll neatly back out of the way, so might as well set it up that way to begin with, then you will be prepared in case the weather turns bad. He set the thing up in a few minutes on the first try without instructions. I believe it will be challenging for me to do it alone, but the process is pretty straightforward.Car-to-tent camping is a great idea as I can sleep off the ground on my new perfectly fitting Coleman SUV mattress; and I can stow all my gear in the tent and have it out of my way, but close to me at the same time. I'll have plenty of room to hang out or do whatever in my tent, and, if you have a group, you'll have room to sleep four in it nicely, too. It is over seven feet tall, but you can see that it is designed that way because it stands next to your car with it's wide open hatch and the connector sleeve has to go up high over it. It cinches nicely around the car for a good fit. After we got it set up, we dragged the tent over to my son's big family SUV--a Nissan Pathfinder--to see if it would also fit there. It didn't. So if you have a ""real"" SUV, get the other style by Sportz. The Dome works well for Subarus and other crossovers and hatchbacks.

"I got this for my grandson when he was maybe six months old as an oral stimulation alternative for him. He was the type of kiddo who always wanted to mouth and chew on things. It worked pretty well. Now he is 19 months old, and his mom and dad use it to brush his teeth. He looks forward to having his teeth brushed with it, I found out when I babysat him tonight. Granted, it does not look all that much like a toothbrush, but HE knows EXACTLY what it is.

"When I could not find Nizoral shampoo in the stores, I searched for it on line, but it was SO expensive that I decided to give Regenpure, since it also contains ketoconazol and is MUCH less expensive. I'm glad I did. I am 100% satisfied with this shampoo. My head and hair feel wonderfully clean and fresh, without being overly dry. My hair comes out soft and shiny, yet my normally oily, itchy scalp is really clean. That oiliness contributes to the overgrowth of a type of yeast that feeds on lipids, I have learned, and has caused a decades long problem with itchy, burning, painful sores on my scalp. Tar shampoos, selsun blue, and other shampoos have had only limited success.

When I was visiting the other day, my son made me some green tea in the pot, and it worked nicely. The ""flower"" is basically made by taking a bunch of whole tea leaves and weaving them or fastening them together with cotton string in the center, so that when the dried leaves soak up the hot water, they expand outward in a flower-like effect.

"I gave this to my granddaughter a few days ago, and her eyes lit up as I showed it to her and told her about her new (first) dolly. It is a small doll, very good size for a newborn, and it is perfect for my little granddaughter to cuddle. The velour fabric is even softer to the touch than I expected, and the doll is stuffed to the consistancy of a very soft pillow, yet not floppy. My granddaughter clutches her dolly every night now whenever she goes to bed. I checked it over carefully before giving it to her, and everything is stitched nice and neat. I am pleased with the quality of the item, and I do believe it will hold up well to repeated play and washings.

"I got this book because I really love horses, and reading them is as close as I'll ever come to knowing what it is like to own one. Two good things about the book are that it is short, and the narrative flows nicely.  Susan Richards went from a miserable childhood living with her grandmother to a horrible marriage to an abusive, alcoholic man whom she did not really take the time to get to know well enough before jumping into matrimony. On top of that, she had ""saddled"" herself with alcoholism. I can't personally relate to this. It's hard for me to understand why someone would get so mired in self-abuse of that sort; maybe if you have been or are an alcoholic, it will speak to you.Anyway, she was fortunate in the fact that her grandmother, much to Ms. Richards surprise, left her a large fortune when she died, and with that she was able to buy a wonderful property in the adorondacks, complete with horses, etc. But she went looking for ""the one"" horse that truly spoke to her spirit. I can believe that; I've had my own heart animals at times, and I think horses and humans connect on a very deep level. She was searching for a special Morgan horse and she found Georgia. Georgia was a green, but quite strong-willed young mare. Perhaps training her, riding her, loving her gave Susan the will and strength to finally get rid of her abuser and also the alcohol abuse. I did not like that she did not take the horse with her when she left him; apparently she had to get away, and it was not possible to bring Georgia with her. Getting the horse back proved to be extremely costly and time consuming because of her ex's vindictive ways.Altogether the book was not bad, but I didn't like hearing about her disastrous personal life so much as I did reading about her relationship with Georgia. For example, the parts where Susan nursed Georgia back to health were quite moving to me. The author really did a good job of capturing the spirit of this magnificent, though at times headstrong horse, and her writing style is clear and enjoyable.  She really did come through some hard times and overcome a lot, but I feel there is a certain over focus on herself and her hard times, and I would have preferred to hear more about the horse and their relationship.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7D90YHZF9BDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547241720#wasThisHelpful","R7D90YHZF9BDN","A2DB720I9XRX7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DB720I9XRX7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this chair better than I thought I would. It actually looks pretty good--at least the fluffy top part, which resembles a down coat in texture. It's pretty comfortable to sink down into--just don't expect any lumbar support. I did not have any trouble opening it and getting it set up, and re-folding wasn't too hard, either, except you have to be sure to wrap the velro strap part around the TOP, puffy part, or it won't work. Once I got that straight, it was AOK. BTW, it all fits inside a clear, plastic, zippered case. The case has two handles, and it is possible to hike it up on your back and put one handle over each shoulder. I wouldn't carry a long way to a picnic or something; it's a bit hefty for me. I plan to store it in my garage and get it out if I need extra seating for entertaining either inside my house or out on the patio.

"This is the basic model of the Oral-B electric toothbrush, so it only has one speed, but really that's all you need. I have an earlier version of the ""Oral B Professional Care"" toothbrush from a few years ago, and it still works. It looks a little different style-wise, but the performance is identical. It was also made by the Braun company in Germany, and therefore I trust the quality and expect it to last.As I said, it runs at one speed, but, in addition, it has a tricky little timer thing that helps the user brush for the recommended two minutes. You start brushing wherever you like, then concentrate on just that particular quadrant. Each thirty seconds the motor makes a slight hesitency sound which cues you to move to the next quadrant. After two minutes it makes a longer hesitency sound, and you are finished.Besides the handle, you get one brush head and a stand that has an attachable unit for storing up to four brushes. I like how that is designed and that it has a cover to protect the brushes. The included brush is compact and round and does a great job getting into tight corners and getting teeth clean all over. The included brouchure depicts four other specialized heads that you can buy if you prefer. I plan to order a set of four basic brushes from amazon.I definitely can recommend this Oral-B electric toothbrush by Braun based on both my prior experience with the brand as well as my testing of the current model. At the current price of about $50, with an additional $20 rebate it is an absolute bargain. It carries a two year limited warranty, but will probably last several years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QJMV2Z2JGDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PEMBNC#wasThisHelpful","R38QJMV2Z2JGDE","A2DB720I9XRX7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DB720I9XRX7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoy reading memoirs of people from all sorts of backgrounds, and, esp with disabilities. This book about a seriously disabled boy was quite well written and gave me a lot to think about. The author, Ian Brown,  is a Canadian journalist, and one thing that it made me think about is that the services for profoundly ill or disabled people in Canada are in many ways seriously lacking. Another thing I think is that I am glad that he wrote this book so that people who have not had experience with disabilities of this sort can get a really good, up close look at what it is really like. I glad for this and for every other book that opens up this world to the ""rest of us"". On the other hand, it is also useful for those who are traveling down a hard road with a handicapped family member, so that they can see there are others out there, and that they are not alone. For example, after the family was finally able to get a placement for their son, Walker, Mr. Brown, took a journey to find other families who had children with the same syndrome in Canada, the US, etc. I read quite a bit about that on the internet after reading this book, and it was pretty interesting. Sorry, it has been a while since I read this book, so I'm not going into a lot of detail, but I did read it (mine was an advance reader's copy) immediately and mostly all at once.

"This book made quite an impression on me; I read it several weeks ago, and so I may not get as many details down here as I would like to at first. The most salient part of this book to me was the story of the author's mother got cancer and died a slow, horrorific, tragic death. This was a middle class (probably upper middle class) family where the father became a practitioner in the Christian Science Church, meaning that he had the job of praying for people so that they would get well instead of going to doctors. They take a very literal view that the physical world is not real and that illness or any other ""bad"" thing is merely illusion because we are all ""god's perfect children"", and if you can just get your thinking straight, you will get well.  The father in the story was a very literal, I guess you could say faithful follower of the CS faith, and because of that he had very much influence over the family and how they did things. I was very saddened by what happened to the mother. One of the reasons this affects me so deeply is because I believe that the patient's narrative is vital in medicine and in understanding what is wrong and what is needed for them. To ignore the patient's naerrative, the person's story of what they feel, what they suffer, is to deny their reality, and therefore tantamount to denying the person as a person. I have a lot to say about this subject, but for now, I just want to say that this book was very vivid and maybe too traumatizing for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GTYM6MQ6RSXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307720926#wasThisHelpful","R3GTYM6MQ6RSXS","A2DB720I9XRX7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DB720I9XRX7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Sullivan has written quite a books for young people, including numerous historical biographies. This one is the story of Charlie Stratton, born in 1838 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, who received the stage name of General Tom Thumb from PT Barnum. Charlie was a cheerful, even rambunctious little boy who enjoyed amusing his parents and the guests of the inn that they ran in that coastal town. His parents only concern for the boy was that he stopped growing as an infant; in every other way he was perfectly normal. When Mr. Barnum discovered the lad while visiting the inn, he was completely captivated by him and was sure that Charlie would have a good life and be a big hit in Mr. Barnum's entertainment business. Eventually he prevailed upon the parents to allow him to take Charlie, now Tom Thumb on this adventure which became his live.I found this book to be quite readable and also enjoyed the photographs and illustrations. There were pictures of his town, of him dressed in various costumes, of adverts, maps, and much more. A longer section was devoted to his famous wedding to Lavina Warren. The book tells about Lavina's life, and also many other people who Charlie met and worked with along the way. The author's portrayal of PT Barnum, his successes, his challenges, and his hoaxes was honest yet sympathetic. Barnum promoted and even exploited Tom, but Tom also led a good life, got to travel around the world, meet kings, queens and others, and he became immensely rich in the process.This book would appeal to many readers ages 10 and up who like to read about history, biography or just like to learn something new. The book immerses the reader in a world that is often exotic, and always interesting.

I really got a sense of the culture he was raised in and of his family, with all their strengths and flaws. I like reading all sorts of memoirs of people whose lives were different from my own, and getting a sense of the variety of experiences that people can have in this world. Lemelman's pencil drawings added much to the enjoyment of the book. I liked it so much that I also ordered and read an earlier memoir that he wrote called ""Mendel's Daughter"", which is a wonderful and sympathetic story of his mother.

"I wouldn't call these undies ""boxers"" really, because they really don't have much of a leg part at all. They are, rather, square-shaped panties.

"I bought these for my year-old grandson to use when he is eating at my house. He has another brand at home, also with the metal spoon/fork ends and built up plastic handles, but I think these OXO ones are superior. They have a nice weight and balance, and the handles are longer and the build up helps tiny hands grasp them, but the curved aspect also makes them quite ergonomic. The spoon and fork are not just stamped out of metal, but they have a nicely curved surface. I like how the fork is curved similarly to the spoon. I will say that they seem just a little bit large for a 12 month old, but he will definitely be able to use them for two years as he grows.

" 0:52 MinsI gave this to my grandson for his first birthday, and he has shown a great interest in it, and is already mastering it, although he has had it only a few days. My son sent me a clip from his iphone of him doing the shapes, so I am attaching it. He has another shape sorter, but this one is better. It is very solidly built and has no sharp edges. Each piece has a rattle inside that makes a different sound from the others. Each shape is also a different color and is color-coded with the shape-hole. This is a toy that is fun, educational and will last.

"I was doing google searches on my old doctors who treated me in 70's, 80's and beyond, including Matthew Budd, and here, to my surprise I find that he has written a book about ""Ways to Wellness"", the same program I was in with him in the early 80's. I was a patient of three different primary care doctors at Harvard Community Health Plan, Cambridge Center, in the 80's, including, last but not least, Matthew Budd. With each new doctor, I had hoped that one would take me seriously and find an answer to my health problems and be able to treat my illnesses, but my hopes were dashed.Now, after decades of illness I have discovered that I have an inborn immunodeficiency that was causing me to repeatedly come down with infections, and I was also diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erthymatosis a few years ago. Back then Dr. Budd, like many others, tried to convince me that my problems were really about stress, anger, or other emotional states, so that if I could just get a handle on these emotional problems I would become healthy. I followed all the steps in the workshop and did all the journaling and homework and I made a remarkable discovery. But not what Dr. Budd had in mind. Instead of finding that emotional states led me to physical illness, I found a strong correlation between getting physically overtired and getting sick. Actually with a little introspection, I should have realized this, but with the Ways to Wellness, I had veritable proof. I was never able to work more than half time, and I had to be very careful with my energy, or I would get sick. I had constant sinus infections, among other things. Dr. Budd was not at all supporting of my finding. Though it was very long ago, I will never forget his reaction. He did not believe me. I did the program, but it didn't work the way he wanted it to, so he just discounted my experience.No, it was not ""what I said"" that made me sick; it was my body and the crap shoot of genetics that I was dealt. Looking back on my life at 57 years old, I wonder how it would have been if ""smart Harvard doctors"" like Matthew Budd had believed me and tried to solve the physical problems I had, and had gotten me treatment for my immune deficiency and my lupus. It has long been the attitude of doctors, when they have difficult cases to blame the patient for their problems I hope that is beginning to change with the narrative medicine movement, for example. Just look at the title of this book ""YOU are what YOU say""--points the blame right at YOU. I once asked Dr. Budd if I could read my patient records. He became very nervous and asked ""why you you want to read them?"" I don't know, it's about me, so I thought I should know what it said. Among the demeaning statements I read this one by Budd, ""Difficult patient from Dr. Miller."" It's been a long road to find doctors who were willing to solve the difficult problems instead of blaming me, but one thing I have learned from this as a medical consumer is: Check your records, for that is how you can find out how your doctor views you.Now I am reading books like Rita Charon's ""Narrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Illness"". I am reading a lot about the Medical Humanities programs that teach doctors to listen to their patients and understand their health issues. I am writing poetry about my experiences and getting it published so other people will understand. I am working on Disability Studies.I am sorry that this is not strictly a ""book review"", but I want to put my story out to you because if it helps someone get the help they need, it will be worthwhile. I get a lot of books to review, both on my own and from the vine, and always make it a point to READ them through, but in this case, I believe this is mostly, as a reviewer of another edition of this book said, ""psycho babble"".

"These pineapple chunks are quite tasty--sweet and flavorful in their own juice. I think it is a fair price, too. I like having a stock of these small cans because they are the right size for me to use by myself for two servings. The cans have pop-tops, so they are a good portable snack. Doubtless many people would find them to be the right size for a single serving, but for me, they are just a bit too big for that.

"I like these Herring Fillets a lot, and also the ones in mustard sauce. They are less salty and more tasty than kippered snacks. They are soft and easy to eat and the sauce is tasty. I think it would be nice if there was more fish in there and less sauce, but I end up eating all of the sauce, too. I disagree with the reviewer who said that one tin of these would serve three people. There are only six ounces in the tin and that's including the sauce, just enough for a single portion. I like to keep some in my car along with some Wasa and other healthy snacks because I hate fast food. Great source of tasty protein. But after I ordered the case for about $2 each, I found out that [big name] store carries them for $1.38 each.

"I got the bronze ones (from a different source, though, and it goes with a lot of different outfits, especially ones with a little metallic embroidery or metallic accents. One of the things that convinced me to purchase these shoes was the fact that the footed is made of latex (under the soft suede sole), which is in my opinion THE most comfortable substance. I have latex pillows and a latex mattress (very expensive) and they are way better than memory foam or any other material. Most of my shoes, especially my summer sandals are Birkenstocks, and these shoes are every bit as comfortable as any other them, including my soft foot bed Birks, and they are far more comfortable than Danksos, which, to me are actually hard.I have a narrow foot, and I wish this brand made at least a few of their shoe styles in narrow. When I saw these sandals with the two Velcro adjustable straps, I thought I'd chance it, and I am glad I did because they adjust to fit me very nicely.The material that the uppers are made from is definitely shiny and the square jewel-like adornment on the toe strap gives the sandal a unique pizzazz. The stitching around the outer part of the sole is a shiny gold color and it is visible when wearing it (it outlines your foot). Amazingly comfortable walking or just standing in them and a dress-up or down versatility make these Alegria sandals a good addition to my summer shoe wardrobe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9AZSVDNLWNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LY7ST2#wasThisHelpful","RI9AZSVDNLWNN","A2DB720I9XRX7K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DB720I9XRX7K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have been drooling over them, have downloaded a fermenting cookbook, and am raring to get started (as we say in Texas). I'm not walking well right now due to leg surgery, but as soon as I'm functional again I'll be using the heck out of this product. Do you know you can make your own yogurt, buttermilk, low-fat sour cream, fermented salsa, fermented cabbage (sauerkraut), fermented lettuce if you like milder sauerkraut, fermented carrots, and the list goes on. What's most important is that as these are high-acid foods you can use a boiling water bath to can them instead of having to use a pressure canner.

My stepdaughter will be particularly interested in it, as she and her husband like to camp out, and they have four small children.

The surgeon had to remove the metal entirely and put in a ""concrete"" which amounted to plastic spacer impregnated with antibiotics. The pain referred all over the place, including my back, where it manifested as severe heat. A helpful CNA made me an ice pack, which was great until I moved and was instantly drenched with ice water. Then I remembered the disposable blue ice pack the hospital gave us one time when one of us sprained something or other. We had been using it ever since, but the problem was we had only one, and we needed more so I would have one to use when the other was refreezing. Rush to Amazon! Yep, they had it. Now I have it.

You can prepare ahead of time when you know everybody in the family will want to eat at a different time from everybody else, or when a major project such as moving gobbles up mealtime.

"I was given one of these in return for an honest review. This is a dashboard cam for individual usage. Although we usually think of dashboard cams only in relation to law enforcement, in at least one case a dashboard cam already has been used to halt a lawsuit brought by a scammer who deliberately swung his car into the path of another car, causing the other car to ram it. The sammer sued for a large sum of money, but the dashboard camera saved the day and caused the scammer to be sentenced to a large fine and payment of his intended victim's court costs. As soon as I read about that, I decided to get my husband a dashboard cam if I could afford one. (I don't drive anymore.) DBPower came to the rescue, and my husband now has a dashboard cam which will protect him from nuisance lawsuits and questions such as ""Didn't you see that red light?""

"I was provided a free copy of this book in return for an honest review--and what, you may ask, does a Utah Mormon do with a book about small distilleries in New York State? Well, I happen to be a writer, and I am already considering how to work some of this information into some of my novels. To sum up quickly, changes in the law allow New York residents to go commercial with spirits in much smaller quantities than was previously required, and to treat them as farm produce rather than as alcoholic beverages. The result has to be an extremely varied crop of beverages, many of which sounded interesting. The only thing that concerns me--and this is a concern with the liquor rather than with the book--is that absinthe is being produced. Absinthe is well known to seriously damage the brain when taken in even moderate amounts, and I would hate to see the Paris experience with absinthe repeated in New York. France long since outlawed absinthe entirely, and its major ingredient, wormwood, was declared unfit for human consumption. But the book itself is interesting, and if you use alcoholic beverages, and live in or intend to visit New York, you are likely to have a use for this information.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6XLTKF46F07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1634432614#wasThisHelpful","RS6XLTKF46F07","A2WW9T8EEI8NU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WW9T8EEI8NU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a complimentary sample of this product for my honest and unbiased feedback. Magnesium is essential to normal body functions. It should be taken in the proper ratio to calcium; use any nutrition site to find this proportion. Most people are unaware of this necessity and become severely low on magnesium. I am very aware of the problem, because I am bipolar and I know that I function better with magnesium. But even people with no mental problems whatever are likely to become depressed or unreasonably angry if their magnesium level is low, and few foods provide adequate magnesium. So I was delighted when Viva Labs asked me to evaluate this. I found that it provides adequate magnesium for my life, if taken in the proper dosage, and I used it until I ran out.

"You may not be interested in this. I am. Even if you are not interested, I recommend you at least read up on the uses of garlic. You will find that some of these natural remedies attack viruses, which no pharmaceuticals do adequately except in very few cases, and in those cases they are hideously expensive. I know man who had AIDS who went to HIV negative and has stayed that way; his doctor says he will continue to do so as long as he stays on his meds--which cost him over $200 a day! And that is one of the very few viruses that can be treated pharmaceutically. I have used natural antibiotics for many years, and I intend to continue to do so. This does not mean I reject pharmaceuticals; I do not, especially since recent treatment saved my life. I was literally dying when I entered the hospital on a stretcher. But all the same, natural remedies can help with many conditions. My doctor and I have an agreement: if the stuff is known to be harmless I take it; otherwise, I ask her first. She rarely says no. Try this . . . oh, by the way, I started using natural remedies when I was eight years old, when my father came home to tell my mother that onions were known to help prevent colds and keep them lighter when people did catch them.

"I was given this sleep mask in return for an honest review. As that is the only kind of review I ever leave, I had no problem in complying.I found this sleep mask excellent. At the moment I am in a skilled nursing facility where I went after being released from the hospital. I will go home next week, but at present my sleep is frequently disturbed by people wanting to take my blood pressure, and do other things that require turning on the light. It is a scientific fact that people do not sleep well if even a small amount of light shines in their eyes. I ask everybody when they are through with whatever they are doing to turn off all the lights including the bathroom light, and to close the hall door. But they often forget, and the bathroom light is especially annoying because it reflects off a metal plate attached to the wall and shines straight into my eyes. But when this sleep mask arrived, it cut out all the light. I can almost sleep through a blood pressure test as long as I keep this mask on, and if I am wakened and do not have light in my eyes I can go right back to sleep. Another feature I like about this sleep mask is that it has two straps,not one, to keep it on. Some years ago I bought several sleep masks that has only one strap and I wound up having to hand-repair all the straps where they attached to the mask. I do not expect to have this problem with this sleep mask.I am very pleased with it and intend to buy more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K61CDXFCETCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014X4D1WW#wasThisHelpful","R3K61CDXFCETCQ","A2WW9T8EEI8NU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WW9T8EEI8NU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He told us once that he believed that his son was more intelligent than he was, and if he had a way to look inside his son's mind he would learn a lot. Trispero is the novel that if he were still alive I would give to him at once. It looks at Down's syndrome in a way no other author has ever done. if you read this book you will understand far more about why parents of such a child usually cherish the child.

Our friend had a Ph.D. in military history and was well known for his tactics. Several weeks before his death, his son, frustrated by his mother's refusal to let him take a long walk in the neighborhood alone, lured his mother into the garden shed and then stepped out and locked the door. After his walk, he went and released his mother, who had steam coming out he ears. But I was mainly impressed that this young man, supposedly mentally retarded, took after his brilliant father in creating tactics that worked.

Starting with ""the big bang is a hoax"" and proceeding to prove that important scientific discoveries cannot be made in a dishonest society: As our present society is dishonest, most of the scientific theories and proofs that have been presented in at least the last seventy years are incorrect, untrue,, and often contain lies about statistics and experiments.Everybody is out of step but me.I'm going to put this book on my shelves right beside the one in which Velikovsky proved that two planets in our solar system collided with each other within human history.

" 0:51 Mins I am happy to present to you the easiest-to-use, easiest-to-clean chopper I've ever encountered.  The Black & Decker engineers hit a home run with this little baby.  Let me tell you why (then watch the video to see how easy and effective it is to operate).1)  Ease of use.  No weird twisty tops or latchy lids need to be engaged to get it to operate.  Simply put the blade shaft onto a spindle in the bowl, rest the motor on top, hold it in place, and chop away.  ""Ergo"" Chopper, indeed.2)  Everything (save the motor, of course) is dishwasher safe.  Makes for convenient clean up.  Wipe the motor down with a damp paper towel and you're done.3)  Safety.  I tried to get this thing to misfire and turn on when not closed.  With reasonable efforts (short of sticking a screwdriver into every hole), I couldn't.  It will be safe enough for responsible kids to use.4)  It's got good guts.  We've chopped any number of vegetables with this unit and it's always been up to the task.This product is very deserving of its 5-star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I47RAZKK32TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDVJHZK#wasThisHelpful","R2I47RAZKK32TU","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a lot to like about this little powerhouse.  Since I received this product as a member of Amazon's Vine program, I felt compelled to put it through it's paces, so to speak.  Out of the box, I had the Bluetooth-compatible speaker paired with my phone and playing music in about 2 minutes.  It's very easy to set up and comes with clear instructions.Your first question probably is, ""Does it actually float?""  Answer:  YES!  You just have to be absolutely certain you've got the rubber stoppers fully engaged in the back to keep water from damaging the access ports.  The instructions recommend you not submerge the speaker but you can be confident that a little washover and splashes won't cause any problems.I've been showering with this baby for a month without a hitch.  The easy-to-install rubber strap works well simply draped over my shower head.  It lasts about 2 weeks worth of on a single charge, which will vary totally based on your shower length experience...  ;-)  A helpful red light starts to notify you when the battery is getting low.  You'll have about 30 minutes of listening time before it completely konks out, during which time you may notice a slight decrease in volume but no degredation of sound quality.So, how is the sound?  Very CLEAR.  Crisp highs, and powerful mids.  While it makes a valiant effort, it doesn't have enough housing to make pool-shaking bass, so don't expect that it's like having a Bose Acoustawave equivalent in the bathtub with you.  There are a few separate EQ settings, all of which augment the mids (making the sound tinny, like an old AM radio), so my favorite EQ setting is ""Flat"".  The only reason this unit doesn't get a 5-star rating is because I believe at its current price point (over $100) I would expect more robust bass.  They've engineered this speaker so that your can turn it to max volume without notable distortion, which is nice.  In an outdoor setting, you'll be able to hear the music clearly at a radius of 20 feet or so, thus no need to worry about overpowering the neighborhood.Charging takes between 8 - 12 hours.  The unit comes supplied with a mini-USB cable that can be easily replaced if you lose it, so no worries.Weighing in at just a couple of pounds, the applications for this speaker are nearly endless.  Outdoors in any weather, on a boat, IN the pool, IN the shower, at the end of the picnic table, heavens, even in the car or carrying your NYNE around the house, you'll never have a reason for the tunes to stop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PIGZQPA18EO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NH1AFFY#wasThisHelpful","R4PIGZQPA18EO","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best way I can think to describe SET DICE is to say it's a cross between Scrabble Classic Crossword New Game and Qwirkle Board Game, combining Scrabble's scoring grid and Qwirkle's rummy-like matching of shapes and colors.  It's fast and fun... if you can even get started.Once you understand the instructions, just about anyone over the age of six can enjoy this game.  The written instructions are a mind-boggling exercise in over-complication.  The concepts are, in fact, simple:  Create sets of three dice that meet certain criteria, i.e.: all different colors, numbers, etc..., then line them up like a crossword puzzle.  The instructions are about 10 panels explaining every possible iteration and variation (plus 2 full-on variations of the game for a nice variety).  The game rules are not difficult to explain (verbally) by someone who understands the game, thus you can play this with your friends without difficulty.  The initial start-up might be off-putting to some.  My kids were intuitively playing the game even before I'd finished trying to digest the instructions, which gives me hope for the future.Hang in there on your first read-through (or two) of the instructions and you'll be rewarded with a fun family-friendly game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBJ5S3KFZZH9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O59C9WY#wasThisHelpful","RBJ5S3KFZZH9E","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit of a geography geek and was hoping this set would spark more curiosity in some kids I know, but there are so many problems with this set that it's being avoided by both the kids AND the adults.  Any way you slice it, this is a cheap (in every sense of the word) alternative to T.S. Shure Wooden Magnetic Map of the USA Puzzle.  If you want a more enjoyable experience (that will last longer, provide better play, lose less pieces, have a decent carrying case, etc...) save up a few more bucks and get the wooden version.  The shortcomings of this set make it worth avoiding at any cost.The carrying case is a flimsy plastic and paper combo.  It's not destined to last, even with ""kid glove"" treatment.  The backboard is a flimsy piece of what feels like posterboard that's got a magnetic coating.  The state pieces stick unevenly.  The pieces are very small and easy to lose, making a nightmare for people who like their puzzles/educational materials complete.  (The target audience for this playboard aren't inclined to keep things neat and orderly.)As a side note, the little pieces are a major choke/intestinal hazard for babies.T.S.

Sadly, not only does it fail to meet expectations, it flat-out disappoints.As you can imagine with a puzze of the world, there are A LOT of pieces.  Any set with A LOT of pieces should demand a decent carrying case.  This set's case (if you can even call it that) is a paper envelope with a plastic window and paper handles.  A six-year-old boy I know nearly tore it in half just trying to open it up, and he wasn't even being rough.  Without the carrying case, you're going to have to deal with lots of loose pieces.  Lots.

The pieces are colorful but small, definitely a choking hazard for toddlers or younger.

In other words, KEEP THIS AWAY FROM THE LITTLE ONES.Beyond that, I have a beef with the pieces themselves.  Now, with a puzzle this size, I don't expect to have a separate piece for Belgium or Burundi, but seriously, the designers didn't even seem to make a serious attempt at following country borders.  The groupings are somewhat bizarre sometimes with some countries getting cut in half and others bunched together.  Call me a geography geek if you will, but if you spend this much time designing an educational tool like this, having the pieces make geographic sense only... well, makes sense.Gobs of potential just didn't pan out here.  You can find better tools for teaching geography without all the risk and mess.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REN587T96RD0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTC162S#wasThisHelpful","REN587T96RD0B","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After my expericne with the stellar T.S. Shure Alphabet Letters Wooden Magnets 26 Piece MagnaFun Set, my hopes for this T.S. Shure set were high.  Sadly, it fails to meet expectations.A major disappointment came literally right out of the box.  As I picked up the plastic carrying case, 3 pieces fell immediately out of a large hole in the bottom.  It would have been almost all the pieces if I hadn't tipped the case flat on its back.  Not a good start.  What would have been a very convenient storage case has been rendered useless by cheap materials (until I get out a roll of 3M Utility Duct Tape 2929 Silver, 1-22/25 in x 50 yd 5.8 mils).The anatomy set is comprised of a magnetic body-shaped piece with a skeleton printed on it.  One can stick various body systems (circulatory, muscular, etc...) or clothes onto the base piece.  Play is very akin to old-fashioned paper dolls and can be adopted and mastered in a matter of seconds.  Though it is VERY basic in its instruction, kids can get a cursory introduction to different body systems and their anatomical layouts.  The mix-n-match possibilities are potentially the most fun part of the game (boy with skeletal head, muscular torso, exposed blood vessels in legs).  Without labeling, though, kids may not know what they're looking at.Please note there are pieces with genetalia printed for both genders, which weirded out my kintergardener and jr. higher (for different reasons).  While I understand that genitals are important parts of the anatomy, I think it's a safe bet to say that those will be the least played-with pieces and probably could have been better substituted with another body system (or more clothes, hair colors, skin types, etc...) that would garner more interest (rather than squirmy avoidance) from the kiddos.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJSNBM391DTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTC1EO8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJSNBM391DTT","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product is well constructed, can support up to 300 lbs (I'm just under that and it feels solid), and is comfortable to use when doing crunches.  I like the versatility of this unit in that you can flip it over and do steady dip exercises.  The crunch technique takes a little getting used to so one isn't straining their neck.  My wife and kids (all of smaller frame than me) had more difficulty perfecting the technique and I believe it's because they were having to reach for the arm support bar further, therefore were more likely to pick their heads up off the mesh support.It took me and the kids 20 minutes to assemble out of the box.  There is no way to conveniently break this unit down for storage between exercise sessions.  It's light and easy to move around, but a bit bulky if you're short on space.What I find inexplicable is the lack of printed exercise instructions included in the box.  No pictures or demonstrations except for the examples printed on the glossy box itself.  Instead, you're directed to a website for use instructions.  How many people are going to be doing crunches in their home office while they learn how to use this equipment, or worse yet, with an iPhone?  This seems like a major oversight of the manufacturer in order to cut costs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D465XRLWW6GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBEW0CO#wasThisHelpful","R3D465XRLWW6GS","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a great deal to like about this product:  The ingredients list, for one, is spectacular.  I love the idea of combining both protein and greens (two things I can have trouble getting enough of in my diet) to jump-start my day.  The purity of this product appears to be up there with the best protein powders I've sampled.  The flavor is an appealingly mild vanilla that can be combined into smoothies without overpowering the mix.So, why just a 3-star rating, you ask?  Well, call me petty, immature, or weak, but this stuff LOOKS GROSS!  When stirred into water or milk, it's a grayish-greenish goo that resembles newborn diaper juice.  It doesn't smell bad, of course, but there is no way under Mother Earth's ionosphere that I'm getting my kids to drink it.  They gagged LOOKING at it.  I almost gagged but was able to chug-a-lug it eyes squished shut.  The texture isn't fantastic (thick, globular), but it's manageable, especially when used as an additive rather than a main course.  I could make some snide comment about anything that's this good for you is bound to be gross, right?  Well, I won't.To sum up, the ingredients are great, the flavor is nice, the texture is OK, the visuals are flat-out yucky.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS5R3DOKK9G4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYRXIIS#wasThisHelpful","RS5R3DOKK9G4W","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got an iPhone 5c.  The spring-loaded adjustable caliper that holds the phone provides enough tension so the phone is always secure in the mount -- no worries about falling out.  There is stiff foam padding surrounding the contact surfaces so your phone won't get scratched.  The mount can be stretched wider to accomodate slightly larger phones as well.I would LOVE this product and give it 5 stars except that the piece that mounts to the vent is not nearly as grippy as the rest of the unit.  I find that I'm having to adjust the placement of the mount on my vent at least once on each commute.  It has yet to fully fall off the vent flap, but it's been darn close several times.

"For YEARS, I have struggled with fog on the inside of my car's windshield.  In Minnesota winters especially, it can take quite a while for warm air to start blowing to the point that one can see safely.  Countless times, I've found myself pulled over in my neighborhood waiting for my engine to warm and my windshield to defog.This little device (about the size of a portable pack of tissues) has made instantaneous improvement in my car cabin without the need for any sprays/chemicals.  It's as simple as you can imagine:  Wipe the inside of the windshield and internal fog goes away.  I've noticed that I will occasionally need to wipe the windshield a couple of times as the engine heats up to the point where the blowers can handle the job, but that sure beats sitting on the roadside for upwards of several minutes.The bottom line:  I feel safer already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22RF0NS5VOYHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002B3BM38#wasThisHelpful","R22RF0NS5VOYHZ","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a well-equipped, consolidated emergency road kit for your vehicle, Bell has put together list of stuff for you.  As the three-star rating would indicate, it's OK; not terrible but also not great.  The supplies included are of very cheap quality (thus 104-pieces for the presented low, low price).  There's not much here that you'd buy individually, should you put this kit together yourself.  The tire inflator states it can fill 14"" tires.  (That might work on a Mini-Cooper...)  The air pump did a servicible job on a bicyle tire but I can imagine it would take near forever (if ever) to fill a deflated car tire.  The blanket is exceptionally thin, as in just better than nothing...That's kind of how I feel about most of this kit.  It's better than nothing, but just.

"For full disclosure, I'm not a runner, but I'm on my feet all day and a good pair of shoes will determine how much I hate my life at the end of the day.

The gel in the sole makes for an exceptionally comfortable walking experience without being ""squishy"".  I still feel well supported and stable.I'll probably be buying another pair of these shoes down the road.

"Well, now.  This is a surprise.Who would have thunk that this little dynamo would replace our Dyson ($300+) as the primary vacuum in the house?  No me, I assure you.  Stunningly, it has.  Is it BETTER than the Dyson?  Not on most measures, except possibly the most important ones:  User-friendliness and convenience.  Allow me to explain.First off, the design of this lightweight unit is so stunningly brilliant I can hardly believe I've never seen something like this before (though I'm willing to admit I may very well be a vacuuming idiot).  It's essentially a cordless hand-held vacuum (think ""Dust Buster"") that can be snapped into an upright attachment and used like a light-duty vacuum cleaner.  The spinning bristles draw their power from the hand-held core unit and they can be turned on and off with the flick of the thumb to make the unit safe for hardwood floors.  We've test-driven it on ours and the floors LOVE IT.  It glides around providing gentle suction (enough to pick up Cheerios, dust bunnies, hair, etc...).  When the spinner is turned back on, the unit does decent spot work on low pile carpets like berber or cut-berber.  (I don't have any plushes in the house, so am unable to give you a good report on that.  Sorry.)  It has a double-folding handle that makes it exceptionally maneuverable and it's light weight (approximately 8 pounds) means even the laziest of kids will have one less reason to complain.Speaking of vacuuming hair, this unit has the simplest, most-accessible way to remove and clean the spinning bristles.  There is simply one switch on the bottom that needs to be flipped and the spin brush comes right out for easy cleaning.  Additionally, the dirt catcher (while small) is clear (so you'll know when it's full) and very easy to empty.Make no mistake, this mighty mite will never replace a full-size vacuum.  The battery power is only good for about 20 minutes and the suction is nowhere near the rug-hickeys our Dyson applies.  When we need to do more than one room (or heaven forbid, the whole house), out comes the more muscular Dyson.  But if we've got a spot job (i.e.: we want to reach behind the toilet or do a quicker picker upper after a kid-related ""activity"") or want to do a quick run over the hardwood floors, the Bissell Bolt is getting the call.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U4ZIC14J40Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LASI4BI#wasThisHelpful","R2U4ZIC14J40Z5","A6B92PTV0Z1SU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6B92PTV0Z1SU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most body wash users utilize some sort of loofa, sponge, or washcloth, all of which will be more abrasive than itsy-bitsy pellets included here.  It's sort of pointless rather than cool.

"The last decade has seen a significant number of books written with the goal of attempting to reconcile contemporary science and the Torah. This is far from a new phenomenon and it in fact goes back to medieval times. Perhaps its greatest proponent was Gersonides (1288-1344), also known as Ralbag (Rabbi Levi ben Gershon).In Gersonides: Judaism within the Limits of Reason (Littman 978-1906764784), author Seymour Feldman (former professor of philosophy at Rutgers University) has written an enticing overview of the life and thought of one of the greatest and most daring; if not most controversial medieval Jewish philosophers. Like his predecessor Maimonides, Gersonides attempted to reconcile the philosophy of Aristotle with traditional Jewish thought.In truth, I think it’s unfair to use the term controversial, as often is done when referring to the views of Gersonides, as the term carries with it negative connotations. While his philosophical views may be in the minority, and not universally accepted; as one of the greatest philosophers of his time, his views must be considered.But unlike Maimonides, Gersonides wrote very few letters and as such, details of his life are scant. Besides a very brief bibliographical overview, Feldman spends all his efforts understanding the man and his worldview.Feldman writes that unlike many modern scientists or philosophers who either scorn religion or compartmentalize it; Gersonides did not see any fundamental discrepancy between the pursuit of truth via reason, and its attainment through divine revelation. Understanding that there has to be but one divine truth, Gersonides felt it was an imperative that reason and divine revelation must be able to be harmonized.Reason was something Gersonides took quite seriously. In fact, he saw reason and logic as a divine gift. With that, he felt it was essential that God had to be, and must be understood within the limits of reason.Tertullian's notion that credo quia absurdum (I believe because it is absurd) would be an anathema to Gersonides. As a polymath in addition to being an accomplished astronomer, Feldman writes that the study of astronomy and other natural sciences according to Gersonides, were fundamental and prerequisite requirement for the ascent to metaphysics. The reason for this was that Gersonides felt that the whole of nature, even our own bodies, displays the handiwork of the Lord.In a dense 10 chapters, the book provides the reader with a detailed summary of Gersonides’ worldview in areas such as the Bible, creation, Divine knowledge and omnipotence, prophecy and more.Gersonides has a number of contentious opinions, and none of it greater than his approach to divine omniscience. Most Jewish philosophers felt that there was complete divine omniscience, of which human free will was simply a perplexing part of. Gersonides took the radical approach and felt that while God knows in advance what choices are available to a person; God in fact does not know what choice the individual will ultimately take.Gersonides methodology was in part to try to reconcile Aristotle with traditional Jewish philosophy. On this topic, Feldman spends a chapter and writes in detail how Gersonides was almost universally rejected for this approach as detailed in his magnum opus on philosophy Milhamot Ha-Shem (The War of the Lord). One of his opponents mocked it by calling it “Wars against the Lord”. Such mocking was grievous, given the six questions Gersonides was dealing with are fundamental to Judaism; and relevant to this very day.The book also discusses other non-traditional approaches Gersonides had, including minimizing the notion of miracles, and the approach that a person’s soul is not immortal, rather it’s their intellect that is.Gersonides didn’t create a formal system of thought, such as Maimonides did in Moreh Nevukhim (The Guide for the Perplexed). And like Maimonides, there are many ways to interpret Gersonides, to which Feldman provides a superb overview of all of Gersonides core ideas.Feldman shows how many of Gersonides’ doctrines were not traditional. Not being bothered by that, Gersonides never shied away from drawing the logical conclusion from what he considered to be the true philosophical premise.As interesting as he is provocative, Gersonides: Judaism within the Limits of Reason provides the reader with a comprehensive look at one of the most formidable Jewish philosophers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OS79AJ5RFD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906764786#wasThisHelpful","R24OS79AJ5RFD8","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Key areas include space calculations, virtualization, power management, heating and cooling, and much more. The authors focus on not just the materials and infrastructure of a data center, but the many costs also.The cost aspect plays a prominent part in the book, as many people have a somewhat nave notion that the cloud is free. While there may be many free cloud services, once one gets into the enterprise realm of cloud computing, it is anything but free. The authors show how to make educated decisions when building out a cloud data center.The authors take the pragmatic approach that just as a large building requires significant engineering, design, requirements and more; so too does a large enterprise data center. With that, the authors leave have detailed every aspect of data center design.The authors make extensive use of various formulas to ensure that the design meets the expected result. This includes a significant amount of pages dedicated to cost models to ensure that the design does not break the bank. By using the many analytical tools suggested in the book, the data center designer will have a highly effective cost framework for strategic decision making.For those looking for a reference to guide them through every aspect of a cloud data center design, Cloud Data Centers and Cost Modeling is without a doubt the best reference available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TPD3OBVJNAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=012801413X#wasThisHelpful","R30TPD3OBVJNAF","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1965, Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik wrote The Lonely Man of Faith, and used Hegel, Kierkegaard, Kant and other philosophers as a springboard for his discussion of the vibrancy and relevancy of religion and faith in the modern era.Half a century later, Rabbi Shlomo Einhorn takes a similar approach, albeit with a very different set of characters. In Judaism Alive: Using the Torah to Unlock Your Life's Potential, he takes a New-Age approach to the topic in this most enjoyable work.For those unfamiliar with Rabbi Einhorn, Rabbi Steven Weil, senior managing director of the Orthodox Union, called him “the top young Orthodox rabbi in all of North America.” Einhorn is a with-it author, and is not your mother’s Rabbi; this is not your mother’s book. For the seeker that wants ancient answers couched in a more modern context, this is a book that will likely quench part of that spiritual thirst.In the preface, Einhorn asks what it means to start “living” and to live a full life. He answers that it means that every day is filled with a sense of purpose. In the book, he gathers insights from various Biblical, Rabbinic, and Hasidic sources, and combines them with the likes of Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra and many other contemporary sources. His goal is to show the relevancy of ancient Jewish sources, in order to give the reader a guide to a more fulfilled life.Einhorn is definitely an out-of-the-box type of person, as is reflected in the book. He weaves the thoughts of Marianne Williamson into the same paragraph as a contemporary Hasidic master. He does this throughout the book, and provides myriad insights into who a person is, and what they can be.It’s important to note that while Einhorn frequently cites pop references, be it lyrics from Queen or a passage from Amadeus; his out-of-the-box approach firmly remains within the framework of traditional Judaism, never straying from the basic tenets of Jewish thought and law.The books three chapters focus on life lessons from Abraham, Joseph and Moses. In each chapter, he shares life lessons from these Biblical characters, and writes how their struggles and life challenges are similar to those that we face today. Einhorn writes of the manner in which they dealt with their challenges, and how by utilizing a similar approach, we can deal with our unique sets of challenges. The outcome of this is that we can indeed live a more meaningful life.Einhorn is a big fan of Tony Robbins and quotes him often in the book. Robbins’ approach is to help people be more productive and successful. Einhorn takes that approach, but adds a spirituality and Jewish soul to it.However, Einhorn’s penchant for New Age insights doesn’t always work. He describes a seminar which purports to show the power of the mind by the fact that controlling the mind allows one to walk on fire; the mundane reality about fire walking is that it is not really that difficult to do, and has clear physical explanations.Wikipedia notes that some of the reasons are due to the fact that water has a very high specific heat capacity, whereas embers have a very low one. Therefore, the foot's temperature tends to change less than the coal's. Water also has a high thermal conductivity and the rich blood flow in the foot will carry away the heat and spread it. On the other hand, embers have a poor thermal conductivity, so the hotter body consists only of the parts of the embers which are close to the foot. Finally, firewalkers do not spend very much time on the embers, and they keep moving.The good news is that the other insights Einhorn shares are to the point and accurate. He’s a person who has his hands on the pulse of society and his listeners, and is able to provide them with a fulfilling message. For those looking for an engaging and topical voice, and one that awakens you, rather than puts you into a sermon-based slumber, Einhorn provides a just that.Soloveitchik wrote The Lonely Man of Faith to be a universal guide to people of all faiths. In Judaism Alive: Using the Torah to Unlock Your Life's Potential, Shlomo Einhorn takes a similar approach and has written a guide that will provide insight and awareness to all. Spiritual growth is about getting to the next step. And this book details the steps in which to start getting there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3IPGZZEZC1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=965229652X#wasThisHelpful","R1M3IPGZZEZC1B","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The phrase think like a hacker is bandied about incessantly. For most people, they can’t think like a hacker any more than they could think like a podiatrist or a CPA.With that, in Network Attacks and Exploitation: A Framework, author Matthew Monte has written a great guide that while it won’t help you think like a hacker; it will provide you with the knowledge of how to secure your network, such that hackers will hopefully find an easier playground.Monte takes a holistic approach and integrates a number of strategies to incorporate both an information security offensive and defensive approach to create a secure network.The book starts off with an introduction to computer network exploitation (CNE). Monte writes that CNE is simply the latest reincarnation of espionage. As more and more of the worlds political, economic and military information is being stored on networks, and these are often insecure networks; a framework for organizing and analyzing CNE becomes necessary to national and corporate security interests.Monte is a fan of military theorist Carl von Clausewitz and quotes him a number of times in the book. An interesting point he makes in reference to creating a secure network, based on von Clausewitz, is that in theory, defending should be easier than attacking. The reason being that the defense has the negative objective to maintain the status quo. While the offense must effect some whence while being resisted. But in the digital world, attackers working on the offense, nearly always have the upper hand, since they have more knowledge and tools to use against insecurely designed networks.Creating a secure and resilient network is something that takes time, as the book notes. Monte’s main approach to build security in by creating an offensive strategy. Far too many organizations just want to buy hardware and software, without knowing what they are securing their network against. He writes that crafting an offensive strategy requires asking the right questions, and then proceeds to list about 50 essential questions. Answering these questions and customizing the response are fundamental to building a secure network.Those looking to understand how they can create a high-level roadmap to build effective security into their networks will find Network Attacks and Exploitation: A Framework a helpful resource. At 170 pages, it’s not a comprehensive guide to designing secure network. But for those looking for a great introduction to the topic, it’s an essential one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HTK2ED0HAUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118987128#wasThisHelpful","R37HTK2ED0HAUO","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The legal field is forever catching up to advances in technology. Once of the many examples is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which only went into effect in 1998. About 7 years after the creation of the World Wide Web.In ‘Augmented Reality Law, Privacy, and Ethics: Law, Society, and Emerging AR Technologies’, author, attorney and AR expert Brian Wassom provides a forward thinking approach to how law and augmented reality (AR) work. The topic is near and dear to Wassom, as he heads up the Augmented Legality blog, which focuses on social media law and other new and emerging forms of expression, such as AR. Wassom brings an experts approach to the topic to every page in this fascinating and easily readable book.AR is defined as a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented or supplemented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified possibly even diminished rather than augmented by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one’s current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.AR like other emerging and new technologies offer myriad benefits. Wassom details those, in addition to the many legal and privacy issues that go along with them.  AR has a dark side to it, which the book details.The implications of AR are huge, and the book takes a look at the social, legal, and ethical issues surrounding AR technology. AR has entered most people’s lives, whether they know it or not, and whether they want it or not; via the preponderance of smartphones and integrated internet-ready devices.While the book has a legal angle, it is written for a broad audience, not just attorneys or legal professionalsThe book covers the entire range of AR topics from the legal side (intellectual property, criminal law, litigation procedures, and more), and the issues of AR and society, including politics, privacy, personal ethics and more.The issues of AR in our lives are huge and the implications significant.

"Once while she was visiting suburban New Jersey, I saw a very young girl from the concrete jungle of Manhattan who saw a darting cat, and thought it was a deer. Many New Yorkers, like those who dwell in large cities far removed from wild animal life, are often oblivious to the inhabitants of the animal world.In The Torah Encyclopedia of the Animal Kingdom, Rabbi Natan Slifkin has written a masterful work that identifies all of the animals mentioned in Tanach. After reading this volume, one would not mistake a gazelle for a deer or an onager for a donkey, let alone a cat for a deer.The mention of animals in Tanach is pervasive. So pervasive that the reader who is not savvy to these nuances may not appreciate the sheer numbers of animals mentioned. As an aside, which book of the Tanach make the most extensive use of animals? Slifkin answers that it’s the book of Job.In this first volume, Slifkin lists all of the wild animals mentioned in Tanach, Talmud and Midrash. Each chapter starts off by defining just what the animal is. He then lists relevant quotes about the animal from its Judaic sources, and then discusses how the animal is identified, and its name in various languages. As to animal naming, Slifkin references numerous sources, including such scholars as Saadia Gaon and Yonah ibn Janach, both of whom make heavy use of Arabic to define the animal. Each chapter also details the symbolism of each animal.Each chapter provides a detailed analysis of the identities of these animals. Slifkin uses classical Jewish texts for their Biblical identification, and then maps them to their current zoology identity. More often than not, they meet. When there is a conflict, there are a number of proposed solutions. The book also shows many instances where ancient Rabbinic understanding of the animal world is perfectly in sync with current scientific and veterinary understanding.The book starts with an overview of the role of animals in scripture, Talmud and Midrash. It then details the classification of animals.In the chapter on the classification of animals, Slifkin notes that the Torah’s system of animal classification is very different from modern zoology. The former is known as a folk taxonomy and the latter a scientific taxonomy. Scientific taxonomies are not absolute defined groups. Rather they are a system meant to categorize. While there are significant differences between the two taxonomies, Slifkin astutely notes that each taxonomy serves a different purpose, and contradictions between the two are not necessarily significant.The remainder of the book focuses on the various animals and is broken up into sections on predators (lion, bear, leopard, cheetah, wolf, hyena, fox, jackal, caracal, mongoose and badger), kosher wild animals (gazelle, deer, ibex, oryx, hartebeest, aurochs, wild sheep, giraffe) and other wild animals (hyrax, hare, wild boar, onager, hippopotamus, elephant, monkey, porcupine, and otter).Slifkin notes that for various reasons, identifying the animals of the Torah is not an easy task. One reason is that Biblical Hebrew has not been a spoken language for thousands of years. These ambiguities of language and the struggles to identify these animals (often thousands of miles away from those who are trying to do the identification) have vexed scholars for thousands of years. Adding to the ambiguity is that Modern Hebrew usage of these animals’ names are often different from their Biblical meanings. For this reason, the Modern Hebrew meaning is often not the same.What difference does it make if, for example, a person thinks that the tzvi is a gazelle, deer, ibex or antelope? The answers are manifold, Slifkin writes. One is that every animal is mentioned in the Torah for a specific reason and purpose. Those reasons can be negated if one makes a mistake regarding the very identity of that animal.The book cites hundreds of reference, from a wide variety of sources. But while the book has an index of citations from Scripture and Talmud, it lacks an index to the hundreds of citations it uses from Midrash, which is a significant lack.One of the most mysterious animals discussed in the Talmud is the koy. While Slifkin notes that the koy has been a favorite topic of Rabbinic discussion for many centuries, he spends a very brief five paragraphs discussing this enigmatic animal. Such an animal, whatever it may be, would warrant greater discussion.In The Iranian Talmud: Reading the Bavli in Its Sasanian Context, Dr. Shai Secunda writes that to understand many aspects of the Babylonian Talmud, once must understand the Sasanian culture where it was developed. Similarly, if one is to read about the akko, ankakta, bardelas and hundreds of other animals mentioned in Tanach and Talmud, they need to understand both their definition and context. Slifkin’s book provides this background.The Torah Encyclopedia of the Animal Kingdom is a fascinating and enjoyable work that lends itself to readers of many levels. Slifkin has done a remarkable job of detailing the many wild animals in Judaic sources. By understanding these marvelous animals and the wonders of their very existence, the animal kingdom is living testimony to the glory of its Creator.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAWCF9IIJ6E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159264404X#wasThisHelpful","R3AAWCF9IIJ6E0","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had you Googled social media investigation a decade ago, you would have gotten a handful of responses. Today, it has become a key part of law enforcement, family law and more.Social media played predominantly in the terrible murder last week of journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward. Law enforcement poured over the social media profiles of the perpetrator.In Introduction to Social Media Investigation (Syngress 978-0128016565), author Jennifer Golbeck PhD has written a guide that shows how you can use the most popular social media channels as part of an investigation.While there are thousands of social media channels, the book focuses on the largest of them, namely: Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, Tumblr, Instagram and YouTube.  For each of the channels, Golbeck provides a number of case studies and real world examples of how to perform an investigation.The book provides a basic approach to gleaning information from each of these channels. For most investigators, the reconnaissance work will not be so difficult given the amount of information people share on social media sites.The book is an introduction, and the author herself notes that most of the investigation stories detailed in the book are relatively simple. Namely that the target uses social media and the investigator collects the information.  If it’s a popular site like Facebook or Twitter, and the person being investigated is somewhat chatty (which is often the case on these channels), the investigators job is not that difficult.But many investigations are much more complex and will require a deeper and more thorough approach.  The book touches on that, but is primarily based on the more simple investigations. There are other tools that can be used in an investigation, such as reverse image searches, Social Searcher and more.Those looking for an introductory text on the topic, such as information security professionals, those in law enforcement, investigative journalists and more will find Introduction to Social Media Investigation a handy guide in which to start their investigative word.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPUTAIX23CPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0128016566#wasThisHelpful","R2LPUTAIX23CPU","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s not clear who first uttered the quip: Of course I can keep a secret. It's the people I tell it to that can't. But what’s clear is that there are plenty of times when it’s a matter of life and death to ensure that secrets remain undisclosed.In The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography, author Simon Singh reveals the often hush-hush world of the science of secrecy.How powerful are these cryptography tools? Until about only a decade ago, the U.S. Department of Commerce categorized strong cryptographic tools the same way it did F-15s and M-16s (more about that in Chapter 7).Singh is a particle physicist who understands the science well and, more importantly in the case of this book, knows how to explain those details quite well.Sit back and be enthralled by the fascinating world of cloak-and-dagger spies, and how without strong cryptography, we wouldn’t have online banking, Amazon Prime, and other things that make life meaningful.For anyone who ever had to study for the CISSP certification examination, the cryptography domain was almost always the hardest and most intimidating of the ten exam domains. While the ISC2 recently retired the cryptography domain and put it under Security Engineering, any topic with obscure terms such as hash function, public key cryptosystem, side-channel attacks and the like will certainly be intimidating.In The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography, while not a comprehensive overview of cryptography, this masterful book by Simon Singh is a history of encryption, with a focus on the 16th century to the end of the 20th century. As a history book, Singh strikes a good balance between writing about the history, and providing a good technical and mathematical overview of the topic of cryptographyWith a Ph.D. in physics, Singh follows in the footsteps of fellow physicist, Richard Feynman, who was a great explainer. Feynman noted that if a specific topic couldn’t be explained in a freshman lecture, it was not yet fully understood. In the book, Singh spends about 400 pages on this freshman lecture. It’s worth noting that a number of freshman university courses use this book as a reference; it’s that good.I first became acquainted with Singh when he gave a most entertaining keynote at an information security conference about a decade ago, where he dispelled the claim that Stairway to Heaven contained subliminal satanic messages.Classic cryptography goes back thousands of years. While the book provides details into cryptography from the times of the Bible, Caesar and more; its focus is predominantly on the modern era, starting with the cryptography used by Mary, Queen of Scots in the mid-1500s, up to the topic of quantum cryptography.The book covers a wide range of topics, from both a historical and technology perspective. Singh takes a broad approach to the topic and doesn’t focus entirely on ciphers and algorithms, rather he brings historical stories like the Rosetta stone, Man in the Iron Mask, Manhattan Project, Navajo Code Talkers and much more.While encryption and cryptography have their roots in the world of mathematics and number theory, the book often places a focus on the human elements. While many cryptosystems work perfectly in the pristine environs of a lab, they will fail miserably when incorrectly implemented. Singh gives numerous examples, from Mary, Queen of Scotts to the German Enigma cipher machine, where the human element leads to extreme failures.A number of the eight chapters start with a story, which Singh then uses as a lead to provide the underlying details of a specific aspect of security and cryptography.For the story of Mary, Queen of Scots in Chapter 1, the message is that the underlying cipher needs to be reasonably impenetrable. In Chapter 4 on cracking the Enigma machine, the message is that even the strongest of cryptography devices finds its kryptonite if its users don’t follow the directions.Chapter 5 on Language Barrier is perhaps the most fascinating chapter in the book. Singh details the story of how the U.S. used Navajo Indians and their obscure language as a means of ensuring the Japanese would have a much harder time deciphering the messages. By the time the war ended, the Japanese were never able to read a single message when Navajo was used.The chapter also details the story of the Rosetta stone. While not a cryptographic issue in the common sense, hieroglyphics had been indecipherable for thousands of years. Singh writes how common wisdom at the time was that the Ancient Egyptian language of hieroglyphs should be treated as symbols and not letters. Singh highlights the story of how Jean-François Champollion was able to decipher the stones by using new research that the hieroglyphs were indeed letters, not symbols.Anyone involved with cryptography knows terms such as Diffie–Hellman and RSA on a first-name basis. Those cryptosystems are the very backbone of today’s Internet security infrastructure. Singh does a good job of explaining how they work and what makes them secure. For RSA, it’s built on a very simple premise, that factoring the product of two huge prime numbers is difficult.  While most people may be oblivious to it, much of the underlying security for online banking and the Internet is built on top of RSA.The book closes with the next generation of secrecy, which is quantum cryptography.  As a particle physicist, quantum mechanics is Singh’s bread and butter. When Singh wrote the book, quantum cryptography was not a practical technology, and that is still the case.As a side note, if and when quantum cryptography becomes practical, it would be so powerful as to be able to break every RSA key in existence.The Code Book was first published in 1999, around the time Windows 2000 came out. While the latter became obsolete in 2005, The Code Book is still quite germane given the value of the information in the book, which is still relevant and of interest.For those looking for an encyclopedic reference, David Kahn’s The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet is the definitive tome on the topic.For those looking for a more informal and selected overview of some of the core topics from the last 600 years of cryptography, this book is readable and interesting, and a perfect read for those looking for an introduction to the topic.Those looking for a captivating and very readable book on the history of modern cryptography will find The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography a valuable read, and one that is certainly worthy of being in the Cybersecurity Canon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MYQONIHNTUIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385495323#wasThisHelpful","R1MYQONIHNTUIG","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who walks the streets of any major Orthodox neighborhood today can’t go far without passing a yeshiva. To the uninitiated, they may think these yeshivas go back for millennia. But that is not necessarily the case.In Lithuanian Yeshivas of the Nineteenth Century: Creating a Tradition of Learning (Littman 978-1906764609), Shaul Stampfer (professor at the Dinur Center For Research In Jewish History at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem) has written a detailed and brilliantly researched account of the development of the current yeshiva system.This is an English translation of Stampfer’s Hebrew work which first appeared in 1995. It also includes additional material that became available with the opening of archives in Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism.Those with an interest in modern Talmudic study will find the book, as I did, a spellbinding overview of the development of the modern yeshiva. Stampfer’s impeccable research changes the way one will look at the reasons for the creation of and the development of these yeshivas in Lithuania. The book is like a riveting documentary, full of fascinating insights.The first modern Ashkenazi yeshiva was established relatively recently in 1803; with the founding of the Volozhin yeshiva by Rabbi Chaim Ickovits; but better known as Rabbi Chaim Volozhin.Stampfer notes in the introduction that the yeshivas that developed in nineteenth-century Lithuania offered a completely new structure for the study of Talmud. He writes that the two main impetuses for this were a conservative reaction to the modernizing trends that were confronting the traditional world of Eastern Europe, and faith in the important of educational institutions.The book focuses on the development of these yeshivas from roughly 1803 to 1914. The bulk of the book focuses on the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, which is better known though as the Yeshiva of Volozhin.  The book also gives attention to other famed yeshivas such as Slobodka, Telz and Kovno.The 1800’s to early 1900’s was a century of change and revolution.  Every aspect of society was affected, from the isolated farmer to the yeshiva students of these Lithuanian yeshivas.  I found Stampfer’s description of the environment to be quite enlightening and it certainly challenged my notion of what old-time yeshivas were about.  The levels of Talmudic scholarship were legendary, but these were not stale, monolithic institutions.Stampfer writes that the yeshiva system developed in response to the collapse of the batei medrash (informal study halls) and was seen as an essential element in preserving the traditional values of a conservative society. In the early nineteenth century, the yeshiva was therefore presented as simply a place of Torah study, with no suggestion of practical advantage or reward.While the very Talmud that was studied at the Lithuanian yeshivas were written in the yeshivas of Babylon, the book notes that because the Lithuanian yeshivas offered a new model of Torah study, they can’t be regarded as a continuation of the yeshivas of the middle ages.While many of today’s yeshivas are styled after their Lithuanian predecessors and there is an assumption amongst many people that today’s yeshivas operate in relatively the same manner as they did 200 years ago; Stampfer shows how their methods were often quite different. Two of the most striking are, first of all, the fact that the Talmud was studied systematically and completely; starting with Tractate Berachot, all the way to Tractate Niddah. In addition, the method of study in these yeshivas was not with a chavruta (study partner) as is de rigueur today, rather the yeshiva students would study independently.The book covers every aspect of the yeshivas, from the number of students, admissions protocols, budgets of the yeshiva, student political organizations, student housing, tuition and much more.The long-term influence of the Lithuanian yeshiva is unquestionable and Stampfer does an incredible job of detailing the milieu where these yeshivas developed. The book is impressive in exhibiting a large amount of research, as well as depth of content.Those with an interest in Talmud study and the yeshiva system will unquestionably find Lithuanian Yeshivas of the Nineteenth Century: Creating a Tradition of Learning  a fascinating and a compelling read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32OZS9UA0U9E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906764603#wasThisHelpful","R32OZS9UA0U9E0","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The only negative thing to say about Hacking Point of Sale: Payment Application Secrets, Threats, and Solutions is its title.  A cursory look at it may lead the reader that this is a book for a script kiddie, when it is in fact a necessary read for anyone involved with payment systems.  The book provides a wealth of information that is completely pragmatic and actionable.  The problem is, as the book notes in many places, that one is constantly patching a system that is inherently flawed and broken.Often after a major information security breach incidents, a public official (always in front of cameras and with many serious looking people standing in the wings) will go on TV and say something akin to “we have to make sure this never happens again”.Last year, Target and Neiman Marcus were the major victims.  This month, it’s eBay.  What next month will bring isn’t known, but it will be major.  But after hundreds of millions of records breached, it’s not that anyone is saying it won’t happen again.  Rather, it’s inevitable it will happen many more times.There are a number of good books on PCI, but this is the first one that looks at the entire spectrum of credit card processing.  Author Slava Gomzin is a security and payments technologist at HP and as clearly evident in the book, he lives and breathes payment technology and his expert knowledge is manifest in every chapter.  His technical expertise is certain to make the reader much better informed and understand the myriad issues involved.The book provides an excellent overview to the workings of payment systems and Gomzin is not shy about showing how insecure many payment systems are. Its 9 chapters provide a good combination of deep technical and general detail.The reader comes out with a very good overview of how payment systems work and what the various parts of it are.  For many people, this may be the first time they are made aware of entities such as processors, acquirers and gateways.An interesting point the book raises is that it has been observed there are less breaches in Europe since they use EMV (also known as chip and pin) instead of insecure magnetic-stripe cards which are used in the US.  This leads to a perception that EMV is by default much stronger.  But the book notes that EMV was never designed to secure the cardholder data after the point of sale.  The recent breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus were such that cardholder data was pilfered after it was in the system.Another major weakness with EMV is it doesn't provide added security to web and online transactions. When a customer goes to a site and makes a transaction with an EMV card, it is fundamentally the same as if they would have used a magnetic stripe card.  What many people don’t realize also is that EMV is not some new technology. It’s been around for a while.  What it did was reduce the amount of fraud for physical use amongst European merchants.  But the unintended consequence was that it simply moved the fraud online, where EMV is powerless.As noted, the book provides the details and vulnerabilities of every aspect of the life of a payment card, including physical security.  In chapter 4, he notes that there are numerous features that are supposed to distinguish between a genuine payment card from a counterfeited one.  These include logo, embossed primary account number (PAN), card verification values and ultraviolet (UV) marks.  Each one of them has their own set of limits.  For the supposed security of UV marks, these are relatively easily replicated by a regular inkjet printer with UV ink.In fact, Gomzin writes that all payment cards as they are in use today are insecure by design due to the fact that there are multiple physical security features that don’t provide adequate protection from theft, and that the sensitive cardholder data information is encoded on a magnetic strip in clear text.Gomzin has numerous PCI certifications and with all that, doesn’t see PCI as the boon to payment card security as many do.  He astutely observes that PCI places a somewhat myopic approach that data at rest is all that matters.  Given that PCI doesn’t require payment software vendors or users to encrypt application configuration data, which is usually stored in plaintext and opened to uncontrolled modification; this can allow payment application to be compromised through misconfiguration.Even with PCI, Gomzin shows that credit card numbers are rather predictable in that their number space is in truth rather small, even though they may be 15-19 digits in length.  This is due to the fact that PCI allows the first 6 and last 4 digits to be exposed in plaintext, so it’s only 6 digits that need to be guessed.  This enables a relatively easy brute force attack, and even easier if rainbow tables are used.The Target breach was attributed to memory scraping and the book notes that as devastating an attack memory scraping is, there are no existing reliable security mechanisms that would prevent memory scraping.The appendix includes a POS vulnerability rank calculator which can provide a quick and dirty risk assessment of the POS and associated payments application and hardware.  The 20 questions in the calculator can’t replace a formal assessment.  But the initial results would likely mimic what that formal assessment would enumerate.So what will it take to fix the mess that POS and payment systems are in now?  The book notes that the system has to be completely overhauled for POS security to truly work.  He notes that point-to-point encryption is one of the best ways to do that.  What is stopping that is the huge costs involved in redoing the payment infrastructure.  But until then, breaches will be daily news.Hacking Point of Sale: Payment Application Secrets, Threats, and Solutions is an invaluable resource that it highly relevant to a wide audience.  Be it those in compliance, information security, development, research or in your payment security group.  If you are involved with payment systems, this is a necessary book.When an expert like Slava Gomzin writes, his words should be listened to.  He knows that payment breaches are inevitable.  But he also shows you how to potentially avoid that tidal wave of inevitability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPJE8OQJSFGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118810112#wasThisHelpful","R3UPJE8OQJSFGB","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a formal vade mecum in your quest for CISSP certification, then The CISSP companion handbook: A collection of tales, experiences and straight up fabrications fitted into the 10 CISSP domains of information security by Javvad Malik should not be your reference guide.But if you are looking for an entertaining and educational book to give a break to the monotonous work of CISSP preparation; this is your guide, and a very funny one at that.  Even for those security gurus that have the treasured and adored CISSP certification (and all the more so for those with SANS certifications), the book is a witty look at the world of information security, and ones man’s observation of it.What are Malik’s accomplishments?  Well, he really knows information security and brings a lot of experience to the table.  He won the RSA Social Security Blogger award for the most entertaining blogger, as well as the best security video blogger and most entertaining blog at the European Security Blogger Awards.  The book is entertaining in the sense that he doesn’t drone on about information security abbreviations and acronyms.When discussing TCP/IP, the book uses rock music as an analogy.  Drums are TCP, an electric guitar is UDP; vocals are IP, with the band manager as ARP and the record label are RARP.  While those analogies certainly won’t help you pass the test; they will definitely give you a more realistic understanding of what the protocols really do.No CISSP guide would be complete without a reference to the Bell-LaPadula model, which the book mentions on page 107.  The book doesn’t really define it, but notes that it may be used and implemented in pencil pushing governmental departments.As an aside, I once worked with a really smart guy who once worked with Len LaPadula at Bell Labs.  He couldn’t tell me what the model was either.  But he did note that most people mispronounced his name as La-pa-doo-la.  When Dr. LaPadula himself pronounced it as le-pad-you-lah.In movies such as Cars, much of the humor is lost on the children, while the adults will laugh.  This book is very much like that in the sense that those have been in the industry for a while will get the humor and irony Malik’s writing.  In Domain 3: Information Security Governance & Risk Management, he writes that if you do things just because they are best practices, you end up becoming an auditor, and notes that nobody likes an auditor.  In the footnote, he clarifies hat despite the sweeping generalization, there are some good and effective auditors in existence… a few.  Only those who have been in information security for a while can appreciate the humor there.The book is only available for the Kindle, and at 99 cents, that comes out to less than 10 cents per CBK domain.  Note that in the book, he never defines what CBK stands for, which would leave a CISSP candidate grasping in horror for an acronym without a definition.When it comes to pure CISSP guides, a best practice is to use the CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide by Shon Harris, all 1,500 pages of it.If you want the funniest and cheapest and downright educational guide around, nothing beats The CISSP companion handbook: A collection of tales, experiences and straight up fabrications fitted into the 10 CISSP domains of information security.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFFI8N6MSUK4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAYL51E#wasThisHelpful","RFFI8N6MSUK4S","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most introductory books about information security are about the size of this book, but are often written at a far too basic level.  In Introduction to Information Security: A Strategic-Based Approach, authors Timothy Shimeall and Jonathan Spring of CERT are able to provide an exploratory text about the topic without getting bogged down in the more elementary items.The book provides a good balance between the broad aspects of information security, privacy and risk management; without overwhelming the novice with far too much minutiae.As the title implies, it provides a strategy-based and holistic approach to the topics, and shows how the various sub-disciplines within information security overlap and interact.In 16 chapters, the book gives the reader almost everything they need to know about the current state and relevant topics involved in information security.For those looking for an introduction to the topic, that nonetheless provides a comprehensive overview of the relevant areas, Introduction to Information Security: A Strategic-Based Approach is an excellent reference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1Y4VTQDF5QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597499692#wasThisHelpful","R1S1Y4VTQDF5QZ","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neurologists and brain scientists are in agreement that in truth, we know very little about how the human brain works.  In the just released second edition of Designing with the Mind in Mind, a Simple Guide to Understanding User Interface Design Guidelines, author and UI expert Jeff Johnson provides a fascinating introduction to the fundamentals of perceptual and cognitive psychology for effective user interface (UI) design and creation.  UI is a facet of human-computer interaction (HCI), of which HCI involves the study, planning, design and uses of the interaction between people and the computers and devices they are using.This second edition is a completely updated edition, which has new chapters on human choice & decision making and hand-eye coordination & attention, as well as new examples, figures and explanations.Johnson heads up a consulting firm that specializes in evaluating and designing UI and brings significant experience to every chapter.  He writes that following user-interface design guidelines is not as straightforward as something like following a cooking recipe; even though people often compare the two. Design rules often describe goals rather than actions, as they are purposefully very general to make them broadly applicable.  The downside to that is that it means that their exact meaning and applicability to specific design situations is open to interpretation.With that, the book provides an exceptional foundation on how to ensure effective usability is successfully implemented.  The book spends a long time detailing how users make decisions and choices.What's really good about the book is that Johnson provides ample details about the topic, but doesn't reduce it to so just a set of rules or mind-numbing (and thusly unreadable) checklists.  His synopsis of the topics provides the reader with a broad understanding of the topic and what they need to do in order to ensure effective UI design is executed.While the focus in the book is heaving on general and cognitive psychology, the book is written for the reader who is a novice in the area, and stays quite practical, without getting in the vague theoretical areas.The book provides scores of examples of how people relate to an interface, and how to design accordingly.  One of many fascinating examples is when the author details the notion of attentional blink.  After we see or hear something, either in real-life or on a monitor, for a very brief amount of time following the recognition, between .15 and .45 of a second; we are nearly deaf and blind to other visual stimuli, even though our eyes and ears stay functional.  Researchers call this attentional blink and it is thought to be caused by the brain's perceptual and attentional mechanism being briefly fully occupied with processing the first recognition.What this means for a UI designer is that attentional blink can cause the user to miss information or events if things appear in rapid succession.  The book then goes on to describe techniques in which to create an effective UI to deal with the effects of attentional blink.  And he does this for scores of other similar issues.Another fascinating example is around visual hierarchy, which lets people focus on the relevant information.  The book notes that one of the most important goals in arranging information presentations is to provide a visual hierarchy, an arrangement that breaks the information into distinct sections, labels each section prominently, and presents the sections and subsections as a hierarchy.The book details the myriad areas which are crucial for an effective interface.  Chapters 4 and 5 provide significant detail about the importance of color for effective visual representation.As the title suggests, the book takes a deep approach to the neuroscience and psychology in UI design.  Other chapters include topics on human vision, sound, task, cognition, memory and more.As to memory, chapter details issues around the working memory of a user.  He gives numerous examples of error boxes and help screens that work and are epic failures, and how to do it right.  The classic example he provides is a 4-step Windows XP wireless error message.  If the user were to follow the directions, the instructions would close after step 1.Each chapter provides numerous implications of proper and improper design, and provides the needed recommendations.  While the topics may sound dry, Johnson writes in an engaging and often humorous style.The book clearly and empirically shows how effective UI design makes all the difference on how users interact with an application or web site. The book will certainly be an important reference to software designers, web designers, web application designers and those interested in HCI, and usability.For the designers that can't understand why their users are frustrated, they can understand why here.  For designers that really want to know what is going on in their users minds, one is hard pressed to find a better reference than this.As the subtitle of the book is Simple Guide to Understanding User Interface Design Guidelines, Designing with the Mind in Mind, a Simple Guide to Understanding User Interface Design Guidelines, is an invaluable resource for those serious about effective UI design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROY9XZWAG8HGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0124079148#wasThisHelpful","ROY9XZWAG8HGK","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his first book, Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking, author Christopher Hadnagy wrote the definitive book on social engineering.  In it, he detailed the entire lifecycle of social engineering and pretty much everything you needed to know on the topic.In his just released follow-up Unmasking the Social Engineer: The Human Element of Security, he takes social engineering up a few levels.  While the first book was more of a practical introduction to the topic, this is an advanced title for the serious practitioner.  There is a lot of interesting information and research provided in the book.  But the challenge here is not just reading it; rather it is in mastering its practical use.The book is meant to show the reader how do read a person's body language and facial expressions.  By understanding them, it makes social engineering easier, but also defending against social engineering attacks easier also.  If you can understand how an attacker uses non-verbal behavior, then you can better defend yourself and your organization against them.While the first book was about a standard approach to social engineering, this new title can be seen as advanced social engineering.  The premise of the book is that in order to effectively and fully deal with and defend against social engineering threats, an understanding of how non-verbal communications is used is important.The book notes that much of our everyday communications are nonverbal.  And as its name implies, nonverbal communication is the process of communicating and understanding messaging via mechanisms such as touch, posture, body language, eye movement, eye contact and more.Since social engineers and scammers use these techniques, it is important to understand them in order to defend against them.The books forward is written by Dr. Paul Ekman.  Ekman is a renowned psychologist whose career is deeply enmeshed in non-verbal communications.  Hadnagy's approach is based significantly on methods Ekman developed, much of it starting over 35 years ago.  As to Dr. Ekman, he was ranked in the 100 most cited psychologists of the 20th-century.Of the books 4 parts, half of the book is in part 2 - Decoding The Language of the Body.  The 4 chapters in the section particularize the various aspects of how movements around different body parts can be interpreted.While an interesting read, the techniques detailed in the book are quite complex.  Whereas it is often difficult to understand what people say, understanding their non-verbal communications is not a trivial endeavor.  Readers should therefore not read this 200 page book and expect to come out experts in non-verbal communications.For the serious reader who wants to understand everything they can about the topic of social engineering, Unmasking the Social Engineer: The Human Element of Security should one of the references in their reading arsenal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FFMJOHGB0LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118608577#wasThisHelpful","R37FFMJOHGB0LN","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to documenting the history of cryptography, David Kahn is singularly one of the finest, if not the finest writers in that domain.  For anyone with an interest in the topic, Kahn’s works are read in detail and anticipated.Kahn’s first book was written almost 50 years ago: The Codebreakers – The Story of Secret Writing; which was a comprehensive overview on the history of cryptography.  It is now considered a classic.  Another classic title of his is Seizing the Enigma: The Race to Break the German U-Boats Codes, 1939-1943.  The Codebreakers was so good and so groundbreaking, that some in the US intelligence community wanted the book banned.  They did not bear a grudge, as Kahn became an NSA scholar-in-residence in the mid 1990’s.  In 1996, Kahn updated his classic with a major update in The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet.With such a pedigree, many were looking forward, including myself, to his latest book How I Discovered World War II's Greatest Spy and Other Stories of Intelligence and Code.  While the entire book is fascinating, it is somewhat disingenuous, in that there is no new material in it.  Many of the articles are decades old, and some go back to the late 1970’s.  From the book description and cover, one would get the impression that this is an all new work.  But it is not until ones reads the preface, that it is detailed that the book is simple an assemblage of collected articles.For those that are long-time fans of Kahn, there is nothing new in the book.  For those that want a wide-ranging overview of intelligence, espionage and codebreaking, the book does provide that.The book gets its title from a 2007 article in which Kahn tracked down whom he felt was the greatest spy of World War 2.  That was none other than Hans-Thilo Schmidt, who sold information about the Enigma cipher machine to the French.  That information made its way to Marian Rejewski of Poland, which lead to the ability of the Polish military to read many Enigma-enciphered communications.An interesting question Kahn deals with is the old conspiracy theory that President Franklin Roosevelt and many in is administration knew about the impending attack on Pearl Harbor.  He writes that the theory is flawed for numerous reasons.  Kahn notes that the attack on Pearl Harbor succeeded because of Japan’s total secrecy about the attack.  Even the Japanese ambassador’s in Washington, D.C., whose messages the US was reading were never told of the attack.Chapter 4 from 1984 is particularly interesting which deals with how the US viewed Germany and Japan in 1941.  Kahn writes that part of the reason the US did not anticipate a Japanese attack was due to racist attitudes.  The book notes that many Americans viewed the Japanese as a bucktoothed and bespectacled nation.Chapter 10 Why Germany’s intelligence failed in World War II, is one of the most interesting chapters in the book.  It is from Kahn’s 1978 book “Hitler's Spies: German Military Intelligence In World War II”.In the Allies vs. the Axis, the Allies were far from perfect.  Battles at Norway, Arnhem and the Bulge were met with huge losses.  But overall, the Allies enjoyed significant success in their intelligence, much of it due to their superiority in verbal intelligence because of their far better code-breaking.  Kahn writes that the Germans in contrast, were glaringly inferior.Kahn writes that there were five basic factors that led to the failure of the Germans, namely: unjustified arrogance, which caused them to lose touch with reality; aggression, which led to a neglect of intelligence; a power struggle within the officer corps, which made many generals hostile to intelligence; the authority structure of the Nazi state, which gravely impaired its intelligence, and anti-Semitism, which deprived German intelligence of many brains.The Germans negative attitude towards intelligence went all the way back to World War I, when in 1914 the German Army was so certain of success that many units left their intelligence officers behind.  Jump to 1941 and Hitler invaded Russia with no real intelligence preparation.  This arrogance, which broke Germany’s contact with reality, also prevented intelligence from seeking to resume that contact.Other interesting stories in the book include how the US spied on the Vatican in WW2, the great spy capers between the US and Soviets, and more.For those that want a broad overview of the recent history of cryptography, spying and military intelligence, How I Discovered World War II's Greatest Spy and Other Stories of Intelligence and Code, is an enjoyable, albeit somewhat disjointed summary of the topic.The best part of the book is its broad scope.  With topics from Edward Bell and his Zimmermann Telegram memoranda, cryptology and the origins of spread spectrum, to Nothing Sacred: The Allied Solution of Vatican Codes in World War II and a historical theory of intelligence, the book provides a macro view of the subject.  The down side is that this comes at the cost of the 30 chapters being from almost as many different books and articles, over the course of almost 40 years.For those that are avid readers of David Kahn, of which there are many, this title will not be anything new.  For those that have read some of Kahn’s other works and are looking for more, How I Discovered World War II's Greatest Spy will be an enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30G8CB6TZKQ6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466561998#wasThisHelpful","R30G8CB6TZKQ6C","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cyber Attack, CyberCrime, CyberWarfare - CyberComplacency is definitely not your typical information security title.  Mix in a few parts reference, technical guide, rant, scary stories, comedy and myriad references to movies, and there you have this book.The full title of the book is actually Cyber Attack, CyberCrime, CyberWarfare - CyberComplacency: Is Hollywood's blueprint for Chaos coming true?  In the movies, evil hackers are able to take down entire networks and continents with a single-click.  The book shows where many movie plots are farfetched.  But is also pragmatic enough to detail how the Internet is leading to the point where large DoS attacks can indeed bring done large swaths of the Internet.Osborne uses references to Hollywood movies in order to show the many holes and vulnerabilities in today’s networks.  He seems to be the first one to use the term cybercomplacency; which is intuitively the reason for the majority of information security breaches.  Far too many organizations think that attacks won’t happen to them.The main theme of the book is the threat of DoS and how they are a danger to all networks.  The book spends ample time on DoS mitigation strategies.The book provides enough low-level technical details to give the novice a thorough understanding of the many security threats, but is not so high-level as to bore the more advanced reader.Some of the topics are dealt with on the book’s YouTube page.At under 300 pages, the book will definitely be of interest to CIO’s and those that that need to get the message about DoS and other network security issues.The message in Cyber Attack, CyberCrime, CyberWarfare - CyberComplacency  is both entertaining and serious.  But more importantly, it can’t be ignored.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JOC5ZZJ8QZ6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493581287#wasThisHelpful","R1JOC5ZZJ8QZ6A","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to measuring and communicating threats, the most ineffective example in recent memory was the Homeland Security Advisory System; which was a color-coded terrorism threat advisory scale.The system was rushed into use and its output of colors was not clear.  What was the difference between levels such as high, guarded and elevated?  From a threat perspective, which color was more severe - yellow or orange?  Former DHS chairman Janet Napolitano even admitted that the color-coded system presented “little practical information” to the publicWhile the DHS has never really provided meaningful threat levels, in Threat Modeling: Designing for Security, author Adam Shostack (full disclosure:  Adam and I are friends) has done a remarkable job in detailing an approach that is both achievable and functional.  More importantly, he details a system where organizations can obtain meaningful and actionable information, rather than vague color charts.Rather than letting clueless bureaucrats and Federal agencies define threats, the book details a formal system in which you can understand and particularize the unique threats your organizations faces.In the introduction, Shostack sums up his approach in four questions:  What are you building?  What can go wrong with it once it’s built?  What should you do about those things that can go wrong?  Did you do a decent job of analysis?The remaining 600 densely packed pages provide the formal framework needed to get meaningful answers to those questions.  The book sets a structure in which to model threats, be it in software, applications, systems, software or services, such as cloud computing.While the term threat modeling may seem overly complex, the book notes that anyone can learn to threat model.  Threat modeling is simply using models to find security problems.  The book notes that using a model means abstracting away a lot of the details to provide a look at the bigger picture, rather than the specific item, or piece of software code.An important point the book makes is that there is more than one way to model threats.  People often place too much emphasis on the specifics of how to model, rather than focusing on what provides them the most benefit.  Ultimately, the best model for your organization is the one that helps you determine what the main threats are.  Finally, the point is not just to find the threats; the key is to address them and fix them.The beauty of the book is that it focuses on gaining empirical data around threats for your organization.  Rather than simply taking an approach based on Gartner, USA Today or industry best practices.While the author states a few times that threat modeling is not necessarily a complex endeavor, it nonetheless does take time.  He writes that threat modeling requires involvement from many players from different departments in an organization to provide meaningful input.  Without broad input, the threat model will be lacking, and the output will be incomplete.For those organizations that are willing to put the time and effort into threat modeling, the benefits will be remarkable.  At the outset, they will have confidence that they understand the threats their organization is facing, likely spend less on hardware and software, and will be better protected.Chapter 18 quotes programmer Henry Spencer who observed that “those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly”.  Shostack writes that the same applies to threat modeling.  The point he is making is that there are ways to fail at threat modeling.  The first is simply not trying.  The chapter then goes on into other approaches which can get in the way of an effective threat modeling program.Why should you threat model for your IT and other technology environments?  It should be self-evident from an architecture perspective.  When an architect is designing an edifice, they first must understand their environment and requirements.  A residence for a couple in Manhattan will be entirely different from the design for a residence for a family in Wyoming.  But far too many IT architects take a monolithic approach to threats and that’s precisely the point the book is attempting to obviate.As noted, threat modeling is not overly complex.  But even if it was indeed complex, it is far too important not to be done.  The message of the book is that organizations need to stop chasing vague threats and industry notions of what threats are, and customize things so they deal with their threats.Risk modeling is so important that it must be seen as an essential part of a formal and mature information security program.  Having firewalls, IDS, DLP and myriad other infosec appliances can be deceptive in thinking they provide protection.  But if they are deployed in an organization that has not defined the threats these devices are expected to address, they only serve the purpose of giving an aura of infosec protection, and not real protection itself.Amazon has over 800 Disney World guide books.  Anyone who is going to invest their time and money to spend a few days at Disney World knows they have to do their research in order to get the most out of their visit.There are only a handful of books on this topic and this is perhaps the finest of them.  No tourist would be so nave to go to Disney World uninformed.  And conversely, no one should go into the IT world without adequate threat information.Threat modeling provides compelling benefits in the ability to make better information security decisions, better focus on often limited resources, all while designing a model to protect against current and future threats.For those serious about the topic, Threat Modeling: Designing for Security will be one of the most rewarding information security books they could hope for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQNY8E7IOYCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118809998#wasThisHelpful","R1NQNY8E7IOYCG","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, The Art of the Data Center: A Look Inside the World's Most Innovative and Compelling Computing Environments appears like a standard coffee table book with some great visuals and photos of various data centers throughout the world.  Once you get a few pages into the book, you see it is indeed not a light-read coffee table book, rather an insightful book where some of the brightest minds in the industry share their insights on data center design and construction.The book takes a holistic view of how world-class data centers are designed and built.  Many of the designers were able to start with a greenfield approach without any constraints; while others were limited by physical restrictions.Author Douglas Alger is a data center architect at Cisco (Cisco is highlighted in the book in chapter 6) and has reached out to his peers at 17 other firms to share their insights.  While Alger’s his other two books Grow a Greener Data Center and Build the Best Data Center Facility for Your Business were much more technical, this is more of a middle-ground title.Some of the firms profiled in the book are Citi, Digital Realty Trust (who run the world’s largest data center in Chicago), eBay, Facebook, IBM, Intel and Yahoo!.One of the interesting things about hearing 18 different viewpoints, both from the US and Europe-based firms, is that it shows there is not just one way to build a data center.  Fundamental data center components such as raised floors are reconsidered in some of the data centers in the book.  From UPS, to cooling systems and more, Alger details how the nuances of various data centers have influenced their design.It is an unfortunate reality that many expensive data center builds and expansions fail.  The book profiles those that have succeeded, and it is hoped the reader will take the advice to heart in their build and design.The book is written in an interview style, where Alger asked the designers various question on how their came to their design, the rationale behind it, what their strategy was, what constraints they ran into, and moreThe book highlights a broad range of data centers; from those built into a century old church in Spain, a former Swedish underground military bunker renovated into a modern data center with artificial daylight, manmade waterfalls and submarine engines providing standby power, to those powered by all solar energy.Many of the data centers that he showcases are designed in order to be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and Energy Star certified.  LEED is a rating systems for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of green buildings, homes and neighborhoods, created by the US Green Building Council (USGBC).  It should be noted that as of now, the USGBC hasn’t set specific criteria for data center LEED certification.An important point about LEED made in the book is that for those designers that are thinking about LEED certification, it must be done in the design stage and not as an addendum. Obtaining LEED certification must start at design and end with a formal certification after project completion.  It was noted that consulting with a qualified LEED professional or consulting firm at the start of the planning process is a must.As noted, the book showcases many different aspects and often counterintuitive notions of data center design.  One of the most significant is ACT, Inc., a nonprofit that runs the ACT test – a college admissions and placement test taken by more than 1.3 million high school graduates every year, who decided to runs their active and backup data centers in Iowa City, Iowa just 5 miles apart.  The book details the designer’s rationale behind that.  Similar case studies are detailed in the book.One of the major methods in the book used to reduce power consumption and cost is via the use of virtualization, which many of the data centers have used and optimized.One topic lacking in the book is that Alger did not ask detailed questions around the physical security of the buildings.  Why power, UPS, flooring and the like are critical to the efficacy of a data center; physical security components such as mantraps, access control systems, bollards, surveillance and the like are necessary to ensure all of the previous design items are not placed at risk.One of the questions he asked every designer is if they could go back and design the data center all over again, what; if anything would they do different.  Surprisingly, everyone one of them said that they put a lot of planning in and there was nothing major they would change.  Most of the designers did though say each data center had small items though could have been revisited to make the center better.  Bu most agreed that many of them are so minor in some respects, that it would not be meaningful to go through them.An interesting point the data venter architect at Syracuse University stated is that one of the things they did in constructing their data center was to not necessarily be driven by rules of thumb or best practices.  Rather they looked at their own requirements and how they could best optimize everything that they could in the design of the facility.One common metric used throughout the book is power usage effectiveness (PUE).  It is a measure of how efficiently a computer data center uses energy; specifically, how much energy is used by the computing equipment, as opposed to cooling and other data center overhead.  The lower the number, closest to 1.0, the more of its power is used for computing.Poor data center planning leads to poor use of valuable capital, can significantly  increase operational expense and obviate any computation gains.  Many organizations get overwhelmed on the design and focus far too much on speed and power, without taking a larger holistic view of their data center needs.For those looking for guidance on how to design a world-class data center, The Art of the Data Center: A Look Inside the World's Most Innovative and Compelling Computing Environments should be the place you start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUB272DX3G9B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1587142961#wasThisHelpful","RUB272DX3G9B9","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, brainstorming seems like ice, in that you really don’t need an instruction manual to make it.But that is clearly not the case, as Chauncey Wilson writes in Brainstorming and Beyond: A User-Centered Design Method.The book shows that brainstorming can be most successful and productive when the facilitator knows the proper techniques for getting the most out of the participant’s brains.Wilson shows how brainstorming is more than just getting people in a room with a large supply of Post-It notes and markets.  He writes that brainstorming is often portrayed as simple with only a few rules.  But as you read through the book, he details that brainstorming is a complex social process requiring knowledge of social psychology, motivation and corporate culture.Wilson defines brainstorming as an individual or group method for generating idea, increasing creative efficacy or finding solutions to problems.The goal of a brainstorming session is to generate ideas.  The book details how to extract those ideas from participants in brainstorming sessions.  The book also details two other similar concepts: brainwriting and braindrawing.Brainwriting is a variation on brainstorming in which each person writes ideas down on paper and then passes the paper to a new person who reads the first set of ideas and adds new ones.Braindrawing is a more visual method of brainstorming that helps generate ideas where the function is more illustrative than conceptual.At 75 pages, Brainstorming and Beyond: A User-Centered Design Method is a quick read, and of value to anyone who plans on using brainstorming to the most effective level possible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC5R6E1B6ZN19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0124071570#wasThisHelpful","RC5R6E1B6ZN19","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Narrating a compelling and interesting story about cryptography is not an easy endeavor.  Many authors have tried and failed miserably; attempting to create better anecdotes about the adventures of Alice and Bob.  David Kahn did the best job of it when wrote The Codebreakers: The story of secret writing in 1967 and set the gold standard on the information security narrative.  Kahn's book was so provocative and groundbreaking that the US Government originally censored many parts of it.A lot has changes since 1967, and while Secret History: The Story of Cryptology is not as groundbreaking, it also has no government censorship.  With that, the book is fascinating read that provides a combination of cryptographic history and the underlying mathematics behind it.As a preface; the book has cryptology in its title, which is for the most part synonymous with cryptography.  Since cryptography is more commonly used, I'll use it in this review.Kahn himself wrote that he felt this book is by far the clearest and most comprehensive of the books dealing with the modern era of cryptography including classic ciphers and some of the important historical ones such as Enigma and Purple; but also newer systems such as AES and public-key cryptography.The book claims that the mathematics detailed in it are accessible requiring minimal mathematical prerequisites.  But the reality is that is does require at least a college level understanding, including algebra, calculus and more.As an aside, nearly every book on encryption and cryptography that claims no advanced mathematical knowledge is needed doesn't meet that claim.  With that, Bauer does a good job of separating the two narratives in the book (cryptography and history), so one who is not comfortable with the high-level math can easily parse through those sections.Bauer brings an extensive pedigree to the book, as he is a former scholar-in-residence at the NSA Center for Cryptologic History.  While Bauer has a Ph.D. in mathematics, that does not take away from his ability as an excellent story teller.  And let's face it; telling the story of cryptography in a compelling and readable manner is not an easy task.The 20 chapters in the book follow a chronological development of encryption and cryptography; from Roman times to current times.  Each chapter has a set of exercises.  Besides being extremely well-researched, each chapter has numerous items for further reading and research.Chapters 1-9 are focused on classical cryptology, with topics ranging from the Caesar cipher, Biblical cryptology, to a history of the Vigenère cipher, the ciphers of WW1 and WW2 and more.In chapter 8 World War II: The Enigma of Germany, Bauer does a great job of detailing how the Enigma machine worked, including details regarding the cryptanalysis of the device, both in its rotor wirings and how recovering its daily keys ultimately lead to is being broken.  The chapter also asked the question: what if Enigma had never been broken, and provides a provocative answer to that.Chapter 8 opens with the famous quote from Ben Franklin that ""three may keep a secret if two of them are dead"".  He notes that the best counterexample to that is of the 10,000 people that were involved in the project to break the Enigma.  They all were able to maintain their silence about the project for decades; which clearly shows that large groups can indeed keep a secret.  Bauer notes that it is often a reaction to conspiracy theories that large groups of people could never keep a secret for so long.Chapter 9 provides a fascinating account of the Navajo code talkers.  These were a group of Navajo Indians who were specially recruited during World War II by the Marines to serve in their communications units.  Since the Navajo language was unknown to the Axis powers; it ensured that all communications were kept completely secret.While part 1 is quite interesting; part 2, chapters 10-20 focuses on modern cryptology and is even more fascinating.  Bauer does a fantastic job of encapsulating the last 60 years of cryptography, and covers everything from the origins of the NSA, the development of DES and AES, public key cryptography and much more.The book was printed in March 2013 just before the NSA PRISM surveillance program became public knowledge.  If there is any significant mistake in the book, it is in chapter 11 where Bauer writes that ""everything I've seen and heard at the NSA has convinced me that the respect for the Constitution is a key component of the culture there"".Aside from the incorrect observation about how the NSA treats the Constitution, the book does an excellent job of integrating both the history of cryptography and the mathematical element.  For those that aren't interested in to the mathematics, there is plenty of narrative in the book to keep them reading.This book is the latest in a long line of cryptography narrative, such as The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography by Simon Singh and The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet by David Kahn, and of course the classic cryptography text Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier, and Bauer shows himself to be a master author and story teller.For those looking for a comprehensive and decipherable text on the history of cryptography, this is one of the best on the topic in many years.Kahn's book laid the groundwork that made a book like this possible and Secret History: The Story of Cryptology is a worthy follow-up to that legendary text.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7GHWOXTTE2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466561866#wasThisHelpful","R1W7GHWOXTTE2U","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last month, noted reported Dan Goodin wrote in Security of Java takes a dangerous turn for the worse that people need to beware of increasingly advanced Java exploits. He noted that Java, installed on some three billion devices worldwide, is taking a turn for the worse, thanks to an uptick in attacks targeting vulnerabilities that will never be patched and increasingly sophisticated exploits.While Java insecurity may seem inevitable, it does not have to be, thanks to a great new book out.  Java Coding Guidelines: 75 Recommendations for Reliable and Secure Programs is a follow-up to The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java.It is hard to find a company today that does not have at least a few developers coding in Java. Many large enterprises have scores of Java developers.  While Java has robust security controls, they are only as robust as they are correctly implemented.The book has 75 guidelines in which to write secure Java code.  Each guideline includes detailed requirements for compliance and example of non-compliant code to avoid, which is included.While some of the guidelines are obvious, such as not storing unencrypted sensitive information on the client side and storing passwords using a hash function, many of them are new to the uninitiated Java programmer, which is why this book is greatly needed.This book should be in the hands of anyone that codes in Java.  If a developer is not trained to write secure code, it's inevitable that their code will be insecure.James Gosling, the creator of Java writes in the forward that Java Coding Guidelines: 75 Recommendations for Reliable and Secure Programs highlights the fact that information security is not a feature;  rather it's an attitude toward taking due care at every point.  Gosling found that the book is full of excellent guidance for dealing with those details.

"While teenagers, marketers, and celebrities seem to dominate the sphere of social media, all those connections can be a valuable tool for security professionals. The notion of social media analytics (SNA) didn't even exist a few years ago, but it can enable organizations to mine intelligence from social media conversations.Using Social Media for Global Security is written for cybersecurity professionals, security analysts, policy experts, decision-makers, activists, and law enforcement personnel. It explains how to use the myriad social network communities and SNA to ensure greater levels of security. That said, this is not an easy read. The reader needs to be quite comfortable with the core social networking sites, in addition to advanced networking tools. The user of these techniques should also be comfortable with statistics and advanced analytic techniques.The book notes that terrorists and criminal elements have been exploiting social media for years.

The truth is that all it takes to use Tor is to download it and then click on Start Tor Browser.  For those that want to read the manuals, the Tor documentation repository has detailed information that includes everything a user needs to know about using the product.  The Tor site has numerous manuals, FAQ's and more.  There is likely enough information there for the vast majority of Tor and potential Tor users.At 130 pages, the book is useful for those that want a hard copy to read on a bus or plane and for whatever reason, don't want to print out the references from the Tor site. Loshin does a decent job of presenting the topic, including why Tor is important, and who it could most benefit.Tor was first released in 2002.  But since it became known that the NSA was viewing data, Tor usage has doubled, as detailed in a recent Washington Post article.One of the main drawbacks of Tor, as the book notes in chapter 2 (and also detailed in the Tor FAQ here) is that Tor is slow; really slow.  The FAQ notes that here are many reasons why the Tor network is currently slow.  It is first off important to know that Tor is never going to be extremely fast.  All Tor traffic is bouncing through volunteers' computers in various parts of the world, and bottlenecks and network latency will always be present.  The current Tor network is small compared to the number of people trying to use it, and Tor can't always handle file-sharing traffic load.The book also spends a large amount of space detailing Tails, which is a Linux distro that can booted as a CD or on a USB.  The benefit of Tails is that no trace of it will be left on the host it was run off of.Like Tor, the Tails documentation repository has a large set of documents and FAQs covering all areas of the product.  For those on a budget, this site has everything that they need to know about using Tails.Practical Anonymity: Hiding in Plain Sight Online is a decent start for those who want to be more anonymous.  It is far from a comprehensive guide, as using Tor is just the beginning to start being anonymous, but far from the only resource or method.

Truth be told, that is a hard, if not impossible combination to write for.The reality is that SCADA is not child's play.  The underlying theme of the book is that SCADA is critical to our national infrastructure and that it's ineffectively secured.  Those two things are something nearly everyone can agree on.Written by Robert Lee and effectively illustrated by Jeff Haas, the book is cute and presents its message in a non-threatening way.  Its 26 pages can be completed in less than 5 minutes.A book like Corduroy is one kids will want read to them over and over again.  But while the message in SCADA and Me is critical, I don't think kids will be begging for a second reading.As to management, leaving this book on a desk for management to read might be perceived as insulting.  But then again, our insecure SCADA infrastructure shouldn't be left that way because management couldn't comprehend ideas expressed in a children's book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4W3I5ZHLEQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149127512X#wasThisHelpful","R2H4W3I5ZHLEQT","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been about 8 years since my friend Richard Bejtlich's (note, that was a full disclosure `my friend') last book Extrusion Detection: Security Monitoring for Internal Intrusions came out.  That and his other 2 books were heavy on technical analysis and real-word solutions.  Some titles only start to cover ground after about 80 pages of introduction.  With this highly informative and actionable book, you are already reviewing tcpdump output at page 16.In The Practice of Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response, Bejtlich takes the approach that your network will be attacked and breached.  He observes that a critical part of your security posture must be that of network security monitoring (NSM), which is the collection and analysis of data to help you detect and respond to intrusions.In this book, Bejtlich details how to design a NSM program from the initiation state.  Being a big open source proponent, the book lists no proprietary tools and myriad open source solutions.  The book is designed for system and security administrators, CIRT managers and analysts, incident handlers, NSM architects and engineers with a strong background in understanding threats, vulnerabilities and security log interpretation.The book is about the inevitable, that attackers will get inside your network.  While it's foreseeable they will get in, it's not inevitable that you have to be caught off-guard.  For those who are serious about securing their network, this is an invaluable book that provides a unique and very workable model to create a fully-functioning NSM infrastructure.The book is a hands-on guide to installing and configuring NSM tools.  The reader who is comfortable using tools such as Wireshark, Nmap and the like will be quite at home here.This is a book about how not to be surprised and its 13 chapters detail how to create and manage a NSM program, what to look for, and details myriad tools to use in the process.The focus of the book is not on the planning and defense phases of the security cycle, hopefully, that is already in place in your organization, rather on the actions to take when handling systems that are already compromised or that are on the verge of being compromised.In chapter 1, the book details the difference between continuous monitoring (CM) and NSM; since their terms are similar and many people confuse the two. CM is big in the federal computing space.  The book notes that CM has almost nothing to do with NSM or even with trying to detect and respond to intrusions.  NSM is threat-centric, meaning adversaries are the discussion of the NSM operation; while CM is vulnerability-centric; focusing on configuration and software weaknesses.Also in chapter 1, Bejtlich asks the important question: is NSM legal?  He writes that there is no easy answer to that questions and anyone using or deploying an NSM solution should first consult with their legal counsel; in order not to potentially violate the US Wiretap Act and other laws and regulations.  This is especially true for those who are in European Union (EU) countries, as the EU places a high threshold on information security teams who want to monitor network traffic.  Something as simple as running Wireshark on a corporate network in the US, would require court approval if done on an EU-based network.One of the main NSM tools the book references and details is Security Onion (SO).  SO is a Linux distro for IDS and NSM.  It's based on Ubuntu and the distro contains Snort, Suricata, Bro, Sguil, Squert, Snorby, ELSA, Xplico, NetworkMiner and many other useful security tools.The book details and explains how use these tools in an NSM environment.  An important point Bejtlich makes in chapter 9 regarding the tools, is that analysts need tools to find intruders.  But methodology is more important than just software tools.  Tools collect and interpret data, but methodology provides the conceptual model.  He explains that CIRT analysts must understand how to use tools to achieve a particular goal, but it is imperative and important to start with a good operational model first, and then select tools to provide data supporting that model.The book has a short discussion of how cloud computing effects NSM.  In a nutshell, the cloud throws a monkey wrench into an NSM effort. For example, it is generally not an option for SaaS offerings since customers are limited to the back-end logs.The book closes with the observation that NSM is not just about all the tools that the author spent over 300 pages discussing, rather it is more about the workflows, metrics and collaboration.  Unfortunately, this title does not detail the necessary workflows for a NSM and it is hoped that the follow-up to this book will.The only negative in the book is that as CSO of Mandiant, Bejtlich references his firm's products, mainly their MIR appliance for a CIRT.  In the spirit of objectivity and not trying to have the book come across as marketing PR, if an author is going to mention a product their firm sells, they should also mention alternative solutions.For those looking for a comprehensive guide on the topic of NSM, written by one of the experts in the field, The Practice of Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response is an excellent reference that is certain to make the reader a better information security practitioner, and their network more secure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDVLD9K3YK0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5REN34#wasThisHelpful","R2GDVLD9K3YK0C","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, Professor Harvey Molotch argues that the government is worrying about the wrong things, and wasting huge amounts of money in the process. With a focus on post 9-11 events, he suggests that while significantly more security measures are in place, most people do not feel safer, and it is even arguable whether we are indeed safer.The book takes on a number of very different subjects, including public health via the availability of public restrooms, the 9-11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and more. When it comes to post 9-11 airport security, Molotch shows how the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's reactive security programs have done very little to enhance airport and aviation security.The book provides a fascinating look at the New York subway system and how it dealt with the disaster of 9-11. It also provides a detailed overview of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Not really a fluke, the disaster was expected and predicted. The book notes that numerous water projects, including the creation of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal, meant as a way to provide shipping with a shorter route to the Gulf of Mexico, created a scenario that exacerbated the flooding of New Orleans.For the most part, Dr. Molotch's recommendations for better design and safety are pragmatic. While many make sense, some may be far too radical for Congress or public safety officials. Nonetheless, this contrarian look at many of the security measures we have in place today gives the reader plenty to think about. Perhaps if planners took these ideas to heart, we would be safer and would have spent a lot less on security.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UT6IIPD93YBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=069115581X#wasThisHelpful","R3UT6IIPD93YBF","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Little did anyone know that when the first Hacking Exposed books came out over 15 years ago, that it would launch a set of sequels on topics from Windows, Linux, web development, to virtualization and cloud computing, and much more.  It was a series that launched a generation of script kiddies, in addition to security experts.In 2013, the newest edition is Hacking Exposed Mobile Security Secrets & Solutions.  In this edition, authors Neil Bergman, Mike Stanfield, Jason Rouse & Joel Scambray provide an extremely detailed overview of the security and privacy issues around mobile devices.  The authors have decades of experience in the various mobile topics and bring that to every chapter.The power of mobile devices can be understood by the fact that this book came out in July 2013, and just last week, Steve Ballmer announced that he will step down as Microsoft CEO.  While mobile has spelled the doom to Ballmer's career and Microsoft's bottom line, mobile has the Apple brand relevant again, and extremely dominant.  More of a concern is that mobile is the new avenue of security attacks for a new generation of attackers.The book provides a great overview of the new threats created by mobile devices.  Like the other books in the series, it provides an overview of the issues, shows how attackers will use vulnerabilities to compromise and exploit mobile devices, in addition to showing you how to secure your mobile devices and enterprise mobile platforms against these threats.One of difference between this book and other Hacking Exposed titles, especially the Windows editions, is that this has a dearth of script kiddie tools.  This is due to the fact that such tools don't exist so much for the mobile platforms.The 9 chapters in the book provide a comprehensive and meticulous synopsis of all of the core areas around security and privacy concerns about mobile computing.The first two chapters provide a thorough analysis of the mobile risk ecosystem and how the cellular networks operate.One of the major risks detailed in chapter 1 is that of physical risks.  When data resides in physical data centers, a company can have some semblance of assurance of security given the data has multiple layers of physical controls in an enterprise data center or colocation.  The authors note that physical access to mobile devices is difficult to defend against for very long, and the entire phenomenon of rooting and jailbreaking certainly proves this.They also write that they have yet to find a mobile application that they could not defeat when given physical access, including defeating the mobile device management software.  The book astutely notes that if your mobile risk model assumes that information can be securely stored indefinitely on a physical mobile device, then you are starting with a false assumption.  The entire book is based on the assumption of an attacker gaining control of the mobile device.  To compensate for that, the book provides the requisite countermeasures.Another bit of sagacious advice in the book is ensuring your developers, and those you outsource your development to, understand the specific risks and vulnerabilities around mobile apps.  It is crucial that all programmers developing mobile apps be sufficiently trained in how to write secure mobile apps.Chapter 3 details iOS, the Apple mobile operating system.  An interesting part of the chapter is on how to jailbreak Apple devices.  But the authors also note that there are pros and cons to jailbreaking.  The main negative is that you expose yourself to a variety of attack vectors that could lead to a complete compromise of the device.  A non-jailbroken device obviates that in most cases given the security controls in place.The book also sheds light on the fact that even those iOS is a closed system with less threat vectors, it is still far from perfect.  The Apple App Store, even with its security controls, is far from impervious to attack.  The chapter tells the story of a few malicious apps that slipped past security reviews and found themselves on the Apple App Store.  While these malicious apps were later removed, they will there long enough to cause damage.While the book provides ample evidence of the risk and vulnerabilities around mobile devices, it is rich in appropriate countermeasures and methods to compensate for these.  The chapters on iOS and Android provide myriad ways in which to secure the devices.  Chapter 8 on mobile development security details a framework in which to secure mobile devices.  This framework includes requirements from secure communications, effective authentication, preventing information leakage, to platform controls and more.Appendix A contains a checklist of options that end-users can use to ensure the security of their private data and sensitive information stored on their mobile devices.Appendix B is a mobile application penetration testing toolkit for performing security assessment of mobile technologies.The press is full of stories of how the demise of Microsoft is directly related to their misreading the mobile market.  The public has responded to buying mobile devices in the billions, and attackers who not so long ago wrote exploits for Windows, are now putting their efforts into iOS and Android.  The message is clear, mobile apps need to be written with security in mind and the mobile devices need to be secured.For those looking for an understanding of current mobile security threats and how to counter them, Hacking Exposed Mobile Security Secrets & Solutions is a uniquely good book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DSUWF6RPQS7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071817018#wasThisHelpful","R3DSUWF6RPQS7H","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diet books are literally a dime a dozen.  They generally benefit only the author, publisher and Amazon, leaving the reader frustrated and bloated.  With a failure rate of over 99%, diet books are the epitome of a sucker born every minute.One of the few diet books that can offer change you can believe in is The Healthy Programmer: Get Fit, Feel Better, and Keep Coding. Author Joe Kutner observes that nearly every popular diet fails and the reason is that they are based on the premise of a quick fix without focusing on the long-term core issues.  It is inevitable that these diets will fail and the dieters at heart know that.  It is simply that they are taking the wrong approach.  This book is about the right approach; namely a slow one.  With all of the failed diet books, Kutner is one of the few that has gotten it right.While the title of the book says it's for programmers, it is germane to anyone whose job requires them to be at a desk for extended amounts of time.Kutner is himself a programmer who builds Ruby and Rails applications, and a former college athlete and Army Reserve physical fitness trainer.The book focuses on two areas that require change: regular exercise and proper nutrition; and it details the steps necessary to create a balanced lifestyle.While popular diet books require rapid and major lifestyle changes and promise quick weight-loss, the book notes that small changes to your habits can provide the long-term effects that can improve your health.  The book focuses on incremental changes and sustainability, not about losing x pounds in x weeks.The book is different (read: effective) as opposed to other diet and lifestyle books, in that its goal is to make your healthy lifestyle pragmatic, attainable, and fun.  It is only with those aspects that long-term change be possible.As to programmers, Kutner writes that programming requires intense concentration that often causes them to neglect other aspects of their lives; the most common of which is their health.  People's bodies have not evolved to accommodate a lifestyle of sitting and there are many negative health effects from it.The book takes a start small approach, rather than one of drastic changes.  In chapter 2, it notes the myriad benefits of walking.  It states that walking is a powerful activity that can stimulate creative thinking (a required trait for a good programmer) and is a great way to bootstrap your health.  The chapter details the ways in which a few short walks during the day can have a dramatic positive effect on your life.Chapter 3 is about the dangers of chairs and sitting for long periods of time.  It details a number of ways to counter the dangers of sitting.  It also notes that while sometimes you simply can't get away from your chair, and when that happens, you can make sitting less dangerous by forcing your muscles to contract without even getting up.  It then details a number of different calisthenics to use to do this.Chapter 4 - Agile Dieting - is perhaps the best part of the book.  It details how to fight the real causes of weight gain and details proven solutions that work.  That chapter repeatedly uses terms like iterative, sustainable, slow to show what it really takes to lose weight and achieve a healthy lifestyle.Kutner notes that most of the popular fad diets are idiosyncratic and unbalanced.  They will provide short-term benefits, but ultimately fail miserably.  The chapter quotes research data on what needs to be in a balanced diet.  It then notes that almost every fad diet violates those needs.  Nutrition needs to be rounded and well-balanced and the fad diets for that reason will only work in the short term.This book is everything the fad diet books are not and this is most manifest in chapter 4 where Kutner writes one should cut calories slowly.  This is based on research which shows that quick drastic weight loss is counterproductive.  While the fad diets talk about drastic caloric changes, Kutner suggests dropping your intake slower, about 100 calories every two weeks until you get you your targeted caloric intake level.While much of the book is on fitness and nutrition, it takes a complete body approach.  Chapter 5 details the importance of eye health.  This is an important topic since the average programmer spends much of their week behind a monitor.Kutner writes about computer vision syndrome (CVS); an eye condition resulting from focusing the eyes on a monitor for extended amounts of time. Symptoms of CVS include headaches, blurred vision, neck pain, redness in the eyes, fatigue, eye strain, dry eyes, irritated eyes, double vision, vertigo/dizziness, polyopia, and difficulty refocusing the eyes.  The book also details methods in which to minimize the effects of CVS, and how not to become a victim of it.  Kutner writes that CVS is what most programmers refer to as life.  But it does not have to be that way.The rest of the book covers other physical ailments that plague programmers.  This runs the gamut from headaches, backaches, wrist problem, carpel tunnel, head strain and much more.  Most of these problems can be obviated if one follows proper ergonomics practices and employs some of the physical conditioning detailed in the book.Another area where Kutner goes against the tide is with stretching.  For many people, stretching is an integral part of their pre-workout preparation.  In the book, he quotes research that stretching may do more harm than good, and ultimately provides little benefit for most people.Another theme of the book is using goals as an impetus for change.  The book lists 16 goals which can be used as a progressive framework to improve your health.  These goals include buying a pedometer, finding your resting heart rate, getting a negative result on Reverse Phalen's test and other lifestyle changes.Given the preponderance of obesity, diabetes and other maladies associated with a sedentary lifestyle, this may be one of the most important non-programming books that every developer should read and take to heart.The book has hundreds of bits of excellent advice and subtle lifestyle suggestions that over time can make a significant difference to your health.The book concludes with the observation that programmers often say the hardest part of software development begins when a product is released.  The real work, maintenance, continues on, much like your health.  You must sustain a stat of wellness for the rest of your life, and you need to continue setting goals, iterating and making small improvements,For many programmers, they love their job but not the lifestyle problems that come with it.  For the programmer that wants the challenges of the professional and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, The Healthy Programmer: Get Fit, Feel Better, and Keep Coding, may be a life changing book, and should find its rightful place on every programmer's desk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K835F9ZP08C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937785319#wasThisHelpful","R1K835F9ZP08C6","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SlideShare is a free web 2.0 based slide hosting service where users can upload presentation-based files. Launched in October 2006, it's considered to be similar to YouTube, but for slideshows.  It was originally meant to be used for businesses to share slides among employees more easily, but it has since expanded to also become a host of a large number of slides which are uploaded merely to entertain. SlideShare gets an estimated 58 million unique visitors a month and has about 16 million registered users.With such a strong user base, authors Kit Seeborg and Andrea Meyer write in Present Yourself: Using SlideShare to Grow Your Business how SlideShare users can use the site (including other similar collaborative sites such as Prezi and Scribd) to present their story to a worldwide audience.  Given that visual presentations are the new language of business, understanding how to maximize their potential can be a valuable asset for the entrepreneur, job seeker and everyone in between.The truth is that a book on SlideShare alone would need no more than 15 pages (20 pages if you include the Pro edition).  How difficult is it to upload a PowerPoint?  As an aside, the truth is that there is a huge market for publishing freely available content.  Check out Emereo Publishers on Amazon.  They have mastered the art of taking free Wikipedia content and charging for it.  Enough digression - in this valuable book - the authors show not only how to use the product, but how to maximize its use.In eight detailed and concise chapter, the book shows the reader how to create presentations that stand out.  The chapters are:1 - Visual Thinking2 - Getting Started3 - Events and Public Speaking4 - Content5 - Sell, Sell, Sell6 - Research and Collaboration7 - Recruiting, Hiring, and Getting Hired8 - Organizational Outreach and CommunicationThroughout the book, the authors quote liberally from science and research on the power of visualization.  With that lies the inherent power of SlideShare, as humans like images and think more efficiently when they use them.  The authors quote a study which shows that when carrying out routine office tasks, if the data is displayed more visually (such as through visual maps), individuals are 17% more productive and need to use 20% fewer mental resources.  As to the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words; the authors show that it has a basis in biological fact.The book is worth it just for the sage advice in the quote at the beginning of chapter 3 where Nancy Duarte, author of slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations states about presentations, that ""they didn't come to your presentation to see you.  They came to find out what you can do for them.  Success means giving them a reason for taking their time, providing content that resonates, and ensures it's clear what they are to do"".  Using Duarte's call to arms with the guidance in the book can hopefully start a meaningful change in how data is presented.As to the presentation itself, the book notes that the presenter of today has a huge challenge in keeping the audience engaged.  Anyone who has presently recently knows that many, often a majority of the audience will be distracted by their smartphones, Twitter, Facebook, Angry Birds and more.  With that, presenters must put in extra effort to compete for the mindshare of a distracted audience.  The book shows you how to overcome such obstacles and suggests that one way to win more audience attention is to include engaging visual slides with your presentation and show them intermittently instead of in parallel with your talk.Throughout the book, it is clear that the authors are passionate about the topic and it lists many resources and uses to make presentation much more effective.  The book has numerous real-world examples of such users.  One is Adam Tratt of Haiku Deck; a free presentation app for the iPad that makes presentations simple, beautiful, and fun.Another example is that of Jeremiah Owyang of the Altimeter Group, a research and advisory firm whose reports consistently rank in the top 100 most viewed documents on SlideShare.  The amazing thing about their research, which competing firms charge thousands of dollars for, is that it is all free on SlideShare.  The example also shows how they use SlideShare Pro for the secure creation of the reports.  They view this model of open research as a core asset that has served the firm well, establishing its credibility and reputation as a trusted resourceWhile the book has business in its title, it still has significant relevance for end-users, specifically in chapter 7.  There it details how you can use SlideShare to further your career and find a job.  This is crucial regardless of your profession and industry, in that while the traditional resume is still alive and well, the ability to place your experience on-line opens up new horizons.  A full professional presence requires both a paper resume and an online presence.The chapter notes that a comprehensive online presence, especially with a compete profile on LinkedIn, is forty times more likely to receive job opportunities.  The authors note that even if a person is not a presenter, there are things they can do on SlideShare to highlight themselves; including a presentation that serves as a visual resume of their career, a portfolio presentation that displays their creative work and more.  Even for those who are not speakers, the authors recommend that the serious job searcher consider public speaking as part of their career strategy,For those that want to take a look, the first chapter of the book is available here.  Not surprisingly, it is on SlideShare.For those that want to learn everything about online presentations and how to design effective presentations, they may need a more comprehensive guide.But for those that have the basic capabilities and want to learn everything about SlideShare, from the mundane of adding a SlideShare widget to your website, sharing your presentation across social platforms, sharing your content, collaboration, finding a more rewarding job and much more, Present Yourself: Using SlideShare to Grow Your Business is a great resource.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLM915KCUTZM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449342361#wasThisHelpful","RLM915KCUTZM3","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a title like Cloud Computing: Theory and Practice, this book sounds like it is a reference for a general audience, providing a general introduction to what cloud computing is all about.Author Dan Marinescu, Ph.D is a computer science professor at the University of Central Florida, and the book is written for the college level reader, who has a strong interest in cloud computing; combined with an equally strong background in mathematics and statistics.The book starts by taking a broad approach to the topic, rather than just jumping into cloud computing details.  Chapters 1 and 2 detail computer networks in general, and then gets into parallel and distributed computing systems.  Already in chapter 2, the book gets into the mathematics of cloud computing, and details cloud issues such as how the causality of local events can be derived from the process history and the transitivity of the causal relationship.In chapter 3, the book gets into specific about the cloud, with an overview and comparison of Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud initiatives.From a security perspective, chapter 9 details the specifics of cloud security.  It provides a high-level overview of the top concerns for cloud users and those designing cloud-based systems and various other cloud security risks.For those looking for a more basic overview of cloud computing, Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architecture is the best book on the topic.As to Cloud Computing: Theory and Practice it's an excellent resource for those tasked with developing and architecting sophisticated cloud systems and applications.  The book also details how to integrate CDN (content delivery networks) into the cloud.About half of the book includes advanced mathematics that may either be irrelevant or incomprehensible for most readers.With that, many cloud initiatives have failed since the designers really believed the marketing gibberish that sophisticated cloud applications could be deployed in days.  Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architecture details the many benefits of the cloud, but also the complexities that must be addressed for migrations to the cloud to be successful.For architects of sophisticated cloud solutions, Cloud Computing: Theory and Practice will prove to be an invaluable resource.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDNW3OYUY348/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0124046274#wasThisHelpful","R2HDNW3OYUY348","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every organization has external software, hardware and 3rd-party vendors they have to deal with.  In many cases, these vendors will have direct access to the corporate networks, confidential and proprietary data and more.  Often the software and hardware solutions are critical to the infrastructure and security of the organization.  If the vendors don't have effective information security and privacy controls in place, your data is at risk.  In addition, when selecting a product to secure your organization, how to you ensure that you are selecting the correct product?  All of this is critical as in the event of a breach, when the lawyers start circling, they will be serving subpoenas to your company, not your 3rd-party vendors.With that, Assessing Vendors: A Hands-On Guide to Assessing Infosec and IT Vendors is a valuable resource for those looking for a basic introduction on of how to understand the risks involved when sharing data with 3rd-parties, in addition to selecting the appropriate products for your organization.Many Fortune 1000 organizations have formal programs and processes to evaluate the vendors they interact with, in addition to software and hardware procurement.  For those that don't, this 80 page reference is a good place to start.The book shows you how to find the right balance between performing a superficial assessment and one that is way too deep.While the book has a healthy dose of checklists, it is not about simply acting like an auditor filling out the checklists and adding up the totals.  Author Josh More writes that robust information assurance processes and regulations aside; successful vendor management involves a wide range of skills; from technical assessment to business communications, to negotiation and much more.An effective aspect of the book is that it has many questions that you should ask the vendor as part of the assessment process.  Too many organizations simply take the vendors word, without performing effective due diligence.  Rarely will one find a company where too many questions were asked to the vendor.Given that the book is but a short 80 page, More writes that it focuses mainly on the initial assessment process, with a goal to select a vendor to solve a specific problem that your organization is experiencing, improving an existing process or adding new capabilities.  Given its short length, the book does not delve very deeply into the continued operation of a formal vendor management program.For those that need a larger more formal guide, they may want to turn to Forrester and Gartner for their processes which are more formalized and detailed, and offer a turn-key solution.The main thrust of the first chapter is around preliminary vendor research.  It shows how to identify vendors for specific products and build criteria for effective vendor selection.An important point in chapter 1 is that the primary rule in vendor assessment and selection is to always keep your needs first in mind.  Far too many organizations let the vendors drive the process, and in turn, the vendor will ensure that their needs are made primary.One of the topics in chapter 3 is testing confidentiality.  When comparing vendors, they will often swear that their product is secure; but will often not provide any details attesting to how secure it really is.  The chapter shows how you can perform internal hands-on testing to ensure all of the promised security features do in truth work.The book provides a lot of common sense advice that may not be intuitive to many people.  One bit of invaluable advice to taking the steps to confirm that the vendor you are considering is not selling you gray or black market products.  This is especially true for products from Cisco, Check Point and Juniper, which are rampant on the gray and black markets.  While buying gray market products may initially be cheaper, they can be much more expensive in the long run when you find out that the warranties you paid for are worthless.In chapter 4, the book does a good job of showing how to score vendors.  It details how you can create questionnaires and use the data to assist in your selection.  The chapter stresses that after all of the data is scored, weighted and sorted; you should not expect to find a vendor with a normalized score of 100%.  More writes that if you do a good job of creating the right questions on the questionnaire, you will seldom see a vendor higher than the 80-90% range.A good point the book makes in chapter 5 on testing, is that when a vendor requires you to sign an NDA prior to testing; such a request is a fundamental mark of mistrust.  If the vendor is unwilling to negotiate the NDA, it may be worth replacing them with a vendor who is more willing to work with you.After you have done all of the dirty work of a vendor selection, the book closes with a few pages on how to avoid vendor manipulation.  It is not unusual for vendor to fudge the information they provide you with, which will skew the results in their favor.Another point to consider in the vendor selection process is that vendors benefit greatly from lock-in.  The harder they can make it for you to move to another vendor, the more likely they are to get annual renewals.Selecting a vendor is not a trivial process, and it not intuitive to many organizations.  Given the breadth of the topic, the book is a great place to start your work on this important process.The book doesn't claim to be an all-inclusive resource for the topic.  And at 80 pages, one should not expect it to be.But for those looking to a highly tactical guide to start them on the road to vendor assessments, Assessing Vendors: A Hands-On Guide to Assessing Infosec and IT Vendors is a most helpful book to start with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5G1Y95Z54L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0124096077#wasThisHelpful","R2S5G1Y95Z54L2","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cloud computing is certainly a hot topic.  Every business magazine is filled with article and advertisements on the topic.  A July 2013 search on Amazon has 4,723 books on cloud computing.With that plethora of titles available, the recently released Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology &  Architecture is an exceptionally good book and an indispensable reference on the topic.One of the concerns of a book such as this with 3 authors, is that there is no integration, and the book would come out as a difficult read.The opposite is the case, as authors Thomas Erl, Ricardo Puttini and Zaigham Mahmood have created a superb introductory text on the topic of cloud computing.The book is a comprehensive overview of all of the aspects of cloud computing.  The authors make ample use of figures and diagrams, and do an outstanding job of making many of the abstract ideas around cloud computing quite comprehensible.For those interested in the security and privacy aspects of cloud computing, chapter 6 details the fundamentals of cloud security.  But this is not a cloud security reference, rather a general reference.The mark of a good author is their ability to make a book readable.  While cloud computing may not be a compelling topic, the authors have created a book that is fascinating a readable.For anyone looking to get a highly technical overview of all of the core aspects of cloud computing, one is hard pressed to find a better reference than Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology &  Architecture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R267JKKY4WNDOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133387526#wasThisHelpful","R267JKKY4WNDOV","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's said that truth is stranger than fiction, as fiction has to make sense.  Had The Chinese Information War: Espionage, Cyberwar, Communications Control and Related Threats to United States Interests been written as a spy thriller, it would have been a fascinating novel of international intrigue.But the book is far from a novel.  It's a dense, but well-researched overview of China's cold-war like cyberwar tactics against the US to regain its past historical glory and world dominance.Author Dennis Poindexter shows that Chinese espionage isn't made up of lone wolves.  Rather it's under the directive and long-term planning of the Chinese government and military.Many people growing up in the 1940's expressed the sentiment ""we were poor, but didn't know it"".  Poindexter argues that we are in a cyberwar with China; but most people are oblivious to it.Rather than being a polemic against China, Poindexter backs it up with extensive factual research. By the end of the book, the sheer number of guilty pleas by Chinese nationals alone should be a staggering wake-up call.In February, Mandiant released their groundbreaking report APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units, which focused on APT1, the most prolific Chinese cyber-espionage group that Mandiant tracked.  APT1 has conducted a cyber-espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006.  The report has evidence linking them to China's 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army.China is using this cyberwar to their supreme advantage and as Poindexter writes on page 1: until we see ourselves in a war, we can't fight it effectively.  Part of the challenge is that cyberwar does not fit the definition of what a war generally is because the Chinese have changed the nature of war to carry it out.Poindexter makes his case in fewer than 200 pages and provides ample references in his detailed research; including many details, court cases and guilty verdicts of how the Chinese government and military work hand in hand to achieve their goalsThe book should of interest to everyone given the implications of what China is doing.  If you are planning to set up shop in China, be it R&D, manufacturing or the like, read this book.  If you have intellectual property or confidential data in China, read this book as you need to know the risks before you lose control of your data there.Huawei Technologies, a Chinese multinational telecommunications equipment and services firm; now the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world is detailed in the book.  Poindexter details a few cases involving Huawei and writes that if Huawei isn't linked to Chinese intelligence, then it's the most persecuted company in the history of international trade.The book details in chapter 2 the intersection between cyberwar and economic war.  He writes that any foreign business in China is required to share detailed design documents with the Chinese government in order to do business there.  For many firms, the short-term economic incentives blind them to the long-term risks of losing control of their data.  The book notes that in the Cold War with Russia, the US understood what Russia was trying to do.  The US therefore cut back trade with Russia, particularly in areas where there might be some military benefit to them.  But the US isn't doing that with China.Chapter 2 closes with a damming indictment where Poindexter writes that the Chinese steal our technology, rack up sales back to us, counterfeit our goods, take our jobs and own a good deal of our debt.  The problem he notes is that too many people focus solely on the economic relations between the US and China, and ignore the underpinnings of large-scale cyber-espionage.Chapter 6 details that the Chinese have developed a long-term approach.  They have deployed numerous sleepers who often wait decades and only then work slowly and stealthily.  A point Poindexter makes many times is that the Chinese think big, but move slow.Chapter 7 is appropriately titles The New Cold War.  In order to win this war, Poindexter suggest some radical steps to stop it. He notes that the US needs to limit trade with China to items we can't get anywhere else.  He says not to supply China with the rope that will be used to hang the US on.He writes that the Federal Government has to deal with the issue seriously and quickly, to protect its telecommunications interests so that China isn't able to cut it all off one day.  He also notes that national security must no longer take a backseat to price and cheap labor.Poindexter writes that the US Government must take a long-view to the solution and he writes that it will take 10 years to build up the type of forces that that would be needed to counter the business and government spying that the Chinese are doing.Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is the archetypal wake-up call book.  Poindexter has written his version of Silent Spring, but it's unlikely that any action will be taken.  As the book notes, the Chinese are so blatantly open about their goals via cyber-espionage, and their denials of it so arrogant, that business as usual simply carries on.The Chinese portray themselves as benevolent benefactors, much like the Kanamits in To Serve Man.  Just as the benevolence of the Kanamits was a faade, so too is what is going on with the cold cyberwar with China.The book is an eye-opening expose that details the working of the Chinese government and notes that for most of history, China was the world's dominating force.  The Chinese have made it their goal to regain that dominance.The book states what the Chinese are trying to accomplish and lays out the cold facts.  Will there be a response to this fascinating book?  Will Washington take action?  Will they limit Chinese access to strategic US data?  Given Washington is operating in a mode of sequestration, the answer should be obvious.The message detailed in The Chinese Information War: Espionage, Cyberwar, Communications Control and Related Threats to United States Interests should be a wake-up call.  But given that it is currently ranked #266,881 on Amazon, it seems as if most of America is sleeping through this threat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPBUTNPHJZMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786472715#wasThisHelpful","R3KPBUTNPHJZMM","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Exploding the Phone: The Untold Story of the Teenagers and Outlaws who Hacked Ma Bell, author Phil Lapsley was able to track down many of the original phone phreaks and get their story.  Many of them, even though the years have passed and statute of limitations expired, had asked Lapsley not to use their real names.While parts of the story have been told before, Lapsley's far-reaching research brings many of the central characters into a single read, resulting in an extremely interesting and engrossing read.When Alexander Graham Bell created his harmonic telegraph, which would later turn into the telephone, it was like the Internet, built for functionality, with no inherent security controls.  Those security vulnerabilities were begging to be found, and when they were discovered by the phone phreaks, it was a wake-up call to AT&T.Defining a phone phreak is just as challenging as defining a hacker; as it means different things to different people.  Lapsley defines it as ""someone who loves exploring the telephone system and experimenting with it to understand how it works.What the phone phreaks did was to spend endless hours dialing different numbers to understand how the inner-workings of the telephone system operated.  Meaningless sounds to most people were music to the phreaks as they could determine how calls were routed via these tones.Many of the phreaks practiced what is today known as social engineering and would impersonate phone company employees and technicians.The devices that enabled them to make phone calls were called black boxes, blue boxes, and red boxes.  The book notes that Steve Wozniak (who wrote the foreward to the book) and Steve Jobs sold blue boxes before they started Apple.  In fact, Jobs is quoted as saying that if they hadn't built blue boxes, there wouldn't have been an Apple.The book has many layers to it.  One part is an interesting history of the telephone and long-distance communications.  It then segues into phone phreaks, who much like early computer hackers, used the phone network as a portal for exploration and hacking.  The vast majority of the phone phreaks did it for the thrill, rather than just to make free phone calls.One of the things the phone phreaks did was to read as much corporate documentation and manuals (obtained both legally and serendipitously) as they could.  Lapsley notes that many of the technical documents that the phone company shared were in truth highly confidential.As AT&T was a monopoly (and a hostile one at that) with zero competition, the notion that someone would use their own technical documentation against them was inconceivable.  Lapsley writes that for reasons of corporate pride, national service and public relations, AT&T felt an obligation to share its latest and greatest technical feats with the public.  For that reason, the Bell System Technical Journal was required reading for every phone phreak.The books web site has available many of the technical documents detailed in the book that played a role in the development of phone phreaking.  Included is the article a 1971 article from Esquire Secrets of the Little Blue Box by Ron Rosenbaum, that AT&T was able to suppress.The book details many similarities between the phone phreaks and the early Internet hackers.  While law enforcement stated that Kevin Mitnick could launch missiles via whistling into the phone, law enforcement called the phone phreaks a public menace, mentally unstable, a national threat and much more.Like early hackers, the phone phreaks showed how engineering insiders are often the last to know what is actually possible with the systems they design.  Lapsley noted that part of the problem was pride, in that Bell Labs had created the public telephone switching network, and they didn't want to admit how vulnerable it was.  Its engineers were spring-loaded to disbelieve reports to the contrary.Another advantage the phone phreaks, like hackers, had is that the Bells Labs engineers only looked at the systems as how it was supposed to work.  That blinded them to how the system actually did work and how it could be made to do things it was never designed to do,The results were that they couldn't see the holes in their own network; holes that a blind teenager found.  Even when that blind teenage told them of the problem, (the book tells the story of Joe Engressia), they didn't understand it when first described to them.The book describes another major technical security oversight made by AT&T in 1970 with the introduction of the telephone credit card. Lapsley writes that fraud was epidemic as AT&T's credit card numbering system was a bad joke from a security perspective.  The card numbers were easy to guess and highly predictable resulting in millions of dollars of related fraudulent calls.One of the main recurring characters in the book is John Draper, better known as Captain Crunch.  Draper made a lot of money as a legitimate software engineer, but lost it due to his business naiveté and personal demons. Draper had numerous arrests related to phone phreaking and served time in prison.The book notes that Draper's arrest in 1976 is a textbook case of how not to deal with the FBI when arrested.  One of the incredulous things Draper did when he was read his rights was to waive them.  While the FBI didn't have a search warrant, he voluntarily allowed them to search his apartment and Volkswagen Van, where incriminating evidence was indeed discovered.While Draper was later convicted, the book quotes a fascinating observation by a phone company employee in that 90% of the phone phreak and hacker cases, law enforcement in fact had no criminal case.  Most of the evidence they had was things they couldn't be prosecuted for.  Either there was no legitimate crime on the books or all they had was the phone phreaks confession, but no tangible evidence.It wasn't just the phone phreaks who were raising havoc on the phone company networks.  The book writes of others who used black boxes and blue boxes for free calls. From Mafia bookies, to the Hare Krishna movement making fraudulent long-distance phone calls.The book closes in 1982 when the US Dept. of Justice and AT&T came to an agreement to break up Ma Bell in the Baby Bells.Lapsley has a degree in electrical engineering from UC. Berkeley so he as a deep first-hand understanding of the technology he is writing about.  He also has the unique ability to write about bland technical topics and make them both engaging and comprehendible. He understands directly the curiosity the phone phreaks had and the passion to understand the inner workings of the phone system.For a book that ends over 30 years ago, Phil Lapsley does a superb job of writing the story of the glory days of phone phreaking.  In 2013, the notion of a domestic long-distance call is for the most not in anyone's lexicon. But making free long-distance calls was the mantra of the phone phreaks.Exploding the Phone is the first comprehensive history of the era of phone phreaking and Lapsley has done a masterful job a making the story fascinating and readable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ZQV6HRDUEG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080212061X#wasThisHelpful","R21ZQV6HRDUEG3","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had Locked Down: Information Security for Lawyers not been published by the American Bar Association (ABA) and 2 of its 3 authors not been attorneys; one would have thought the book is a reproach against attorneys for their obliviousness towards information security and privacy.  In numerous places, the book notes that lawyers are often clueless when it comes to digital security.With that, the book is a long-overdue and valuable information security reference for anyone, not just lawyers.Such a title is needed as the legal field has embraced digital technology for nearly every aspect of the legal field, has magazines and conferences about legal technology and much more.  Wireless (often insecure) networks are pervasive in corporate offices throughout legal America.The underlying problem is that while attorneys often know the intricacies of tort law, court proceedings and the like; they are utterly unaware of the information security and privacy risks surrounding the very technologies they are using.  In many firms, the lawyers think that someone is protecting their data, but don't understand their requirements around those areas of data protection.Legal IT systems are a treasure trove of personal data. Many small law firms are extremely attractive to identity thieves gives their systems have significant amount of personal information via social security numbers, credit card information, birth dates, financial information and much more.  Small law firms are notorious for weak information security controls and attackers will scan those systems and networks for vulnerabilities.A pervasive aspect of the book is ABA rule 1.6 regarding the confidentiality of information regarding client-lawyer relationships. The rule requires that a lawyer not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent.  The lawyer though can reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary.  The myriad details of 1.6 can be left to the bar association to enforce, suffice to say that a lawyer can find themselves on the wrong side of the law if they are not careful with information security controls.The authors note that although lawyers are all well aware of rule 1.6, the challenge is how to keep client data secure in the digital age.  In a world of paper, things were much easier and cheaper  This is why the authors note that so many otherwise competent layers fails so miserably in reference to their duty to maintain the confidentiality of digital client data.The book quotes an ABA 2011 technology survey in which 21% of large law firms reported that their firm had experiences some sort of security breach, and 15% of all firms reported that they suffered a security breach.  It is figures like those which show that attorneys really need to read this book and take the information to heart.The books 17 chapters are in a readable 150 pages, with an additional 120 pages of appendices.  Written in an easily understandable style and non-technical for the technologically challenge lawyer.When it comes to the security of client data, in chapter 4 the authors write that encryption is a topic that most attorneys don't want to touch with a ten-foot pole.  But it has reached a point where attorneys must understand how and when encryption should be used.  Just as important, they need to know about key managements, and what good encryption is.  The chapter provides a high-level detail on what needs to be done regarding encryption.Chapter 13 is on secure disposal, is an important topic to everyone, and not just lawyers. Digital media needs to be effectively disposed of; and for many lawyers, they often think that means reformatting a hard drive or simply erasing files. The chapter effectively details the issues and offers numerous valuable hardware and software-based solutions.Chapter 14 on outsourcing and cloud computing is an area where too many attorneys are oblivious to of the security and privacy risks.  For example, the authors advise attorneys against the use of the free Gmail service since the terms of service allow Google to do anything it wants with the data.  That opens a Pandora's Box when it comes to securing client data.  The authors advise to use premium Google business versions, so attorneys can stay in control of their data with added security and privacy features.Two omissions in chapters 13 and 14 are that the authors don't reference NAID (National Association for Information Destruction) or the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).Firms that outsource their digital disposal to non-NAID certified firms run the risk of having a glorified recycler do their work. As to NAID, it is an international trade association for companies providing information destruction services. NAID's mission is to promote the information destruction industry and the standards and ethics of its member companies; while the mission of the CSA is to promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within cloud computing and to provide education on the uses of cloud computing to help secure all other forms of computing.The authors include many real-world stories and case law to reinforce their point.The book closes with a number of appendices on various rules from the FTC, state information protection regulations, the SANS Institute glossary of security terms and more.For the lawyer looking for an easy to read introduction to nearly everything they need to know about information security and privacy, the book is a great resource.The book closes with the note that since lawyers have an ethical duty to protect their client's data, they have no choice but to keep themselves as well educated as possible.For the attorney that wants to ensure their requirements remain current and are looking for an easy to read introduction about information security and privacy Locked Down: Information Security for Lawyers should be considered required reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPNGYSWANZWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1614383642#wasThisHelpful","R2LPNGYSWANZWL","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the challenges in reading The Plateau Effect: Getting from Stuck to Success is figuring how to classify it.  Amazon has it ranked mainly in applied psychology, but also time management and inexplicable personal finance.  In some ways it is all of the above and more.  In fewer than 300 pages, the authors reference myriad different areas of science, mathematics, psychology and more; in the effort to show the reader how they can elevate themselves from the stuff in life that glues them to the status quo.With that, the premise of the book is that the plateau effect is something that affects everyone.  We all have our ups and down in life, relationships, work and more.  The book attempts to help the reader identify plateaus in their life, in order to break through them.While a plateau is often simply flat terrain, the authors are all over the terrain in the book.  They quote and reference liberally from science, statistics, life sciences, psychology, ethics, information technology and much more.  From that end, the book is a fascinating and insightful read.At the start of the book, the authors use the term acclimation to refer to the plateaus that many of us reach. This is the inability to notice changes in the environment around us.  To a degree, acclimation is a critical element of our lives.  If everything was brand new, life would be overwhelming; both to our senses and psyche. The downside is that this acclimation often leads us to accepting things the way they are, staying at the plateau, getting stuck and the inability to move forward.The authors note that a real plateau means that you have stopped growing and that your mind and senses are being dulled by sameness; by a routine that sucks the life and soul out of you.  Plateaus force you to make bad decisions and feel desperate.  By understanding the force and tapping into it, you can get more out of life with less effort, and feel more in tune to your existence.  If this scares you that the book sounds like a new-age title, relax, it is far from it, thankfully.Chapter 3 is one of the many fascinating sections in the book where the authors detail the greedy algorithm, where the locally optimal choice is what is generally preferred. They tie this into the Gekko mantra of greed being good.  But note that research has shown that long-term greed is good, but short-term greed, the type that maximizes the here and now seems to work for a while but almost always leads to a plateau.  And as you realize, plateaus are bad.Chapter 5 details flow mechanisms, step functions and choke points. Author Hugh Thompson is a mathematician and its obvious this chapter is his baby.  A choke point is a part of a system that breaks first and slows everything else down.  The book notes that a common cause of plateaus is not recognizing when and where choke points will occur.Chapter 6 is another fascinating chapter that details people's inability to effectively deal with risk.  The example given is around shark attacks.  While the risk of shark attack is extraordinarily low, the media often makes it seem like an epidemic, and the gullible populace overreacts.  The authors give many examples of where people don't comprehend risk and statistics.  The authors note that people buy lottery tickets, often described as a tax on the mathematically disinclined, despite knowing the odds. They also write that due to various factors, people and society have become overly risk-averse, not realizing how risky that is.While not new, chapter 7 details the problems with multitasking and its illusions of productivity. The authors quote Jordon Grafman, chief of the cognitive neuroscience section of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke who states that multitasking is actually a misnomer.  He terms it rapid toggling between tasks.  The downside to this rapid toggling is that people become less effective and productive.  The reality they show is that people can't multitask.While the book is indeed a fascinating and valuable read, some readers may find it somewhat frustrating that the authors at times can seem like they are all over the place, quoting and integrating different facets of science and psychology.  While the theme of the book is plateaus, there is not always a discernible sense of unity between all of the examples.Another lacking is the shortage of prescriptive actions the reader can take. For the reader who may be indifferent to their need for change, the book may not be of full value to then.  It would have been appreciated if the authors could have created action items and exercises for each chapter.But perhaps the best advice is on the 3rd to the last page of the book. The authors note that if your company is stuck and has plateaued, and unable to get past some vexing problems. What should you do?  Tell the type A's in the room to be quiet for a while and set out some frontline introvert an ask for their advice.  Giving voice to the quietest person in the room might be the most unique exercise a firm undertakes.With that, The Plateau Effect: Getting from Stuck to Success is an extremely stimulating read.  For the reader who wants to grow and move off their plateau, this will certainly help them.  The book promises to help the reader unstick themselves from the things in life that weigh them down.  It certainly lives up to its promise and makes for a fascinating read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPV10UG2SIIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525952802#wasThisHelpful","R3JPV10UG2SIIZ","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Behind nearly every security vulnerability is poorly written or insecure code.  Fix the code and a majority of the security vulnerabilities go away.In the just released 2nd edition of Secure Coding in C and C++, author Robert Seacord of CERT has created an invaluable resource for developers.Research from OWASP and CERT shows that a lion's share of core vulnerabilities can be found in a small number of root causes.  In the book, Seacord tackles those root causes.Like a good programmer, the book is methodical and details all of the core areas which can lead to security vulnerabilities.  The book shows how they are exploited and how they can be fixed.The average C programmer knows about buffer overflows, authentication, format strings and more.  But if they don't know how to write secure code, they will invariably write insecure code.Aside from the inherent security and privacy benefits, there is significant cost savings to writing secure code.For anyone who codes in C or C++, Secure Coding in C and C++ should be required reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N1TLV4WE8R3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321822137#wasThisHelpful","R3N1TLV4WE8R3D","A1L5RDC8H9BB9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1L5RDC8H9BB9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The DVR records and holds the data until you want yo delete it. The eight cameras can pan it, zoom in and be adjusted for better angles. The globe type camera rotates 360 degrees around.

"I was hoping for positive results like most people had from this supplement. I took it for 3 weeks. I noticed improvement as far as adrenal fatigue symptoms. I was thrilled at first but, this gave me large, painful breast lumps. This was only supplement I had been taking over the last month. No other prescriptions or supplements.

"I believe that this book represents the ""coming of age"", if you will, of this series. Ms Hunter can write, can write action, snarky humor and good plots. But Broken Soul starts to take the reader ever deeper into Jane's world and the hidden  history of the vampires.To quickly sum up, Jane is hired by MOC of New Orleans to review and tighten up the security of his new headquarters because the European Council is expected, but no actual date is set. As Jane, with her ""Crew"" go about looking into things, they discover that Leo has a very dark secret hidden away in the sub-basement of his new facility. It is a presence so monstrous and so dangerous that it threatens everyone and everything in Jane's life.Rather than try to summarize the entire book, let me instead tell you that what makes this volume stand out is the way Faith Hunter takes us into the back stories of several major characters, including Jane herself. There is also the undefined new status of Bruiser, with a potential for romance that Jane had never considered seriously.The book ends in a way that, while gratifying, leaves the reader yearning for the next volume moreso than any of the previous volumes. Must read for fans of the series and please don't try to start with this book; it will make little sense to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25IA9ESFV3Y09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEF6C2#wasThisHelpful","R25IA9ESFV3Y09","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is actually two stories told side by side. It is a compelling account of human endurance and perseverance, during 1942, and again in 2012. It is an amazing tale of a plane lost over Greenland in 1942, the crash of a B-17 during the search for it and the search for and recovery of some would-be rescuers who were lost in the ice and snow as part of the ground search in the days following the original crash.Some of the members of the 2012 search team had been part of finding one of a squadron of P-38s lost over Greenland during the war. This is a story of courage, of faith and of honor. The stories told by those who survived and were rescued tell of extraordinary endurance and will, both on the part of the survivors and those looking for them, some of whom lost their lives during that search.The story of the searchers and their mission in 2012 shows just how far our technology has come, and how limited it still is in the face of the treacherous and unpredictable weather that makes up modern Greenland. Again, bravery and tenacity hold the modern day searchers to their task, despite the odds being against them.It's not a spoiler to say that they do eventually find the plane for which they were searching, but it recounts the ingenuity they needed to make their search and their high-tech tools work for them.This book is as compelling as any adventure novel and has the added touch of it being a true story and the superior writing skills of Mitchell Zuckoff.Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C80W4QZD3ZK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NG2G54#wasThisHelpful","R2C80W4QZD3ZK2","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wrote about my attraction to this fascinating book in my review of the first volume. At the age of 12 or so I was fascinated, even obsessed with how this war had happened, especially since it effected my father so profoundly.I became fascinated with WWII and how it happened and how did this one diminutive man almost achieve world domination? I read so many books on WWII but never had the chance to read things from the German side. This book is the 2nd of two volumes of interviews with soldiers who were on the German front during D Day. The actual interviewer was the father of the man who edited these books.He did an excellent job. If you are a student of history, this is a must. They say the history books are written by the victors, but this book and its companion volume present a compelling view of what it was like to suddenly see this enormous armada coming onto the beach, to hear of the terror that offshore shelling by Allied battleships and cruisers unleashed for hours before and during the assault. Many of the interviewees are quite honest in how frightened and confused they were. In volume one, some even speak of what happened when they were captured and taken as prisoners. It turns out that many were sent to England and/or the United States, were treated very well, and some even stayed! In volume 2, the few who spoke of  being captured were not captured on D Day, but later in the war and say they were not treated very well. I have no reason to doubt them.No bones about it, as with the 1st volume this is not a book for the squeamish. There are very graphic descriptions of the damage done to humans and even animals as a result of the assault. There is also, from some, a begrudging admiration for the creativity and tenacity of the Allied forces. The interviews were conducted in 1954, and at that time, a small few of those interviewed still held that ""only if"" certain things had happened they would have repulsed the assault. I read this book and its companion volume very quickly. It is well organized and is not edited down to make it a ""nice"" read. This book is about the horror of combat, the confusion of war and the bravery of men on both sides The reader can almost hear the explosions, smell the cordite and sweat in the bunkers.

"What an absolutely fascinating book. I was born in 1950, and grew up in a world where people with German sounding names or who were of obvious Japanese descent were held in suspicion. I even remember when I was maybe seven, when a friend and I were playing with a toy metal tank. The turret came off and my friend's dad picked it up, saw that it was made from and inverted Maxwell House Coffee can and it said, ""Made in Japan,"" and he threw it out! My friend's dad was a U.S. Marine who saw action at Guadalcanal during the war. We, my friend and I, had no idea what his dad was so upset about. I remember dating, later marrying a woman whose maiden name, which I won't disclose here, was discussed by my parents when I first met her. Her family had said they were Swiss, but my parents were sure they just didn't want it known that they were probably of German descent. Crazy!But it served to create in me a fascination with WWII and how it happened and how did this one diminutive man almost achieve world domination?

"This is a wonderful collection of four short works from the world of Jane Yellowrock. What makes it worth reading is the variety of points of view in the various tales. We have a story, ""We Sa,"" which is told from Jane's Beast's point of view. She does this sort of thing in her novels, but this takes the reader way back in Jane's history and is a great addition to her back story. Then we have, ""Haints,"" which is told from the point of view of  Jane's best friend, Molly Everhart Trueblood. It is a great way to see how Jane is seen by another person. The last two works are from Jane's perspective. One, ""Signatures of the Dead was published previously in the anthology, ""Strange Brew."" Good story. Finally is a short work, ""Cajun with Fangs,"" which takes place right after the end of ""Raven Cursed,"" and is a sort of lead-in to ""Death's Rival."" As Ms Hunter says in her forward, ""(It was) a blast."" There is also a healthy chunk of the beginning of ""Death's Rival"" that serves to fatten the book, but fans of the series are going to read the novel in its entirety anyhow, so, the final bit is something of a waste, which is why I only gave it four stars.

"I believe that this trilogy by Ransom Riggs will be considered a classic for the foreseeable future. This third book, which seems to be a finale, is, in my opinion, as close to perfect as a final book in a great trilogy can be. While I believe this is meant to be in the YA demographic, it is a story for all ages. I'm 65 and read it with the same excitement that held me when I was 8 or 9 and reading The Hardy Boys, and Tom Swift, Jr & Sr. Actually, I'd have to say I was enraptured because I have so much life experience now that to thrill me like this series has takes a lot. I'm almost immune to horror, and only a few sci fi writers really grab me anymore with their originality. There are few authors now from whom I can't wait their next publication.If you haven't read the first two books, you must do so in order to fully appreciate how masterful this finale is. It is unpredictable, filled with suspense, very honorable characters, duplicitous characters, very scary creatures and a conclusion I in no way saw coming. I had my ideas, but I was both flabbergasted and pleased with how this series concludes.Mr. Riggs has created such a unique collection of characters, that I believe he may be living in the wrong time. His trilogy brings to mind L. Frank Baum, Poe, Lovecraft, the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson and many other authors of great and memorable fairy tales. Of course this series requires suspension of disbelief, but Riggs writes so well, the reader may pause to wonder if maybe this is all possible. The story spans several generations, includes alternate realities, time travel, magic and wonder. It is a story of growing young love, familial discord, misplaced trust and trustworthiness where one would least expect to find it.I am  not going to try to summarize this plot; I'm just not that good of a reviewer and can't imagine including spoilers if I tried. I will say Riggs will make you laugh, shake in your boots, feel the sort of hatred that Americans felt toward Nazis, and bespell you with the power of love and the power of growing into belief in oneself.I've already preordered the box set for both my children to read and share with their children. The story is unforgettable in the same way that Tolkien's best know works are. It really stays with you. I give this trilogy my highest recommendation and hope you will open  your heart to what is, in the end, a story of the power of love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OHR2JQ3ABFD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKX364M#wasThisHelpful","R2OHR2JQ3ABFD6","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just discovered Cathy Lemons recently, and I know this album dates back to 1998, but is is a great record, if a little uneven. This is real Texas style blues and every song is well done. One exception is ""Goodmorning Little Schoolboy,"" which transliterated for Kathy to sing, just comes across as a bit lame. Ms Lemons' voice is clear and crisp. There are several guest artists on the album, none of whom I have actually heard on their own, so that's one limitation in my appreciation. Overall, the album is excellent. The question that hangs in the air is why have we not heard from her again until her very recent release, ""Black Crow,"" which is an excellent album.

"Every now and then, I pick up another CD by Gabrielle Roth & The Mirrors. I have always been thrilled with what I find and ""Still Chillin'"" is no exception. While she may vary tempos, styles, instruments and overall feel, the result is always rewarding. If you have never ""Trance Danced,"" this is a great CD with which to start. The first track, ""Descending"", is very slow paced and allows you to just let the sounds penetrate you and to just move slowly in whatever way you feel moved to do so. The next track, ""Shavasana,"" is longer, and of a similar tempo, but with chanting included. That's another freedom you have, you can make whatever sounds you wish, or just lose yourself in the vocal sounds that are recorded. The third track, ""Stephanie's Song,"" is a bit more uptempo and creates a sort of sound cocoon around you as you listen and/or dance. Finally comes the title track, which is nearly 30 minutes long. If you just relax and listen and move, it will take you places inside yourself where you may  never have been before. This is ""soul"" music of the spiritual sort. Just listen and move or don't, but it will move you. Using headphones is very highly recommended, since they cut off exterior sounds which may distract you. You can also blindfold yourself, if you have an open safe space in which to move. No matter what, you can't go wrong with this CD.

"I admit to being slow to warm to this series. There is no question that Ms Wilks is a masterful writer. I must admit that, at times, I have to go back and reread some of the previous pages to fully understanding what is going on at a given point in the book. I have no doubt, this is the best book of the series so far. The reader gets to know Cullen Seabourne and Cynna Weaver, usually more peripheral characters, both of whom have talents that are quite magical. Seaborne is not only a werewolf, but a powerful sorcerer as well. He and Cynna are at the beginning phase of acceptance that they are having a child.Cynna is a Finder, one of the most powerful ever known. She also works for the FBI. Lily Yu, the more senior of the FBI agents and the usual protagonist in the previous stories, is left behind by some interference in a ritual that will take her, Cynna, Seaborne, and several other characters to a magical realm, one that has only two phases, Night Season, which lasts half of the year and Day Season, which lasts the other half of the year.The mishap puts Lily Yu out of the picture, sends several characters to the wrong place and sends Weaver and Seaborne, along with a gnome, to the realm which is in Night Season, but not in the place they intended to be. The gnome has sought out Cynna because of her reputation as a Finder, and wants her to find a Sacred Medallion, which has been lost. Only the right person can wear it and thus rule the realm, anyone else will slowly go insane.The book's pace steadily quickens and intensifies until it reaches a denouement that I can't believe any reader sees coming. Highly recommended, but you must read the first three books in the series or you will be hopelessly lost in trying to grok this volume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PTT8B9203B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UZQILK#wasThisHelpful","R34PTT8B9203B1","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's kind of hard to have a book as raw and frank about the horrors of war to be rated as, ""I loved it."" But this book by Wolfgang Faust deserves five stars. Why, because it is honest and it offers a perspective rarely seen, since, as it is said, ""the history books are written by the victors."" In this volume the reader is taken inside one of the last German tanks to make it through the Russian lines on the Eastern side of the Elbe, as it and a small cadre of other Germans, knowing they have lost the war they started, try to flee West, to cross the Elbe, where they will surrender to the Americans.Reader be warned, this is not a book for the young or squeamish. Faust tells things as he saw them and what he thought about them. He somehow maintains a sense of humanity and decency as his ramshackle cadre rush for their lives. He tries to save those civilians he can, but knows he must also be ruthless in his goal of making it through the Russian lines.There is brutality on a scale that exceeds any of the modern gore fest horror novels, in that what is described is real and the writing is so good, the reader feels the claustrophobia of being inside the Panther, the horrible smells, the sweat and fear that permeates the tiny crew compartment of this fighting machine.I recommend this book highly, because it may just introduce some to the true horror of war, no matter what side the writer is on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P4LM5RPG8U5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1R4X92#wasThisHelpful","R2P4LM5RPG8U5Q","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I took a long time reading this excellent book by Frank MacEowen. I did so because I had been studying shamanism for a while and what is most predominant here in the U.S. is some form of ""native American"" shamanism. I studied that and found it beautiful but something about it did not feel right. My ethnicity is mostly Celtic and when I started to explore in that direction, I knew I had found my roots. I won't bore you with the rituals I did that made this evident to me, but I will tell  you that if you are looking for a spiritual path, then the work of Frank MacEowen is a very good place to start.This book is very thoughtful, very well tied together in the way it mixes myth, memory, tradition and ritual to bring about a sense of belonging in the world and a sense of the importance of developing oneself as a spiritual being.

"I couldn't agree more with the Amazon review submitted by Deborah Wiley. I had not read Wilks' work in a while and I was somewhat lost until I checked back on my highlights from the previous two novels in the series. I agree with Ms Wiley, by no means attempt to pick up on the series here. In some ways, this could be considered the third book in a trilogy that serves to open the series. There is no questioning Ms Wilks' skill at character development, plot and action writing. This is a great book, but I do think she could have smoothed out some of the rough edges as even those familiar with the series may find themselves a bit confused at times.Given that, this is still a superb read that holds so much promise for the continuation of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERGGZ3Y3H430/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040895G8#wasThisHelpful","R3ERGGZ3Y3H430","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have said, John Scalzi can't write a bad book or short story. This is a fast moving, thought provoking bit of speculative science fiction involving the unexpected behavior of the computer/robot on a Federation battleship. It opens up so much room for contemplating AI and what we just might get ourselves into without intending to do so. It also offers the hope that AI may well save us from ourselves.

"Read the summaries that are on the page for this book on Amazon. I can add little other than that, unlike some, who find some of the characters and situations improbable, I found this to be the best book of the three and an excellent wrap-up of the trilogy. Suspension of disbelief is required of readers in this genre and I did not find mine tested at all. The characters are wonderful, fascinating, confused, irritating, frightening and everything in between. I admit that the warrior for hope who lives within me was thrilled that Kress developed characters who saw that peace won out. She is one of our living Masters and this is another masterpiece to stand beside the ""Beggars in Spain"" trilogy.Excellent read, highest recommendation, so long as you read the first two books; if you don't, you'll be hopelessly lost as to the significance of the actions of various characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRM4U4VXB7OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008S0E6CM#wasThisHelpful","RMRM4U4VXB7OV","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can I say? If you have heard the Trance/Dance music of Gabrielle Roth and the Mirrors before then this album will come as no surprise. If this is your first exposure, then you are in for a treat. This is another gorgeous collection of musical pieces intended for listening while meditating or to be used as dance music. If you let go and just move however you feel, you can become entranced. As a shaman, I have danced for hours to her various albums and find that doing so moves/alters my ordinary conscious state to one of being open to unseen wonders in myself and the world around us. It is important to listen to her music with what I call ""New Ears"", wherein your body becomes the ears by which the music enters you and invites you to move and experience something you may have not thought possible, or even considered possible.If  you find you like this, I would recommend her album Totem as your next purchase.This music is not for everyone, but if you are looking for something of a new experience, facilitated by music, then Gabrielle Roth and the Mirrors will give you that experience. Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQRUZ9JF8ZW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012ADS06#wasThisHelpful","R1PQRUZ9JF8ZW9","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems to me, that, as a rule, second books in a trilogy are a way of setting up what should  be a grand finale. This book is a bit more than that, in that it develops the characters and culture of the Worlders, who planet the Terrans have found by means of old, but far advanced scientific artifacts left behind by what would seem to be a now extinct race. The Terrans have returned and the intent is to take one of the moons that is, in fact, an artifact left behind by the ancient race. Perhaps it could be a weapon to help turn the tide of the ongoing war with the Fallers. Not everyone of the Terrans on the mission know that some of them are there for military reasons, while the others are just continuing their study of the geology, the flora and fauna, and the culture of the Worlders. The Worlders are, by current Terran standards, a very simple race, lacking in any real technology. They do share a collective mind, however, and things are declared real or unreal, by agreement of the collectives. Through  her work interacting with the Terrans, one Worlder, Enli, finds herself declared ""unreal"" by her villagers.She struggles with this as opposed to keeping her belief in the Terrans activities and seeing how real their technology is and suffers for siding with them. She wants her status returned to real and is torn by how to do it.Meanwhile, the Terrans have been exploring the Sacred Mountain, and Enli has seen what is inside. The source of the shared mind is, in fact, an artifact buried in the heart of the mountain, which the Terrans test by changing the settings and discovering that it can be a powerful weapon. One consequence, however, is the the Worlders lose their shared mind and are completely lost without it. Some go mad, some become aimless and Enli, because of her experience with the Terrans, keeps her own mind intact. Meanwhile, the Terrans now know that the ""moon"" artefact"" is, indeed an incredibly powerful weapon, which they decide to steal.With great skill, Kress has created a world, a culture and a belief system that is genius. She easily demonstrates the manner in which the ""sophisticated"" Terrans can manipulate the, to them, the naive Worlders. Her characters are wonderful and the way she combines the well-meaning intent of the Terrans who are unaware of the military aspect of the mission and the ongoing story of war in space makes this a great read. It is far above what I usually expect from a second book in a trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPVYHV7CBIC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MYX3A0#wasThisHelpful","R2NPVYHV7CBIC9","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read all of the Aneka Jansen series to date and have just loved it. I find Teasdale knows he's writing for adults and can be a bit heavy-handed when it comes to sex, but I found that was not the case in this first volume of the Ultrahumans series. I found this an exciting delight. Yes, it begins with an ugly duckling turned swan story, in an alternate, post-apocalyptic Earth. Some humans become Ultra human and have special powers depending upon their personalities. Some turn to crime; others register as crime fighters. Cygnus, our ugly duckling turned swan, seems to have unlimited powers and is only beginning to understand them. She joins forces with another Ultra, known as ""Twilight,"" and they become an unstoppable team. There are two major crime syndicates in the city of New Millennium, MD. It is sort of the new New York. One uses Ultras and has a dark secret, the other is the more traditional mobster type and doesn't use Ultras, in fact, hates them and wants to destroy them. I can't say more other than the this book focuses most on Cygnus and her development and escapes from dilemmas and starts to familiarize the reader with this alternate reality and its occupants. The plot is good  and there is a nice cliffhanger ending setting up book 2 quite well.Unlike some reviewers, I find Teasdale to be fun, good enough to hold my interest tightly and full of enough  humor that the reader knows that they are on Teasdale's latest roller coaster ride, and I like his rides very much great summer reading or wait till there are at least three volumes, and set aside for a wintery weekend indoors.

"I love the work of Nancy Kress. She is, in my mind, a grand master of hard science blended with realistic speculation in the sci-fi genre. This first volume in the trilogy finds a very worn out and war-weary earth suddenly discovering a stargate through which they can reach out and colonize more planets than ever before. Earth is at war with the only other species, the Fallers, known to be capable of interplanetary travel. The Fallers are ruthless, never negotiate and take no prisoners. They are winning. When Earthers send their first probe through the gate, it sends back information suggesting a very earthlike planet with several moons.The first manned ship to travel to the new planet discovers a very unique civilization in which the residents are of one mind and when that mind is in full conformity, something is declared ""real"". If an individual does not fall into complete agreement, they are considered ""unreal"" until they rejoin the collective mind, they are again declared real.The earthlings,  with their separate minds, are considered unreal until a few show that they can be considered real.Of course, the mission has a hidden military agenda, which sends some of the crew into the depths of the most sacred mountain, where they have traced an unusual signal. It turns out this this non-native artifact is the source of the one mind of the inhabitants. It also possesses indicators that one of moons of the planet is actually a much larger version of the artifact and has the potential for use as a very powerful weapon in the war with the Fallers.Needless to say, the off-worlders are condemned ultimately as unreal and end up fleeing the planet to save themselves. Some choose to stay behind and continue the work they believed they were sent there to do, anthropology, botany and zoology.The use of the stargate system, also built by those who built the artifact on the planet  and the false moon, is complicated and I will not try to summarize it here. Let's just say that Nancy Kress works her special magic to get this trilogy off to a grand start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JEBOKJN947Y0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PE3ZUA#wasThisHelpful","R1JEBOKJN947Y0","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Skin care with quality products is essential, not just to satisfy our youth obsessed culture (your reviewer is 65) but it is a vital part of self care no matter what your age. I found this product to be exactly as advertised. It moisturizes, gives skin a healthy glow and can be used pretty much anywhere on the body. I personally like Oz Naturals products because of quality and reasonable price.I admit I have tried some very expensive products of a similar intent and none could exceed this much less expensive product.One caveat I would offer is this stuff goes a LONG way.

"I only give this four stars because the production is crap and has been cleaned up as much as possible. I admit I have loved John Mayall from this era since I first head the first blues breakers album featuring Eric Clapton, which I bought because I had to know what could draw him away from the Yardbirds, just as they were breaking big in the U.S.The appeal of this album is the presence of what would become the core of the REAL Fleetwood Mac. So many people would never guess to whom they were listening if they heard the early Fleetwood Mac because they were a serious blues band, witness ""Fleetwood Mac in Chicago."" All water under the bridge.This album shows a really great band going through the early staples of the Bluesbreakers setlist. What is frustrating is you can hear McVie, and then you can't. Mayall's voice is in and out. Even Fleetwood doesn't always come through. But the album is worth it for Green's playing. It is strange to hear him playing some of the songs associated with Clapton, but Green excels and Clapton's absence is not noticed at all.I have to say this album is for hard core fans of that early British Blues era of the sixties. It you are a Green or Mayall die hard,  then it is a must-have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBYGNDXSKQ92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U77OISQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NBYGNDXSKQ92","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While differing in some degree to her work with previous goth/speed metal bands, this is classic Anette.She sings with sincerity and beauty and devotion.

"I have loved Sirenia from the first moment I heard them, which, to my chagrin was only about a year ago. Some may not like this album for various reasons. For me, it is among their best, if not their best. Their is the usual expected complexity of arrangements both instrumental and vocals as expected from groups in this genre.What makes it so good to me is that is is more of a group album than any of their previous efforts. What I mean is that there is no over-dependence on the lead female vocalist. She's there and has her spots, but for the most part, this is a gorgeous ensemble effort. You may not agree, but so be it. No matter what, if you are a Sirenia fan, this belongs in your collection. If this is your introduction to Sirenia, you'll be getting a great album, but realize that it is not typical of their previous work.Highest Recommendation","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EMGRDTLUXO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4B9R8K#wasThisHelpful","R6EMGRDTLUXO0","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got this recording this morning. Rarely am I just blown away on a first listen. After the third listen, I knew this was the best work these two old veterans of the music wars have done in years. While it is a trend lately to do duet albums, either with one other artist and many are quite good (I'm thinking Emmy Lou Harris, Tony Bennett, etc.) this  is by far the best. If this album is not nominated in next year's parade of awards shows, something is REALLY wrong in the world, or, the boys put it so well in the second track on the record, ""It All Going to Pot."" Of course, given their reputations, this song is both socially accurate, but the double entendre is not lost on anyone who are fans of these two.The album begins with the title track and it is a magnificent tribute to their roots, to those who came before and inspired them. You can just hear the prestige and respect in which they hold all the ""old timers"" they mention in the song.The album offers a beautiful simplicity of instrumentation and arrangements. This is so very evident on ""Unfair Weather Friend,"" a song that had to come from the mind of Willie.The homage to Johnny Cash, ""Missing Old Johnny Cash,"" is truly that, a true honoring of the memory of the man who was a legend. It begins with Merle (my guess) sounding so much like Johnny, I thought it was really Johnny. They hint that while they tell amusing anecdotes of Johnny's life, they let on that there is much more to be told.""Live This Long"" is an admission that they would have lived a bit differently if they had known they were going to live as long as they have. How they sing so clearly with their tongues stuck that deep in their cheeks, I'll never know.The only solo effort on the album is Willie's ""Somewhere Between"" and is a classic Willie ballad about love between two people wherein something unknown comes between. It is a beautiful song.The album ends with a tribute to ""The Only Man Wilder Than Me."" They never reveal about whom they are singing which is a delightful way to end the album and leave the listeners with something to ponder, considering who is singing...This album is a must, in my book, no matter what genre. It's my current holder of the first spot on the second quarter's list of my nominations for Album of the Year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJWEMF7890OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU95GNQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NJWEMF7890OH","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is very easy to use, very gentle on my face, and after a couple of weeks I can see a real difference in my facial skin. People have even been commenting and asking what I am doing differently. I am happy to tell them about the Konjac Sponge. This is, in my opinion, a great product, available for a very reasonable price. Get one for yourself and you will see a difference.

"Full disclosure: I was sent this  item free from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest interview. I think this product is superb. The light is bright on low or  high setting. At this time of year in Vermont, we get a lot of sunshine, so the charge lasts well into the night. It is somewhat dull by sunrise. I do wonder how it will be in the Winter, when many days are cloudy and the sun does not shine for long. We shall see. However, for now my wife and I love it and use it to light up a part of the yard where, unfortunately we have found evidence of kids hanging out and leaving their refuse behind. This has stopped since the area is now well illuminated. We are very happy about this. This is an excellent product, very easy to install and use. It is a  sort of ""set it and forget it"" kind of thing.Why four stars and not five? I don't know if my product was missing a piece, but I have found no indications that it is. The problem is that once the stake is fixed in the ground, the light just sits loosely on the post, and even a strong wind can turn it. It could be easily stolen if someone checked it. There is just no way to secure it to  the post.

"This review was solicited by the seller. I found this case to be quite a surprise.  It is rugged, durable and flexible on the inside. It can be used for cards from any non-video games that use cards. I also found it was snug enough to hold the playing pieces for games like Trivial Pursuit in addition to the cards. It zips up quite securely and even has a convenient carabiner to allow you to attach it to your belt or anything else, which is very convenient in my opinion.When I say it is rugged, I mean it. I decided since I had received it in exchange for an honest review that I would do some extra testing. I filled it with cards and board pieces and zipped it up and then tossed it around and opened it to find that very few of the cards and none of the pieces had left the compartment in which I had placed them. Did I say rugged? I also stood on it (I weigh 170 lbs.) and it showed no damage. I then stood on it again, in stilettos, and still it showed no damage! I think this is a great case at a great price.

"For Gallagher fans, this is a must have CD. I don't care that it is spread over 2CDs and the price is a bit high. This is a very special event made available on CD. Why a special event? Because it demonstrates without doubt that RG was among the best, if not THE BEST blues/rock/folk guitarists ever. Hendrix, at the Isle of Wight declared him to be the best in the world. Clapton said that it was listening to RG that got him to go back to playing the blues. The Edge and Brian may have said that their respective bands would not have existed and sounded as they did had Rory not been so kind to them at various club gigs in London.This is special because it just another typical RG performance. His forte was playing live. This may be the best live recording of him playing live available on CD, with the exception, of course, of the six volume ""Irish Tour '74"" compilation. I would not want to have to choose between them for which one is the best. I must add that, in my opinion, THE BEST live recordings of Rory playing live are on Disc 3 of the 3 disc Rockpalast DVD, also available from Amazon.As I understand it, this was recorded during his American tour promoting his ""Top Priority"" album, which is, in itself, excellent. What you hear on this recording is Rory giving his all, thrilling the crowd with high energy. It could have been just another gig that many artists would have ""mailed in."" Rory covers some songs, such as ""Keychain"" from the ""Top Priority"" album, and, for me, he gives what was a relatively typical studio performance of one of his songs new meaning with his explosive live performance. What continues to amaze me, the more I hear of his live performances is how he manages to offer new arrangements and solos on some his old favorites, such as ""Tattoo'd Lady"" and ""I Wonder Who?"" and his classic favorite show ender, ""Bullfrog Blues"". He manages to keep his cover of Junior Well's ""Messin' With The Kid,"" sounding bright and fresh.As usual he shows  his amazing versatility by doing both acoustic numbers and even covers, ""Too Much Alcohol"" with an amazing demonstration of his skill with slide playing on his ancient National Steel Guitar. I still mourn his early death and believe that if such circumstances had killed him today, there would be an uproar over poor care. So be it. At least with have great CDs like this one to keep us remembering just what a musician and musicologist he was. Be honest: have YOU ever heard of the Mississippi Sheiks before Rory sang about them? Get this album and be amazed by what RG could and did do on ""just another night.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124UR327DWZWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4RH2T0#wasThisHelpful","R124UR327DWZWP","A2MSZE23MOYURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MSZE23MOYURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 stars as the beginning is a little off and doesn't really get going until the main characters are together.  Keep going; it's worth it.I can see where the similarities are made with this one to The Black Dagger Brotherhood as there is a group of royal vampires that have to fight other half-breeds who can’t play nice.  There are the Vampirian houses: Reihn, Cyphre, Korvinos Amaleh and Daemonov all represented by a glyph (tattoo) on their necks or face. Then there are the enemies, the Vampisapiens Houses: Remonai, Mazor, Lukjin, Federov and Zeigen.  There is a reference glossary in the back which you will need to fully understand the story.The best parts of this story and the major parts are when Vampirian King Xander and Elena are together.  Xander is alpha and sexy while Eleina is confused, but strong.  Xander has been waiting for his green-eyed mate for centuries but is falling in love with the blue eyed beauty he is bound to protect until her conversion.  His fellow warrior buddies love Eleina and tell him to forget about his mate, but he can only have children with his mate and his kingdom needs him to carry on the royal line.Eleina is human, but it sought after by the Vampisapiens.  The Fates have assigned Xander to protect from them since she has no family.There is descriptive sex, some profanity and some chapters devoted to the evil ones trying to kidnap Eleina, just like BDBH style, only I skip the ones in BDBH because they are so awful, but I read these.I will be getting the next book which is about Lucien and Samanda called My Dark Beauty, then later, My Dark Angel about Reichen and Angel.Would I/Did I buy it?

"This one was much better than book 2, in my opinion, with a better love story, no interrupted sex scenes, and a heroine who doesn’t do anything too stupid.  There are some “pushing it” plot points like Grace temporarily taking over Frog’s place in the band as a guitarist when she hasn’t played since high school, surviving a collision in a corvette and Kelli’s 10 year angry disappearance, but overall, it was a great love story.Grace became a model at 14 years of age to help her dad pay for her deceased mother’s medical bills.  She left the family to help pay for expenses including her siblings schooling, but they felt she had abandoned them, not knowing her sacrifice.  When Henry calls her to help out the band, she immediately says yes, having the need for family and escaping her hectic life as a model.Casey and Travis are asked to pick her up, and there is a misunderstanding about drugs that leads to Casey and Grace getting up in each other’s faces.  Both are very attracted to the other physically, but they both open their mouths and ruin it.  Grace is feisty and not intimidated by Casey’s looks and personality and he is thrown by how attracted to her he is, which is bad timing as he is trying to romance another girl named Morgan to get information on his parents deaths.  He is using Morgan, but she is persistent and tries to interfere with his growing desires for Grace.Grace’s boyfriend is history after cheating on her and she just wants to spend her weeks playing with her brother’s band and getting to spend time with her brother.  Henry warns her to stay away from Casey, but they end up having a secret affair, agreeing to “walk away” after Grace’s 8 weeks are up.  But then their lives start becoming endangered and Casey’s protective instincts start taking over.There is not much of the band in this one or any real storylines that include anyone other than Casey and Grace and the “bad guys”.  It is much more of a romance and has a lot more descriptive sex and dirty talk than the previous ones, which I liked.  While it is a very lengthy book, I read every page and enjoyed every minute of it.The next book looks like it will finally be about Mac and whoever she ends up choosing.  It used to always be Jake, but Luke and one other guy are now in the picture……I highly recommend this story for those who love a good romance and love story.

"This one felt like we finally have come full circle.  Jenna and Leander are main characters in this one along with Jaqueline (Jack) and Hawk.  Seeing Jenna in dragon form was reminiscent of book one and Brazil brought a lot of the former main characters together to fight.Hawk and Jack’s love story is comical in that she thinks Hawk is a birthday present from her single best friend, and Jack spends a sex filled night with him; no strings attached.  He is actually on assignment to ruin Jack’s journalist reputation after she single-handedly got the prejudicial laws against the Shifters passed by the President and was nominated for the Pulitzer Price to boot.  When the Shifter colony decides to expose her to their way of life instead, and have her write a new story that takes back all the bigoted thoughts in the first one, they send Hawk to go fetch her.  He was already feeling a strange tug towards her during their one night stand, and feared he was losing himself by wanting to be with her.Jack thought she was being patriotic and protective when she wrote her scathing piece on the Shifters, but she soon learns she did not have the whole story.  Caesar was not the Shifter’s King nor was he acting with their consensus.  He was a loonie who represented the Shifters as accurately as Hitler represents humanity.  After experiencing time with Hawk in his colony she discovered that their ways and customs were different, but that in every way that counted, the Shifters and the humans were the same.  She also fell in love with Hawk.Caesar is still alive.  He is like Jason from those horror movies.  He just won’t die.  I skip his chapters because he is just evil, but he finds the Brazil colony and Jenna and Leander along with their 4month old twin daughters are there along with a prophecy of doom.  There are great secondary characters and characters from other books like Xander and his wife Morgan. Christian is not there.There is A LOT that happens in this book, but I really only read this series for the love stories.  That is why I read anything, so I tend to skim the political and evil parts.  The epilogue is a little foreboding and I am hoping for a miracle.  The battles are always built up more than they ever turn out to be, and I am hoping this is the case here too.Some good quotes:Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities – VoltaireFear becomes a part of you, like a tumor that can never be cut out – JackLove can be painful, sometimes cruel, but regret will devour you, bite by bite, until there’s nothing left at all. If love is a tyrant, regret is a soul-eating demon. - JennaJ.T. Geissinger always has a political message or idea she want to argue in her books, this book is not different.  While in E of D book 4 the message was of homosexual discrimination and cystic fibrosis awareness, this one consisted of: the different sexual standards Women are held to as opposed to men, USA’s unethical treatment of animals for consumption, mental illness, bigotry, rape, and that “’Hope’ is the single most powerful forced in the universe. More powerful, even, than ‘love’” (that one was an interesting argument).  She definitely uses her books to influence the readers to think and explore new ideas.Descriptive sex scenes and lots of profanity (f-word, Gd Jesus Christ a lot).Would I/Did I buy it?

"I would read Maggie Stiefvater's grocery list - I am sure it is brilliant.  This girl can really write, and I just sit amazed as I read captivating characters and descriptive inner dialogue.  It is amazing!Cole has come to LA because Isabel is there and he wants to take his musical life back.  He agrees to be on a reality show, which makes Isabel doubt she is the reason for his return to LA.  Their relationship is just as bumpy in LA as it was before, but they both have really interesting people in their lives which makes for some great reality TV and self-discoveries.""Jeremy"" The only problem with you on a reality show is that reality's never been your strong point.""""Leon"" - `My driver's eyelids were halfhearted tents pitched over his red eyes.

She also adored me for no reason I could discern. There were plenty of other people more worthy of her adulation'.""Isabel's mother"", `My mother had dressed herself in contempt. Not her best look, but better than tears'.While Cole is going through learning to live as Cole St. Claire again, Isabel is living with her mother, aunt and insecure cousin in The House of Divorce and Separation or The House of Dismay and Ruin.""The truth was that fame was an inconsistent friend, never there when you needed it, ever-present when you needed some time away from it"".""Ugly has hurt some things. It's just that pretty hurts more"".""It pissed me off when people called common sense a magical power.  Because if it counted, I was the most magical creature I knew"".I was a little disappointed with how little time Isabel and Cole spent together.  It is kind of hard to imagine them friends, let alone lovers, when they never say two words to each other.  What is it that keeps them together?  A shared secret?  Isabel had so many trust issues that the ending was a little too quick and out of character. Maggie Stiefvater's writing is like strong lyrics to an emotional song.  She gives all she has as she paints an emotional picture that relays all the information you could possibly want about the scene.  Her words make you feel the story with the intensity of being there - experiencing it as it unfolds.  She is truly talented at painting a story - not just telling it and the colors she uses are intense and perfect. Her writing is so poignant - poetic.This is classic Maggie Stiefvater writing that is exquisite and emotional.  You will not be disappointed with Sinner!Would I/Did I buy it?

"Finally, Geissinger has written a Night Prowler novel that did not aggravate me to tears with the tedious descriptions and she also used a normal amount of metaphors. While I really like the storyline of the Night Prowler Series, this author has been too descriptive and used so many metaphors and descriptive adjectives that would get in the way of the story being told.  Her writing is beautifully descriptive and tedious if that even makes sense.  But, this one was different.  I didn’t eve skim.So FINALLY Christian’s story!  I have been waiting since book 1 and have finally been rewarded.  He has fallen in love with a somewhat plain book store owner named September who is quite damaged herself.  She is all alone in the world since her father’s death of a heart attack three years ago.  She has been told of other world creatures by her mother, “Elsething” but thought they were fairy tales until Christian swoops into her life.  The have a VERY bumpy courtship and she does NOT handle any situation very well.  Basically she FREAKS out A LOT. (Personally, I was hoping for someone a little less dramatic for him, but she is likeable).  Christian is in Spain on a suicide mission for his brother and the Ikati – to root out Caesar and to kill him; even though Caesar is now, basically immortal.As always, the enemy was headed by a TOTAL CREEP, this one was named Caesar and let’s just say I skipped the chapters when this guy and Thirteen or Jahad, were narrating. Caesar is still wanting world dominion and is the truly damaged guy with his penchant for torturing beautiful girls and killing them.  Thirteen hunts the Ikati and Jahad is the religious nut that is an albino who was treated badly by Catholic school boys and whose own sexual desires are really disgusting.“Life is cruel in the same way people are. Casually. Randomly. Indifferently. Sometimes I wonder how anyone survives at all.Ultimately, we don’t.”I forgot, and got the audible, but wish I hadn’t as the narrator, Angela Dawe is awful and ruins the story even more with her awful intonations.  I ended up just reading it myself and enjoyed the story SO MUCH MORE.Descriptive sex scenes and language (f-word, Gd Jesus Christ a lot).

"The Distance Between Us is just as superbly written and a definite favorite in my house, so when On The Fence came out, I preordered it.  Skye from “Distance” makes a few cameo appearances in this one and it was great to see her again.  Kasie West’s books are YA with no profanity, some non-descriptive kissing but no sex.  The main characters are fantastic and the romance is so sweet.Charlie, a girl, is 16 and lives with her three older brothers and her policeman father.  Her mother died when she was 6 in a car accident.  The boy next door, Braden is like a brother and is best friends with Gage, the brother closest to Charlie in age and confidence.  Charlie is a TOMBOY who is excellent at soccer and football and whose brothers adore her and include her in everything.  When she gets one too many speeding tickets and frustrates her dad, he makes her get a job and a transformation happens in her life.  She starts meeting girl figures that make her question who she is.  Her boss is a motherly, new age type named Linda who can read her “auras” and understand what and how she is feeling.  She meets a make-up artist, Amber who uses her as a model and introduces her to feminine living and she meets Evan a boy who doesn’t know her as a tomboy and who seems to really like her – or at least the girlie girl she has become when working at Linda’s store.  But Charlie is also having nightmares and intimate talks with her brother’s best friend Braden at the fence most nights and is starting to feel confused and scared.Secrets have been kept from Charlie and in the midst of them unraveling, she is living in two realities: Charlie as the tomboy and Charlie as the pretty girl on the sidelines.  She wants to be accepted, but does she want to change completely?  Does she have to?  Can she embrace some of the changes and not others?  Who is she really and who does everyone want her to be and why can’t she remember anything about her mother?I love Kasie West’s writing style and her clean YA books.  All the girls (4 daughters) in my family fight for their turn with Kasie West books and reread them many times.  I will be reading more from her in the future.

"This is for the romance reader who likes a lot of sex; I mean A LOT of sex. I recently read another book that was similar to this one's style by Alexis Anne called The Storm Inside. It also had a sex scene every other page that gets a little tedious after a while.  I did enjoy the actual story to this one and was reminded of Consumed (Consumed Series Book 1) by Skyla Madi, only this book was A LOT better than that one. A LOT!!!!In the first chapter, Lexi is cheated on by her boyfriend and best friend, her twin brother dies, and the step brother, Ryder she has always had a crush on, rescues her from drowning, and then leaves.  3 years later, her step-father, David, asks Ryder to watch over her while he and her mother take a trip.  Those 6 days together finally bind them together and flesh out all the anger and abandoned feelings they have held.David, Ryder's dad, left his mother to marry Lexi's mother. His deep feelings of betrayal by his father and his mother's sadness and bitterness, turned him against his father for years and pushed Lexi and her twin brother out of his life.  After saving Lexi he became obsessed with trying to stay away from her, not wanting anything to do with his father, still and not wanting to hurt his mother.  But when Lexi comes to stay with him as he is training for his MMA fights, he can't keep his hands off her and she seems to want him too.There's jealousy, manipulations, people conspiring against them, but love is triumphant and it is great for the fictional romance reader.

"Okay, honestly, I enjoyed reading this story, but mostly because I liked this author’s writing style, not that she writes realistically instead of romantically.  For those of us who like a hero that never touches another woman after finding “the one”, this story is a disappointment.  Byron and London share a fantastic sexual encounter, but continues to have meaningless sex with other girls afterwards, making sure that London can hear.  London is obsessed about her overweight body and the reader constantly reads about her expansive behind and thighs, which is a mood killer during the sex scenes.  I am not kidding, the reader is CONSTANTLY reminded that she is not thin.  All other aspects of her personality are very strong, not embracing her body doesn’t make sense.  And finally, London’s best friend is the fantastic gay guy whose sexual conquests are almost on par with Byron’s.London doesn’t want to live at home for her sophomore year at UCLA and convinces manwhore Byron to give her a two month probation as his roommate.  He discovers she is unlike other girls he’s known and starts to fall for her.  London is convinced that Byron could never want her after being rejected by her last boyfriend, a guy who had a girlfriend and used her.  She talks like a guy, and refuses to throw the type of drama girls normally go through with guys.  Her best gay friend, Macon is her lifeline and he calls her “baby” and is ALWAYS there when she needs him.  He is also very wise about love.So the whole book is the miscommunication between Byron and London as they try to fight their feelings for each other while everyone around them knows they are perfect for each other and that they should just wake up.  The ending is quick and disappointing as none of London’s fears are put to rest, she just follows her heart.  Maybe there will be a book 2 that tells us if it works out.If you are looking for a romantic love story, this isn’t it.  It is also hard to read about Byron’s many sexual escapades while London is in the apartment having to listen to it all.  While realistic, most romance readers like to keep their fictional goggles on and never see the hero with anyone other than the heroine.  Actual manwhores are not swoon worthy and girls that pine after a guy who will do other girls are doormats.  It was an addictive read for .99, but it was not a satisfying love story, in that I would read it again.  If you like realism more than fiction, this will delight you.  If the other way around, it will leave you sad.Some hot descriptive sex, profanity (f-word)Would I/Did I buy it?  Yes (.99)Would I read it again? Probably notWould I recommend it to friends?

"With the Band is all about bass player Sam and his first love, Peyton.  All the books are written from the girl's point of view and none of them are even in the band (anymore) just dating the members.  I love band love stories, and this one was just as fun as those you see inDocumentary,  Foolish Games (Book 1) (Foolish Games Series)Series, Rock the Band Series and Lick (A Stage Dive Novel) Series by Kylie Scott.Romeo and Riley are still going strong in this book as are Justin and Allie from book 2 and make some cameo appearances, but Sam and Peyton are worth the time and their love story is a long time in coming.  Sam has a twin brother named Seth who Peyton was beguiled by in high school and was his girlfriend for a time as he was the lead singer in a garage band with his brother.  Because of his charismatic personality, Seth was always busy and Peyton spent a lot of time with Sam with whom she has a lot more in common.  When Seth's behavior and jealousy became too much for Peyton to handle, she unwisely turns to Sam for a night and is caught by Seth.  He ruins her reputation for her senior year and Sam and Peyton become strangers - until college.There was a lot that happened that night that is later explained in the story, but in the meantime, Peyton and Sam, who have avoided each other for the last three years, are now thrust together on a six week band tour as Romeo has hired her to do the publicity.  She has to travel with the band in a tour bus for six weeks with a guy who supposedly can't stand her.  But this is Peyton's dream, to become a music journalist, so she is going to get through it no matter how awful Sam wants to treat her.This was a sweet love story with a three year hurt that is finally explained and ironed out.  It was great to see all the band members again and to see Gabe not being such a jerk.  Surprisingly, Justin and Allie are still going strong and he remains faithful to her on the tour.There was descriptive kissing and sex, some profanity and reference to drug use.  In the Band was a YA story and Ink My Heart and With the Band are NA, which made them a lot more interesting for me to read.While there is nothing new in this story than what is normally out there with band books/tattoo stories, I do like these characters and anyone who read In the Band, will enjoy being with everyone again.  The ONE BIG CHANGE I would make is new covers for this series.  All of them are AWFUL.Would I/Did I buy it? No Prime Membership FreebieWould I read it again?

"A big THANK YOU for giving us a taste of the story WE WANTED after reading Just One Day!So, this ""story"" is only 43 pages but, in my opinion, is what the second book should have been about in the first place.  Willem and Allyson have FINALLY found each other again and can explain to each other what happened and what they feel.""He looks at her. She looks at him. ""I told you I would remember,"" Allyson says.Before he'd kissed her that night in the art squat, she had told him that she'd remember everything about their day in Paris. That she would remember him.Willem had made no such promises. But he can taste, touch, hear, and smell every last detail of that day together. ""I remember, too,"" he says.Lulu and Willy are finally together and it is beautiful.  I smiled through this novella thinking how much I loved seeing them ""finding"" each other again and how romantic it was.  It reminded me of how I felt reading the last chapters of Where She Went.  I have read that chapter over and over and I will read this novella again and again. It is just that sweet.This was beautifully written and well worth the .99 just to get an ending.  Honestly, Gayle Forman should have made this a trilogy because reading about ""Lulu"" and ""Willy"" NEVER gets boring.Boy, do I feel sorry for those who bought the book already and don't have a Kindle.  They will never get the love story we were all craving after reading Just One Day!  I guess she could always add an epilogue in the second printings of Just One Year.There was some non-descriptive sex scenesWould I/Did I buy it? YesWould I read it again?

"Okay, I will admit that book 2 was A LOT better than book 1, Cold Iron and I would recommend it even if you haven’t read Cold Iron.  There is a lot of review in this one and I don’t really think you need book1 to follow this story.  There was decidedly more romance (i.e.: sexy scenes) in this one and the action and plot was better.Helene has been secretly used as a pawn by one of the “magic people” (would be a spoiler to tell you who) and is missing hours of her days.  She tries to phone Beth about it to ask for help, but is unable to tell her anything but small talk.  She knows something is wrong and decides she has to go to Miach, the sorcerer who has tried to seduce her, in order to free herself from the compulsions she is feeling.  Miach is thrilled to have her back in his life (he made a bond with Beth that he would leave Helene alone) and since Helene came to him, he is able to help her.Miach’s life has become difficult with training the little druid, Beth, dodging death attempts by his vengeful son, Brian and dealing with the 2000 year old grudge he has with Finn and Finn’s son Garrett who seduced Miach’s “daughter” Nieve and got her pregnant two years ago.  When he needs Finn’s help to save Helene from a memory eating tattoo, he has to bargain with Nieve’s safety and finds that he is willing to sacrifice a lot for Helene.  Helene has found that she too has forgiven him for his part in kidnapping her and her best friend, Beth and trying to kill Beth to save his people.  She has decided to give in to him and have an affair with a dangerous, devious Fae.  She hopes her heart can take it.There is a lot more sex in this one, danger, torture and darkness.  We get to see Beth and Conn, but they are quite harmless and not very helpful, so it is anti-climactic to be with them again (somewhat like their own story in book 1).  Miach and Helene had some real sparks and a questionable love affair that is in NO WAY as certain as Conn and Beth’s turned out to be.  There is a definite inkling that Helene will be heartbroken, despite being warned.I found this story to be much more interesting than book one, but still a little dry.  Yes, I skimmed some paragraphs, but someone more history minded would probably enjoy it more.  While there were more sex scenes in this one, they were still not very emotionally felt and somewhat unsatisfying for all the talk that the Fae are such awesome lovers.There was some descriptive sex and another suggested ménage scene that seems to be a theme in this series.  While neither heroine has participated in these descriptive encounters, the desire to do so is getting more aggressive.  Wouldn’t be surprised if the next one has a ménage encounter based on the author’s interest in writing about it.  It is unlikely that I will purchase the next in the series.Did I buy it?

"My Cow-Eyed Beauty???There is NEVER a time when “Cow-eyed beauty” is a compliment.  Every time Conn would call Beth this, I would cringe.  So NOT romantic!  I got this book and its sequel as a deal of the day ($1.99) and hoped they would live up to their description.  They were billed “For fans of Jeaniene Frost and Kresley Cole”, of which I am one, but this is NOTHING like Cat and Bones or the Mortals After Dark so, don’t read this thinking that is in ANY WAY true.  Really not even close, but if you give it a try on its own, it wasn’t horrible.Beth was married to a ninny of a man who took her artifact finding abilities and bot only profited from them, but claimed them as his own.  He had a nasty best friend who was in league with him and together they set Beth up and even drugged her.  After the latest discovery, Conn the Betrayer was released from his “mound” and was “taken” with Beth.  Following her back to the states in pursuit of her and his famous one-of-a-kind sword, The Summoner.  Conn and Beth fall in love, discover there is more to her than she knew (which explains why she can find the fae) and lose the sword to Frank, her ex-husband.  The sword can be used to bring back the evil Fae and must be found before the gates are opened.While the story was pretty entertaining, it was predictable and dragged in some spots.  The worst part about this book were the extremely quick and unfulfilling sex scenes. The product description says, “this full-length novel is the first in D.L. McDermott’s fast-paced, sexy paranormal romance series”, but if you are reading this because you thought it was a paranormal ROMANCE, forget it.  The love scenes are maybe a paragraph and if you look away too quickly, you missed it.  I wasn’t even sure either of them was even satisfied as something else is quickly going on in the next paragraph.  All around, a real “quickie”.Most reviewers have mentioned they liked the second book better, so I will give it a try and hope that just knowing the characters will make it more interesting.Did I buy it? Yes Deal of the Day 1.99Would I listen to it again? NoWould I recommend it?

"I am a fan of the Moreno brothers Series and have enjoyed SOME of the 5th Street books, but this one was really disappointing.  I was expecting so much more and characters that I could really like, unfortunately, Bethany, the damsel in distress, was a complete liar the entire time and Damian was her fool.  There was way too much describing of emotions and not showing and repetitive revelations of “this is going too fast, or I have never felt this way so quickly and I will reveal everything when it’s over.”So there is this great family, just like in Reyes’s previous books, that includes four hunky males and one beautiful female.  The males are all gorgeous and self-confident: one is a musician, one is on a reality show, one is a cop (Damian) and one lives in in New York and seems to be moody. They all have “D” names: Delfina, Damian, Diego, Dominic, and Dimitri and are all very wealthy, of course.  Damian is a cop, but has family money and good investments and he meets Bethany through a friend, Jerry and quickly falls in love.  His detective’s intuition tells him that Bethany is keeping something from him and he suspects another man, but she continually makes him feel like he is being too jealous and possessive and he fights against his suspicions.Bethany is on the run from something that happened in California that the reader has no idea about until the very end.  She has a younger sister and brother that are still there and she sends them money from the multiple jobs she has.  A guy named Max has her running scared and it is her ties to him that she is trying to keep secret from Damian.  But her lies about Max are not her only ones.  She lies about who she is on the phone with, when her rehearsals are, when she is with Simon, a guy who likes her and what her situation is.  When he is rightly suspicious, she makes him think it is all in his mind and that he is having a jealous tantrum, making him apologize and question his correct suspicions.  She justifies this with knowing she will eventually tell him the truth after she has taken care of it because she does not want to get him involved.  I just don’t like the way she made him look like a fool and question his own correct assumptions.Of course, there was a misunderstanding, bad decisions and a happily ever after, but after an entire book of lies, flat characters and too much and too fast ""I love you's"",  it just didn’t do it for me.So while I really like this author normally, this book was just not up to the great romances the other series have.  The writing was more telling than showing and the heroine was stupid.  I did like Damian and his brothers and hope their stories will be better than this one was.There is descriptive sex including oral.Would I/Did I buy it? YesWould I read it again?

"I was just going to sample this story, but found I couldn’t put it down and ended up reading it in a couple of hours. It was really delightful and left me with a smile on my face.Biggest Flirts is very similar in flavor to Major Crush in its YA themes and romance revolving around drummers in the school band. In some ways this book also reminded me of Catching Jordan by Miranda Kenneally, as the two main characters are competing for Drum Captain and Tia, the heroine refuses to have a boyfriend, preferring to have one night stands regardless of the reputation that implies.  She has a hook-up buddies in the local pot-head Sawyer, but no ties to anyone boy.Tia has good friends, a busy dad, and three sisters that messed up royally when it came to men.  Two were left knocked-up and one left high school to follow her bum down south.  Being the only one left at home, Tia is convinced she is an irresponsible girl who should never be put in charge of anything, so when she wins Drum captain, she tries to convince others to challenge her and take it away.  Hot, new boy, Will Matthews takes Tia’s breath away one night after a party and the next morning takes her Captainship away in a fair duel.  Tia is relieved and bothered.  She has never felt about a boy the way she feels about Will and has to fight her feelings while shamelessly flirting with him in band.Typical high school drama incurs and is fun, sweet, silly and a little dramatic to watch unfold to its predictable and very likable end.  I loved Will’s character, identified with Tia’s and enjoyed all the secondary characters of best friends.  I really didn’t think I would like this book as much as I did after being disappointed by Such a Rush and The One that I want by Jennifer Echols.This story has a lot of different themes it tries to address: the abandonment issues created when a mother cheats and leaves, learning to trust, be true to yourself, not changing for another, jealousy and first love.I have previously enjoyed Echols “Romantic Comedies” such as Ex-Games and “The Boys next door” but I also love her more intense romance novels Forget You, Love Story and especially Going Too Far.  I enjoyed Echols writing and romantic stories whether they are for mature readers or as in the case of this story, suited for the younger YA reader.  There is no doubt that Jennifer Echols is a fantastic writer and I have enjoyed reading all of her books.  If you liked Major Crush, you will like this book too.There is kissing, some alcohol and weed use, talk of sex and promiscuity and some profanity (f-word, sh**t, gd).Would I/Did I buy it?

"So, I know this story is narrated from the main character, Mia’s point of view, but it is called “King’s” and he is the only REAL interesting character.  Mia is a foul-mouth, edgy woman who is not at all likeable because she is angry 70% of the book, whereas King, the true “villain” in this story, is mysterious, dark and TOO PATIENT WITH MIA!  Seriously, the reader wants to strangler her and tell her to stop her theatrics and stupidity, but King keeps her alive while killing others less offensive.Did you notice the title is the possessive of King?  That is because he claims people for payment. “I am the man who can find anything. And you are my Seer of Light. Let’s hope you stay alive longer than the last one.” – King to Mia.Mia’s archeologist brother has been “kidnapped” in Mexico and after depleting all her options, Mia enlists the help of “King” in exchange for being “owned” by him.  Their first encounter is at his empty office where he mistakes her for his evening paid escort.  She quickly and abrasively clears that up for him and continues to be a twit for most of the book.  EVERYONE fears King, (but not Mia) and those that belong to him are protected and respected.  Mia now belongs to him (despite her claims) and has entered a world where dreams and reality are hard to distinguish from each other.King perceives that Mia holds the power of “Seeing” and she finds that she can indeed “see” colors left from murders and objects.  Refusing to embrace her powers hinders King’s ability to find her brother and King’s true motivation, the Artifact that Mia’s brother, Justin has discovered and disappeared over.  She meets a string of seedy men//people while traveling with King and continues to exasperate King by disobeying him and blocking his ability to find Justin/Artifact.King is alluring, complicated, mysterious and dark – perhaps evil – you just don’t know.  He is always right and it is frustrating to watch Mia complicated and interfere with his plans.  King is sexy, sensual and more than he appears:  “Spells are for children’s fairytales. I acquire power, or more accurately stated, I obtain ways to channel it and use it to my advantage.” – King.“Was it really possible for ordinary people to acquire extraordinary powers, as King said he had? Was there more to the world than what one simply saw on the surface?” – MiaAnd that is the question.  How does King mysteriously disappear or appear out of thin air?  How is he able to “read” Mia’s mind or torture her inside her head?  Why does he keep her alive when she is so much trouble?  Just how old is he really?Mia is attracted to him and when her “visions” come over her she can’t help throwing herself at him.  I am hoping for less sexual teasing and more MORE in the next book.“You’ll be fine, he (King) said in that deep, deep voice that sounded like it had been cut from a blanket woven from thick dark chocolate and sin.” - MiaThere is nudity, crass conversations and harsh profanity (mostly from Mia).  While not really liking her, it is REALLY WELL WRITTEN and I will read book 2 for more King.  Hopefully, he won’t disappoint.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?

"""He walks away, leaving me alone with the echoes of his words. Nothing means anything. Things just happen. I’m falling down a philosophical rabbit hole, where there’s nothing but tiny tea cakes and mysterious vials that say “drink me, I promise I’m not poison”.  - MeganSo, this one was hilarious too, but to be honest, I found myself cringing a bit and not enjoying SOME parts of it.  I guess I just liked the first one better.  Megan is much “rougher” than her sister, but her problem around guys is fairly common in today’s world and many will identify with her defensiveness.  Megan is too honest, too defensive, too insincere and too scared and she doesn’t know why she behaves the way she does and says the mean things she says.I don’t know what I want, or why I want what I want. Or why I don’t want what I don’t want. But I do know I need to take another shower”. MeganMegan met Drew at her self-help group that she is accidentally apart of.  She went in thinking it was a weight watchers group, but stayed after liking the people there.  Drew makes her babble and say sexually forward statements.  She is abrasive and “complicated” (another word for the b-word) but doesn’t totally put him off.  In fact, he seems to like her and returns the next week for more.  Drew is a little bit odd himself, but she can’t figure out why HE is coming to the self-help group or why he is able to handle her “truthfulness”.  In fact, she can’t seem to offend him enough to make him stay away, and that has her running scared.“He measures out the coffee grounds and water like he’s a high school chemistry teacher making crystal meth” – MeganDrew is a dentist (only a mortician would be less romantic in my opinion) and I have to say, while many might find the part funny/romantic when she calls him over for an ""emergency visit"", it was my least favorite part and where the ""cringing"" was involved. Just, ICK! Okay, moving on.....Luca was Sexier, Drew was more Sensitive which explains why I liked book 1 better.This one is funny and at the same time, kind of sad because Megan is messed up and self-sabotaging.  Tina and Luca are in this one a little and offer some great support and Rory is adorable with her eccentricities.  Can’t wait for the third book, which I hope is hers.I have discovered that Mimi Strong books are best read out loud to friends.  They are hilarious and are easily enjoyed while sipping wine and hanging with girlfriends who laugh and identify with Mimi’s characters.

"Fiction Goggles are used to enjoy romances that have “beautiful people”, “simultaneous orgasms” and “no awkward moments”.  They are not perfect relationships, but the virgin can have sex over and over the first time, and the man-whore never looks at another woman after he meets “the One”.

"I was a fan of book one, but this one didn’t do it for me.  The main character, Jessica who we loved to hate in book one, practically stalked her ex-boyfriend Taylor the ENTIRE book begging him to tell her why he broke up with her their senior year in high school.  He had left her the minute he found out he had a full scholarship to Ohio State and after hooking up with her best friend Mallory there for a month, proceeded to hook up with every blond bimbo the school had.  We know from Guys are Props that Jessica was damaged by this unexpected break-up and that she slept around to numb the pain, so when Taylor FINALLY explains why he dumped her, it was NOT GOOD ENOUGH.Jessica was so manipulative in book one and so clinging in this book, that I never really did like her.  She did love Taylor even before he became a hottie which makes me mad at the excuse he gave her for the break-up.  College is known for being the Place kids “find” themselves in and Taylor was hoping Jessica would find who she was.  Unfortunately he was unwilling to wait or love her enough to go through that with her.  They both slept with a lot of people creating emptiness and really bad memories.  It is honestly just really sad and STUPID.So no, I didn’t enjoy this story even with its HEA.  It was a lot of angst for no good reason and a lot of very conditional love and a lot of betrayal.  There was no cameos from any of the characters in the previous book or any information on how they are doing.I enjoyed Seymour’s style and would read another book by her.

"I got this and the first one for free and admit, that might have a lot to do with my 3 stars ratings. Had they cost me $4.99, I would be a lot harsher.I actually liked this one better than the first one, whose heroine dated two men at the same time and REALLY bugged me.  This one also had Ex Sands narrate it, but either I am getting used to her being the voice of the Laurel Heights novels, or she has gotten less annoying.  She still talks in the back of her throat, which bugs me, but I guess I just didn’t find it as annoying.This is a totally separate and standalone story, which is good since you don’t have to read book one to know what is going on.  Freya, from book one, is mentioned, but even Anna, (who I would have liked to know whether she and Max got together or not), is not even mentioned.  Where Angela’s best friend was Freya in book one, in this book it appears to be Olivia, the lingerie owner.These stories are predictable and formulaic, but entertaining and the love scenes are pretty hot.

"This one hits the ground running and never lets up.  Cecile is a young farm girl who is planning to join her mother in the city to sing on all the great stages.  Her 17 birthday is the turning point to start her new life, only it isn’t the life she was expecting or dreamed of.  On her way home to her party, she is kidnapped by a fellow neighbor, Luc and sold to the mythical Trolls who live under Forsaken Mountain.Always believing that Trolls were not real, Cecile is quickly made aware of her dangerous position when she meets the evil and obese King of Trollus and he tells her of her immediate nuptials to his son, Tristen.  The Trolls come in a variety of shapes and tempers.  There are the usual hideous creatures, deformed, and some in-between.  Since the purebloods have mated with humans, there are also some really attractive trolls too, and luckily, Tristen is one of these.There was a curse put on the Trolls by a Witch that prevents them from leaving the mountain.  The Countess had a vision that would break the curse and it involved the royal line mating with a human with red hair.  The countess is part of an odd creature, she is conjoined to her sister, the queen, and sprouts from the queen’s back so that she is constantly demanding the queen turn around so that she can see what is going on.  It is kind of funny.Cecile has red hair and her singing voice is breathtaking.  I have to stop here and say, that although this book is call “Stolen Songbird” Cecile’s singing play NO ROLE in book 1; I am guessing it will be important soon, but it is not singled out in this book at all making the name seem pointless.  But I digress, Cecile is kidnapped, bonded to Tristen and imprisoned in the cave the Trolls and half breeds call home.  She begins to make friends and comes to realize that not all Trolls are not the evil creatures traditions have said they were.  She also finds that not everything is what it seems in Trollus and that there is a revolution underway to undermine the evil King and that her Tristen might be part of it.All the characters in the story have French names which leads one to believe this might be based on a French fairy tale that those more knowledgeable about French Culture could confirm.  I thought it was similar to Beauty and the Beast with the beautiful maiden being held by a Monstrous society, but it was also very unique.This is part of a trilogy, so there wasn’t a complete ending or all the questions answered.  While I enjoyed the story, I would have liked more interaction between Tristen and Cecile to believe their love story.  While their bonding let them feel each other’s emotions, the reader was not as influence and their sudden love for each other was too shallow compared to Tristen’s deep friendship with the female Troll, Anais.  One could feel Tristen’s need to protect Cecile, but love? Not as easy to see.No profanity, some (very little!) kissing, no sex (teased, but no)Would I/Did I buy it? YesWould I read it again?

"One sex scene – One!  And Beth acted like a biotch afterwards and ruined it.  If you read for romance, this is not the book for you.  There were 6 “major” kisses that all happened at inappropriate times (looking for a kidnapped boy, oh, let’s make-out) and again, Beth was a Biotch when she got her body back under control.  Yeah, Beth was not a likeable character at all.  The seals were all likeable, except Mac and the story would have been good, if not for the VERY SLOW PACE.I hated this author’s style of writing!  There was WAY TOO MUCH inner dialogue from Beth and Zane and it was repetitive thoughts.  There was too much description (she describes a kitchen at one point, as if we don’t know what a kitchen looks like!) of rooms and mannerisms.  It was detailed as if it was a script for a movie (have Zane place hand on lower back and puts foot on car), not a story.  And the conversations! Kill me now; they took forever to unfold and were headed to such obvious conclusions.  Zane would say something, then go silent.  Cosky would ask if Zane meant “this”, then go silent.  Zane would continue and say, “Yes”.  Rawls would ask what that could mean, then go silent.  Cosky would make a guess; reader would have already known this answer.  Zane would act surprised and agree, then go silent. Rawls would move the dialogue along with an obvious conclusion.  Cosky would ask a question the reader could already figure out.  Zane would start to answer it, then go silent.  They would all look at each other.  Rawls would answer the question.  Reader would throw kindle.The story doesn’t end.  After enduring a bad romance, sluggish conversation and men dying, the story doesn’t end.  There is no wrap up except for Beth’s immediate change of heart towards Zane which, after all her whining throughout the book, you want to tell Zane to run (too bad their “soulmates”).  Zane is stuck going through morning sickness with her since they share a bond.  How gross is that?I got this and book 2 Forged in Ash as Amazon’s deal of the day and got the audibles to go with them for .99.  I paid too much.  The narrator, Angela Dawe was irritating to listen to and made Beth worse than she probably was.Descriptive sex and lots of profanity (f-word, Sh**t, GD JC)UPDATE:  I did enjoy Book 2, Forged in Ash, so if you can struggle through this one, book 2 is better.Would I/Did I buy it?

"I was disappointed in Suzanne Wright’s Carnal Sins (which I returned for a refund) and was hesitant to get Taste of Torment, so I used my Prime Membership to get it free this month. I am so glad I did. In this book, Sam and Jared remind me of Bones and Cat from Jeanniene Frost’s Night Huntress Series. They are inseparably in love and fight well together against their foes while desiring each other’s bodies and minds forever.This volume was full of action and new characters. The Hollow is once again under attack with investigators Collins and Eloise making trouble for Sam, having to deal with a lethal case of The Call, and fighting off a dangerous invasion.Collins was Antonio’s first Turning and he is an arrogant rule-follower. He is jealous that he is not the Heir and has come to the Hollow with trump up charges that Sam is an unfit Commander and that she has had complaints against her. Eloise is a former one-night-stand of Jared’s and is determined to get a negative reaction out of Sam to include in their report. Two previous friends of Sam’s Cristiano and his sister Ava have arrived asking for help finding their missing vampires. Cristiano seems to have a “thing” for Sam which bothers Jared to no end and makes his alpha rise. They agree to help, but three of their team contract a plague called The Call which is lethal to all vampires. They must search to find a cure that has never been discovered before. And finally, Jared’s coronation to become the Grand High Master and Sam’s secret life as a hybrid is exposed to enemies who want to take over control of the vampires.While all this action is going on, Sam and Jared still find time to make love and adore each other. They are a fun couple to watch and listen to as they share their deepest feelings of love and fears. If you haven’t started this series, I recommend it. I love the tone this author uses for her writing. It is upbeat, sarcastic, intelligent and just plain fun to read. Alpha vampires, homosexual vampires, sexist vampires and really powerful and awful vampires. There was never a dull moment and the heroine Sam could really kick some butt. Definitely recommend!Some editing issues such as using stood instead of standing and other proof reading mistakes. There is plenty of profanity, but much of it is British (plonker, bugger, f-word son of a .. gd ) and some great descriptive sex.I really wish Suzanne Wright would have this made into an audio version!Would I/Did I buy it?

"Another SAD story!  I was not really a fan of Ruin, but stated in my review of it that I wouldn't mind a book about Gabe.  While I might have got my wish on this one, it was not the story I expected or, really, wanted.  Ruin was sad, but Toxic was worse and I really don't like to read sad books.  I also got to thinking how similar Kiersten and Weston's personalities were to Nat and Alec from ""Tear"" and Gabe and Saylor were replicas of Alyssa and Demetri from ""PULL"" - another story where you had to suspend belief.  And that just really says it all about this story - you will enjoy it if you can SUSPEND BELIEF for the duration of it.Gabe turns out to be a famous person that NO ONE has recognized in the last four years even though he uses his real driver's license to drink. He is also the best friend of one of the most popular and rich guys at school, but that notoriety has also never exposed him. Gabe accidentally harmed the love of his life when he was 17 and now takes care of her in a home.  He uses girls to ""forget"", but is in a ""dry spell"" since vowing to Wes not to keep hurting himself.  Gabe is very angry and is a totally different character from Ruin.Enter Saylor, the new girl in his life that changes everything - only the reader never sees this love really blossom, he just one day is totally in love with her.  The reader has spent half the book agonizingly falling in love with Kimmie, Gabe's first love that is now a paraplegic, and then has to transfer feelings to Saylor, someone who accepts Gabe's undying love, care and preference for Kimmie.  What we do know about Saylor is that she is an ANGEL since most girls would never be able to handle the last fourth of the book as wonderful as she did.I did not like that sadness.  It overshadowed the love story and the love story was between Gabe and a dying girl, not Gabe and Saylor.  2 star reviewer mommyofone really got the problems with this story.  I would have given it 2 stars too, but for .99 I just found Toxic to be Okay; I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't read it again.There was no descriptive sex (one scene at the end).  There was very little profanity (sh**T, damn,).

"“Be yourself, because everyone else is taken.  Fat or thin, be your wild, wonderful, unique self.” – Dottie Simpkins, Owner of Charm Classes.Let me just say that I would have HATED this book’s cliffhanger ending if I didn’t already have book 2!  Some cliffhangers are worse than others, and the ones that leave in the MIDDLE of a story are the worst!  This is the WORST!  So, that said, this is one of the funniest, relatable love stories (?) I have ever read and while I was not enthused about it at first, I just couldn’t stop laughing to stop reading.Peaches Monroe is a plus figured girl who runs a book store and captured the eye of a visiting movie star, Dalton Deangelo when she literally fell into his arms.  She finds her life getting more complicated the longer she dates Dalton and continually reminds herself to Keep Her Eyes Open, knowing the relationship cannot amount to anything long term.  To add additional complications to her life, her old heartthrob, Adrian Storm has returned to his hometown of Beaverdale and Peaches cannot explain the fluttering she experiences in his presence, believing her high school crush on him to be over.  They both comment on the dangers of dating actors and that they (actors)  are the very best liars alive, since that is their job.I have never read a romance novel that was so embarrassingly honest.  The sex was not earthshattering, the romantic encounters did not go smoothly and everyone was not beautiful and sexy.  Peaches is hilariously sarcastic and witty and her best friend, Shayla is her true partner in crime.  They “get” each other perfectly.  Adrian is mysterious and sexy, Dalton is smooth and sneaky and Peaches’s mom and dad are awesome.  The story just embodies the small town relationships, gossip and togetherness through tough times attitudes.  I was repulsed, allured, entertained and mystified enough to just keep reading.  Then the cliff hanger made me shout and get angry.  Not Right!!There was descriptive sex and plenty of profanity.  The sex included oral and back door which I don’t like at all, but the sex was not romantic in the first place and took some adjustments to just read through, so I don’t know, I just skimmed over it, too.  There are all sorts of questions left at the end of this one, so I am off to go find out what happens in STARLIGHT and hope Peaches didn’t just get used.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?  NoWould I recommend it to friends?

"I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I immediately gave it to my teenage daughters and my best friend who also totally loved it.  It has everything, action, YA romance, mystery, aliens, science, space camp, death, friendship, family and suspense.  This is one of the better YA books I have read in a long time.  HIGHLY RECOMMEDED.Maisie Danger Brown wins a cereal box contest to go to space camp for three weeks.  Wanting to be an astronaut since she was six, her only liability might be that she doesn’t have a right hand.  Her best friend Luther is a fellow science geek and homeschooler, who is loyal, witty and might have a thing for her.At space camp she is grouped with three other super-intelligent kids and they compete to win a visit to the “Beanstalk”, the world’s only space elevator docking on an asteroid 36,000 kilometers away.  Also, while at space camp, Maisie meets Jonathan Ingles Wilder, a cute rich boy who is not put off by her missing hand and whose wit and intellect coincide with her own.  Not sure why the cute boy is singling her out among the girls, Maisie is thrilled by the first chills of infatuation and first kisses.But space camp is much more dangerous and scary than the brochure described as aliens enter the stratosphere and a savoir of the earth is needed.  Friendships are tested, loyalties are questioned and danger is lethal Maisie and her team discover what the aliens can do and how they must stop them.I loved every exciting minute of this book, especially the writing style.  Shannon Hale outdid herself with the inner voices, the puns, the personalities of ALL the characters, and the intelligence of the story.  I loved the dialogue, the friendships, the mystery and the romance.  Don’t miss this one!No profanity or sex; some kissing and cuddling.Would I/Did I buy it? YesWould I read it again?

"Honestly??? This one starts off with Alex and Olivia having descriptive sex with other people?  No, sorry, just no.  I don’t do stories where people supposedly in love and meant for each other have sex with other people.  That is the great thing about fiction; people in love remain faithful to each other – tempted, yes, but not able to follow through out of loyalty and love for their true love.  This is just disgusting and a HUGE betrayal.  I don’t care if they are separated, Olivia has sex with another seconds after seeing Alex again after weeks.

"This story takes place immediately following Book One My Wolf's Bane ending, with Autumn and Zack agreeing to date and Charles waiting for Zack to finish high school before taking him to the werewolf King.  While sad that Zack will be leaving, Autumn loves being his girlfriend, despite the insecurities Gina puts in her mind about what Gina and Zack did when they were together.  Two new characters show up, Renzo and his niece Alura who seem to be watching Zack and Autumn and being too inquisitive.  After fighting with Charles, Autumn and Zack feel they need to break up to keep each other safe and end up making themselves insecure about their relationship while playing their parts convincingly.  Zack gets together with Gena for a science project and Cameron, a nice boy from school puts the moves on the now free Autumn.  Both make each other too jealous and hurt while supposedly broken up. But it all ends with everyone getting what they deserve.Autumn's parents are gone most of this book which allows her to do pretty much anything she wants.  While this does give her the ability to spend the nights with Zack, they never do anything more than snuggle and kiss because sex between two different species will SUPPOSEDLY make them weak and vulnerable, which would give the enemy, Charles a chance to kill them.There is some action and some paranormal situations, but this is mostly an angsty love story (swoon) with a stalker, fights, mystery and is the second in a (trilogy-?).  Honestly if you loved Hayden in Something Witchy This Way Comes,  you will adore Zack.  I love conflicted, honorable guys and these two are great!  This book does not alternate POV's like SWTWC's did, but you still saw the struggles of all the characters and fell in love with them all.Veronica Blade is friends with two of my favorite authors; Katie McGarry (Pushing the Limits) and Susan Hatler (Shaken), who help critique her work and explains why I love her work so much.  All three are very talented authors whose stories I highly recommend!The My Wolf's Bane Series  doesn't have any profanity or sex; just lots of very romantic kissing! (Smile)Would I/Did I buy it?

"If you love words, you have to read this book! Second books are traditionally the character development tomes that are not normally as exciting as book 1 or book 3, but are needed to round out the story.  Since Maggie Stiefvater excels at both character development and plot advancement because of her masterful use of words, book 2 is not just a filler but a brilliant work of art.In the first book we got the object of the mission (finding Glendower) and who was the leader (Gansey).  We also got the budding of an attraction between Adam and Blue, but the foreshadowing that Blue's real true love would be Gansey whom she saw herself lovingly kissing in a vision.  And let's remember, Blue's true love will die when she kisses him.  In The Dream Thieves we get a better perspective on some of the crew making up the expedition that Gansey is leading, specifically Ronan.  While, in my opinion, the story still centers around the group, we are given little tidbits of information about Ronan specifically that help us to understand his ""viper in the grass"" persona.  We are also introduced to a new bad guy (the previous one was killed off) named the Gray Man, who was just as fascinating as all of Maggie Stiefvater's other characters.  Here's what we learn:The Grey Man: has been hired by Professor Colin Greenmantle, for the last five years, to find the Greywaren which he believes is an instrument or relic that allows the owner to take objects out of dreams.  We learned that Ronan can do this and suspect that he is the Greywaren that the Grey Man is looking for.  While mysterious, he is as forthcoming as Noah was when he said, ""I have been dead for seven years"" and no one took him seriously.  The Gray Man is asked his job and he truthfully declares, ""I am a hit man"" and apparently the truth is stranger than fiction because no one is phased by his words. For a bad man, you really want to like the Gray Man and find him suspiciously charming.  It's like he half-heartedly struggles with deciding to be good himself, but never really puts any effort into it.Ronan:  Ronan can bring things back from his dreams and knows how his father made all his money beacause: ""I am just like my father"" page 37.  Ronan feels that ""All of his secrets felt dangerously close to the surface"".  We discover how important Ronan is to the search for Glendower as he discovers his abilities to bring things out of his dreams and what that means for Cabeswater. We really get to know and even like Ronan as we watch him make mistakes and learn to like himself.Adam: Made a deal to be the hands and feet of Cabeswater at the end of The Raven Boys.  Now he is feeling the effects of his sacrifice which has got him all out of balance and hallucinating.  He has to discover how to deal and communicate with Cabeswater and finds that his relationship with all the group has changed drastically, but not as much as he has himself has chaanged.The Beginning of Blue and Gansey's romance:  While Blue and Gansey did not change much in this story they are still struggling to find ""that more"" that each of them feels they are capable of, while at the same time discovering ""more"" in each other:""Gansey who prized honesty above nearly every other thing, knew it (a lie) when he heard it.  Blue Sargent cared whether or not he was interested in Orla. She cared a lot. As she whirled toward the truck with a dismissive shake of her head, he felt a dirty sort of thrill"". page 195Blue crumpled the edge of the (Gansey's) sheet against her nose.  It smelled like mint and wheatgrass, which was to say, like Gansey.""I have a crush on Richard Gansey"".In a way, it was easier than pretending otherwise. She couldn't do anything about it, of course, but letting herself think it was like popping a blister.Of course, the opposite truth also seemed self-evident.""I don't have a crush on Adam Parrish""Maggie has admitted to wanting to make her readers ""feel"" enough to cry and my instincts are that just like Noah and The Grey Man being very direct about who they are, Maggie is not fooling around when she says that Gansey will die (and from Blue's Kiss).  Every bone in my body wants to rebel against her taking the story in this direction and I grasp at the fraudulent belief that she will ""bring him back"" somehow for a happily ever after, but I don't believe it in my soul.  I believe I am on a journey that I have been told will end badly, but I have refused to take the warnings seriously and will have no excuse when the prophecy is fulfilled as defined. Blue and her mother experience the same fate: Missing loves.A lot more  profanity than the first book (because it is Ronan!)  (sh**t, gd, JC, MF, f-word), divination, psychics and overall creepy people that really make this story come alive. (smile).Would I/Did I buy it? Yes HardcoverWould I read it again?

"So this is kind of hard to rate. I love Katie McCarthy's style of writing and enjoyed the story, but it was just a tad too similar to Give Me Love for me to give it many originality points.  Hey, I read a lot of popular authors that use specific formulas (Abbi Glines, Melissa Schroeder, M. Leighton, Michelle Valentine), but they are such great character writers, that readers tend to forgive the repetitive themes.  Katie McCarthy is just such a great character writer, and could easily expand her theme in the next book - which I am hoping is about the hottest guy in the book, Casey.This one is about another of Mac's brothers, Travis and Mac's new assistant, Quinn.  Quinn and Travis have a one night stand and later realize that they will be around each other a lot.  This is great for Travis who wanted more from Quinn, but Quinn has some self-esteem issues along with a psycho abusive step-dad hunting for her which makes her wary of making any long term attachments.  Travis is all alpha male, including being the silent, brooding, somewhat possessive boyfriend while Quinn is independent, wary and insecure because of growing up in an abusive household.  She is also loyal, self-sacrificing and in need of some devoted friends, which she gets with the Jamison crew. The story is mostly written from Quinn's pov, but  I love that we get Travis's POV at the end!Some issues: Too Similar to the First One, so if you liked Give Me Love, this one is VERY formulaic, but not as long and drawn out.  There is the immediate attraction or romance that has some roadblocks to get rolling, there is the dangerous, gun toting bad guy who just can't be caught and there is a girl who thinks she can and should handle it all by herself, despite knowing a crack negotiation/protection team.  There is also the continual interruptions that come just when the sexy parts are getting good - I mean over and over where you kind of just sit back and wait for the fore-play to get interrupted. And it does - continually.  REGARDLESS, I love Katie McCarthy's characters and writing style and will DEFINITELY be in line to buy GIVE ME GRACE when it comes out.I was thinking this series was more like Michelle Mankin's Black Cat Record Series Love Evolution (Black Cat Records series), which are also really good.  I highly recommend this story for those who love a good romance and love story.  There was sex scenes, but not very explicit. There was some profanity (f-word, gd, sh**t, etc).Would I/Did I buy it?

"This was a cute story that kind of reminded me of Don't Let Go by Michelle Lynn. Both stories had heroes that had secrets that harmed their relationships when finally divulged.  Of course it also very similar to First Daughter, only MUCH SEXIER!  The author's style also reminded me of Lauren Blakley'sCaught Up In Us .  It is a good story for .99.Carrie Wallington is the daughter of an OVERLY protective senator who uses a young marine to watch his daughter while she is in school in San Diego, despite assuring her she wasn't being guarded.  Finn Coram was the 23 year old assigned to her duty who falls in love with her, knowing he shouldn't.  He plays the part of a careless surfer dude who is also in the Marines, and knows that Carrie is going to find out he is working for her dad and will hate him.  I kept imagining Channing Tatum as Finn and fell in love with the story (smile).Some issues: somewhat repetitive inFinn's belief that Carrie would break up with him when she discovered his lies.  He bemoans it a lot and it gets kind of old.  Carrie gets attacked and blood is on her neck from the knife, but she is rescued, taken home, and ravished and the only blood mentioned is that from her virginity(?).  Her neck needed medical attention, but it was never mentioned.It is fun, cute and predictable and maybe dragged a little towards the end, but I have to say, the little teaser phone call Finn got at the end to make me want to read the next book, was too manipulative.  I didn't need a semi-cliff hanger to want to read more by this author and I thought the ending was a low blow.Descriptive sex, profanity (f-word, gd, sh**t)Would I/Did I buy it?

"This was a good story that reminded me a little of Bad Rep by A. Meredith Walters, which I was not a fan of.  This one I liked.  Sadie is a girl who went wild sexually after a tragedy and gained a bad reputation, making her switch schools in her senior college year.  Starting over, she just wants to get through her classes with no more drama.  Her roommate, Jessa becomes her best friend and introduces her to the night life where she meets Brady, the lead singer for the band The Invisibles and a senior engineering major. Unlike her previous fraternity rich kid boyfriends, Brady is also not the typical rock star man-whore.  Against her own roadblocks, she allows Brady to enter her heart and learns to trust again.While Sadie shares all her past indiscretions and secrets with Brady, he is less forthcoming.  He is afraid she will leave him if he shares the drama in his own life and his lack of trust becomes a stumbling block for their relationship, especially because Kara, a family friend seems to know so much more than she does and is included when she is not.  Kara, who is in love with Brady despite his rebuffs, threatens Sadie verbally and keeps showing up in Brady's life.  Grant, Brady's childhood best friend, likes Sadie at first, but then meets her roommate Jessa who is dating Rob from the Invisibles and wants her.  His story is next due out in October 2013.Things I liked: Brady's desire to make Sadie realize she was the only girl for him.  When other girls looked at him lustfully or when Kara would not let go of her delusions of being with him, he ignored the lustful glares and stared only at Sadie, and he TOLD Kara that Sadie was his girlfriend and tried to get her to stop her stalking behavior.  He never gave Sadie reason to not trust in his love for her.  I love that he didn't tease her and try to make her jealous or lead anyone else on.Some issues: Brady doesn't ever use a condom?! Sadie admits to sleeping with half a town and if she is used to no condoms, she is a walking STD.  They never even discuss it or her being on the pill.  The sex scenes, while frequent were unsatisfying. It was descriptive up until the orgasm, then just flat.  Left one feeling really dissatisfied.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?

"I couldn't help but compare this to The Sea of Tranquility: A Novel by Katja Millay when I was reading it.  They both have these beautiful pastel covers, they both have a heroine who is struggling with her identity after a tragedy and the heroine uses some self-destructive behavior and running to deal with emotions.  Finally they both have a really great guy who is suffering through his own issues that love them and help them recover.Aimee's best friend Jillian died in a car accident after a party they both went to.  ""They were so close that it was an ongoing joke with my family that Aimee and Jillian were the opposite of Siamese twins - one head controlling two bodies.""  Aimee spent her senior year in Portland with her grandparents because she wanted a fresh start, ""a place where Jillian hadn't breathed the air"".  She returns to Florida to go to college with her sister and meets Cole the very first day.  Not ready to date, Cole, a guy with a reputation as a man-whore pursues her knowing he has to settle for friendship and totally confused by his feelings for her. ""You're not the only one who fell that day"" - Cole.I read and like Autumn Doughton's  On the Edge of Glass, but I loved In This Moment.  It was a real story that took its time to reveal all the gritty details of death, friendship, love and devotion.  Doughton writes ""bare bones"" love scenes  in that she builds the heat and desire in the reader, then tells you when it's over.  She also uses alternating POV's so you feel the desire Cole has for Aimee and learn to trust that he doesn't want to hurt her with his bad boy ways.  The reader also is inside Aimee's head and see her confusion, guilt and desires.""I never used to think about things like death and life and all the hundreds of thousands of seconds that get stuck in between.  Back then I didn't know the way that a person can crawl so far inside of you that your organs voluntarily shift to the side to make room for the shape of them.""Another story this reminded me was After Math (Off the Subject #1) by Denise Grover Swank, so if you liked that or The Sea of Tranquility, you will love this story too.Would I/Did I buy it?

"WARNING: This is Sad like  Chasing Nikki (Chase Walker #1) by Lacie Wetherford. Not my type of ""Love Story"" as I like to read for romance.  It is VERY WELL written, and if you can handle sad, you'll like it.Some Spoilers:So in this story, Eamon is the man-whore who doesn't want commitment/responsibility of any type.  He refuses the supervisor position at his work, he only does one night stands and  he is reckless with his own safety - taking stupid life-threatening dares for the adrenaline rush.  When he finds himself suddenly attracted to his life-long female best friend Rachel, where he just can't keep his hands off of her, he agrees to a weekend of sex with her to ""get it out of his system"".  Unfortunately for Rachel, she is and has been in love with Eamon for years and knows that a weekend of sex is going to kill her heart.  She hopes she is different from all his other girls, but finds she is not when he beds another red head after their perfect sex weekend.  What she doesn't know is that Eamon has to force himself to have sex with another girl because he can't get Rachel out of his mind and is afraid that he might be in love with her.Yes, I said force himself to have sex with another girl, actually TWO other girls.  He is really something. (Amazon prevents me from saying what!).  So while technically Eamon and Rachel agreed to only the weekend, he is not cheating on her, it still really FEELS like he is CHEATING on her and I hate that feeling in real life and when I am reading a LOVE story. Just saying.I really liked My Heart for Yours and Tobin and Delia play a very small role in this book.  This story takes place before Tobin sees Delia again since they have been broken up for eight months.  Tobin knows Delia is dating another guy, but also knows she is not in love with him.  Tobin is/was faithful to Delia for over eight months when he had no hope of getting her back, but his brother can't even go a week.  I forgot from My heart for Yours that Tobin's brother DIES!! This story is SAD! I really like Steph's writing, but this story is just depressing as far as love stories go.Editing is an issue in this one as there are plenty of missing words which makes the reader double take to get the sentence right.  There is descriptive sex and plenty of profanity similar to the first book.  While I really love this author's writing style , but I was disappointed by Eamon's hurtful actions and Rachel's too easy forgiveness and acceptance and, of course, the ending.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?  NOWould I recommend it to friends? Yes, for writing and with warning that it is SAD.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPATSHD83U8AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5UEKRK#wasThisHelpful","RPATSHD83U8AA","ADGLADSOHAQMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADGLADSOHAQMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Big WARNING that this book ends with a MAJOR cliff-hanger, so if you hate that trend in indie books, be forewarned.  In many ways, the ending reminded me of the cliff hanger in the FABULOUS book by Claire Contreras called There is No Light in Darkness (Darkness #1) (Darkness Series).  Thankfully, that series was only two books long and hopefully, so will this one.This is a great story for only .99.  25 year old Inky or Anika is a great character who has been through abuse and survived - with baggage.  She has a great life-long friend in Aimes, a boyfriend/fiancé who she has been in love with for 3 years, but only been together with for 2 months and another roommate/friend, Lisa while working as an artist and a bar-tender.  The first half of the book is establishing her relationships and setting the suspicion that all is not as perfect as it seems.  Inky is happily engaged, she is expressing herself well in her paintings and singing and she feels truly happy.  Her best friend Aimes who is normally pretty slutty, is in serious love with a divorcee named Gus, but her other roommate Lisa has been acting bitchy towards her lately and Inky met a hot guy named Cole who helped her through a panic attack and sparks went off between them confusing her feelings towards Evan.SOME SPOILERS:Those of us who have been there, knew what the bitchy roommate/ working out of town at the same time roommate has ""gone home"" boyfriend really meant, but poor Inky didn't see it coming.  Her name Inky is from the large tattoo of an oak tree on her back that represents the bad things that have happened to her but have not knocked her down.  She puts a new leaf on the ground of the oak tree to show one more thing she has overcome.  Inky's mother was emotionally abusive and her mother's rich boyfriend ""Papa Joe"" was sexually abusive.  When he shows up again after 10 years, and tries to get at Inky, she starts to have panic attacks again.The second half of the book is Inky's SUPER FAST relationship with 35 year old Cole who is from high society and has an A&&hole father. It explores two bent, but not broken people who want someone to trust and love.  They are the answer to each other's prayer and ""get"" the darkness the other goes into and needs help coming out of.  I wish more of the story was devoted to them.  Their story was a little too neatly packaged and could have been livened up with an encounter with the ex's or even if ""Papa Joe"" had turned out to be Giuseppe Drago's son and the guy who bought her painting.  There wasn't enough action or drama in the second half before that agonizing cliff-hanger! I LOVED the beautiful cover of this book!  You definitely get a lot of story, emotional angst and great friendship along with some dirty betrayals, angry music and destructive memories.  I liked it enough to want to read the next in the series when it comes out. There is a lot of profanity and somewhat descriptive sex.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?

"The first thing I noticed from page one was that there was too much ""he said"", ""she said"", not something more descriptive like,  ""she whispered, embarrassed"", or ""he suggested, helpfully"".  If you end your dialogues with ""said"" every time it becomes monotonous and misses out on the easy opportunity to flesh the characters out more.  Both Natalie Sharp and Alex Mercer appear to be robots at their first meeting with this stilted dialogue.The next thing was that the sexual attraction between these two was mysterious and emotionless.  ""He smiled, and parts of my anatomy reacted to him. I growled inside at them to stop"" or after refusing a drink in case it was drugged (3 pages in), and having just got his name, ""An image flashed in my mind of him touching me with (his hand), stroking my breasts and pinching my nipples and I clenched between my legs"". So, she wants the guy she thinks is wanker enough to drug her? And this ""sexual attraction"" is after she has tripped in front of him twice, once bloodying hands and knees and once knocking herself out and waking up in his house.""New Zealand has one of those reputations for everyone knowing each other but that's not the case, except for when it is"". ???It is in first person narrative which always seems to make the main character appear bitchy and the transitions stilted.  Then, at 10% when Natalie says she is not a whore and two minutes later is naked in Alex's truck ""doing him"", I lost interest in the story.  She met him the DAY BEFORE and he was in her restaurant with another woman.  She knows NOTHING about him but that his company is taking away her livelihood and  that he wants her and she beds him in his truck. Classy.While the story after that is fairly predictable and not much out of the ordinary really happens, it is the dialogue and the transitions that really began to frustrate me. I found it hard to care or even like these characters and wished the author had taken the time to flesh them out more.  I highly suggest getting the free pages first to see if the writing style is for you.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?  NoWould I recommend it to friends?

"So I am really not a fan of first person narratives, they sound too much like a diary and it is really hard to like a person when you know their EVERY thought.  It is also way too descriptive: what she is wearing, what she is doing, what she is thinking, who she bumps into, what she is eating.... skim, skim skimming.  Really, that is just not interesting and needs to be edited.  I liked all the characters and that it took place mostly in London, but they all acted so immaturely and the ""misunderstanding"" was too stupid for words.Chloe was cheated on by her boyfriend Connor, so she moves to London for a job promotion and meets Jack, the bassist for the band SubZero and they fall for each other.  Conveniently, he lives across the hall from her and when her sister comes to visit she falls for Tyler, another band member.  All is well until Connor makes a surprise visit to get Chloe back and tells Jack that he is still in Chloe's life.  Jack breaks it off with Chloe without letting her explain. The rest of the stories goes on from there.  Jack is definitely NOT an alpha male who fights for what he wants, which was slightly pathetic.The dialogue was really agonizing at many times included juvenile conversations and ridiculous meetings.  I admit the story gets more interesting towards the end, but how about some words to  the song Jack writes for Chloe? While I won't be continuing with the series, I would suggest writing alternate POV's, refraining from the diary type entries and add some rock and roll drama.  These musicians act like kindergarteners, not heartthrobs. (also, what is up with Nick and Noelle being a couple out of the blue? That needs more explanation).This is for the younger YA even though the characters are older; nothing really fits a mature situation.  There is some kissing but no profanity and no descriptive sex.Would I/Did I buy it? Free DownloadWould I read it again?  NoWould I recommend it to friends?

"Have you ever wondered who the half naked models in sensual (sexual) positions are on the cover of books?  Welcome to the world that Rook enters when she meets a modern young Fabio named Ronin and becomes the next erotica model for the Tragic campaign. Now why this book does not have these two on its cover is BEYOND ME!Wow, this was really good!  If you are in for a love story that is slightly erotic, than this story about abused Rook and smokin' Ronin is for you.  I must say, though, that the product description is very misleading as we never see Rook ""make it"" in the modeling business in this book.  She is just a troubled girl that is helped by someone who used to be in her place and was helped in life.  The book is more about Ronin and Rook falling for each other and Rook figuring out who and if she can trust her new friends. Also, the PD suggest her past will come back and ""get her"", but again, not in this bookSo, the tone of this book reminds me a little of The Edge of Never by J. A. Redmerski.  Rook was in an abusive relationship that she fled but ended up in another state and in a homeless shelter.  After being fired from her job and being falsely accused of stealing, she ""gets"" an invitation to a photo shoot and ends up getting the job.  It is there that she meets the beautiful Ronin, who has the same unique color eyes that she has.  Too scared to enter another relationship, she is thrilled to get paid to model even if it is for erotica book covers or other ""tasteful nudes"" not porn (and I quote).Well, most of us might disagree with whether or not she might be doing porn, but the point is she is working and calling her own shots, and is not being controlled anymore; at least she doesn't think she is.  There is something about her new job that makes her feel dirty and all sorts of red flags about Ronin, but she is hoping that she is choosing right and is glad that SHE is doing the choosing.There was a lot of sensuality, descriptive sex and, let's face it, soft porn in this book, but the story was still sweet and was not filled with angst, cheating or drugs.  There are some questions that are not answered as this is the first book ( the second called, Manic is due out in August 2013), that will continue Rook and Ronin's relationship.  Just based on the business they are in, they have a long road to go, but I will be reading all about them as J. A. Huss is an excellent writer and made me really care about these two lovers.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?  YesWould I recommend it to friends?

"This story is about Jonah who is a mafia type collector who worked for his Uncle Vinnie who is also a drug lord, and Olivia, who is a college student that runs into him accidentally when he is ""collecting"" from one of the professors.  She is immediately attracted to him, but he is brooding and makes a quick get-a-way.  Later that week, she and her roommates go to Club Risk and she sees him again.Olivia can't get Jonah out of her head even though he has tried to push her away saying that she was too good of a girl for a bad boy like him and that he would only hurt her.  He has secrets that he is unwilling to share and Olivia decides she can live with secrets if she can belong to Jonah.  They fall into bed together WAY TOO FAST especially for her being a virgin, but they are in lust, I mean love.While Jonah doesn't want Olivia to find out about his drug dealing job, She doesn't want him to find out her secrets either. But once she discovers his real job, she runs away from him and is in more danger than ever before.This story was really good but was missing the little something that made it sensational.  More intimate scenes would have help, more dangerous moments and maybe some jealousy would have given it the edge it needed.  Overall, it was a good mystery in regards to what Olivia had done that was so hard to confess, an alright romance in that it may have happened to fast and not enough emotional and physical description, but interesting characters. I will probably read the sequel which looks like it is going to be about Jonah's roommate, Denny and the girl he loves enough to leave alone.There are a lot of misspelled words and editing issues, but nothing too baffling, some not very descriptive sex and a lot of profanity (f-word, BS, sht, Hell,).

"This story was heavier than the first one as it dealt A LOT with grief and regret.  While it was well informed and sensitive, it was hard to find the love story between Demetri and Alyssa when Alyssa's previous boyfriend Brady was such a great guy.  Every time Alyssa went back in time to a memory with Brady, I fell more in love with him and swooned.  No, he was not perfect but neither is Demetri and sweet Alyssa deserves true love.  I could definitely see why it was so hard for her to move on.  Honestly, it was very depressing.The story starts off with the rock star, Demetri, getting a lowly job at the taffy shop which required masses amount of REALLY SUSPENDING BELIEF!  Demetri, crushed by a broken heart, drug addiction and reckless driving, is trying to turn his life around with the help of his therapist and closest friends.  He wants the consuming love his brother has with Natalee, but feels he has used up his one chance at true love when his girlfriend died in a car accident.  Natalee talks him into a common job working at the taffy shop because he has no inspiration to write songs.  While there, he meets the competition in the form of Alyssa, the beautiful, sarcastic girl who was not charmed by who he is and becomes his muse.Thus begins their love story: ""What if you take the one part of me that's finally started to breathe without crying?"" - Alyssa""No. I won't leave you alone. I won't abandon you. I'm sure as hell not going to listen to you, and you can damn well know that I'm going to fight for you"". - DemetriBoth Alyssa and Demetri have suffered loss and, I am not going to lie, the grief sessions at Demetri's house made me tear up.  There were these flash backs of Alyssa and her boyfriend Brady that were so sweet, that the loss hurt that much more.  It was hard to read.  The whole book was emotionally draining and, while many will find this romantic, it is not my type of story.Was it as good as Tear?  Well, not really; it was definitely emotional, but not as romantic or filled with good drama, just sadness.  At least it didn't have a stupid love triangle, I really hate those.  You could really tell a female was writing Demetri's thoughts and it was a little lame sometimes because, as he confesses himself, he was really acting like a girl.Some confusion on story integrity: Demetri claims to be both nineteen and eighteen in the book which is it? Also, how hard all these kids fell in love at such a young age (15) - it is so Romeo and Juliet. And Alec and Nat's relationship sure got boring - where'd their spice go?  It's too early for the honeymoon to be over! And his reveal to Demetri that he might have got another girl in trouble was just wrong on so many levels.  Apparently book 3, Shatter, will be written from Alec's POV and will strain his relationship with Nat as AD2 becomes REALITY TV.Rachel Van Dyken is an entertaining writer who always keeps me turning the pages, and even though this one was too heavy for me, I will definitely be purchasing book 3! Her stories are definitely YA, not New Adult, but for .99, it is a STEAL.No Swearing or sex; but there was intense kissing, drug and alcohol use and sleepoversWould I/Did I buy it?

"So in this book, Hope has the perfect boyfriend, Trent, but then meets Joey and is no longer in love with Trent.  The two times she sees Joey, he acts like a complete, wasted jerk.  Personally, I can't find a reason for her to be mooning over the Italian Jerk when her boyfriend is treating her so well.  Most girls marry men like their fathers if they have a good relationship with them, and Trent is just like Hope's father.  Hope and Trent have sex once in a year long relationship and the reader is expected to believe he doesn't try to get more?  Not likely. Hope was in love with Trent at one time, but now finds Trent BORING.My suggestion to Ashley Wilcox is to start this story with meeting Joey the second summer and gloss over the previous year that Hope is with Trent.  Do not make the reader fall in love with Mr. Perfect (""Trent has every quality that you dream your future husband will have - good looks, big heart, sensitive, hardworking and an overall great guy.  He's the perfect guy""), have sex with him and then bring in another guy. Hope has two sex scenes with Trent (one after Joey!) and only one with Joey. Oh, and make the love scene with Joey a lot hotter!This ""love story"" just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I liked both guys (eventually), but not Hope. I personally, was hoping Trent would find a new girl and forget about Hope. Hope's reaction to finding out about Joey and making out with Trent felt like cheating.

"Well, you know I bought this one just because of the COVER!!! Unfortunately, I hated the story! This book is for you if you like horrible people who have sex, I mean lustful f-ing, but they absolutely do not make love, like at all and SUPPOSEDLY fall in love. I know there are many out there that do (10 positive reviews already to prove it) but for those who like romance and decent people who do not play games with other's lives, cheat or use sex as a weapon, you will hate this story.By 17% through, I was not impressed and even slightly disgusted with the main character Aston. While I really like reading dual points of view, this one repeated the SAME events over again. The narration style made the characters seem less than charming; Aston was beautiful and knew it and Sloan was just a jerk: ""Just looking at her through a window, like a pervert none-the-less, got me all hot and bothered. Man, I was going to have to start taking cold showers at work if this was how my *ick was going to spend its day"" and ""I don't know exactly what it was, but being in the close proximity and hearing her laugh, was making my *ick twitch."" Classy. *ick is used 33 times. Also, Sloan is romancing Aston at the office, but still being a womanizer each night - douche.SOME SPOILERS***I am also not a huge fan of winking and these two did a lot of winking (35 times!). These two couldn't be more pretentious and conceited. I kept thinking I would grow to like them, but NO. I started skimming by 23%. Finally, at the Toby Keith's Bar, things started to get better (27%) and later with a hot night of sex. But then she succeeds in her mission of making her ex, Nole, regret her and leave his bride at the altar and all she can think about is sleeping with Sloan again and I am right back into hating this book. Oh, and Aston's best friend Shelby steals someone else's boyfriend, then later cheats on him with a waiter, then is with him again - quality girls. All this action happens within 5 weeks and let me just say, I hope there isn't a sequel, because you know these characters are not going to make it. END SPOILERS***(thoughts as I kept reading) Oh. My. God. These people all deserve each other!Keep in mind, the star system is not how well a book is written, it is whether or not you liked the book and reviews are subjective. This book wasn't for me, but that doesn't mean others won't like it. As for me, Aston, Sloan and Shelby are three people I hope I never meet.Some profanity YES!!!, descriptive sex and oral sex, self-sex, drinking.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (2.99)Would I read it again?

Airicka Phoenix is a very good writer if not too prolific!  This is definitely a teen novel that deals with highschoolers that are 17 but seemed younger, but then it also has some super ADULT situations that makes it very INTENSE.  There is a very big parental presence and some repetitive dialogue that may contribute to the length of the story, but overall, a very good romance with some absolute TERROR in it.There is a new bad boy in town, Spencer, with a schizophrenic hot/cold attitude toward the heroine Sophie. Sophie likes the most popular boy in school, Brian who is finally singer and invites her and her friends to the popular group's party that Friday night. Sophie has to sneak out of her house in order to go to the party and ends up being saved from three university guys by none other than Spencer. (She is continually walking into his ""brick wall"" chest and being saved by him).  While wildly attracted to Spencer's body, Sophie is confused by his meanness towards her.  Both throw insults and sarcasm at each other, but just when Sophie thinks he might be acting nicely towards her, he does something incredibly mean and keeps his distance from her.When Sophie later discovers that Spencer's old girlfriend hurt him BADLY and that is why he doesn't want her, she begins to understand his hot/cold attitude. As they start to get to know each other, Spencer's car is vandalized, they get hit with BB's and Sophie is left a bloody gift on her doorstep.  Somebody does not want them together and they have to hide out for awhile. Their romantic relationship is really sweet and fun to read!  Then there are chapters and chapters of Sophie being abused by the psycho that wants her and it is very disturbing to witness the sickness of this character. ""You are much feistier than the others.  They were willing to do anything I said just so long as I swore not to hurt them."" - psychoAll the characters are really great and definitely fleshed out, but it really was too long.  A good editor could really help tighten this book up (mostly by taking a lot of the conversations with her parents out as they are mostly repetitive). I really loved the plot and the characters, but to be honest, I skimmed A LOT and still found it a fantastic story.Some profanity (sht,damn,one f-word) very sensual make out scenes (hello!) sex but not even descriptive (talked about after the fact) and physical abuse from the psycho that wants her and kidnaps her and others.

"If you were a fan of Veined (A Guardian of the Angels Novel) (download it while it is FREE!), then you will love Lethed just as much.  It is NOT the typical second book where nothing really happens - NO - it is full of action and love and kicking demon butt!  I love Anyta Sunday's characters - all of them - and her writing style.In Viened, Sylva became a Guardian because the Angels needed help to battle demons and keep the gates of Eirene safe.  She and Atticus were ""lethed"" - stripped of all their memories of each other but had the added ""bonus"" of being able to feel each other's wounds.  Sylva's family's memories had been ""lethed"" also so they had no memory of her.  It hurt that she wasn't missed and that she no longer had a family.  She felt ALoNE.  Marcus had left with his bonded Guardian Dimitri (gay relationship - not the only one, I might add) but she was going to get the chance to see him and go to a Vein Dance to watch two people get engaged.  Guess who one of them is.....There is a Moirae prophecy that says there's a way to relock Eirene and separate it from Ache forever  and that Sylva is the KEY to the prophecy, but only a few believe in its validity. Attic's mom, the Queen, still hates Sylva and is determined to keep them apart.  There is a lot more attention paid to the strained gay relationship between Dimitri and Marcus and adorable Jason (yes, I said adorable) is a major character who is trying to redeem his error of giving Silver to Furie.  Both Marcus and Jason are still half demon and have a hard time fighting the evil within.The great thing about Atticus and Sylva having their memories removed is that they get to fall in love all over again, I mean, once a couple falls in love, the story becomes a little stagnant, so if they get to start all over again, you start cheering for them to REMEMBER!!!!  I loved it.  This book also had a serious message about doing what was right over what is wanted. ""We do what we have to"" even when it involves a loved one dying or denying love because it is right.If you haven't read Veined in awhile, a review is needed.  While Anyta goes over some of what happened before, it is really skimmed and somewhat confusing at first.  There is some  profanity (s***, B*tch, f-word), really gross, descriptive, bloody fighting, drinking, some almost sex and some really good kisses (smile).  Book 3 called Phoenixed is not due out until 2014.  Someone tell Anyta to WRITE FASTER!Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (2.99)Would I read it again?  For ReviewWould I recommend it to friends?

"If you are like me, you see the word ""Documentary"" and think LONG and BORING, not romantic love story. While this book is long (Over 400 pages for only .99), it is definitely NOT boring! The great thing about reading a book this long is that you REALLY get to know the characters and come to care about them. And there are a lot of really great characters in this book from bad boy surfer twins, to Hawaiian Hotty to sexy, fun loving girls to slutty one night stands. If you enjoyed Foolish Games (Book 1) (Foolish Games Series), Tidal, Love Unscripted: The Love Series, Book 1 or  Incidental Happenstance then you will like this book too.This exciting story opens with a prequel where musician bad boy, Kai, and his (former) best friend, Jeremy are at the end of a knock down fight and Kai questions whether he has killed Jeremy who is NOT moving. What has got Kai so mad???? That is the plot of the story as everyone wants to know what happened that night as the fight took place in the ally.The first half (200 pages) is about college junior Dylan Carroll getting the coveted job of documenting bad boy singer Kia White for a couple weeks for Christmas break. This is Dylan's ""big break"" into the industry she loves and she has a natural talent at film making. Dylan, like all breathing girls, falls hard for the gorgeous Kai, but has to stay away from him in order to keep her job. This is WAY TOO HARD for her since Kai is continually flirting with her and staring at her. Both Kai and Dylan are damaged souls as Dylan's beloved brother, Mac, died 6 months ago and Kai has had a VERY rough life. Kai is constantly getting in fights and it is Dylan's job to help redefine his image by letting the fans get a look at the real Kai White.""Cute or not, he seems like a disaster, and not the kind where you're both tolerable train wrecks and in the midst of the ""baloney"", it just sort of works out due to some sort of cosmic trickery"" - Kate (Dylan's best friend) (Amazon wont let me use real quote)The second half of the book (another 200 pages) is about the super SECRET that Kai has and whether or not he will reveal it. Dylan is under orders from her boss, Nina, to wheedle out the secret and reveal it, but her deepening feelings for him only make her want to help him overcome his demons. Since Kai knows he can't be with Dylan and that he is ""just a job"" to her, he continually provokes her (and the reader) to jealousy. I know, Dylan's devotion to Kai gets a little much and you want to tell her to GET A BACK BONE! But just keep reading.To be honest, I would recommend this author take 80 pages off this work and give it a new title. No, I did not skim at all, and I loved ALL her secondary characters, but the book was long. As for new title suggestions that would help market this book better, how about: Record of Love, The Tattoo Song, Lyrics Are My Ink and lastly Team Dick (you have to read the story to get that one, LOL). I totally recommend this gem, especially at the low price of .99 - WHAT A STEAL! There is a sequel, but this does not end on a cliff hanger, thankfully!Profanity (btch, f-word, etc) descriptive sex, drinking and some drug reference.Would I/Did I buy it?

"Michelle Mankin has a great idea of modern re-tellings of Shakespeare's comedies using a rock band and country singers.  I loved Love Evolution which was Twelfth Night and Love Revolution which is Much Ado About Nothing.  I am looking forward to Love Resolution due out in March (according to the author's comments at the end of this book) of 2013, but no hit is given about which Shakespeare comedy this one will be.I am a big fan of characters reappearing in subsequent books and was not disappointed to see Avery, Mason and the rest of Brutal Strength, especially JR, who was a main character in this book.  So if you know the Shakespeare story, then you know it is about two female relatives (sisters in this book) who fall in love.  One is prickly and is hard to love, the other is sweet and kind and the perfect woman.  I was surprised when Sara and Chris Alex (who we met in book 1) meet because their sexual banter seemed juvenile and I was surprised to find out they were 32 and 44 respectively.  I thought these two were the main characters and in their early twenties when I first started reading, but it is Sara's sister Sam who is in her twenties and falls for JR, the drummer of Brutal Strength.Of course there was the showdown and the feelings of betrayal, just like in Shakespeare's work, and a sweet/sad love song that Sara and Chris collaborated on called That Leads to Leavin' you.  I love that this author can write lyrics and it reminds me of Where She Went by Gayle Forman.  These re-tellings are really fun to read and, again, I have recommended it to my best friend.There was very descriptive kissing, some profanity (f-word) and some sex in this one.  I loved that it was romantic love making and not the dominate crap that is so popular today and in so many of the books I have read lately.  Both girls are CHERISHED by the guys that love them and not treated as ho's.  Brutal Strength's members seemed to be really decent guys as there were no groupies, casual sex, bad boy behavior or psycho paparazzi, just good clean Shakespeare comedy light-heartedness.Would I/Did I buy it?

"This was a love story of two broken souls finding each other next door and fitting together to make something beautiful.  Ally had been through a traumatic family murder and Ian had lost his fiancé to cancer. Both just wanted to be left alone and sought isolation to grieve.  When Ally becomes too sick to stay home, Ian becomes her lifeline and her miracle worker and she unwittingly helps him to heal too.""It sucks when someone you know turns into someone you knew, especially when it is yourself."" - Ally""It is astounding how when you look at me I may seem Ok, like I have it all together, but if you see me when no one's around I'm thoroughly broken inside and struggling to put the pieces back together"" - IanIan shows his inner beauty way before he ever falls in love with Ally or realizes she is beautiful to him.  He proves his loyalty, dependability and honesty way before he claims her beautiful body as his own.  I also like the alternating POVs so you know what each character is thinking.While I liked the love story, there were several parts that left a little to be desired and I did end up skimming some of the cheesing moments in the end.  The declaration of love was unnecessarily prolonged and misunderstandings took up the space. There was some editing issues such as missing ""i"" in the word ""in"" and some extra letters to some words. There was some descriptive sex towards the end.Would I/Did I buy it?

"I got this because I liked the cover, was intrigued by the description and it was only .99.  I have to disagree with the other reviewers so far, as I found this story predictable, somewhat boring and the characters - flat.32 year old Theresa was married twice to two twits and was still making really bad choices.  While her second husband, Gary was stalking her to get her back, she goes on a blind date with Stuart, on her best friend, Jamie, recommendation.  She decides to sleep with this loser, but stalker Gary shows up and Stuart high tails it out of there, leaving Theresa to handle Gary on her own.  Convinced by her ""sage"" best friend to hire a body guard, she is yet again on the cusp of lust when she meets Nathaniel, the god-like body guard who just happens to ""like"" her back (because a two time divorcee with a bratty 9 year old is so attractive).  I found their romance to be dry, predictable and really boring.  With all the great reviews, I just kept expecting it to get better...something, but no.Theresa has an adopted daughter with her first husband, Glen.  Glen now has three biological daughters and treats Rhea differently which makes her resentful.  Rhea has taken to drawing and saying the male body part all the time and saying inappropriate things in front of Nathaniel, such as will you two be having sex?  Theresa never corrects her and really seems clueless as a mother, acting more as a big sister. (ex: Theresa wakes a cranky Rhea up to go to school and won't buy the ""I'm sick"" routine.  9 year old Rhea says, ""I hate you, you bitch."" It's troubling to watch.  Theresa is not any more mature in her conversations with Nathaniel and her inability to understand their relationship.Then, there's the over use of the f-word, oral sex, stalker behavior and inappropriate words for a 9 year old daughter. There was some editing issues with misspelled words and redundant articles, but nothing you can't eventually figure out.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (.99)Would I read it again?

"I thought I was lucky to get Fight With Me and Come Away With Me for .99 each one day and quickly downloaded both.  I now believe that there is something like TOO MUCH sex for a book.  I compare it to eating Oreo's.  The first two are delicious, but the more you eat, the more nauseous you get - no matter the variety of ways you try to eat them.  Nate and Julianne go at it like rabbits and honestly, it is not love, just lust that is based on nothing but looks.Nate and Julianne are playboy beautiful, rich, smart, exceedingly athletic, beautiful, rich, beautiful, athletic, beautiful.  Did I say they are perfect in most ways the common folk are not?  They are UNBELIEVABLY blessed physically, financially, mentally, etc.  There is just no way to identify with these two, especially Jules who has an several orgasms EVERYTIME she and Nate go at it and that is AT LEAST three times a day. She is Wonder Woman.  I was starting to get bored when these two were together no matter how many variations of sex they tried - and they tried them all in a three week period.  All they ever did was tell each other how beautiful the other one was and how much they wanted the other.  I sure hope neither of them gets in an accident and mars those good looks because I doubt the other one would stick around.The slim plot of the book was the fear of what would happen if these two were discovered together by those at work because of the no fraternizing policy.  Nate was totally devoted to and protective of Jules so there was no real drama with jealousy; actually there was no real drama over anything - just sex - A LOT of sex.  Twice there was a reference to ""making love"" but Jules barely put up with it; she wanted it fast and hard all the time.My ending feeling for these two was sadness.  Their relationship seemed so shallow and missing love.  I guess that makes sense as these two are both (MMA) fighters and lives reflect this defensive style.  They are mistaking lust for love and sex for affection.  Their story reads like a two month one night stand.Obviously there was descriptive sex and the f-word which seems the only way to the sex these two had.Would I/Did I buy it?

"Over a year ago I thoroughly enjoyed the first in this series, Fate Fixed (The Erris Coven Series) and was on a sequel watch for the Blood Twist.  How I missed it when it was released a couple of months ago is beyond me.  Blood Twist is just as good as the Fate Twist and thankfully, it gives a great review, and then carries on from where Fate Fixed took off. Blood Twist was suspenseful, intriguing, and sometimes disgusting. I loved seeing Lexie and Torin again and Braden and Liz were just as wonderful to read about.  IF you like Fate Fixed, this one will not disappoint!Lexie's mom needs a cure to her werewolf disease her horrible husband gave her before being killed by his eldest son.  Braden is determined to trade his life for the cure, but is talked into taking Lexie's best friend Liz with him.  He is un-explainably attracted to Liz, but knows they have no future together as he is going to die and he has never dreamed about her.  Braden is not really Liz's usual type, but she can't help the pull of attraction she feels toward him.  Thinking she is going with him to retrieve the cure, she is surprised when she meets up with another coven of vampires who are human blood drinkers.  She also meets Braden's Brother Riley who didn't make it through the change without drinking human blood.  He wants Liz and his brother to stay with him and make a new coven together.Death is also a character in this story and his parts are completely disgusting.  He licks up blood and eats his kill slowly.  He is determined to have the succulent blood of Braden and has waited almost 12 years for Riley to lure him to their nest.  I really liked the alternating POV's that included death, Braden and Liz.While not as romantic as Fate Fixed, it is still compellingly written and full of great characters and action.  It would be appealing to those who enjoyed The Darkwoods Trilogy (The Mayfair Moon (The Darkwoods Trilogy #1)) by J. A. Remerski or who read the first book in this series and liked it. There are small editing problems such as missing words or misspelled words (accept for except), some profanity (some f-word, sob, etc), paranormal eating of humans and reference to sexual situations.I am looking forward to the next in the series called Soul Kissed which I think willfeature Lexie's little sister Elle and her werewolf love Nicolai.Would I/Did I buy it?

"UPDATE:  Great, A New Cover, Now Get A New Title!! (smile)This is a wonderful story that is only ruined by its BORING cover and UNINTERESTING title! Do NOT let that prevent you from buying this book.  It is sexy, mysterious, suspenseful and ROMANTIC.  I was so hesitant to start this story because of its boring cover, but once I started, I didn't want to put it down. (Suggested alternate titles: Climbing Over To You, Challenge Her, Crazy For You. Honestly, ANYTHiNG would be better!)Danny (Danielle) is the baby daughter of the Bennet clan and wants to pursue dream of going to Columbia to get her degree.  Her father refuses to pay for it, so she applies for a job from the rival Cahill family.  Austin Cahill knows that she is a Bennet and has hired her to seek revenge on her brother Derek whom he thinks is responsible for his fiancé's death.  At one time, Derek and Austin were best friends determined to end the long standing feud, but actions, rumors and distrust won out and separated them for the last 15 years.  When Danny showed up on his work site, Austin had no idea he would fall for her hard.While I LOVED the romance of Austin and the feisty Danny coming to fruition, it was the personalities of all the characters that really had me enjoying the story.  Danny's brother Derek was a great brother, friend and lover, Melanie, his girlfriend, was also Danny's best friend and was a real spit-fire.  The guys on the work site who gave Danny such a hard time before making her one of their own all had distinctive likeable characteristics and really fleshed out the story.  They all were a really great cast of characters, so when one of them is fatally wounded, I was heartbroken and lost some of my enthusiasm for the story.  I am sorry, but it is true.  I don't like tragedy in my stories and this one reminded me of Chasing Nikki (Chasing Nikki #1).  I just didn't see it coming.  Despite the tragedy, J. A. Dennam does not let the reader wallow in sorrow for a long time and the book ends on a positive note.So, most of the story had great editing, writing, characters, love story, rival families, plot, and dialogue and I HIGHLY recommend it as a delightful read.  But the last bit was sad and left me less excited about having read the story.  I still love it enough to recommend it to my best friend who is WAY less sensitive than I am.

"Typical fan response: review wasn't even up 3 minutes before it was hit.  Why can't fans understand that not all reviewers will give their favorite authors 5 stars and that just maybe others would like to hear a different point of view?  AND that the helpful review button is for those without a vested interest.I have to say, I was kind of disappointed in this story because it was just too unbelievable, sticky sweet and wrapped up WAY too nicely which is ironic coming from an author who calls herself a ""hardcore realist"".  I suppose if I had read this story before Slammed and Point of Retreat I would be more lenient, but Hoover's stories are now just too ""perfect"" with very little realism.I didn't hate this story; in fact I loved parts of it like when Holder told Skye that he ""live her"" - a combination of ""like"" working towards, but not yet, ""love"" - that was imaginative and beautiful.  I also liked how the story unfolded by being mysterious one minute and romantic the next.  I loved Karen and Skye's relationship with their ""I'm not getting pregnant, Mom. Only terribly high and cracked out."" She laughs and hugs me. ""Good girl. And wasted. Don't forget to get wasted"", and the trust they had in each other.  But the poetic and imaginative writing that captured my attention in Hoover's previous works was corrupted by the unrealistic PERFECTNESSWhat I didn't like was how PERFECT Holder was, I mean, come on, he was 18 or 19 years old and he said and did everything as if he had a PhD in psychology.  It was UNBELIEVABLE and made me roll my eyes and groan to read one more sentence of his god-like answers of comfort.  It immediately lost its grittiness for me and the drama became just that - drama.  Then the inter-lapping of lives and circumstances all wrapped up so neatly that no one appeared to even need therapy just seemed implausible and sappy.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't want a sad ending, just a believable one!I hate that I feel this way about a book that so many have obviously LOVED, but after rolling my eyes for the eightieth time, it was hopeless (literally).  This story was going to be a chore to finish; and it was.  It took me four days, but I did it.Indie authors are writing the life out of abuse, suicide and bullying and giving their victims' PERFECT saviors (which they claim they can because it is FICTION).  Well, FICTION does require some realism to make it believable and enjoyable or at the very least relatable.  Maybe a savior does come along, but he is NEVER perfect and THAT is what makes him human.Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (3.99)Would I read it again? NoWould I recommend it to friends?

"So, I really, really enjoyed Just Remember to Breathe (Thompson Sisters) and immediately downloaded this next in the Thompson Sister's Series!  I don't know how Charles Sheehan-Miles writes such a romantic, dramatic, heart-felt story, but he is excellent at it and can count me as a fan.  This is saying a lot, because I DO NOT LIKE to read romance books by MALE writers.  I usually find their female characters missing any depth of emotion and the loves scenes, shallow.  But not this author! (honestly, I had to check his author page to confirm he was a guy; I was so impressed).Just like her sister Alex, Julia Thompson was a wonderfully fleshed out character that was just as emotionally wounded as Dylan was in JRTB.  She ran away from relationships after being betrayed and abused by her family, her best friend and her first love.  She was unable to trust, to love and to be loved, so when Crank, the lead singer of the band Morbid Obesity fell hard for her, she panicked and ran.Crank had his own emotional scars that kept girls at arm's length.  Oh, he would sleep with a different one any night of the week, but he was careful never to make any commitments to any of them.  He was the first one to be shocked by his intense feelings for Julia, but was quick to accept that he wanted her and only her.  He was tired of ""being alone in a crowded room"".  Crank's home life was filled with a loving family that had trouble with mental illnesses that caused strained relationships and absentee parenting.  The result was a rebellious Crank who was finally tired of being angry.Julia and Crank were puzzle pieces meant to fit so perfectly together.  It took awhile to realize they were part of the same puzzle, but when they finally come together, the picture is perfect.  This is a beautiful love story involving two bleeding souls who heal themselves and each other.  I loved it and will be anticipating the next installment in the Thompson Sister's Series.Would I/Did I buy it? YesWould I read it again? Yes!Would I recommend it to friends?

"Listen, if you love reading Bride Magazine and House Beautiful, then you will love this book.  As the title would suggest, this book is about PLANNING for a wedding and it goes into DETAIL about the cake flavors, wedding dress styles, furniture to buy for the new home, etc.  I have to admit, my personality is the same as Joie's on this (she let Riley plan it ALL) so I skipped those parts (which was a good portion of the book. Additionally, Riley and his boyfriend's romance, which we really saw blossoming in book two, is the main feature in The Wedding Blitz and I am more a fan of Joie and Hawkins' dealing with her pregnancy or Lizzie and Warren's messed up life after his sister died.  Now that would have been interesting to read!Honestly, I loved, loved, loved book one, Foolish Games, thought Time Out was just OK, but am so glad that The Wedding Blitz was free (Prime membership).  I love the character's personalities, but NOTHING really happened in this story and I was really disappointed that there was no adventure in this one. Yes, there were some twists and some new characters, but no real drama.  I know I will be bombarded by ""not helpful"" votes by Speigel fans everywhere, but I would want an honest, non-biased opinion if I was paying for this book and if your are not a Bride Magazine fan, you will probably find this book flat.Would I/Did I buy it?

"Sorry, I am just going to have to be in the minority on this one as I like an alpha male and Seth is not even close.  To be honest, I didn't really like any of the characters in this story and although it was similar to Rock Me by Cherri Lynn, the characters were just not as likeable.Seth is, in my opinion, a wimp who is incapable of fighting for Devi.  He listens to what everyone else tells him to do and just lets things happen.  Devi isn't any better because she is too forgiving and accepting of Seth and lets him come in and out of her life.  The casual kisses Seth is always giving her are just creepy.  Seth's My Misery Muse band members are immature and selfish and Devi's friends are just awful, blaming her for Seth's departures and the eventual bad press. Finally, I have yet to meet a two year old able to talk that maturely and have so much understanding.There were parts I did like: family loyalty, faithfulness, good parenting, Drake's possessiveness and readiness to defend his sister, and the alternating POV's give it more flesh and helps the reader know what is really going on, but there wasn't enough drama to keep the story interesting or reasons enough for Seth's departures.The story involves rough sex, body piercings, tattoos and drinking/drugs use by a band member.

"The product description sounded really good, so for .99, I thought I would take a chance on this author I had never read before.  It is always a risk, but this one paid off for me and, in the end, I thought it was a deal.  If you liked Unmaking Hunter Kennedy  by Anne Eliot, or Rock and a Hard Place by Angie Stanton, then this story will appeal to you also.Beautiful, high school senior, Natalee (Nat) has just meet the rock brothers Demetri and Alec from the band AD2 who are now going to her school.  She has an immediate connection with the brooding older brother Alec, but Demetri goes for her first and she foolishly relents to his advances.  The boys are on a year hiatus from performing to finish school and take a needed brake, but they have more secrets than they are letting out.  When Nat realizes her feelings for Alec won't go away and that Alec appears to like her too, she becomes confused.  Add to that Demetri's inability to stay sober or loyal and his constant suspicions that Alec holds Nat's affections and you have TROUBLE.Nat is a fun character to read about and the brothers, though troubled, are swoon-worthy.  While they both are in love with Nat, only one truly is right for her and the other one gets his own story called ""Pull, A Seaside Novel"" next.  There is not a lot of high emotional drama, just a good, funny at times, scary at others story.  The secret the boys are hiding is bad and hurtful, and it seems to be repeating itself in a way.This was really fun to read even if it was the overdone story of a girl falling for brothers.  Rachel Van Dyken is an entertaining writer who kept me turning the pages way past midnight.  I am normally not a triangle fan (especially brothers!) but since there was no sleeping around (which I think is really gross when brothers are involved), I was ok with it this time. Triangles are still not my favorite, but I really enjoyed Rachel Van Dyken's writing and would read more from her in the future.No Swearing or sex; but there was intense kissing, drug and alcohol use and sleepoversWould I/Did I buy it?

"This was a somewhat depressing story about a young girl who has loved only two men in her life and one more than the other.  After breaking it off after three years with Tommy, Megan is back home working at her family's law firm.  Her long time love, Shane, suddenly needs a place to stay and cannot stay at his girlfriend, Allison's place.  Naturally, he turns to his long time friend Megan and she agrees, knowing how difficult it will be to live with the guy she is in love with.  Of course, they finally get together, but he is called away at all hours of the day and night and after her house is vandalized, her mother's house is broken into and her policeman brother is shot in a drug bust, Megan is starting to think something might be up.  Then her ex boyfriend and FBI agent Tommy tells her Shane is bad news but she defends him and throws Tommy out of her house.  Just one bad thing after another happens.***Spoiler?***My main problem with this book is that we are told that Shane loves Megan but never see any evidence of him doing anything other than using her.  He is not an honorable guy to begin with and his apathy towards Megan's love life over the years and his own flaunting of girls in front of her does not predispose one to believe that he has always loved her.  This makes the book a lot less romantic and really just a book about a girl who makes bad choices when it comes to men.  Honestly, Megan is just clueless (so are a lot of other characters if they didn't know Shane was dealing drugs) and purposely ignores her instincts.  I found this frustrating and disappointing.Would I/Did I buy it? Free DownloadWould I read it again?  Probably notWould I recommend it to friends?

"Do you ever look at the reviews and wonder if everyone is giving a story five stars because of the subject matter (no one wants to look like they approve of abuse/bullied/suicide)?  After reading the first couple of chapters, I wanted to return this book for a refund.  The characters seemed identical to the ones in Tiffany King's book, Wishing for Someday Soon: abused, neglected and sarcastic (but not suicidal?) girl is rescued by handsome, athletic, caring and rich boy in true Cinderella fashion.  Add suicidal and you have the same story.I know suicide, abuse and bullying are really hot topics right now and a lot of YA books are addressing this serious issue.  In this book, King blames religious hypocrisy, homophobia, sexual deviancy by so-called religious leaders and bad parenting. The hero, Dean's family represents perfection  (I have never seen a family that perfect- except on TV) and Madison's family represents dysfunction (which is the fault of religious hypocrisy).The story is somewhat mundane (think afterschool special) as we watch Madison who was bent on killing herself, come out of her shell, leave her suicide partner James behind and blossom into her own person because the hot Dean (and his perfect family) pays attention to her.  Oddly, Dean, who should be super popular because he is a star basketball player, never seems to have anyone around him but Madison and there is no jealous girl wanting to do Madison harm.  Madison is suicidal because she was brought up by parents whose religious hypocrisy prevented them from showing her love?.  While religious hypocrisy and parents who rule their houses with ""the stick of religion"" are a fact, her mother Donna's problems are way beyond her religious convictions.  Ironically, while Madison's father (who by the end of the story has since rejected his religious ways and declares that he never loved Donna) is given a clean slate, poor Donna is left in her religious hell and culpable for all Madison's past abuses.Maybe it's because I am a mother that I can see Donna's inability to love Madison as she should to be more than just bad parenting and religious fanaticism.  Obviously, Donna has been damaged herself and could benefit from her own story being told. My guess is that Donna's own father abandoned her and she was sexually promiscuous as a teenager trying to find her father's love in random men.  When she got pregnant with Madison, she resentfully married the father and turned to religion to find forgiveness and acceptance.  Unhappily married to a man who didn't love her, she escaped from her life by seeking approval within the church and keeping herself from the joys of motherhood she didn't think she was worthy of because of her past behavior.  We all have history's that shed light on who we are and why we behave the way we do.  Madeline's own behavior would shadow a lot of her own mother's just from genetics alone.  So while Donna honestly needs help, it is not her religious beliefs or actions that are to blame for her bad parenting, but her own life experiences and bad choices.So yes, I know I am going to get a lot of zero votes from Tiffany King's loyal fans (the first 14 reviews I read were from self proclaimed ""I will read anything she writes and love it"" fans, but I do not think this story is worthy of 5 stars.  Blaming militant religious practices, rehashing the same story and adding a suicide watch to it and making her ""savior"" too perfect to be real, made this story un-enjoyable and a disappointment for me.Would I/Did I buy it?

"Not only is this such a beautifully crafted bracelet, it also provides pain relief too.  I am a writer and a photographer, so my wrists and fingers get quite a workout at times and I have noticed that the past couple years I have developed pain in my right(dominant) wrist that have set me back for a week or more at a time and wearing it on my right wrist has provided a lot of comfort in the past month.I am a little curious though on how it works, as the accompanying literature lacks the 'science' behind it.  Do you wear it on the affected wrist and it only benefits that wrist? Or that side of the body?  Does it benefit the body as a whole? And if so, how?This bracelet is constructed very well, though it would be nice to see it in an inch or two larger.  Not everyone is blessed with nice, small petite wrists. I prefer my bracelets to sit mid-wrist, not just below my wrist bone.Other than these few 'minor' details, I am really impressed with this bracelet, and have given it five stars and my recommendation.

"This is the second time I have purchased this particular deodorant from Kiss My Face and I have had the same experience.  I love the benefits of it but it smells moldy, musty, and mildewy!  Smells disgusting and putrid!  Has anyone else had this issue?  I have never, ever had a deodorant smell this bad right out of the box or a Patchouli scented product smell of this.  I have tossed this after the first couple of uses because the strong smell of mold & mildew and it makes me think that I am dirty after putting it on.  I cannot help but think it must be the product only because I have bought the product from two totally different, unrelated sellers on two totally different, unrelated sites.  If anyone else has experienced this, please reply.But if it smells great to you and you also reap the benefits of all day freshness, please don't let this one review deter you from purchasing this deodorant!  Kiss My Face has high quality, trusted, and organic products that I would recommend everyday till I am blue in the face to use.

"These wood bamboo wayfarer sunglasses are pretty kool. They have the retro look going for them and the wayfarer look is coming back in too. They are environmentally friendly because they are made out of bamboo and just that point makes them unique too. Who has ever heard of sunglasses made out of bamboo??? This makes them really sturdy and durable too. They come in a pretty awesome carrying case that with the right hook, can be hooked to your handbag strap or strap on a another bag. The case is sturdy enough that you won't have to worry about it being crushed and your glasses being crushed in return. I think anyone will love them as they are really 'in' now(again) and will look great with any outfit.

"I love these socks.  I wear a women's size 11 and these socks fit great.  I really like how they come in darker colors because not only do I love darker colors but they also don't show the dirt.  They are comfortable to wear and they are breathable, but not thin but very durable.  I wear them all the time now.  They aren't bulky nor are they itchy or scratchy.  I like how they are low-cut and very versatile too.  I am not crazy about the price, but.  I would definitely recommend these though.

"These Google Cardboard 3D lenses were easy to assemble and we ended up taping them together.  They feel very sturdy and my phone, an HTC One m7, fits great.  The QR code scans very well too.  There are a limited number of games available for Google Cardboard on the market thus far.  I haven't played any games yet but I did download an movie trailer and it scared the bejeesus out of me.  The functionality of the cardboard is pretty good.  I am thinking that maybe they should add an adjustable strap that goes about your head.  If you're playing for an extended period of time, your hands and arms are going to get tired from holding them up.  It was kinda weird to put them on for the first time, but you get used to them after a few minutes.  If you wear glasses, you have to wear them while you are using these.  It doesn't appear clear whether you are farsighted nor nearsighted.  There are many up and coming opportunities with these.  Not only are more apps in development, if you're an app developer, you can make apps for these too.

"It took us a while to find a light fixture in our home that would accommodate this bulb.  The lamp is a little desk lamp and the bulb sticks out of the top a little bit, but it fits in the base.  It is super brights and provides ample light to do plenty of reading by.  I think this would be perfect as a night light bulb too, but it looks like it may be a chandler bulb too.  It's a very durable bulb and the light is super bright, which is great in an apartment that doesn't have a lot of windows nor that doesn't receive a lot of sunlight nor natural light.

"My husband and I both love this speaker. It's so amazing! The sound that it puts out is rich, deep, and crystal clear, even with the volume turned all the way up. We haven't had a single problem connecting it to either of our HTC One phones. I use it daily to listen to my podcasts. The rubber casing is great because I've actually dropped it a couple times and it hasn't dented nor has it broken. What durability! The flashlight burns brightly too! And the range is pretty far too. I actually took it into two rooms away from my phone, which were separated by at least two walls, and it still worked great. All of these wonderful characterics make this speaker very rugged, so I give it my full recommendation. We have two other bluetooth speakers that we thought were pretty awesome before we got this, but now actually pale in comparison to this one. The battery life is really great too. I only need to charge it every four or five days. In the box, it contains the charging cord, the speaker, and the instruction booklet.

"This is a good, durable clothesline.  Will hold a light to medium heavy load.  I prefer to use clothespins on this line, unlike the hangers they have pictured.  It is not really that long, but it will do if you have a small-ish yard.  I received it in blue, which was pretty awesome  :)  It also has a special coating on it to protect it from weather too, which is nice.  It is easy to put up and take down, which is bonus, so you can put it up in the spring to use it during the summer and into the beginning of the fall and take it down over the winter so it doesn't get ruined during the winter, since you won't be using it anyway.

"These steel strainers are really pretty kool.  They are quite durable as the mesh is attached well underneath the metal and will not come apart.  There are three different sizes so you have the right sizes for all sorts of jobs.  They are easy to clean as well too.  The smallest one is perfect to strain your tea in too.  I love how there are little hooks on all three of them, which is perfect for me, because I hung them off the wall on one of our cupboards.

I see a lot of ladies and men wearing them as a fashion accessories(besides the real tradition behind wearing them).  It's pretty durable as long as your not using it for anything heavy duty, then you might as well spend $30+ on a real one.

"I love to do embroidery when I have a few moments to myself(hahaha) which is quite rare because I always have so much going on.  But when I do have time, I prefer hot iron patterns because they're so much easier to follow instead of doing it free-hand and I always turn to Aunt Martha's patterns.  When I was looking at the selection of patterns online here at Amazon and saw that they have horse patterns, I shrieked and my heart lept with joy because my entire family and I are life-long equestrians and horse-lovers.  I ordered this pattern and I have yet to be disappointed by any pattern I have gotten from Aunt Martha's.  The patterns are always clear, and they transfer so nicely too.  Embroidery is a dying art.  More young girls should be taught by their elders to embroider before the skill dies with them.  My Grandma taught me the basics when I was learning to sew with her when I was a young girl and I am now 32 years of age.  When we adopt, I will teach our daughter to embroider.

This is my second wristlet from them, although I do not have it anymore, as my 16-year-old baby sister eyed it when I went home earlier this year and declared how darling it was and she would love one, so I just gave her mine and I ended up buying another one for myself.

"Some pros:  The color is a very light beige, almost neutral, so it goes with any outfit.  It can be paired with almost any outfit from dressed down jeans to a skirt and top.  It is very roomy that you can carry a 11"" tablet plus your other purse necessities(like your wallet, a hair brush, a coin purse, coupon holder thingy, etc.) with room to spare in it and the straps hold tight.  The purse is made of some imitation durable material that will hold.  The straps on the side are adjustable if you do wish to adjust them.Some cons:  It doesn't come with a long shoulder strap and the straps that it does come with are way too small to loop over your shoulders.  I ended up buying a separate longer shoulder strap off of Ebay.  It's a weird looking handbag.  It's not for everyone.  It is really eclectic and very original though, I have to give it that.I do enjoy handbags and I have a few of them and this was a great addition to my small collection.  I think it was a great buy.  This is definitely not something that you would ever see in the store.  It is just an amazing design.  Not mainstream in the least.This is a truly unique purse.  I think it is a really great purse for the right person.  It is certainly a good match for one who carries a bigger bag, like myself.  I definitely recommend it for a lady who likes unique handbags and a bigger handbag as well too.  I would recommend purchasing longer straps though if you prefer more of a shoulder kind of bag as I do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MVMER3IB38IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSDLWDI#wasThisHelpful","R1MVMER3IB38IX","A2VVHERU17FPKE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VVHERU17FPKE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love how this Retseliney Exfoliant Cream is incredibly gentle, unlike 99% other exfoliant creams I have used in the past.  An overwhelming majority of them have their have their scrubs made from finely crushed apricot pits, which are incredibly abrasive on their skin.  The exfoliant ingredient in here is made from baking soda, which is a great anti-bacteria plus an awesome cleanser to use on your skin anyway.  It is so much more gentle to use to exfoliate your skin too.  It gets deep into your pores and cleans out any impurities with vegan and organic ingredients to wash away those impurities to leave behind soft, supple, smooth, fresh, and glowing skin each and every use.  Myself, I use it three times a week in the shower.  I wet my face first, take out a finger-full of cream and scrub my face, neck, and don't be afraid to do it on decolletage.  It works there too.  Then, after your shower, it you have anymore Retseliney products, just simply follow with those and your face will look like a million dollars.

"This is yet another fine product from Retseliney!  I have yet to be disappointed by their products.  I have been using their antioxidant witch hazel toner for about two months now and my skin has continued to benefit from it.  I just love how it smells and how it makes me skin look fresh, look and feel soft, and how well it renews it plus protects it from further aging and other daily damages as well.  It's made from all organic and vegan products, making it safe to use on your skin daily, twice daily in fact.  Just place a small amount on a cotton ball and rub it on your face, onto your neck and decolletage.  I highly recommend this toner over all others.

"This is the first time I have ever used a fractionated coconut oil.  I have been using organic refined coconut oil for a few years now, but I like this better for skin applications.  It goes on lighter and it absorbs so much quicker and I think it keeps my skin moisturized even longer than any skin product that I ever used.  I really like to put it on after I have shaved because it keeps my freshly shaven skin protect from any irritations as I have very sensitive skin.  This is perfect for those that have sensitive skin and/or skin issues too.  I have dermatitis on the back of my arms that sometimes spreads above my elbows from allergies stemming from dish soaps to shower gels to environmental to the city water and I have used this now for a couple of weeks and it has cleared it right up and kept it at bay.  I get patches of dry skin too and it has cleared those patches up too.  You only need a little bit of this oil to cover a large portion of wherever you are apply it and it comes in a huge bottle so it should last you a good period of time.  I wish a pump would be provided because it would make the application so much nicer.  Not only can you use this 'neat',  this coconut oil would also make a good basis for a lotion as well.  Add some shea butter, a drop or two of vitamin E, perhaps four drops of your favorite essential oil, and you would have some very high-end, moisturizing, organic lotion.  I use this daily, especially after washing my hands constantly, after doing dishes, after showers, or just because.  I highly recommend this.  Not only do you get a huge portion for you money, but you know you are a getting a premium and honest, to goodness product for you money.  Always remember that what you put on your skin also goes into you body too, so you don't want to put a product on that is loaded with chemicals, you'll want to stick with something that is all-natural and organic to keep you and your body safe.***Update 14 August 2015*** After contacting seller about not receiving a pump, they shipped it out to me super fast, so if you didn't receive one, contact them and they will be more than happy to get one out to you ASAP.Having a pump is great.

"I wish they had these when I was still in high school when I suffered more acne breakouts then I do now!  On the occasions that I do experience breakouts, they are not as bad as they were in my teens, but these are extremely helpful for anyone of any age because everyone gets a breakout, even occasionally.  They are so convenient.  Just wash your face as you usually do before you go to bed, put this tiny little 'dot' on afterwards to wear overnight, and in the morning, it has literally sucked most of the life out of the pimple and decreased its size by 80%.  You will see a noticeable difference and after the second night, it will be gone.  I have found that this works on pimples on other areas of the body too.  I get a lot of breakouts on my thighs as well and they work wonders there.  These are safe to use and non-irritating.

"I did not buy from this particular listing, but I bought this from Radio Shack when it first came out in the late 1990s.  I remember I saw it in Radio Shack's flyer in the Sunday paper and I had to save my money for a couple of weeks before I was able to afford it.  I was still in high school then and no other kid in school had anything like this and this used to get passed around in class and everyone put their numbers in it and put notes in it and stuff.  Everyone loved it.  It was fun and surprisingly easy to use right out of the package.  Plus it came with a battery too.  I never had a problem with it then.  It operated well and kept my young, adolescent life organized and work exactly as described.  But eventually, when I got my first cell phone a couple of years later, it got phased out and went into storage.  I actually just found here a few days ago and the battery was dead, which is to be expected, some 13+ years later.  I have purchased another battery for it and I am going to put it in when it arrives and see if it still works.  I am assuming and hoping since it worked the last time I used it, it will work.  At the very least, it will be interested to see what information is still stored on it from way back then.

"This is my second pair of bluetooth wireless hands-free headphones and I just adore this style.  I love how there are no strings coming from your phone anymore and you are not tethered to your phone any longer.  If I am bumming around the house or outside, I usually have my phone on my arm in my armband or if I am sitting in one place, I usually have my phone plugged into my wireless charger.  The range is pretty good on these.  I go into the next room without any interruption but if I go any further, my headphones start flipping out.  They connected fast and easy to my HTC One m7.  These headphones came perfectly packaged together with some very brief instructions(that you really don't need) and a compatible charger.  Included on the headphones are forward and backward buttons for your music, on/off button for the headphones, and to switch between music and calls.  Unfortunately, there is no volume buttons like on my other wireless headphones.  But no biggie!  What really bugs me is the blue light that constantly flashes whilst I have my headphones on.  It is really discreetly annoying and I see it out of the corner of my eye.  But despite those two minor annoyances, these headphones produces high quality sound, the earbuds fit perfectly(which is a big issue with me because my one ear canal is deformed and much smaller than everyone else's so I need a much smaller size than normal) and the earbuds surprisingly fit snug and stay in, and the headphones fit well around my neck and stay put.

"In the beginning there was DDR. Video game ""dancing"" consisted of mashing your feet to certain patterns. It was fun, it was a great workout, but at the end of the day it wasn't really dancing.Then along came Just Dance, which introduced the world to dancing to popular music using ""real dance move"", the kind that you could practice at home and then wow everyone with on the dance floor. It was slightly annoying that the controller accuracy was a bit off, but the dance moves were so fun we didn't care. Just Dance 2 introduced much better motion control accuracy. Plus, it introduced the concept of ""duets"", where people could dance cool choreographed routines together. And it was another winner. Because of the popularity of Just Dance, this spawned a lot of ""copycat"" titles from Ubisoft to cash in. Dance on Broadway. Michael Jackson The Experience, Just Dance for Kids. Even Just Dance with Smurfs. They were fun, but at a certain point they started to get a bit tiring, as they were all variations of the same theme.And so, we've all been waiting to see what Ubisoft would do for an encore with Just Dance 3? Could they push the genre forward, even as copycat titles on other platforms like Dance Central on the Xbox and Everybody Dance on the PS3 encroached on their turf? I'm happy to say that Just Dance 3 pushes the platform even further and does it with great success.When you start up Just Dance, the first thing it asks is if you'll connect Just Dance to the Internet so that ""Ubisoft can learn more about the way you play to make Just Dance even more groovy"". I wasn't sure quite how to answer the question, but I figure since Just Dance doesn't use a video camera like those other systems, there wasn't too much harm in it.The opening menu, like in Just Dance 1 and 2, is delightfully simple. There are only a couple choices:1) Dance!As with the previous versions, you just right into the dancing. What I love about Just Dance 3 is that getting started is extremely simple. No silly things to take up your time like creating avatars. No adjusting of cameras or calibrating of equipment. You just shake your remote to see what ""color"" you are on the screen, and get started.You can create a profile at any time; your name is limited to 5 characters. If you don't create a profile you'll be dancing by default as ""Happy"" (as opposed to ""Sunny"").As with previous version, your job is to dance the ""mirror image"" of a colorful silhouetted on-screen figure showing you the dance moves. I'm happy to say that the motion controls are better and more accurate than ever. Granted, it still only detects the movement of one arm holding the Wii remote, so technically you could still just hurl your arm the right way to build up points. But of course the fun of the game is to get into the dance with your full body (and in fact, if you follow the choreographed moves perfectly with your whole body, your score will be better than ever). One other subtle improvement over previous versions is that the audio cues coming through the Wii remote (for example, when you hit a milestone while dancing) are much louder and clearer than before.The choreography and backgrounds are as fun and in some cases as quirky as ever. For example, in Wilson Pickett's ""Land of 1000 Dances"" you're following a dancing alligator in a fancy suit dancing in a schoolroom. And yes, you ""do the alligator"" :) If you dance well on some songs, you can see the background animate and change.As with Just Dance 1 and 2, each song has a ""technical difficulty"" indicator from one to three gears, and a ""workout intensity"" indicate from one to three drops of sweat. There are over 45 great tracks to suit everyone's tastes, and most of the songs are popular and familiar.Multiplayer is where this game really shines. There's ""Dance Crew Mode"" which is like Duet Mode, except that up to 4 players has their own independent choreography (and a chance to shine with a solo performance). There's also a ""Dance Til Dawn"" party mode where you can just start the game up and it'll cycle through songs all night, without the need to go back through menus again.2) Just SweatAs someone who follows Wii exercise titles very closely, this option was the one I was most excited about. You can choose from a ""Free Session"" (an instant fitness session for up to 4 players) or the ""7-Day Challenge"" (A selection of challenges to boost your fitness during 7 days).For ""Free Session"" You can choose from a variety of options for the kind of music to work out to, including:Speed ShuffleNon-Stop ShufflePop! Pop!Rock PartyR&B VibesElectro SoundsJust 80'sOldies but GoodiesFancy Dress BallAround the WorldExtremeSweat AttackThere are also fantastic options for working out in a group, including:DuetsDance CrewI tried Sweat Attack, and sure enough I was sweating up a storm after just one song. The songs kept going and the more points I collected (in both Dance and Just Sweat modes), the more a ""Mojo"" meter filled up. Each time the ""Mojo Meter"" was full, it unlocked a ""gift"" of another game mode, song, or choreography (the first to be unlocked is Simon Says Mode). There are 27 ""gifts"" to unlock, which will definitely motivate you to keep coming back and building up those points. The songs in my case before I collapsed of exhaustion were Cee Lo Green's ""Forget You"", The Black Eyed Peas' ""Pump It"", Anja's ""Dance all Night"", Wilson Pickett's ""Land of 1000 Dances"", and appropriately, C&C Music Factory's Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)..all very energetic and lively (and fun) songs.As in the Dance mode, you rack up points when you hit the right dance moves. In addition, as with Just Dance 2, they don't count calories for some reason, but rather, they count ""sweat points"". With Just Dance 2, the consensus on the Web was that 4.2 sweat points = about 1 calorie burned, and it seems about the same with Just Dance 3. In all honesty, I'm not sure why they didn't just use calories, which would have made things a lot easier. But still, as long as you do the math in your head, you can pretty much figure out how intensive a workout you're getting (since each song earns you about 400-500 sweat points, it'll take about 25-30 vigorous songs to reach 3500 calories, or 1 pound of fat lost). As you reach certain points, the system will give you an indication of how much exercise you've done (after completing 1000 sweat points, it told me ""You've just walked across Central Park""; after 2000 points, it said ""you've just run 10 rounds of the Wembley Stadium"").For ""7-Day Challenge"" you're presented with three options for the next 7 days: The Fresh Start (3500 sweat points a week, the equivalent of walking 30 minutes a day), The Healthy Choice (7000 sweat points a week, equivalent to running 30 minutes a day), and The Sweat Explosion (21000 sweat points a week, equivalent to swimming for 30 minutes a day).Overall, I loved Just Sweat mode, but I would have liked to see the ability to chart my progress over days and weeks. Still, it's a great improvement over previous versions and definitely one of the best workouts you can have on the Wii.3) StoreThis is where you can purchase downloadable content (DLC) if your Wii is connected to the Internet. As of this writing (October 8, 2011), the store contained only the following songs:- Baby Don't Stop Now (Anja)- Jambo Mambo (Old Orquesta)- Soul Searchin (Groove Century)- Twist and Shake It (The Girly Team)But a bunch of empty icons indicates that there are more coming soon. Each song costs 250 Wii Points, so if you buy a 2000 point card for about $20, this comes out to about $2.50 a song.4) ExtrasThis is where you can adjust options, such as whether to display lyrics, display pictograms (the icons telling you what move to make), display help screens, and track usage. You can also view the medals you earned.I think one of the questions most people will have on their mind is: is Just Dance 3 on the Wii still relevant when there are so many new ""real dance move"" games out for systems like the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. My answer is a resounding ""yes"". Not only does Just Dance 3 hold its own in terms of fun and accuracy--it actually has an advantage over those other systems. While those systems force players to squeeze into a camera view of 6 feet across, with Just Dance, players can stand anywhere in the room, and it doesn't even matter if there are spectators or ""dancers without controllers"" standing among them.Long story short, I think Ubisoft has taken a great franchise and moved it even further. Just Dance 3 for the Wii is another winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BKW8WC0TS3HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053BG26C#wasThisHelpful","R3BKW8WC0TS3HE","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 2008, the game ""My Fitness Coach"" was released to great fanfare. It was the first exercise game for the Wii, and paved the way for dozens of successors, both good and bad (and ugly).There have been a few excellent exercise games. Wii Fit introduced the Balance Board. EA Sports Active 2 introduced activities which make working out more fun and interactive. Exerbeat and Walk It Out introduced video gaming elements to exercise.But since My Fitness Coach there really hasn't been a game on the Wii which has captured the feeling of a real ""personal trainer"", the kind you spend money see at the gym. Too often, the on-screen personas seem far too artificial. They'll look cartoony on-screen and they'll yell the same platitudes and beratings to you over and over again (yes, I'm talking to you, cartoon Jillian Michaels).When you start Get Fit with Mel B, you'll be asked for your name, your gender, your date of birth, your height, and your ""build"". As with the original My Fitness Coach, you can choose the environment you work out in (Central Park, The Maldives, Infinity Pool, Forest Meadow, Apartment, or Luxury Yacht). Unlike that game, photorealistic video images are used (which are of surprisingly good quality for the Wii).Finally, you can choose up to two goals from various categories, including General Health, Lifestyle, Special Occasions, Sports and Activities, and Shape. Once you do this, the system will create a daily workout for you to meet your goals.Get Fit with Mel B in many ways feels like the true successor to the original My Fitness Coach. Like My Fitness Coach, each workout consists of individual calisthenics and aerobics exercises strung together. In typical workouts, you'll do 5-20 reps of each exercise before moving on to the next one. Exercises fall under two general categories: the first category consists of typical cardio fitness moves, from push-ups to lunges to crunches to curls to rows. The second category consists of aerobics workouts (step, combat, dance, cardio, or advanced cardio). If you bought a Balance Board for step aerobics but were always disappointed by Wii Fit's weak ""plink, plink, plink"" step aerobics, you'll love how they use the Balance Board here.A video image of Mel B will demonstrate each move to you, and very clearly call out how to do the move. On screen, you'll see how many reps you've done and how many there are to go. Of all the aerobics games that have come out, very few have really captured the feeling of having a real ""personal trainer"". But here, I felt that the computerized Mel B was just as clear in her demonstration and description of the exercise to mimic a real trainer.The game options are pretty simple. You can do Today's Workout which is a set number of exercises for 30 minutes. You can also choose a standard workout (customizing the length), or you can even create your own custom workout by stringing individual exercises together. A menu option called ""Practice"" lets you practice individual exercises if you're having difficulty with any one of them.There's a section called ""Challenges"" which are intensive groups of exercises where you're pushed to complete a set of themed exercise routines (Dance, Abs Attack, Legs of Steel, Fighting Fit, or Cardio Test) within a certain period of time. I would have liked to see this section be a little more ""fun"" and interactive, but it's really not much different than the standard workouts, just a bunch of tougher ones strung together.There's also a section called ""Nutrition"" which contains recipes. Unless your Wii is in the kitchen, this section really isn't going to be very useful for you, although I like the sentiment of reminding us to eat healthy in addition to the workout.Unlike the Playstation or the upcoming Xbox version, there is NO support for a video camera image of yourself next to Mel B. Having said that, I didn't really miss not having a video image all that much. Like I said, the on-screen rendition of Mel B is pretty clear, and the vocal instructions she shouts are very understandable and easy to follow.As for the accuracy of the controls, the game does use the Balance Board for certain exercises, and for most exercises it uses the Wii MotionPlus. But by now we all know that because it's a Wii, the controls are not the most precise in the world. Most exercises will err on the side of being generous in ""awarding"" you accuracy points, and of course, it's easy to ""cheat"" by moving your hands but not the rest of your body. Of course, if you want to get the most out of the workout, accuracy points aren't the most important thing--the most important thing is doing the exercise.Long story short, if you're looking for a simulation of a real personal trainer working out with you at a gym, in many ways Get Fit with Mel B comes closer than any other game since the original My Fitness Coach. Given the paucity of new fitness titles for Fall 2011, Get Fit with Mel B is a great choice if you're looking for something a little new and different, especially if you enjoy cardio and aerobic sessions at the gym.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q7GTWFQ0E7YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWGBI4#wasThisHelpful","R1Q7GTWFQ0E7YE","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the early inventors of the automobile showed their invention to the public, I'm sure they were scoffed. Why would I deal with this ugly, smelly, smoke-guzzling monstrosity when I have a perfectly good horse?When I look at the early reviews of Kung-Fu Live by the game press, the same thought comes to mind. Back when the game was launched it was soundly panned by most of the gaming ""media elite"". But a funny thing happened. When you look at those same sites, the ""critic reviews"" are all bad, but the ""user reviews"" are all glowing.I downloaded the demo version from the Playstation Store. Within five minutes of my playing it, I knew I had to have this game. I bought it instantly.Kung Fu Live is a revolutionary game in many ways. First, it introduces to the PS3 something it never had before--Kinect-like capabilities where you use your body as a controller (that's right, no DualShock OR Move controller necessary--it just uses the Playstation Eye to detect your movements). Your on-screen character kicks when you kick and punches when you punch.Ah, the on-screen character. The on-screen character is YOU. Not a cartoon version of you, not an avatar, but your actual video image. The game basically as a Street Fighter-like interface in which villains come at you, and you literally punch and kick them into submission. As the game progresses you learn new ""moves"" like power punching, flips, and blocks, all which are done with very intuitive body movements.This was one of those games which I couldn't stop playing, even though I was exhausted. There's something very cathartic about breaking through the TV screen and fighting for real versus fighting by mashing buttons. And by the end of my playing, I had a pretty intense cardio workout.Cut scenes between levels take you through some beautifully drawn comic book art. An interesting (and hilarious) bonus is that they'll take pictures of YOU in various poses and drop them right into the comic book.I suspect the cause for some of the negative reviews is that the reviewers didn't go through the proper process for setting up the game. Your room needs to be lit very, very well, and your clothes should contrast with the background wall and furniture (for best results, play against a blank dark wall with light clothes or vice-versa).During setup, you can select from some pre-defined settings, or you can fine-tune your picture using advanced settings. You basically need to configure the system so your body shows through but the background does not. You won't get your picture perfect--after all, the game is trying to do things the system was never designed to do. I had my best results in the daytime in a room with bright natural sunlight; attempts to set up at night with shadows and lamps was much more challenging.All in all, once I got the game set up reasonably well, it was one of the best active games I've played on any platform--ironic that it's only $15. If you have a PS3, I definitely encourage you to download the demo and give it a try. I suspect that in ten years, we'll have this kind of virtual reality in a lot of video games where your image is literally immersed as part of the action. I think we'll be able to look at games like Kung Fu Live as ones that broke the old paradigm and were pioneers to a whole new kind of gaming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VYP1AV6A4RJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GXACFA#wasThisHelpful","R2VYP1AV6A4RJN","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit, I came to this game with low expectations, having just played the not-very-strong Wii version of this game. But the very things that made the Wii version so weak are what makes the Playstation version strong: its use of motion controls and its beautiful graphics.There are some similarities to the Wii version. First, the ""Six"" of the title refers to six core areas you need to work out to achieve full body fitness: Balance, Cardio, Core Body, Flexibility, Lower Body, and Upper Body. Every exercise you do in the program will tell you which of the six you're working on and to what degree. And you can pull up a graphical summary which tells you how much of each you've worked out, and which you need to focus more attention on.You can choose a fitness goal, after which the system will select a number of ""classes"" for you to take. Unlike the Wii version, you're greeted with a very colorful, very simple and clear user interface where you can select classes. The classes fall under these categories: Cardio (14 workouts), Upper Body (7 workouts), Core Body (8 workouts), Lower Body (8 workouts), Fit for Life (9 workouts), Boot Camp (10 workouts), Kickboxing (8 workouts), Cardio Dance (9 workouts), Pilates (7 workouts), Latin Dance (9 workouts), Dance Moves (10 workouts), and Challenges (6 workouts).Like most fitness games of this ilk, the classes are led by a computer-animated trainer. The level of detail of the trainer and the background graphics of natural environments are very good--not quite photo-realistic, but certainly done with a good attention to detail (for example, when you exercise by the water, you can see soothing clear blue skies with puffy clouds, seagulls flying gently, and even a gently moving ferris wheel in the background). I do like how you can see your own video image next to the trainer so you can match his or her motions.You do need to have a registered Playstation Account in order to play this game--I realized later that this is so Ubisoft could cleverly slip in some DLC into your choice of classes (certain classes require payment of $1.99 to download them). I'm not averse to downloadable content in general, but I was a bit annoyed that Ubisoft seems to be charging for exercises they would have included at no cost if the DLC option did not exist.As other reviews have said, the game does make use of the Move controller for about 50% of the classes, as identified by a blue ball icon over the menu choices. While the Move controller isn't necessary and doesn't track all of your motions 1:1, what it does is show you a colorful ""swoosh"" where you move your Move controller. By matching up your trail to your trainer's, you can tell if you're doing the exercise correctly. If you are, at certain points you'll get confirmation in the form of a ""good!"" or ""great!"" compliment.One thing I really like about this game is that you can play with minimal space. While most Kinect fitness games need at least 10 feet of space, I managed to play with under 6 feet, with room to spare. I also like that you can use your own music from your Playstation 3 instead of the generic music that comes with the game.Overall I wouldn't say this is a ""fun"" game (it's about as fun as a semi-intense trip to the gym). But in terms of workout value and the sheer number of exercises you can do, as well as the good graphics, it gets a solid 4 stars from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICUFX3RF7B8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K5ZME0#wasThisHelpful","R3ICUFX3RF7B8H","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fit in Six is Ubisoft's latest entry into the world of fitness games on the Wii. In many ways, it is the metaphysical heir to the original ""My Fitness Coach"" which helped pioneer the genre three years ago. Like that game, this one includes a large number of cardio and aerobic exercises. And like that game, this one doesn't use the Wii motion controls at all. You are ""on the honor system"" as to whether you're doing the exercises right (or at all).The number of workouts you can choose from is almost staggering. You can choose from ""classes"" that have 10-15 minute workouts focusing on upper body, core body, general fitness, cardio, boot camp, kick boxing, cardio dance, pilates, latin dance, and dance moves. The workouts are all very good, professionally designed exercises that teach you good technique and posture. As others have written, your on-screen trainer is cartoony to say the least, but that's to be expected with the Wii.One thing I wasn't too crazy about was how quickly the on-screen trainers move, without breaking down their moves or otherwise giving you a chance to learn them. This is especially frustrating on some of the quick ""dance step"" routines. But with enough repetition, you'll eventually get them.The lack of motion controls was a deal buster for me. Granted, many people enjoy workout titles without the motion controls, but to me, if I'm going to work out like that I'd rather just pop in a DVD and watch a real human instead of watching a cartoony character I can't interact with. At the very least I would have liked to see them build-in the option for motion detection, with the ability to shut them off. But it seems that after debacles like Your Shape with Jenny McCarthy, Ubisoft seems to have thrown in the towel completely in terms of trying to get motion detection correct. Worse, the fact that this game supports a USB camera may lead some to believe that it has Kinect-like motion controls; of course, it doesn't--all connecting the camera does is show a postage stamp-sized video image of you in the corner, not even aligned with the on-screen trainer so you can't compare your steps to his or hers.Overall, I'd say if you liked the original My Fitness Coach, you'll probably like this. It's a worthy successor to it in that it provides a much wider selection of exercises and doesn't let poor motion controls (or any motion controls) get in the way of your workout. A few years ago, I might have given this 5 stars, but in 2011, it's just ""ok"", especially when compared to other similar games on the Xbox and Playstation, or even other games like EA Sports Active on the Wii which do advanced things like good motion detection and heart rate monitoring.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8S29269TPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K5W1VM#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8S29269TPG","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a big fan of the movie Kung Fu Panda 2. The storyline was great, the characters were endearing, the animation was stunning, and the action was nonstop fun.Sadly, Kung Fu Panda 2 for Kinect seems to suffer from what plagues many movie tie-in games. The game is supposed to augment the movie experience, but it does the opposite. Even with Jack Black providing the voice for the video game, the Xbox Po seems a poor shadow of his big screen counterpart. I didn't expect the detail of the movie, but this didn't even seem close.The storyline starts out promising-it begins where the movie left off and describes how some of Shen's followers are still in the city and need to be eradicated. But that's pretty much where the story stars and ends. The rest of the game, you're just going from area to area fighting enemies, with really no additional plot.You pass your way through familiar environments in the movie: Gongmen City, the Undercity, the Bamboo Forest, The Desert, and Shantu Palace, but it's really the same routine in each area-fight what seem to be the same enemies over and over again, and maybe play a mini-game or two here and there.Where the game does shine-mostly-is in its use of the Kinect for motion detection. There's just something about actually punching and kicking that beats mashing buttons on a controller. Unlike similar Wii games of the past, this one is smart enough to detect when you punch with your left and right hands, when you kick with your left and right feet, when you block with your left and right arms, and when you duck and dodge. The moves are pretty simple; this is, after all, a kid's game. But yes, as I played through the game I worked up a sweat and an elevated heartrate.Unfortunately, combat is a bit stilted. With each villain you encounter, instead of a realistic fight, you fight a few seconds of ""offense"" (kicking and punching), and then you fight a few seconds of ""defense"" (blocking to the left, right, and with both arms).Worse still, later in the game you're introduced to ""advanced"" moves such as dodging attacks (you dodge left or right when the enemy glows red, and you duck if the enemy turns yellow). At that point the system does a worse and worse job of accurately picking up your motions. As a result, you may find yourself making the right moves but still getting penalized for them, and then being forced to replay entire levels (and watch long cut scenes without the ability to skip them).Once you finish Story Mode (which takes only a few hours), you can play a number of different parts of the story again in ""Free Play"" mode as mini-games. As I mentioned, there are some cute mini-games, such as racing a rickshaw (which requires you to tilt left and right, duck, and block objects thrown in your way) and making noodles (which require you to flail your arms as if you're stirring noodles, and then throwing the noodle bowl to the customer). These games for the most part follow the same pattern as the combat game--decent use of Kinect, but more satisfying in theory than in reality to play.One of my pet peeves with every Kinect game is that there are absolutely no standards with UI design. This game is no exception. To select something from a menu, you need to select it with your right hand a punch (yes, punch) a gong with your left hand. Cute at first, but it gets really annoying after a while. And there are some glitches which there is just no excuse for, such as the need to turn on your Xbox controller (which is not otherwise used) in the case of a game timeout, and the inability of the interface of detecting that you've selected certain menu choices without trying again and again.Overall, I'd say the use of Kinect in the game is very good. If you have a young child who loved the movie and would get a thrill out of beating up a few wolves as Po, this is a great game for you to get (and to play yourself from time to time to get a little exercise). But otherwise the repetitiveness and tedium of the game is hard to overcome.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJ71T7UK0AVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TJJTXW#wasThisHelpful","R3HJ71T7UK0AVT","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wii MotionPlus came out almost exactly two years ago as an attachment to the old Wii Remote. While the original Wii remote could detect basic movements, the MotionPlus has built-in gyroscopes which can detect rotational movement and more fine movement.Nowadays for new Wii units, the MotionPlus is built into all new Wii remotes, which are now called ""Wii Remote Plus"". Just to be clear, there is no functional difference between an old Wii remote with MotionPlus attachment and the new ""Wii Remote Plus"" other than aesthetics (while the old Wii remote measures 7 1/2 inches with the attachment, the new Wii Remote Plus is six inches, the same size as the old Wii remote). Out of habit, I'll continue to call it MotionPlus throughout this review.In the last two years, it seems that not many game developers have really taken advantage of the MotionPlus; in fact, to date only three (Wii Sports Resort, FlingSmash, and Red Steel 2) actually require it. For most other games where the MotionPlus is optional, you can hardly notice the difference. A shame, because at its best, the MotionPlus can produce fine motor control that rivals the Playstation Move and the Xbox Kinect. I'm guessing that Wii Play Motion is Nintendo's attempt to get more people to adopt it and thus encourage more developers to develop for it (just as the original Wii Play got many people to purchase a second Wii remote).Wii Play Motion in many ways feels like a game that should have come out two years ago. It feels more like a collection of games designed to show off the capabilities of the MotionPlus than actual games that you'll take off the shelf and play over and over. Having said that, they do this very, very well. Nintendo's developers have really pushed the envelope of what its controller is capable of and have come up with a set of 12 mini-games which use it in different ways.As with most Nintendo titles, the games themselves are a ton of fun, and all your Miis are perfectly incorporated throughout the games in lots of fun ways.Here are the games and my take on them:1) Cone ZoneThis is a game reminiscent of the ""present balancing"" game Shifty Gifts in Wii Party, where you have to balance your Wii remote to keep ice cream on a cone. Fun to play in a group, but we've seen this before. I'd rate it 3 of 5 for fun.2) Veggie GardenThis is a version of whack-a-mole where you beat cute little moles into their holes before they steal your fruit. You control your Wii remote like a hammer, and the precision is very, very good. 4 of 5.3) Skip SkimmerThis is a neat little game where you skip stones across a lake. You first pick a stone you want to skip (as in real life, you look for a round and flat one), and you flick your wrist gently to skip, keeping your wrist angled as flat as possible and the ""B"" button pressed. As cute little twists, you can pick up rocks with different pictures on it (such as dogs and chickens), and your rock will make those sounds as it skips. 5 of 5.4) Pose Mii PlusThis game is pretty much the same as Pose Mii in the original Wii Play, with a twist (literally).  Your Mii will strike a pose, and you'll rotate your remote and the character in all three dimensions with great precision to match the shape of a ""keyhole"" in a particular shape. 3 of 5 for fun.5) Trigger TwistThis is the follow-up to ""Shooting Range"" from the original Wii Play, but you get much more expansive play; as you move your Wii remote off-screen up and to the left and right, the camera will follow you. As with Wii Play, this game pays homage to the original Duck Hunt, and once again you'll be saving screaming Miis from UFOs. Still a lot of fun, 5 out of 5.6) Jump ParkIn this vertical scroller, you tilt your Mii at a certain angle, and then your Mii will jump off a floor made up of trampolines and jump up at the angle you want. Your goal is to pick up gems and eventually jump your way to a big target. This one takes a little getting used to, and is not the funnest of the games. I'd give it 2 of 5.7) Teeter TargetsThis mini-game really shows off the creativity and imagination of the developers. You hold the Wii remote sideways to control a wooden teeter totter to bounce a wooden ball around the screen. It's a simple game, but the graphics and sounds really evokes an ""old school"" feel of playing with wood blocks and an old school pinball-type game. 4 of 5.8) Spooky SearchThis game is by far one of the most innovative games I've seen on the Wii, yet the concept is incredibly simple. You start out in a spooky library with a crowd of Miis watching you. Some ghosts fly towards you and ""out of your TV"". You need to then point your Wii remote all around your room, listening to the sounds that come out of the remote. You'll hear a beeping noise as you get ""warmer"", and you'll hear an alarm when you've targeted the ""ghost"". Press B when that happens, point your remote back at the TV, and you'll be able to put the ghost back into a containment unit straight out of ""Ghostbusters"". Some of the ghosts get feisty, and you'll need to fight it just like you're trying to reel in a fish. I give this one a 5 of 5 for fun, especially when you're playing with others.9) Wind RunnerIn this game, you hold your Wii remote like it's an umbrella handle. Your Mii runs with the umbrella open, and tilts it to either catch the wind to move faster, or to jump up, all in the name of catching gems. The physics on this one is spot-on, but the fun is only 2 of 5, as it takes some getting used to.10) Treasure TwirlThis one also has great innovative use of the MotionPlus. In it, you lower your Mii as a deep-sea diver by continuously twirling the remote (as if you're unspooling a line). You can swing your Mii left and right as you're descending to pick up oxygen and avoid stringing jellyfish. On the bottom, you'll find treasure chests to pick up. 5 of 5 for fun.11) Flutter FlyThis game also makes innovative use of the Wii Remote Plus. You hold the remote straight up like a fan, and fan some balloons through an obstacle course. This one is a little frustrating at times when you need to point to the screen to shoo off some crows, and you lose control of the fan. Still, it's a pretty innovative game which I give 3 of 5 stars for fun.12) Star ShuttileIn the game, you control a spaceship to dock with a space station. If you're old enough like me, this is similar to the 1979 arcade game ""Lunar Lander"", but in glorious three dimensions. As with the dogfight game in Wii Sports Resort, you literally hold and tilt your Wii Remote Plus as if you're holding the spaceship, and you use the A, B, and directional arrows to control six thrusters on your spaceship. This one also takes getting used to but is a solid 4 of 5.There aren't really too many annoyances with this game. Obviously, the motion sensing issues with so many other Wii games aren't present in this one (This really should be required playing for all future Wii game developers).I did find annoying the need to play games to unlock new ones--this is annoying when you want to bring the game to a friend's house and just dive into playing.But happily, all the games are extremely easy to learn and the controls are extremely intuitive to pick up and play. I wouldn't say it's as fun a party game as Wii Sports and Wii Party, but it certainly is a nice change for when you need a break from those games. And of course, it showcases the best of what the Wii MotionPlus / Remote Plus offers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JE6XRZ9GS5FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W4S1S8#wasThisHelpful","R3JE6XRZ9GS5FF","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zumba is a fitness craze started by dancer Beto (choreographer for Shakira, among others) back in the 1990s. Since then, it's swept the world. Zumba classes are given in more than 90,000 fitness centers worldwide, and over 10 million people have tried it. In fact, one just opened up just around the corner from my apartment!Zumba is a simple concept. Standard aerobics exercises become repetitive and stale. But with Zumba you can learn latin dance moves, have fun, and get just as solid a workout (or more).The game comes with a belt in which you place your Wii remote. It's not the most solidly constructed belt in the world, but it gets the job done. You fit it around your waist (it looks like it'll accommodate anyone with as much as a 40-50 inch waist), and secure it with velcro. You put your Wii remote in the front pocket so it's standing vertically and the buttons are facing forward (you need to take the protective plastic cover off before and after putting it in the pocket, which is a bit annoying, but luckily I had a spare Wii remote I wasn't using, so I just used that).The starting menu is simple--you use the arrow buttons on the Wii remote to choose from the options (I'm guessing they chose not to use cursors knowing that the Wii remote would be in the belt while navigating the menus; it is a bit clunky, but you get used to it after a while).The options are:  Create / Edit Player, Play, Workout Calendar, and Extras. You can start dancing single routines immediately, but in order to access most features, you'll need to create a player.The player creation is pretty quick. You enter your name, and select your difficulty level (easy, medium, hard). There's a bit of sloppy programming, in that there's never confirmation that you've successfully created a player (you get sent back to the ""Create"" button). But once you go back to the Main menu after creating a player, you'll see a bunch of new options open to you: Tutorials, Zumba Party, and Zumba Class.Tutorials:The Tutorials are broken into several parts. Learn the Steps lets you learn a wide range of Zumba steps, including:- Calypso (Basic)- Calypso (Single Single Double Pump)- Calypso (Basic with a Travel)- Cumbia (Basic)- Cumbia (Machete Step)- Cumbia (Sleepy Leg)- Merengue (March)- Merengue (Que Te Mueve)- Merengue (Pump)- Reggaeton- Reggaeton (Bounce)- Reggaeton (Single Single Double Basic)- Salsa (Travel)- Salsa (Forward and Back)- Salsa (Cuban)The tutorials were pretty weak. The graphics weren't very impressive, but that's understandable given the limitations of the Wii (it's tough to get high quality full-motion video on the Wii, which is required for learning Zumba, so they made the instructor a glowing silhouette). The real weakness of the tutorials was that you really weren't ""taught"" anything. It's up to you to figure out what the on-screen instructor is doing and to mimic her moves. The biggest annoyance is, no matter what slight move you make in response to the on-screen instructor, the system will tell you ""great!"" and then move you on to the next step.I'm guessing that the developers who made this game heard all the negative comments about games like Just Dance not picking up moves correctly, so they went too far in the other direction and decided that it'd accept ALL moves. I would much preferred to have had the instructor showly break down the moves, step by step, and let me decide if I understand them and want to move to the next step, rather than ingratiate me by telling me I did great when I didn't.So ironically, in order to follow the tutorials effectively, you have to take the Wii remote out of the belt. Then, you watch the tutorials like a video until you learn each move. Then, when you're ready for the next move, you pick up the Wii remote and waggle it a little until it says ""great""!Ridiculously oversensitive Wii remote aside, the tutorials themselves they were fairly decent in terms of their content, if not their execution. They break each dance move into different steps which start with basic movements and get progressively complex (again, I would have preferred a little more vocal instruction rather than forcing me to try to figure out what was going on). Regardless, I was able to learn a lot of the basic Zumba steps this way.Zumba Party and Zumba ClassIt took me a while to figure out the difference between ""Zumba Party"" and ""Zumba Class"". From what I could figure out, they're pretty much the same, except that Zumba Party is a more compressed series of 10 levels (which you unlock one by one by completing it). These are the levels for Zumba Party:- Beginner 20 minute Class 1- Beginner 20 minute Class 2- Intermediate 20 minute Class 1- Intermediate 20 minute Class 2- Intermediate 45 minute Class 1- Intermediate 45 minute Class 2- Expert 20 minute Class 1- Expert 20 minute Class 2- Expert 45 minute Class 1- Expert 45 minute Class 2- ZumbathonZumba Class, on the other hand, consists of many more levels.- Beginner 20 minute Class 1- Beginner 20 minute Class 2- Intermediate 20 minute Class 1- Intermediate 20 minute Class 2- Intermediate 20 minute Class 3- Intermediate 45 minute Class 1- Intermediate 45 minute Class 2- Intermediate 45 minute Class 3- Intermediate 45 minute Class 4- Intermediate 45 minute Class 5- Intermediate 45 minute Class 6- Expert 20 minute Class 1- Expert 20 minute Class 2- Expert 20 minute Class 3- Expert 45 minute Class 1- Expert 45 minute Class 2- Expert 45 minute Class 3- Expert 45 minute Class 4- Expert 45 minute Class 5- ZumbathonIn each ""class"", you're basically go through a series of Zumba workouts, one after another, until you hit about 30 minutes. As you hit the right moves (or rather, as the system interprets you hitting the right moves), your on-screen character will turn green and you'll see a progress bar on the bottom fill up. Successfully finish a class, and the next one will unlock.The difficulty levels are a little confusing. You can choose Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced when you set up your character. But in addition to this, you can unlock Night Club, Factory, Rooftop, and Stadium levels. And in addition to this, you can select Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert Classes.Having said all this, Zumba is such a fun way to exercise that the idiosyncrasies of the game can't stop it from being fun. My recommendation would be that if you haven't learned Zumba yet, you probably won't master it from this game--in that case your best bet is still to go to a class with instructors who can give you real feedback. Also, just as with Just Dance, you need to set your expectations properly. This game will NOT capture your motions 100%. As long as you can live with that, you're in for a ball.On the other hand, if you're an avid Zumba dancer, this game will definitely help you hone your skills and get you in shape on those days when you can't make it to the gym or can't afford to go every day. As of December 2010, I see that Zumba is sold out all over the Web, which is a great sign that the game is a winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKBJLP34H189/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OQ4B1Q#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKBJLP34H189","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a long and hard road for those looking for good Yoga and Pilates programs on the Wii. Wii Fit provided some Yoga exercises which by most accounts, while a decent demonstration of the potential of the Wii balance board, were a bit rudimentary and disjointed. The first ""pure Yoga"" title for the Wii, Dreamcatcher Yoga, was an unmitigated disaster both from a Yoga perspective and a technical perspective. The first ""pure Pilates"" title, Daisy Fuentes Pilates, didn't fare much better.NewU Fitness Yoga and Pilates is actually the second ""NewU"" fitness game developed by Lightning Fish games to hit the US Market. The first was a game originally released in Europe as ""NewU: Fitness First Personal Trainer"". However, when Ubisoft (the US publisher) brought the game to the US they inexplicably changed its name ""My Fitness Coach 2"" (In a boneheaded move, they apparently attempted to cash in on the huge success of the original ""My Fitness Coach"", but ended up alienating fans of the original My Fitness Coach and short-circuiting any possible interest in the NewU title, which was a decent workout title on its own merits). Anyway, I'm happy to see that the new publisher, Deep silver, was wise enough to keep the original name for NewU Fitness First Yoga & Pilates.In any case, if you have My Fitness Coach 2, you'll see similarities between that game and this game, most notably the ""swooshing"" 3-D menus and the cheeky reaction of the trainers after you've done something well.When you start NewU Fitness First Yoga and Pilates, you first create a profile. You'll enter your name, sex, your ""build"" (skinny, average, or overweight), and you'll also select your experience level with yoga and Pilates (a complete beginner, someone who's taken a few classes, or an expert). You then enter your date of birth, height, handedness, and then choose from one of 10 goals (ranging from weight loss to relieving back pain to improving posture to de-stress; women will also see an option for post-natal exercise).You then choose one of three ""teachers"" (all female) each with different personalities and styles who will take you through all the exercises. They tried to make the teacher selection as realistic as possible--you can even read each teacher's bio and hear a taped introduction from each of them. Finally, you choose a location (relaxing nature vistas ranging from a mountain valley to a beachfront), and then have the Wii balance board calculate your weight. By the way, the balance board is not required for this game, but it definitely does augment most of the exercises.You then see a series of menus:Toning - This is where you can do your daily classes, each of which is basically a string of yoga or Pilates exercises put together one after the other for about 30 minutes. You can have the system select a class for you, if you're in a hurry you can choose a ""quick class"", or if there are certain exercises you like you can create a custom class. From here, you can also practice exercises, perform Pilates Core Skills (Water Tilt, Zip Up, and Drawing In), or try some Challenges which really do test your endurance (e.g. Pilates 100, Side Plank, Crescent Moon Standing, Tree Pose, or Perfect Warrior III).Meditation - This is a very interesting part of the program where you can try different meditation techniques, such as Healing, Let Go, Third Eye, Energizing, and Calming. After a particularly stressful week, I did try the ""Let Go"" exercises and I have to say it helped. The instructor will calmly say instructions to you, calm images will appear on the screen, and peaceful music will play. You can choose Meditation any time from this menu, or you'll be given the option to meditate after a workout.As for the workouts themselves, they are typical yoga and Pilates moves (weighted more on the yoga side), such as airplane, dancer's pose, dog tilt, crescent moon standing, and sun salutation (I counted 30 moves total under the ""Advanced"" setting; other settings will have fewer). As you perform each, you'll see a video image of your instructor in front of the vista you selected (the teacher was basically filmed in front of a blue screen and is superimposed over a picture of your environment).I do like the fact that they used video, because you can see exactly what the instructor is doing. In addition, before each exercise, you can select ""show me first"" where the teacher will literally talk you through a step-by-step tutorial. You can also view an 'About this Exercise' blurb which explains the goal of the exercise.I'm a total novice when it comes to yoga, so I chose the beginner's path. The exercises were just right for my level, not too complex, not too strenuous. At the more advanced levels, the instructor goes much faster, and there's a presumption that you know the moves already (she'll yell out instructions like ""step back into a  downward dog"" or ""lower chest down into a baby cobra"").I asked my girlfriend, who has taken both yoga and Pilates classes, to go through a class at the ""advanced"" level and let me know her opinion. She did, and afterwards told me she did get a pretty good workout, comparable to a class. She said the moves were indeed accurate and that exercises like the ""Sun Salutation"" sequence were challenging in a very good way.On the negative side, she said the instructors at times seemed a little ""robotic"" and dry in their explanations--they'll shout out literal instructions, whereas the best ""real"" instructors would have put a little more personality and creativity into them. Also, some of the sequences were much too fast, and at times it was a bit awkward to have to look up at the screen while performing the move (this is where more descriptive vocal commands would have helped). Still, after a few rounds of practice, she got the moves down and was doing them naturally. And she did like details such as the instructors telling her how to breathe, as she did the relaxing music.The controls are decent. The system makes good use of both the balance board (to check how much in balance your forearms or feet are as you perform certain exercises) and the Wii MotionPlus (to check how steady your hand is for certain exercises where you need to stretch your hands). An indicator in the upper left-hand corner will show how steady and centered you are. While most exercises are intuitive, there are some where no matter how ""correctly"" you think you're doing the exercises, the system will tell you you're not--and will not tell you what's wrong. That, of course, is a frustration many of us have gotten used to with Wii games.Overall, I'd say if you're interested in ""Western Style"" fitness, your best bet is EA Sports Active 2, Biggest Loser Challenge or Zumba Fitness. However, if you're interested in ""Eastern Style"" fitness, this one is clearly the best choice to date, although admittedly there wasn't a very high bar set. While it's no substitute for a real class, it's a great way to get a decent yoga and Pilates workout in the privacy of your own home when you just don't feel like going out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUCH8P3OMKC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWGBCK#wasThisHelpful","R1FUCH8P3OMKC2","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Jillian Michaels 2011, D3Publisher decided to take the game in a new and intriguing new direction than the previous Majesco versions. Unfortunately, just as with the 2009 and 2010 versions, the execution leaves a lot to be desired.For those of you who tried Ultimatum 2010 (and who suffered through Ultimatum 2009), this game is a completely different beast. While those are more ""pure"" exercise games with Jillian taking you through a bunch of exercises, here they decided to wrap the exercises around a story. Specifically, you're a secret agent that's helping Jillian destroy the evil corporation FPF (which produces processed foods to poison the masses) and the evil corporation CureAll (which produces a chemically-based elixir that makes people who eat FPF's food ""feel better""). Even as far as video game stories go, this one is kind of weak, but I figured I'd give them a pass on it, since the focus is on the fitness.You start out the game doing ""training"", which is essentially a series of stretching and calisthenics exercises. Each is worth 50-100 ""points"". You need to collect 500 points in order to start the missions. Problem is, there's no visual indication of the number of points you've collected after you finish an exercise--you just see the ""Start"" button again and again. After a while I figured out to go back, where I saw the ""Mission"" button unlocked.The exercises themselves are okay, but nothing earth-shattering. I did like how they incorporated the ""360 camera angle rotation"" from the 2010 version, so you can see exactly how your on-screen character is doing the exercise. Unfortunately, the annoyances far, far outweigh anything positive. It honestly felt like I spent more time calibrating the Wii Balance Board and the Wii MotionPlus than I did actually playing the game. One thing that 2009 and 2010 had in common was horrible motion control detection. This version is not much better. No matter how hard you try to follow the on-screen character's motions, invariably the system can't detect you properly. And for reasons which I'll describe below, this is unbearably frustrating.The graphics are lower quality than they were in the 2010 version, but that's by design--the entire game is meant to evoke a ""comic book"" look and feel. You still get Jillian's real voice, but you get a comic book version of her visually.When you start your ""missions"", you see that there are a total of nine to get through, with one ""Ultimate Mission"". You get through each ""mission"" by doing various exercises to make your on-screen character perform. Each mission is unlocked as you complete the previous one. You can choose from different difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and High Intensity. I chose High Intensity.Mission 1 is ""Recon Northern Environments"". That's it. No description of who you are or where you are or what you're supposed to do. You just find your character in an abandoned warehouse. You need to start by doing 30 ""swing kicks"" (15 for each leg) using the balance board. Once this is done, you run in place with (or just shake) your Wii remote to make your on-screen character run. Your character then comes to a garage door, and you need to do jumping jacks to open the garage door.All well and good so far. Problem is, when it came to the jumping jacks the system kept telling me I was doing them wrong (I've been doing them since I was 3, so I think I know what I'm doing). It became farce-like, with me frantically contorting my body trying to figure out what kind of jumping jack it wanted me to do, and Jillian constantly yelling at me the whole time saying I was either too fast or two slow.Suddenly--the screen goes blank. Then, a screen with Jillian's image shows up, telling me that I need to ""go back to the gym"". Worst of all, I had to start the mission (including the 30 swing kicks, the Wii remote shaking, and the jumping jacks) again.I tried at least three times before I changed the difficulty level to ""Easy"" and finally made it through. Your character next opens a manhole cover and runs through some underground graffiti-filled tunnels. At first I thought, ""this is cool"" and that it did make running in place a lot of fun. But after a while you realize you spend minute after minute tediously running through the same redundant halls.You stop in the middle of the empty corridor and for no reason start doing boxing exercises. It would have made more sense if an attacker came out of the shadows and fought you. But no, your character just decides to start boxing. The game developers didn't even bother to try to detect your motions on this one--Jillian will just yell out commands, and you're on the ""honor system"" to follow them.After what seems like an eternity of running, you climb up the ladder, through another manhole, and out onto an empty street. You have to press a series of buttons to jump over something in the street.After a while you go on to ""squat swings"".  At this point you have to stop to calibrate the Wii MotionPlus. There's no indication of what you have to do next. I tried waving the Wii remote to match what my onscreen character was doing, but no dice. After a few minutes of trying and Jillian yelling at me, you guessed it, I see a screen with Jillian scolding me, telling me to go back to the gym. Mission over, and I need to start all over again. Which means 10 minutes of wasted effort. I later found that there is a ""help"" screen, but it's just a line drawing of Jillian in a ""before"" and ""after"" shot of what the exercise is supposed to look like. Jillian's voice explains how to do the exercise, but it's drowned out by blaring music.After a few more times I got through this step. You then go down another manhole (I figured out by this time that ""Recon Northern Environments"" just means the mission is for your character to run aimlessly through the environment). You run through a bunch of other hallways for an eternity. You finally come out and see a little bit of new scenery. You run to one building to do lunge kicks, run to another building to do pushups, and then go underground to run through more hallways!When I was just about done with this exercise in tedium, it came time to do crunches. I've been doing crunches for about as long as I've been doing jumping jacks, but the game kept telling me I was doing them ""too slow"" and then ""too fast"". But I got through them.You then run up another manhole into a park, where you do hip twists using the MotionPlus and ""curtsy lunges"" using the balance board. Then, you guessed it, back underground to run through more hallways. Finally, after about 17 minutes of exercising, it came time to do 20 ""back kicks"" using the Motion Plus. I read the help text and tried my best to do a back kick, but the game kept telling me I was doing it wrong. Then, all of a sudden, you guessed it. The screen goes blank, and Jillian tells me I've failed and have to start all over! 17 minutes of effort down the drain!At this point I just felt like tossing the game out the window. I would sooner jump out the window than try to get through 10 missions, much less the first one. I don't mind a tough game, but when a game punishes you when you're doing everything right, that's frustrating beyond description.So I give this game three stars for ""fun"", but only two stars overall. I applaud D3Publisher for recognizing the drawbacks of the old versions (they were just too boring) and trying to bring this game in new directions. Unfortunately, I just can't recommend it due to the frustrations. As with 2009 and 2010, die-hard Jillian fans may appreciate the fun of hearing Jillian's voice as you make your way through different exercises. But for everyone else, you're better off with titles like EA Sports Active 2, The Biggest Loser (which also features Jillian, in a much more polished game), or even Active Life: Explorer (which does drama and adventure much better than this).","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N3QOU6V52WGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WTWJUK#wasThisHelpful","R3N3QOU6V52WGY","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dance Dance Revolution was a pioneer in exergaming. Introduced as an arcade game in 1998, it was the first game to use the ""body as the controller"", through the use of a special dance pad. The concept was simple: as music plays, arrows will appear on screen to the beat. Match your steps to the arrows to earn points. The result is not only a fun game, but also a great aerobic workout--so much so that schools around the country have even started to include DDR as part of gym class.The 2010 version of Dance Dance Revolution was supposed to be a ""reboot"" of the series. It was preceded on the Wii by several versions over the years: Hottest Party in 2007, Hottest Party 2 in 2008, and Hottest Party 3 in 2009.I'd given rave reviews to Hottest Party 2 and Hottest Party 3 when they came out, but I have to admit, the series is starting to feel a bit dated. When there are games like Just Dance 2 for the Wii and Dance Central for the Kinect out, where players are performing actual dance moves, the notion of trying to hit a pattern of arrows to a beat seems just a little passé.There is a new feature called ""Choreograph Style"" mode which feels like an awkward attempt to mimic Just Dance by using a combination of foot motions and hand motions to mimic real dancing moves, but this falls short of the real thing.It's starting to feel that Konami isn't really moving the franchise forward. In fact, the only real ""advancements"" in this version are that the on-screen characters look a little more polished, and the precision of hand controllers is a bit improved with support for the Wii MotionPlus. Hardly a ""reboot"" IMO. And disappointingly, there is still no support for downloadable content (DLC), which evidently the new PS3 version does have.Here is a list of the songs the game does have. As usual, there's a mix of a handful of licensed songs, along with in-house music:A Geisha's Dream (Ruffage Remix) - Naoki feat.

Electric TouchWin the Game - DKC CrewDon't get me wrong--DDR is still the most precise dance game available and will likely continue to be for a while, thanks to the proprietary dance pad controller. And it is still is a lot of fun and a phenomenal game for fitness and exercise. If you don't have it already, it's still a great game to get. But if you have it already (either Hottest Party 2 or Hottest Party 3), I honestly don't think it's worth investing another $70.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AP2JDYDDE1JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TJYOTW#wasThisHelpful","R3AP2JDYDDE1JK","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NFL Training Camp can best be described as ""EA Sports Active with a shot of testosterone"". I've reviewed a number of Wii exercise games in my day, and I'll admit, there have been times when for my reviews I've had to dance like a cheerleader or do step aerobics to songs like ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"". Admittedly, there are times I've thought to myself, ""there has got to be a better solution for guys to work out"".The best way to describe NFL Training Camp is that EA Sports combined two of their properties. With their longstanding licensing relationship with Madden NFL, EA Sports has access to official NFL team names, players, and assets like uniforms, stadiums, and logos. And recently, EA Sports released the excellent EA Sports Active 2, an impressive follow-up to their original workout title that brings with it new wireless heart-rate monitoring, leg-strap controls, and more interactive ""video game"" elements. In a brilliant move, they put the two together and built a training title that really does let you feel like you're in the middle of an NFL training camp.The game comes with the same hardware as EA Sports Active 2: a resistance band, a heart rate monitor that you strap to your arm, a motion tracker that you strap to your leg, and a USB receiver you plug into your Wii. If you buy both EA Sports Active 2 and NFL Training Camp, you'll have two sets of motion trackers and leg controllers which you can use for two-player workouts on either game. You can optionally use the Wii balance board to track your weight, but otherwise it's not used in any of the gameplay.You start the game by creating your profile and your character, which you can associate with any NFL team. You even choose a real player to train alongside with.There are two things I really like about NFL Training Camp. One thing is knowing that many of the drills are exactly what real NFL players do in their team workouts (In fact, EA Sports brought in actual strength and conditioning coaches from the NFL to consult on the training). The ""Team Workouts"" include fairly intense exercises such as foot fires, squats, heel lifts, lunges,and much more.The second thing I really like is that many of the activities are interactive, like a real video game.For example, there's an activity called ""QB Read and React"" where different targets on the field will pop up, and you need to make an overhand throwing motion to toss the ball to the target--if your team's logo is on the target. If you toss to an opposing team's target, it becomes an interception. You also have only a time limit before you will be ""sacked"", but you can do foot fires (running in place rapidly) to extend your ""sack timer"". A similar game is ""QB Window"", where you have to use a throwing motion to hit a target as it crosses the screen. Each time you do, you gain yards--four misses in a row without gaining 10 yards will mean you have to try again. There's an ""obstacle course"" game which combines both of these. You can also play as a receiver, where you need to run a pattern (basically following on-screen prompts) to catch a pass.There are a few kicking games as well. The ""punting challenge"" involves you, like an NFL punter, to try to punt a ball as close to the endzone without getting a touchback. You  punt the ball by making a kicking motion with your foot. There's also a ""field goal"" challenge where you have to time your kick with an on-screen cursor going across the uprights.There are defensive activities too, involving virtual version of real NFL training accessories like running through ladders and tires. Then, you have to push a tackle sled by holding out your hands and running in place. The activities become real interesting when in addition to running in place, you need to throw your arm out to block tacklers and jump to avoid obstacles.Like EA Sports Active, there are pre-designed workout regimens that you can choose from, or you can design your own custom workout with your favorite activities. There's also a 60-day challenge where you can work out four days in the week (resting 3 days). You can chart your progress in terms of calories burned and challenges met, and even put it online to compare with friends, family, or anyone else on their online portal.All in all, NFL Training Camp is a winner, and a great gift for the guy in your life who could use a little workout but is turned off by let's say, less than ""manly"" titles. As with EA Sports Active 2, it's a pretty good mix of more intense exercises and ""fun"" interactive exercises which keep the workout interesting and keep you coming back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VIBJHLKYPIGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VC8TUM#wasThisHelpful","R1VIBJHLKYPIGQ","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of Playstation 3 owners have been waiting a long time for Dance Dance Revolution to make it to the PS3. Four long years later, it's finally arrived. Was it worth the wait?The first thing I noticed when I opened my DDR box was a brand new, sleek black dance pad. it definitely looks a lot ""cooler"" than the old white dance pads on the Wii and the PS3. The pad pretty much works the same as always--just plug it into an available USB port and you're all set.The options on DDR should be familiar to anyone who's played it on the PS2 or the Wii.1) In ""Free Dance"" mode where you can just dive into dancing. You select the number of players (single player or multiplayer) and then you can choose any song at one of four difficulty levels (beginner, basic, difficult, expert).2) ""Club Mode"" is where you basically have to proceed thorugh different levels of difficulty to win the game. unfortunately, the developers decided to put in things which seem more like gimmicks than anything else. There are features like ""TRICKS"" which will suddenly change the difficulty level in the middle of a song. As you finish songs in other ""clubs"", you can move them to your own ""club"". Honestly, this section was much more confusing than it should have been, and the confusing and poorly written explanation of ""How to Play"" at the beginning only made things worse. Konami should have stuck with keeping this simple.3) ""Dance Off"" mode is where up to four players can take turns dancing. There's something called a ""combo roulette"" which does things like speed up the dancing, shift the top arrows around, make the arrows bigger. But what it ends up doing is make the competition confusing and frustrating. Seems like another situation where they tried to innovate, but ended up just causing confusion.4) There's been a lot of talk about how the new Dance Dance Revolution makes use of the Playstation Move controller. Turns out there's only one menu option in which you can use them: ""Move & Step"", which is basically ""Free Play Mode"" that uses the Move Controllers. So you can't use the Move Controllers in Club Mode or Dance Off Mode.To start, you need to adjust your position so that you and your mat are in the middle of the screen--and you need to stay in that position throughout the song. I thought that maybe like Just Dance, the game might at least featured some hand movements that looked like real dancing. But that wasn't the case. Instead, there are four new kinds of arrows (pointing diagonally to each of the four corners of the screen) added to the mix. To get points, you need to swipe your hand to that corner when you see the arrow. The controls are precise, of course, and you do see a visual ""swoosh"" when you move your hands in the right direction.For some inexplicable reason, when using Playstation Move controllers, not only does XMB navigation not work, the ""X"" button on the Move controllers doesn't even work. So you're in an awkward position where you're holding two Move controllers, but when you need to select a menu option or even just move to the next screen, you need to drop the Move controllers, pick up your Dualshock controller, make your selection, and then pick up the controllers again. It's a rather sloppy piece of programming on Konami's part.5) The remaining modes are ""How to Play"" (for anyone who doesn't know how to play DDR yet), ""Training Mode"" (which lets you break down any song at any difficulty to practice it--again, no Move support), ""Music Store"" (which lets you access DLC), ""Workout Profile"" (which tells you the number of calories burned), ""Records"" (which displays the high scores for each song on your system for Free Play Move and Move & Step), ""Video Manager"" (which lets you export videos to YouTube and Facebook) and ""Options"" (which lets youThe graphics are much better quality than on the Wii or the PS2, of course. When you select the songs you see a high-resolution image of the song's album cover. For the most part, the graphics are crisp and the colors bright. During the dance numbers, you'll see a video of yourself, taken with the Playstation Eye, in the background (sometimes clear, sometimes stylized with a solid color). I first found this a pretty cool feature, but sometimes the stylized images were so garing and distracting I just had to turn the camera off.The playlist, as usual, is a combination of licensed tracks and Konami's in-house music composers.According to You (Orianthi)Animal (Ke$ha)Bad Romance (Lady Gaga)Battlefield (Jordin Sparks)Celebration (Kool and the Gang)crushcrushcrush (Paramore)Dancing in the Street (Martha and the Vandellas)Hey, Soul Sister (Train)I Got You (Leona Lewis)I'm Yours (Jason Mraz)Love Like This (Natasha Bedingfield)Love Shack (The B-52s)Mission (Everything But the Girl)My Life Would Suck Without You (Kelly Clarkson)Need You Now (Lady Antebellum)Plastic Beach (Gorillaz feat.

Eric Anthony)TIME (NM feat. Aleisha G)As another reviewer mentioned, there are a number of aggravating annoyances. You can't pause when you're in the middle of a song. No buttons will work, and even if you hit the PS button, the song will keep on going. So if you get a phone call in the middle of a song, you just have to let it play all the way through.You have the ability to capture your performance in Free Play Mode, Dance Off and Move & Step on video. I can see the usefulness of recording songs with a dance game like Singstar Dance where you're dancing to ""real moves"". But here, you're just hopping up and down and waving your arms randomly. Something tells me that this isn't the sort of thing most people will be sharing on their Facebook page.In all honesty, I think this summarizes DDR's main weakness. DDR was the king of the hill of motion gaming since it first launched as an arcade game in 1998. But the world has moved on. Now that you can dance ""real dance moves"", stepping on arrows seems a bit passé.Don't get me wrong, die-hard DDR fans will love this new game, the improved graphics, and the new music tracks. It's still one of the better workouts you can get, especially when you practice over and over again to nail a difficult song. And of course, no other game can match it in terms of precision.But everyone else will probably find more satisfaction in newer games like Singstar Dance for the PS3, Just Dance 2 for the Wii, and Kinect Dance for the Xbox where they can not just pattern match but actually learn real dance steps. In that regard, DDR seems almost antiquated.overall, I'll give it a rating of ""It's OK"". Even if you can get over the annoyances, there's really nothing very noteworthy nor innovative about it. It's basically the same as it was in 1998--the ""improvements"" the developers tried to make (including use of the Move controllers) seem for the most part forced and contrived, as if they knew they had to be innovative, but knew that there's just not that much more that can be done to stretch a 12-year old platform.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32X1JRKQW1IE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WY86MK#wasThisHelpful","R32X1JRKQW1IE1","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With all the Wii exercise games out there, it seems that there's been a paucity of active fitness titles suitable for younger members of the family. The two attempts to reach this market have been D3's Family Party Fitness Fun and Knowledge Adventure's Jumpstart Get Moving. But both of these games have been dreadfully disappointing.And so I'll admit I was a little wary when I first tried Nickelodeon Fit. But after spending a few hours with it, I'm happy to report that finally, we have a kid-friendly fitness game that is a lot of fun and does provide some decent exercise value. And it's a bonus that our familiar friends Dora, Diego, Kai-lan, and the Backyardigans are part of it.Each of the four friends has seven activities you can choose from (as with most Wii games, they have to be unlocked as you go). There are also two activities that involve all of the characters for a total of 30 overall.Some of the activities are simple (thrusting the Wii remote up to jump rope, moving it in a circle to hula hoop, etc.). Others are impressively interactive and fun. In one game, you help the Backyardigans roll a big ball up a cliff, and then once it starts rolling you steer it towards a giant set of bowling pins. There's a similar game involving Dora and a bicycle. There's another fun game that involves Rintoo throwing a football into a set of tires on a tree. A lot of the games are just good fun, and even more so when competing against someone else.One thing I love are the little details in the game. There's a game involving Dora on a bicycle where you'll feel a rumble in the Wii remote as she rolls over rocks. You can have her ring her bell by pressing one of the buttons. And of course, the whole time she'll be shouting out exclamations like ""fantástico!"" and ""excellente!""The animation is impressive and true to the actual cartoons. The Backyardigans are rendered in 3D, just like on TV, while Dora, Diego, and Kai-lan are all their familiar selves. The background animation is beautiful, very much like on TV.Happily, the controls are never too difficult for youngsters to learn. They mostly involve moving the Wii remote up, down, left, right, and in circles to control the on-screen character. Before each activity, Tyrone the Moose will explain exactly how to use the controls. And during the game there's a stick figure in a box at all times that shows exactly what movement to make.One thing I also like is that each game gives an ""MVPA Rating"". It took me a while to figure out what this was, but it turns out it stands for ""Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity"". While few of the activities would be considered very vigorous for adults, chances are kids will get a pretty good workout from them, especially if they're motivated by competing against their siblings (or parents!). Like the cartoon, I'd say the game is most suited for kids from 4-7. For older kids, I'd recommend the excellent Active Life: Explorer With Mat.There's a whole section for parents where they can view statistics (including BMI and MVPA) in any date range for up to 5 different profiles, and even create different custom exercise routines for their kids by stringing together different activities.If there's a pet peeve I have about this game, it's that navigating the menus is not very intuitive. You have to hold the Wii remote horizontally, and then use the 1 button (instead of B) to go back or the 2 button (instead of A) to select.Overall, I was impressed with what Nickelodeon did. It's not perfect, but it's certainly a solid title that's better than the others out there. As I always tell parents, the best kind of exercise with kids is always outside with a ball or a bicycle. But on those days when the weather is bad, Nickelodeon Fit is a great way to ensure that the kids stay in shape.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XPO5YQFP4HQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TK1HSM#wasThisHelpful","R1XPO5YQFP4HQS","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I review a lot of games that can be used for fitness and exercise. Very rarely has a game provided such an intense workout that just after a few minutes of playing with it, I'm covered with perspiration and my muscles feel tighter. It happened with this one.It takes a while for you to get started with this game. When you pop the disc into your PS3, you need to wait a few minutes while the game data installs. You're instantly introduced to ""Duke"", your virtual trainer who looks like he's been in a couple fights himself in his day (the graphics are so detailed it's hard to tell if he's a real person or a computer-generated image).You start out by entering your weight, height, and age. Your BMI is calculated for you.You can then choose a look for your fighter. You select from a variety of faces, beards, hair colors, and hair styles. Chances are you can get someone approximating your look.In the next step, you divide 60 ""ability points"" into various categories: strength, speed, stamina, chin (your charater's ability to take a punch), heart (your character's resolve in staying up despite taking a beating), and technique. In the course of the game, you can win more ""ability points"" to further strengthen your character.In the next step, you calibrate your Move controllers (you need two of them). The process is a bit more involved than usual. You need to center yourself in the camera, stretch your arms straight out, and then move your remotes back and forth. You can also take a picture of the background without you in it to enable head tracking, which will supposedly track your head movements just like a Kinect (I couldn't get it to work on mine, possibly because I had objects in the background).Duke will go on to tell you how to play the game. You'll need to keep your feet in place when boxing. You press the Move button and flick the controller to dodge and jump.You'll also learn how to read the various elements in the game which represent your character's well-being. There's a health meter and a stamina meter, neither of which you want to run out. There's also a rage meter, which goes up each time you get hit and adds fuel for ""dirty moves"". A diagram of a skeleton will tell you if any part of your fighter is injured and needs to be patched up.Once you finished the tutorial, you'll see four menu options:Events: Takes you through different fights of increasing difficulty. With each fight, you'll earn money, reputation points, and new moves.Training: Will let you re-do the tutorial or take new tutorials on sparring, heavy bag, speed bag, target practice, and endurance sparring.Fitness: Shows you how many calories you burn while playing.Fighter: Lets you adjust your character's appearance, assign new ""ability points"" you earn, heal from injuries, and apply ""boosters"" which you earn during your fights. You can also download cheats online (which, of course, come at an extra price).As for the actual fighting, it is by far the best fight experience I've had in a video game. Your onscreen character reflect your motions almost perfectly--and even mimics hooks, jabs, and uppercuts pretty well. It does take a little while to get used to fighting on a two-dimensional screen--it's hard to gauge depth and so often you may be swinging and missing at your opponent (the game does work with 3D, so I suppose with a 3D television this issue would be solved). You can also switch camera angles, which helps. Other than that, it's a remarkable simulation of actual fighting.After each fight, you can view the calories you burned as well as statistics (punches thrown, punches connected, ""dirty moves"", and punch accuracy). You can even view a video replay of your fight.Like I said, after about 5 rounds I was breathing hard and felt my muscles tight. What's great is that I didn't want to stop--I just wanted to keep pounding the tar out of my opponents. I have a feeling that of all the games I have to get in shape, this is going to be the one I go back to most often. This is motion gaming to the extreme, and a great title which showcases the capabilities of the Move.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FZHL64JX2HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0J8KS#wasThisHelpful","R20FZHL64JX2HY","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EA Sports Active has long been the king of the hill as far as Wii Fitness Games go. EA Sports Active: More Workouts was an excellent follow-up title. So the burning question was: what could EA Sports do next for an encore?By far, the thing that frustrated me the most about the first EA Sports Active was its use of the Wii's Nunchuk controller. Aside from being spotty in its accuracy, I would constantly get tangled in the wires.EA Sports did something very smart and did away with the nunchuk altoether. Instead, it included its own wireless controller which straps right on to your leg (it communicates with a USB receiver you plug into the top of the Wii). So now, you have full range of motion. The system does an excellent job of tracking your leg movements.EA Sports has also included a Built-in Heart Rate Monitor, which also communicates wirelessly with the game. So throughout your workout you can track your heart rate (displayed on top of the screen along with your calories burned). The Heart Rate Monitor also doubles as a controller that detects your arm motions for many exercises. For certain exercises you still need the Wii remote, and you can optionally use the Balance Board for a handful of exercises as well. The title also still comes with a resistance band (which is slightly less flimsy than the previous version).One thing I really love about the new EA Sports Active is the innovation it put into the activities. There are over 70 to choose from, ranging from basic exercises to sporting events. As in the original version, most sporting events basically consist of you doing repetitions of exercise movements that approximate the movement that your on-screen character does. What I really like about EA Sports Active 2 is that they've incorporated some more interactivity and ""video gaming elements"" into the activities. For example, in the skateboarding and mountain biking activities, you need to leap at just the right moment to avoid obstacles or perform jumps. In the Basketball event, a cursor will move over the basket, and you need to time your jump correctly to score.There's a new 9-week exercise regimen that you can follow. It's not just a random assortment of exercises each day, it was clearly put together by a real fitness expert. You choose four days of the week to exercise (leaving three days to rest). Each day, you work progressively on different fitness goals. Each day starts with warm-up stretches and ends with cool-down activities, and there's a good variety of activities throughout to keep the workouts interesting.Another great improvement is the ability to work out with (and compete against) someone else, if you purchase a second set of controllers. There's something about competition that makes exercise go by so much faster. If your Wii is connected to the Internet, you can also challenge your friends (or complete strangers) online or join an online workout group.One annoyance, as other reviewers have noted, is that because many of the exercises don't use the Balance Board or the Wii remote, both will time out throughout the game, which interrupts the flow of the exercises. I understand that their intent is to save battery power, but at the very least it would have been good to have an option to prevent the controllers from shutting off (for example, those who use rechargeable batteries don't care as much).Overall, I'd say that EA Sports has maintained their position as the king of the hill as far as Wii workout games go. It comes at a price, but when you compare the $100 you pay to gym memberships or exercise equipment, it's definitely a small price to pay. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10O90LSF460J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O6C0V4#wasThisHelpful","R10O90LSF460J","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 2009, Ubisoft released Just Dance for the Wii. This is the game which changed the face of dance games. Prior to this game, video game dancing pretty much consistent of pattern matching. But now, you could dance actual dance moves and have the system tell you how well you're doing.A year later, Sony released Move for the Playstation and Microsoft released Kinect for the Xbox 360. Suddenly, motion control was much more accurate and available with high resolution graphics. And not surprisingly, Sony came out with Singstar Dance and Microsoft came out with Dance Central.I won't comment on the relative merits of Move vs. Kinect--that's something that time and the marketplace will ultimately decide. What I can say is that for those who own a Sony Move, Singstar Dance is a solid title that still carries on the excellent singing and voice evaluation capabilities of the original, while adding new features that use the Sony Move that make it feel like the next-gen version of Just Dance.Like the original Singstar series, Singstar Dance uses proprietary microphones. They're solid, high quality mikes that plug into a USB hub. The blue and red mikes from the original Singstar series will still work, but ordinary USB microphones will not. The ""Party Pack"" is pretty reasonably priced at $40, considering that it comes with both microphones.When you get to the main menu, you have the option of viewing a tutorial on how to dance (basically the same as Just Dance, you hold the Move controller in your right hand and dance the mirror image to the onscreen silhouette). You can also start playing solo or with friends. You can also view your personal ""media gallery"". More on this later.Singstar Dance allows up to four players to play together. A maximum of two can sing at a time, and a maximum of two can dance at a time. When you have four players together all going at it the same time, it's a lot of fun. As for those who want to sing and dance at the same time, you're out of luck.As with the original Singstar, for singers a meter will appear below showing how in-tune you are. The more accurate the singing, the higher the score.When dancing, the original artists' video will play in the background, while a silhouette figure appears to the right of the screen which you need to match the movements of. You can view a tiny video of yourself in the lower right hand corner. Or, you can switch views so that you're taking up the entire screen.The very cool part is that after you finish dancing, you can view a video playback of either part or all of your performance, which you can save (or in my case destroy and remove all evidence of). You can also see snapshots of your performance as well as ""golden moments"" (which I assume are the classic poses pre-identified in each of the songs). Each of these can be saved in the aforementioned ""gallery"", or even uploaded to an online portal (where you can see others' performances as well).For both singing and dancing, you can choose a difficulty level. For the most part, once you get to the more advanced levels the dance moves are authentic (meaning they're the same or very similar to the artists' own moves). This means that to really experience the game to the fullest, you'll need to practice and practice to get the steps right just like in real life. I would have liked to see a ""practice"" mode where they break down each of the steps for you or at least let you try it in slow motion, as trying to figure it out from the fast-moving silhouette can be difficult. But as soon as you get all the steps right, it's definitely rewarding. Motion tracking using the Sony Move was flawless, even in a dark room.Here's a list of the tracks that come with the program. Additional ones will be available as downloadable content:Backstreet Boys - Everybody (Backstreet's Back)Black Eyed Peas - Shut UpBlondie - Heart of GlassChris Brown - With YouCyndi Lauper - Girls Just Wanna Have FunDiana Ross and the Supremes - Baby LoveGloria Gaynor - I Will SurviveGossip - Standing In the Way of ControlGwen Stefani - What You Waiting For?The Jackson 5 - I Want You BackJamiroquai - Cosmic GirlKC & The Sunshine Band - That's The Way (I Like It)Kid Cudi - Day 'N' NiteKool and the Gang - CelebrationLady Gaga - Poker FaceLa Roux - BulletproofMC Hammer - U Can't Touch ThisNew Kids on the Block - Hangin Tough'NSYNC - Bye Bye ByeOutKast - Hey Ya!Paula Abdul - Straight UpPitbull - I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)The Pussycat Dolls - Don't ChaReel 2 Real - I Like to Move ItRicky Martin - Livin' La Vida LocaRun-DMC vs. Jason Nevins - It's Like ThatSalt 'N' Pepa - Push ItShaggy - BombasticSir Mix a Lot - Baby Got BackSoulja Boy - Crank ThatAs you can see, most of the songs are family-friendly, although a few may be a little too suggestive to play with children (the game is rated ""T"" for Teen).One cool bell-and-whistle is voice-controlled menus, where the PS3 will use voice-recognition to bring you to the right place when you say an artist's name, a genre, or a song. This was a little hit and miss when I tried it, so I kept it off. Playstation XMB navigation good enough for me.All in all, this is a solid title that makes great use of the Playstation Move's controller and the Playstation Eye camera. With the dearth of really good launch titles for the Playstation Move, I'd say this one is a bright spot, especially if you'll be playing with friends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4DVBOJRZB19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O6C5O6#wasThisHelpful","R2O4DVBOJRZB19","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the nice things about video games is that they let you experience things you otherwise couldn't. Most of us will never fly into outer space or face down a major league pitcher throwing 99 MPH. Similarly, most of us will never be invited to the real Biggest Loser Ranch for personal training sessions with Bob and Jillian. But this Wii fitness title comes remarkably close.The scenery in the game should be familiar with anyone who's seen the TV show. The opening screen is an exterior shot of The Biggest Loser Ranch, and throughout the game you'll see familiar settings, from the gym to the Boxing Ring to the locations where they do challenges.When you start the game, you're asked to create a new profile. You enter your name and if you have a balance board your weight is displayed (warning: unlike other Wii exercise games, this one doesn't conceal your weight, so anyone in the room can see it).After this, you can allow the program to choose a personalized program for you. This is where things get pretty neat. The first step is for you to go through a 30 minute ""fitness test"". This basically runs you through a series of different exercises at 5 different levels (light, moderate, challenging, hard, and intense). You perform the exercises as best as you can. The system will use the Wii remote and/or the balance board to check if you're doing the exercises.At the point where you can't do any more, the system will automatically end the test and recommend that level for you. I really liked that the levels were really accurate--""challenging"" really meant challenge, and ""intense"" really meant intense. For me, by the time I got to the challenging levels, I was already out of breath and sweating.Once you have an intensity level set, you enter your gender and your birth date. Next, you go on to the ""Body Analyzer"". This is where you verify your weight, and then enter your height, neck size, chest size, and hip size. You then select your target weight.Finally, you're ready to establish your routine. You select the length of time you're able to work out each day (from less than 20 minutes to over an hour) and then choose your trainer. Unlike the previous encarnation of this game, you can choose Bob, Jillian, or both of them.They'll take you through one sample workout session. It basically consists of different routines, basically reps of different exercises each a minute or two in length. You basically have to follow the on-screen image of Bob or Jillian as if you were looking at them in the mirror. A countdown clock will show you the amount of time remaining for each exercises. One nice touch is that you see a figure in the background that is the exact body shape and size you entered before (which I prefer over the first game, where you had to choose a former contestant to be your on-screen character)Once you finish the sample workout, you can decide how often a week you want to work out (anywhere from 2 to 6 days), and then the duration of your fitness program (4 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks). Optionally, you can turn on calorie tracking, so you can enter the number of calories you eat every day.The first time you start your exercise routine, a new ""health and lifestyle task"" will appear on your calendar. This is where you can customize that on-screen character to look like you. You can adjust its ethicity, its age, its starting weight, and even tweak features such as its eyes, eyebrows, nose, ears, lips, and jaw. You probably won't get it looking exactly like you, but you'll definitely get it ""close enough"". It's neat seeing yourself in the world of The Biggest Loser.After this, you're ready to begin your scheduled workouts. A calendar will show you the upcoming workouts that are scheduled. Workouts range from core exercises to circuit training to specialized workouts like ""box-fit"" or yoga. Every now and then there'll be a challenge game. You'll also have a regular weigh-in, just like on the show, which will use the balance board to measure your weight.The training exercises are basically core, calisthenic, boxing, and yoga exercises. There are a lot more exercises available since the first game (I counted 117). They range from jumping jacks to jump rope to boxing to lunges and twists. It's a very complete set of exercises.The challenge games are based on challenges shown on TV: Slipstream, Boom or Bust, Light Cycles, Sprint and Slide, and Punch Clock. As in the first game, you're not actually doing the actual movements of your on-screen character, but you're doing an exercise routine, following a small image of Bob or Jillian. The more accurately you do the exercise, the better your on-screen character will perform in the activity. Like the TV show, you go through rounds of competition. It's a fun way to add a little variety to your exercises.From your personalized workout menu, you can view your calendar and choose ad-hoc exercises or challenges (which are added to your daily total).The Profiles and Settings option allows you to run the Body Analyzer again, or view achievements and trophies. You can also choose additional exercise equipment to use in your workouts (either a stability ball or a resistance band. I didn't see free weights as an option, even though the advertising material said they'd be in there).There's also a ""Health and Lifestyle"" option which lets you view recipes, get tips and advice from trainers and former contestants (these are also randomly displayed for you throughout the game), and calculate your Biggest Loser Know Your Number ""KYN"" HeathScore.Some other thoughts about the game:1) There are options which allow you to exercise with someone else. This is great motivation when you get tired of exercising by yourself.2) The motion controls are mostly accurate. There were a few exercises where my motions didn't register (more notably jump rope and jumping jacks), but that's something endemic in most Wii games. By now, I've learned not to get too bothered by that.3) As with most exercise games, you need a lot of room, especially for exercises which use the balance board.4) The game is definitely more affordable than other games such as EA Sports Active 2 or fitness games on Kinect, yet makes you sweat just the same.5) One thing some may find a bit annoying is that you constantly have to move the Wii remote from your left hand to your right hand and back. I realize this is in the name of precision, but it got to where it became more trouble than it was worth.6) One thing I did like was that when Bob or Jillian shout encouragement, they also reinforce proper technique and posture. This is a refreshing change from other games where the on-screen trainer would just yell random exclamations like ""yeah!"" and ""you did it!""All in all, this game provides a very solid and complete exercise routine which you can use to lose weight. I admit I would have liked to see some more interactive elements in the game to make it more fun (e.g., being able to actually control the on-screen character in the challenges), but at the end of the day this title is a traditional exercise and fitness title, nothing more, nothing less.If you're a fan of The Biggest Loser TV Show and have always felt you could use a little personal training from Bob and Jillian to lose a little weight yourself, this is the Wii exercise title for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SRV8TTSMCS9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003S2OO7W#wasThisHelpful","R1SRV8TTSMCS9Q","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love baseball. As most baseball fans, I've dreamed of walking up to the plate with 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth and crushing the game-winning home run. I'll never know this feeling in real life, of course, but that's what video games are for.Last time I looked for a batting cage in my town, I found that almost every one close to me has closed down, and the ones that are still open are an hour away. And they cost a ton of money. The batting cages near my park cost $3 for 25 balls. Given the way I hit, the math comes out to about $0.75 for each time I make contact.And so when I heard that Konami was working on a batting cage simulation for the Wii, which used the advanced motion gaming features of the Wii MotionPlus, I was excited. Could this experience come close to a real batting cage?I have to admit. I love this game. But I love it because I approached it with the right expectations.I'll start off by saying this game is very, very technical and very, very realistic in its approach. If you're the type who wants to just close your eyes, swing your bat with all your might, and hit towering home runs, this is not the game for you at all. In fact, you will find the game incredibly frustrating. For that, your best bet is still good ol' Wii Sports.The Cages is a batting cage simulator. Nothing more, nothing less. You can't play a real game of baseball, you can't pitch, field, or run. You just stand in a cage and let a pitching maching throw to you.The pitching machine will throw you up to 20 different types of pitches (from fastballs to sliders to curveballs to knuckleballs and changeups). As pitches are thrown at you, their motion and trajectory are very realistic, or at realistic as it can be on a two-dimensional TV screen. Just like the real thing, it's maddeningly difficult to hit a fastball after you've been served a bunch of breaking balls. The machine will throw at different speeds, and the virtual ball travels the virtual 60 feet, 6 inches in the exact same time it'd take on a real ballfield.To prepare to hit the ball, you hold your Wii remote straight out at chest level and press and hold ""B"". To hit the ball, while holding down the ""B"" button, you swing. Sounds simple enough. But what's remarkable (and enervating) about this game is that it doesn't just take the timing of the swing into account. It takes your bat speed, the angle of your swing, your bat height, and the follow-through of your swing all into account, just like in real life. They say baseball is a game of inches. The Cages captures your swing accurately to the millimeter.After each swing, the game will instantly show you a split-screen video showing your swing in slow motion from the top and the side. The game does an incredible job capturing the details of your swing in relation to the pitched ball. It is actually the single best implemention of Wii MotionPlus I've seen in a game yet.The videos aren't just for show. You can actually analyze your swing and make adjustments. For example, once I kept fouling pitches off the plate. I could see clearly from the side view that while my swing was timed correctly, my swing was too high. Same thing happened when I started fouling pitches off to the right--I could see from the top view that my swing was too late. After making the adjustments, I was hitting again.Probably like most people who first started up the game, I started out by trying to time my swings and swing for the fences. This resulted in me striking out time after time. But surprisingly, I was my most successful when I followed the fundamentals of hitting, things like keeping a loose grip on the ""bat"", shifting my weight from my back foot to my front foot while swinging, and having a smooth, level swing (it helped me when I visualized two things: a batting tee in front of me and the bat fully extended from my Wii remote).Unlike most video games which provide instant gratification, this video game rewards you after you practice and practice the fundamentals, just like the real thing.Was it realistic? Almost too much so. When I go to a batting cage, I typically strike out or foul off pitch after pitch and get unbearably frustrated. The exact same thing happened when I started up this game. But the difference is, after I watch the video replays and make the adjustments, eventually I start making contact (the ""bling"" sound effect doesn't provide quite the same satisfaction as the crack of a bat, but it's still a great feeling!)There were, of course, things I wasn't too crazy about with this game, as other reviewers have pointed out:1) It is aggravating to have to hold down the ""B"" button to swing. After a while, you learn to compensate for it, but it really messes with your ability to do the fundamentals.2) The graphics and sounds are really very shoddy. I'm willing to overlook this, as whatever development resources they didn't put into the aethetics of the game, they did put into making a very realistic simulation.The burning question, of course, is: will this game help you hit a real baseball? The answer is, yes and no. Swinging a plastic game controller doesn't feel at all like swinging a real baseball bat (although you can improve your arm strength by playing the game in conjunction with Riiflex Weights). And as much as a video image of a 99-MPH fastball is accurate, it's not the quite as seeing a real one buzzing by your head.On the other hand, if you study and adhere to the fundamentals of hitting and use the in-game tools to analyze and adjust your swing, it's a surprisingly realistic experience and helps you understand the real things you should be looking for in your mechanics when you do get in front of a real pitched ball. It's also a blast to be able to go to your own virtual ""batting cage"" any time of the day or night, no matter what the weather.I'm guessing that the poor response and reviews of this game may have resulted in less-than-stellar sales for Konami. That's too bad, because I hope they keeps trying--the concept and execution were great, but they were probably hampered by the limitations of the Wii. Perhaps this idea was just a little before its time. It may be a better fit for a console like the Playstation Move, with its improved motion sensor capabilities, 3D capabilities, and high resolution graphics. Or, the technology in this game would be amazing if it were incorporated into the ""advanced"" level of a game like Sony's MLB: The Show or 2KSports' Major League Baseball.Casual gamers will probably want to pass on this game. But those who are baseball fanatics and want to experience the process (and frustrations) of training to hit Major League-type pitches, this is by far the best simulation out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Q4QAPABNX32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002W5GI9S#wasThisHelpful","R17Q4QAPABNX32","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If the screens for Get Fit with Mel B look familiar, it's for good reason. The game was developed by a company called Lightning Fish, which also happened to develop a game for the Wii called ""New U Fitness"" in the UK, where it was pretty well received (in a boneheaded marketing move, the same game was re-released in the US under the name ""My Fitness Coach 2: Exercise and Nutrition""--you can read about why this was a boneheaded move under my review for that product).The Wii game was not as bad as the reviews would indicate. It had a snazzy, three-dimensional opening menu, and you could choose on-screen instructors to lead you through a variety of basic calisthenics exercises (sit-ups, lunges, etc.). You could choose either individual exercises or have the system prepare a daily workout that combined different exercises based on your fitness goals. It had the typical bells and whistles of a Wii workout game such as allowing you to change your background scenery.My initial impression of Get Fit with Mel B is that it's pretty much the same game as New U Fitness, just updated for the PS3. The premise of the game is more or less identical to My Fitness Coach 2 and in fact, so are the menu options:The opening menu options are:Today's Workout:When you set up your profile, you can identify up to two fitness goals under the categories of General Health (weight loss, detox, lower cholesterol), Lifestyle (e.g. ""Destress""), Special Occasions (e.g., new mom/dad, getting ready for the holidays), Sports and Activity training, and working on specific parts of your body. The system will automatically put together a daily 30-minute regimen of exercises that will target these goals.Choose Workout:Here, you can drill down to the specific exercises that you want. Exercises are broken into two categories: Fitness and Aerobics. Fitness exercises include things like crunches, squats, lunges, etc. You typically do them in reps of 10-20 before going onto the next exercise. For aerobics exercises, you can choose from a series of dance moves, boxing moves, or cardio moves.There's also a ""custom workout"" option which lets you put together your own string of exercises (selecting exercises and defining the number of reps for each), a ""practice"" option which lets you practice certain exercises as many times as you like (anywhere from 4 to 96 reps), and a neat ""challenges"" option where you're pushed to complete a series of themed exercises (dance exercises, abs exercises, leg exercises, boxing exercises, and cardio exercises) within a certain amount of time.Your Progress:This section allows you to track your workout progress. One thing the Wii has that the PS3 doesn't is a balance board which will automatically chart your weight. So it's time to dust off that bathroom scale.Nutrition:I never quite understood the concept of having recipes on a video game. I get that they want to provide a ""holistic workout regimen"" that involves proper diet, but on the other hand, not many people have their TVs set up in their kitchen or a printer hooked up to their video game console.There were a couple things about Get Fit with Mel B, that I really liked:1) The game makes excellent use of video. You first get a hint of this when you seeing a video image of yourself under ""Your Progress"" in the opening menu options. To start, you first calibrate your video image (basically stand in front of the camera and let it scan you). As you start your exercises you'll see two exercise mats, the left one with a video image of Mel B (it's really her, not a creepy cartoon rendering), and the right one with--you! Your video image is actually superimposed on the screen! As Mel B does the exercises, you can match her movements and timing exactly, step by step, arm movement by arm movement. It's a vast improvement over the ""do the mirror image of my movements"" you find in Wii exercise games.2) The scenery is breathtaking. Granted, when compared to other PS3 games it's probably not that impressive, and it's really just used as a backdrop (there's no interaction with the scenery). But for someone used to enduring choppy and cartoony Wii background scenery I was impressed.  The first scene I chose was the ""City Apartment"", which was a window overlooking a city skyline. You can also choose to work out in a park, on a dock by the bay, at a poolside, in a forest meadow, and on a luxury yacht.3) The array of individual exercises is impressive. There are 22 basic fitness exercises, but 15 dance exercises, 20 boxing exercises, 14 cardio exercises, and 14 advanced cardio exercises. Put them together in different orders with different amounts of reps, and you'll have a pretty good variety of workouts.4) You can choose to work out using your own equipment, including an aerobics step, a fitball, a resistance band, wrist weights, and ankle weights.Annoyances:1) While other games say that you need to be at least 8 feet from the camera, most of the time you can get away with being 5-6 feet away. Not so with this game. Anything less than 8 feet and your video image will not appear on the screen properly.2) For a lot of exercises, it simply doesn't make sense to have the Move controller tracking your moves. For standing exercises like squats, lunges, and jumping jacks it's great. But for exercises like push-ups and crunches it just doesn't make sense.3) The game doesn't use the Playstation Move XMB navigation. I'll chalk this up to the developers not knowing about it, being an early release title. Still, it gets annoying having to point a cursor and click when every other Move game lets you hold down the trigger button and move the controller to navigate. Worse, you can't even use an available Dualshock or Sixaxis controller to control menu options.4) This is an annoyance I don't think the game developers could have done anything about, but when performing exercises that require you to be on the floor, it's very tough on the neck to look up at the TV screen to follow the moves. Perhaps a little more audio guidance during these exercises would help.5) In general, while the motion controls were a step above what you could find on the Wii, I didn't get the sense that they made full use of the Move's capabilities (generally, as long as there was ANY motion, it registered on the screen).6) Tiny annoyance, but it seems the game developers forgot to convert certain screens for an American audience. When you first input your birthday, it took me a while to figure out that it was in ""day-month-year"" format versus ""month-day-year"". And what the heck is a ""gram"" or ""milliliter"" in the recipes section? :)This has all the bearings of a game which is pretty well made for a first-generation title, but may not stand the test of time as newer and more innovative games come out. Still, for someone looking for a ""pure"" exercise game, it's not a bad choice. The ability to see your own actual video image next to Mel B is not just cool--there's no better way to help you visualize and time the exercise, particular for aerobics exercises. And the scenery is definitely beautiful and head-and-shoulders improved over what you'd see on a Wii. That, plus the fact that this is the first attempt at any fitness game for the PS3, gets it a solid 4 stars from me.For ""fun"", I'll give it 2 stars, as at the end of the day it's still just a glorified exercise DVD, which I don't find particularly fun. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I hope as game developers produce more fitness titles for the PS3, that they can introduce more ""gaming"" elements to make workouts a lot more immersive and fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLWLHLF2XXHEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWGBE8#wasThisHelpful","RLWLHLF2XXHEI","A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My old shredder was on it's last legs, so I ordered this as it had good reviews. My old shredder said it could shred twice as many pages as this, but I never put more than about half a dozen sheets in at a time. It was my second shredder. I normally do a big shred session every year, but decided it would be better to shred the papers more often, I think it's kinder on the machine, I don't like to overheat it.When I put the old one out with the garbage after it finally kicked the bucket, it had shreds of paper still in the blades I could not remove. I love this shredder, when it has finished shredding, I slide the button to reverse and all the sheds that didn't drop down the first time, quickly dropped down completely, leaving the the blades shred free. I really like that feature.

"I am having great success with these. I used one on a baking sheet to cook granola. I made the recipe a few times and it came out good using a black lining sheet (not silicone), but it is thin and moves around a lot and had to be cut to the right size and is re-usable, but a lot of fiddling about...When I used one of these, it stayed put, even though it didn't quite cover the pan perfectly, it did a great job.After the granola was cool, I took it off the baking sheet, it was solid, golden, crispy and nice and shiny underneath.

"This is my 4th  Bissell in about 12 years, the first two were really large and heavy, the third was smaller and lighter which was a great relief. Three days ago I was ready to clean the living-room carpet (as I do it twice a year) the water wasn't circulating, just like the others after I had them for a few years. The belt and motor worked OK and it was cleaned from the previous use, the water just leaked onto the carpet, which was annoying I was in the middle of spring cleaning. Maybe my Bissell's hadn't lasted long, because I hadn't vacuumed enough. After each use when I clean it, there's always some grit and dust which gets stuck into places impossible to get to, maybe the tubes got blocked. There doesn't seem to be a way to get to them, I gave up on it and looked online for a new one.I almost ordered a different brand that was really expensive, thinking it would last longer It had good reviews, but then I noticed the bad ones, so many reviewers ended up with the same problem. If I'd spent a lot of money and it wouldn't work, I'd be very upset. I decided that I may as well go with this cheap one, if it lasts two or three years I'll be happy, I ordered it Tuesday night.It's now Friday, it was delivered by Fed Ex at lunch time, I can't get over how fast it came with the free shipping, I'm not even a Prime member. I was expecting the large size I thought it said, but it's small and almost the same as old one it's replacing, which is great because it doesn't take up too much space.I vacuumed the living room carpet three times. There were some old tea stains I didn't think it would get rid of, but I'm happy to report the Bissell did it's job, the stains are gone, the fibers are soft and fluffy and the house smells lovely and fresh, it didn't take long for it to dry with the ceiling fan on high. The Bissell cleaning solution is very concentrated, you don't need much, it's amazing how black the water was. There was hardly any grit and dust when I cleaned it, vacuuming very well was worth it.This Bissell is very easy to use, a red button to turn it on, and next to it one which you press to move the handle down. there's another button you press to release the clean water with the cleaning solution onto the carpets. The handle must be down on the floor to release the tank to empty out the dirty water. Lift and snap up the two clips each side of the tank and lift it up, there's about an inch square opening for the water to be poured out through..I love Bissell's, and obviously I'm not the only one around here, I put the old one out by the curb next to the garbage last night with the instruction manual taped to it. The next morning just as the sun was rising, I looked outside and was amused to find it was gone, someone had taken it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5H89OHF0YW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0070YQP6M#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5H89OHF0YW0","A15LI24XAWS8RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LI24XAWS8RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for something to help my bottlebrush tree, it began to look awful after a hurricane struck one of the branches off in 2004. Amazingly the gap eventually filled, but it just didn't look good, the branches were all over the place and it didn't look healthy or pretty. Last fall, I had the tree trimmed into a nice shape, but it still didn't look good.I saw this product on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try, I used about 4 lbs of it, the tree is quite old and tall, it probably could have done with more according to the instructions. I've also been watering occasionally, which is also recommended.It's now February and what a difference, it has greened out with new growth, and beautiful scarlet bottlebrushes are growing.

"The shirt is very comfortable and fits perfectly.  Some have wrote about the fit not being right and I feel if the best fit is desired, then a tape measure will go far in helping with the correct size.  fox Head gear has a proper sizing chart available on their website where you can choose the best size for your dimensions. No two manufactures are alike when it comes to fit, so it should be expected that one brand offering a large should fit the same as another brand - that would be a perfect world.What I like most about the short other than style is the material. The material stays fresh smelling after 2.5 hours of riding. Compared to my other sports shirts not made of cotton, that's a great benefit.The shirt is not a tight fitting shirt like the roadies and does offer some breathing room.Message created on a smart phone.

" 0:40 MinsI am using this to drill through glazed ceramic flower pots to allow water to pass through and I would like to include a few tips being that everyone else has already said how great these hole saws cut.Being a hole saw without a pilot drill, follow these tips for cutting on a slippery surface: 1) Begin drilling on an angle until the surface has been scratched enough to hold the hole saw in place. Don't try an force the drill straight down from the angled cut, but slowing bring it square with the surface.2) no special oils are required, simply use any vegetable oil by dipping the drill bit in the oil every few seconds or when the surface begins to appear dry. vegetable oil may also be applied to the groove if it is the preferred method. Be creative and keep the drill wet.Some have mentioned that the larger bit is difficult to use,, once again, hold the drill on an angle to scratch surface. Yes, the drill may jump a little, but eventually the groove will appear and you can slowly begin squaring off the drill. The groove will hold it in place as the drill is brought upright. - adjust RPM's to find the best speed.I will try and post a video for additional info.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XIMME08NUM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TYIWUW#wasThisHelpful","R26XIMME08NUM5","A3Q2HW41XACQAA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q2HW41XACQAA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Updated 11/9/20155 star for print speed while new - 1 star for output - two stars to get your attention before buying. 1) high speed printing 2) nice colors on proper paper.The problems: 1) first, my printer was replaced by memjet direct and the problems are the same. 2) Label Printing. C6010 is an edge to edge printer, however both machines printed crooked. Perfect on the top and off by 1/4 inch at bottom. It's not a true edge to edge. 3) Labels, you will never hit center on the labels because of crooked printing. See pic and look at top left label position compared to lower left position. 4) My machine has slowed to a crawl. Of course it's out of warranty.Best use: Proofing for print shops. It's too expensive to maintain for a poor output printer.I wouldn't recommend this machine to anyone. Epson business printers do a much better job for $150 or so. Of course print speed is sacrificed. If memjet would license it's technology to the big boys, printing would change forever - they created an amazing printhead, but they are not in the paper feeding business.Here's the scoop.The printer is amazing and it's fast. Be sure to use high quality inkjet paper for best brochure results..Okay,, now that you own the best printer on the market; where do you get it serviced? Well, I learned today that memjet does not offer any support or any type of warranty unless you purchase from a dealer who will service you. Which means, you are stuck with a very expensive printer if you should have a problem. Now, I've owned many business class printers including very high end lexmarks and epson commercial printers, along with a 42 inch wide canon and ever one of those companies offers support to their customers regardless of where you bought it from - they know by the serial number when it was purchased. So be careful,, enjoy this amazing printer, which in fact it is. The problem I am facing is that all my edge to edge print jobs are crooked whether it's printing from the manual tray or automatic tray.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EKA4SD5U052M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIE59TO#wasThisHelpful","R3EKA4SD5U052M","A3Q2HW41XACQAA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q2HW41XACQAA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product is very easy to install if you can fit under the kitchen sink. Watch the video posted by 3M and you should have no problem.About the product:Like any filter, it delivers fresh tasting water - but in some cases, your water will not taste fresh even with a million dollar filter. Why? Because this filter is behind the spout and not in front. If you have a bit of plumbing experience, remove your kitchen spout to inspect and you should find a lot of growth inside the spout - which your water will pass through before it begins to fill your glass.I recently replaced my kitchen faucet and after careful inspection of the old faucet spout, I discover that the bad flavor (which I thought was city water) was from the build up of minerals and possibly mold within the spout itself.The filter works great and I will now inspect the spout once a year and either clean the inside or replace it as necessary. Keep in mind, the hot water is not filter and there is a good chance that the spout will develop deposits in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R153XOWYKPERXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DVW0PI#wasThisHelpful","R153XOWYKPERXD","A3Q2HW41XACQAA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q2HW41XACQAA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: 1/6/2014After exchanging my initial purchase for a new light and battery; I am not achieving a 3 hour burn time on high. My battery will last for about 90 minutes, so I am looking into purchasing an additional battery pack or perhaps a second unit. It's an awful feeling losing light while on a night trail ride.The light is everything you can ask for at a low price. However, while trail riding at night, the connector pulled apart several times from vibration and the light turned off twice in 60 minutes from vibrations. If you are choosing this light for the purpose of trail riding at night and the trails are loaded with obstacles, then this might not be the best light for you.Negatives: 1) Ride time 90 minutes - battery lasted about 63 minutes. 2) Connector pulled apart on several occasions - use tape if you are buying this based on price 3) Light failed twice from hitting too many obstacles - failing on a trail ride at night is not acceptable and can be dangerous.On the bright side: 1) lights up everywhere you need to see. 2) light weight and simple to install. 3) charging indicator (Red - needs charging and Green - battery is ready) 4) Low price - but I would recommend purchasing two if you plan to trail ride for more than an hour. My guess is that I received someone else's defective item because the package appeared to have been previously opened and the contents appeared to have been used. I would like to hear back from others about battery time before I repurchase this item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RQFVJ7ZP5US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WPXNQ6#wasThisHelpful","R36RQFVJ7ZP5US","A3Q2HW41XACQAA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q2HW41XACQAA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Updated Review: Although the Topeak pump is well built, it does require heavy pushing compared to a more expensive pump. I've since returned the Topeak and purchased a Specialized pump designed for Mountain Bike Tires and the difference in pumping action is night and day. My new pump feels effortless in comparison. In all fairness, the topeak pump which I received could have been defective - you can be the judge. Since receiving my Specialized pump, I have also found it to be much easier to use when securing over either of the two valve types, ""Presta and Schrader""Topeak is a good brand, it just didn't work for me and I wish that it had - the price was right. The specialized pump is about $25.00 more and it was worth it to me, but it might not be worth it to others.Previous review: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the pump requires so much effort to put air through a Presta Valve. I also own a pump made by specialized and I don't use that much effort when pumping 100 pounds into a tire - problem is, I gave it to my son and purchased this pump to save money.Just spoiled I guess - but I will most likely return the pump and spend the big bucks on a new specialized pump.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KVEDS1XBM72T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RLE55K#wasThisHelpful","R1KVEDS1XBM72T","A3Q2HW41XACQAA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q2HW41XACQAA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now that I've finished it I think I would have enjoyed it so much more if I was an actual ""Young Adult""!  There was a lot of romance in this book, which was sweet and would definitely be appreciated by a younger audience.  Personally, I would've preferred much more information about the aliens' invasion, and the timeline of the attacks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLIFT3A16JED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IV1OWHC#wasThisHelpful","R1WLIFT3A16JED","A2P0FW3W4JYSPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P0FW3W4JYSPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, which takes place 300 years before Legacy Code, introduces us to Selene, her brother Eli, and their ""Nan"".  Selene and Eli are ""Protecteds"", which in essence means they will never get sick.  Selene considers herself and Eli to be more defective than protected.  We learn that the three of them have been living ""off-grid"" for the past 8 years, and they are very self-sufficient - canning lots of food so they won't be affected by food shortages.  Selene worries that they will be found, but we're not told much about how or why they became Protecteds, why Selene feels defective, or who may be looking for them.  This was an enjoyable quick read and I'm hoping the next installment will shine light on these questions.**I received a complimentary copy from the author in exchange for an honest review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0KAFO4E5DDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M26EWN6#wasThisHelpful","R3O0KAFO4E5DDK","A2P0FW3W4JYSPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P0FW3W4JYSPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I didn't think I would enjoy this book, but I'm so glad I continued reading it!  The main characters were likeable and I found myself rooting for them!  I could totally see myself reacting the same way Era did to her difficult circumstances.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys ""Star Treky"" sci-fi.**SPOILERS AHEAD** The ending was so sad!  First Dritan gets killed in a mining accident and then poor Era is murdered for committing treason.  The stage is set for a sequel and I'm looking forward to finding out what happens next!  I so hope that the colonists discover the secret about the defect.  Getting that information out meant so much to Era that she was willing to die over it.  It would be so very sad if she died in vain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MF4XM28EEPKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITEZ3OM#wasThisHelpful","R3MF4XM28EEPKY","A2P0FW3W4JYSPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P0FW3W4JYSPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For those who have not had the pleasure of reading this book yet:  Be prepared to feel a whole gamut of emotions and an OMG I NEVER SAW THAT COMING at the end!

It's heavier than the X-Mini and feels more solid & of a much higher quality.  And I love that you can listen to it while it's charging.

You need explicit permission of your local fire marshal and the property owner as well as meeting a bunch of other laws.  In practice that means you'll probably need to find a rocket club with launching privileges to be able to launch legally.  Many launch illegally without a problem, but please note it is a $1000 fine for EACH launch if a cop decides to nail you.  There are horror stories of unaware parents getting multi-thousand dollar fines as a cop watched as they launched a handful of times without incident from the local park.

"I used this to make a nose cone for a model rocket.  I can confirm what other reviewers said about the packaging being a bit sub-optimal for preventing scratches.  It should have had some wrapping and then some filler in the shipping tube to both prevent it being scratched and from rattling around in the round shipping sleeve.  However, the scratches on mine were VERY minor.  In fact, most of what appeared to be scratches, was really just lint/dirt/dust that appeared magnified through the clear plastic.  A quick wash with water got rid of most of it.Others have mentioned material quality issues.  Mine had no voids or chips.  When I ground it down to the shape I wanted for the rocket, and then polished it to a smooth finish, it was obvious how consistent the material was.  No bubbles or voids at all.  (not to brag, but it looked awesome)Finally, the sticker.  Yeah, it's the type where the glue is stronger than the paper and getting it off without leaving a sticky mess would be a pain.

"I got two samples of this product, one black, one white, a few months ago and finally got around to testing them.  USB chargers are a difficult product category because the USB spec was never designed for the current/amps (and thus wattage) that today's products require.  In a desire to not damage computers, most high current/amp devices have special chargers that have the signal wires configured in a special way.  That way, when the device connects to their charger, they'll know they can draw all the current they want.  When they don't see the signal cables properly configured, they only draw what the USB spec allows, thus preventing them from damaging that charger (or computer).It's a fine solution to a tough problem, but unfortunately some of these signal wire configurations are directly contradictory to each other, (specifically Apple vs everyone else) leaving 3rd party chargers in a bind.  They can't support all devices easily, even though they all use the same plug.  The result is that lots of chargers don't charge lots of devices at full potential.To learn more about the particulars of this, see my previous review of the 10 watt PowerGen charger here:http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSQFGYMS2DCH/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permThe PowerGen line has solved this problem by having each of their ports configured differently.  This was true on the older 10 watt and remains true for this newer edition.  The result is if you use the correct port, this device will work with more devices than any charger I know of.  If you've got just about any Apple device you're covered.  It'll cover almost all Android phones and many of the tablets, but some of the special tablets, it won't.As yet another bonus, this edition improves on the older 10 watt version with a more visible and appropriate labeling... ""A"" for Apple products and ""NA"" for non-Apple products.  On the previous 10 watt version it wasn't very obvious and was somewhat misleading being ""2A"" and ""A"".The other area where the new charger excels, and brings itself up with the best in the market, is the mechanical design of the product, particularly on the part that plugs into the 12V adapter in the car.  The older 10 watt product was a bit slippery and over time the vibration of being in a car would make it back out and lose its connection.  This one is a better design and I've left it in my truck for months now without issue.Back to device compatibility, based on my testing, their specs of what it'll work with are accurate.  It charged both my Android phones as ""AC"" devices and my iPod touch and classic.  It also does NOT work with my HP Touchpad, which is specifically mentioned in the specs.It would be nice if it would work with the oddballs in addition to the mainstream, but seeing how it does better than any other device I know, and I've tested 6 now, it gets strong marks from me here.(NOTE: the rest of the review was updated on 4/13/13, based on testing a new device from Anker that exposed some weaknesses in my test bench. As a result, I went back and re-tested this product):This product has yet another impressive feature.  All of the other products I have previously tested bridge the power between their ports, including the older 10 watt PowerGen unit.  However, this unit has independent power for both rails.  (for the techies out there: I tested this with resistive loads, and the voltage would only drop on the rails I heavily loaded and have no affect on the other rail's voltage or abilty to generate current.)This is good, because one device won't affect the other.  If you're charging your high-power phone and then you plug in your tablet, the phone's charging will be uninterrupted and not be slowed.  That's very nice and something the other products won't provide.In addition, there is some sort of load balancing going on between the ports.  I can push either port to 2.2 amps and stay well within the USB spec'ed voltage value (greater than 4.75 volts).  When I then tried drawing that much current from both ports, it went into it's auto-protection mode (that's a good thing, as it prevents the device from being damaged, as 4.4 amps/21 watts is beyond its capabilities) and the status LED started blinking to indicate this.I then tried multiple combinations to see how much I could draw without going into auto-protection and I found as long as I kept it below 3.2 amps combined (over 16 watts) it would keep running like a champ.  So, based on my latest testing this device can power just about any tablet in one port and just about any phone in the other, with one caveat:  They can't be both from the same OS.  You can have an Android phone and an iPad or you can have an iPhone and a Android tablet like the Samsung Galaxy, but you can't have an iPhone and and iPad because you can't configure both ports to support the same set of devices.Nevertheless, until somebody creates a dual port device where both ports are configurable for Apple or Android, this is the best car charger on the market right now and gets 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TFF3PCTAVC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088U4YAG#wasThisHelpful","R3TFF3PCTAVC9","A1CBB2CYNLU8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CBB2CYNLU8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can have an Android phone and an iPad or you can have an iPhone and a Android tablet like the Samsung Galaxy, but you can't have an iPhone and and iPad because you can't configure both ports to support the same set of devices.Nevertheless, until somebody creates a dual port device where both ports are configurable for Apple or Android, this is the best car charger on the market right now and gets 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ER66TTRW9Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088U6OZY#wasThisHelpful","R35ER66TTRW9Y3","A1CBB2CYNLU8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CBB2CYNLU8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quick overview of this product before I get down into the details...This product, in unaltered form, suffers from a couple problems:1. Despite what the description says, it's designed for Apple products, not for other products like Android. I find the description quite deceptive because it will NOT deliver the current one expects for most Android devices (or the HP Touchpad as well).2. While it claims a 2.1A port and a 1A port, implicitly suggesting 3.1A total, it can not actually deliver 3.1A no matter what device you have (including Apple).  It delivers a total of 2.1A.However, by cracking open the case and shorting the data lines, something VERY easy to do with this device if you're at all competent with a soldering iron, you get an awesome unit for Android devices, and it's THE ONLY ONE (that I've found), that will charge an HP Touchpad at full capacity (more details below).Now to the details...A little background on USB charging for those who don't know:The USB power spec is for 0.5 Amps at 5 Volts... or 2.5 Watts. This was great up until the last couple years when devices have gotten really power hungry, particularly smartphones and tablets and to a lesser extent dedicated GPS's. Some of these devices use over 2 Amps, particularly the tablets like the iPad (or in my case the HP Touchpad).Manufacturers of these devices therefore had a dilemma. If they had their devices pull more than 0.5 Amps, they risked damaging the power source, which could be a computer, that was only prepared to source 0.5 Amps. Thus the manufacturers have used tricks to determine whether their device is connected to an unknown source, at which point they purposely only draw 0.5 Amps, or to the dedicated charger that was provided with the device, where they can draw all the power they need.There seem to be two common tricks used. The first is to short the two data-wires together in the charger. This is what most non-Apple devices do. Since a computer or older device wouldn't have done this, the device can assume it is safe to draw all the power it needs.Apple seems to have taken a different approach, one that I don't fully understand but know can be seen by the fact that the data lines are neither open nor shorted when the charger is plugged in, and is more sophisticated and probably superior, because I suspect it allows the device to know exactly how much power it can use.While Apple taking a better approach might be nice in concept, it's created chaos in the USB charger product category. What is the non-specific charger to do? They can't support both.This device chose to go the Apple route for both ports. While the PowerGen unit I purchased (see below for links to the others I've purchased) had the 1 Amp port setup for Android (data lines shorted) and the 2 Amp port for Apple, this device, like the others, has both setup for Apple. I don't own any high-power Apple devices, so I can't say for sure, but I suspect this unit performs well with Apple devices out of the box.But because I had bought 4 of these and they all had the same problem (except the PowerGen, which only had it on one port), I decided it was time to get down and dirty and see if I could open any of them up and modify them by shorting the data lines.  This was the ONLY ONE that was easy to open without damaging the casing.  Just unscrew the silver cap at the top and then pop off the silver plate on the bottom and it easily splits apart.  Then there are two sets of 4 pins, one on either side of the circuit board that runs up the middle that are somewhat obviously the pins to the USB port.  A solder blob on the middle two pins to short them together is all that is needed.  It took longer for the old soldering iron to warm up than to do both sides.  Reassembling took a bit of careful placement of the parts, but it wasn't too difficult and then all that's required is pushing back on the bottom plate and re-screwing in the cap.  The whole operation took 5 minutes.It bears repeating:  NONE of the others were easy to get apart.When I tested it afterwards, it performed beautifully with my android devices, just like I expected from my above explanations.  I got an additional bonus that I didn't expect with the HP Touchpad that requires some additional explanation.See, the HP Touchpad, while it's charger has the data lines shorted, also does something else.  It requires a specific voltage be on the data lines.  Thus it doesn't work with chargers that just have the data lines shorted, including the PowerGen mentioned in this review.There is a way to modify a charger further to get it to work with the HP Touchpad, by adding resistors to one's charger, but frankly, that was more work than I was willing to do.  However, whether it was luck or genius, the 1 Amp port on this device already has some resistive elements for the Apple charger setup, and when one shorts the data lines together, it gives the required voltage for the HP Touchpad to charge.  NICE FREE BONUS!Now, because this device can only source 2.1 Amps total, it'll be a little overpowered if you connect both the HP Touchpad (or an iPad for that matter) and a smartphone, but even when I did that, it continued to charge, just perhaps a bit more slowly than it would have if it could deliver all the current each desired.And it bears repeating that this is THE ONLY DEVICE I am aware of that can fully charge an HP Touchpad (after modification).Thus this device gets docked to 4 stars because it claims out of the box to support a number of Android devices that will not work as expected without modifying the device.  I suspect it will work well with Apple devices including the iPad (I don't own any).  It also gets dinged because of the deceptive amperage claims.Frankly, I am a bit uncomfortable giving 4 stars for something that requires modification to meet my needs, but because all the devices I tested have the same problem it made it easier to give it a 4 considering the ease of the modification and the nice bonus of the HP Touchpad charging.For those who don't have Apple devices, I ordered three additional devices:- ""PowerGen Dual USB 2A Heavy Duty Ouput Car Charger"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00622AG6S/ref=oh_o06_s00_i00_details)- ""Kensington K33497US PowerBolt Duo Car Charger"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PU01M4/ref=oh_o03_s00_i00_details)- XTG ""Ultra Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00470C35E/ref=oh_o02_s00_i00_details)I have written a review on each of them with more details.I kept this one after the above modification and the PowerGen in unmodified form and returned the Kensington and the XTG.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTMUEPV9R91N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056VNVV8#wasThisHelpful","R3UTMUEPV9R91N","A1CBB2CYNLU8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CBB2CYNLU8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't own any high-power Apple devices, so I can't say for sure, but I suspect this unit performs well with Apple devices. Using electronic equipment I was able to draw 3 Amps when putting a fixed load on either of the USB charging ports. However, when I connect any of the 3 high-power devices I have (HP Touchpad (2 Amps), Motorola Triumph Android phone (0.85 Amps) and the LG Optimus Slider (0.7 Amps)), none of them drew all the current they could have, because they were expecting a shorted set of data-lines.To be fair, I tested the device using power resistors to see how much power it could source.  It performed beautifully.  It performed better than any of the 4 I purchased (see below) sourcing well over 3 Amps without significant voltage droop.  It could source it no matter which port it was from, whether it was all 3 Amps from one port or the other, or a combination that added up to 3 Amps (2 Amps from the top port and 1 Amp from the bottom as the labels claims).  From that standpoint, if you have Apple products, I think you will be quite satisfied with this charger and would likely be the best choice for you (either this or the more expensive Kensington who's specs are better than this one, but in practice the deliver about the same current).Thus this device gets 3 stars because it claims to support a number of Android devices that, while I don't have the specific ones mentioned, I firmly believe they will not work as expected.  While I suspect it will work well with Apple devices including the iPad (I don't own any) I ended up returning it because it doesn't meet my needs as a non-Apple user.For those who don't have Apple devices, I ordered three additional devices:- ""Bracketron Universal Dual USB Car Adapter (UGC-298-BL)"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056VNVV8/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details)- ""PowerGen Dual USB 2A Heavy Duty Ouput Car Charger"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00622AG6S/ref=oh_o06_s00_i00_details)- ""Kensington K33497US PowerBolt Duo Car Charger"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PU01M4/ref=oh_o03_s00_i00_details)I have written a review on each of them with more details.I returned both this one and the Kensington and kept the PowerGen in unmodified form and the Bracketron after I broke it apart and shorted the data lines to have it work.Neither this product, nor the Kensington were easily to open without damaging them, so they got returned, even though they had better power output (potential, not in practice) than the two I kept.

"This product has two major issues:1. While it's description claims it has a 2 Amp port and a 1 Amp port, the reality is that it has bridged the two ports and it can only source 2 Amps total.  It is not capable of delivering 3 Amps combined like the description implicitly claims and could never simultaneously charge an iPad and a smart phone.  (UPDATE:  The technical details section now indicates more clearly the 2A total, which is appreciated.)2. The 2 Amp port appears to be using the Apple protocol for USB power, so that port will only provide 0.5 Amps to most other devices.The upside of this is the 1 Amp port somewhat over delivers, and can source 2 Amps if nothing else is connected and 1.5 Amps if the 2 Amp port is sourcing 0.5 Amps for a non-Apple device.  Thus this product can support one-high power non-Apple device (in the 1 Amp port) and one lower power device (in the 2 Amp port).Now some more background/details...First, a little background on USB charging for those who don't know:The USB power spec is for 0.5 Amps at 5 Volts... or 2.5 Watts. This was great up until the last couple years when devices have gotten really power hungry, particularly smartphones and tablets and to a lesser extent dedicated GPS's.

As such, it was able to deliver all the power my Triumph and Optimus wanted.  However, for some reason, even when it was the only device connected, it would not fully charge the HP Touchpad at the 2 Amps it could have, because for one reason or another, the HP Touchpad rejected it as a high power charger.To be honest, this surprised me because it was able to source the 2 Amps the Touchpad claims it needs and the HP Touchpad charger has the data-lines shorted.  So I'm not sure why this didn't work.Thus this device gets 3 stars (UDPATE: 4 stars) because it can source the current it claims (minus the somewhat deceptive 2A + 1A notation (UPDATE: Which is now more clear in the technical details)), would likely support an iPad like it claims, but falls short in other regards noted elsewhere.For non-Apple users, or even more so mixed users (say an iPad and an Android phone?) this device is superior to the other device I purchased, the ""Kensington K33497US PowerBolt Duo Car Charger"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PU01M4/ref=oh_o02_s00_i00_details) because on that device, NEITHER port works with non-Apple devices (although it performed better power-wise, see my review over there for details).I've ordered two additional devices:- ""Ultra Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger - 2.1A Output"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00470C35E/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details)- ""Bracketron Universal Dual USB Car Adapter (UGC-298-BL)"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056VNVV8/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details)Hopefully one of the two of them will be able to deliver to their specs for my devices.UPDATE: I've increased my review to 4 stars for two reasons:1. The changed technical details text makes it more clear its total power capacity.2. Of the 4 models I purchased, it's one of the two I kept and it's the only one I kept in unmodified form.

"A quick summary of this product before I get into the details:Likely great for dedicated Apple device users that has all the power it claims (simultaneously 2.1 Amps on one port with 1 Amp on the other for a total of 3.1 Amps output combined, but under performs DRAMATICALLY for non-Apple devices due to protocol issues for USB chargers.  It gets 3-stars because all it claims to support is Apple devices.Now for more details...A little background on USB charging for those who don't know:The USB power spec is for 0.5 Amps at 5 Volts... or 2.5 Watts.

I don't own any high-power Apple devices, so I can't say for sure, but I suspect this unit performs well with Apple devices.  Using electronic equipment I was able to draw 2.1 Amps when putting a fixed load on this USB charging port.  However, when I connect any of the 3 high-power devices I have (HP Touchpad (2 Amps), Motorola Triumph Android phone (0.85 Amps) and the LG Optimus Slider (0.7 Amps)), none of them drew all the current they could have, because they were expecting a shorted set of data-lines.The 1 Amp port on this device is a bit of a quandry however.  It didn't have the signature on the data lines of either the Apple protocol or the shorted lines.  It appeared to have them open... which was a surprise and I believe a mistake (although I can't be certain with Apple products).  The results for my 3 devices however were identical to that of the 2.1 Amp port.To highlight the positives, I can say this, I was able to draw all the power the product claims it can source using fixed loads.  As my above explanation makes clear, it is the DEVICE, not the charger, that chooses not to make full use of the available current (Amps).  So by using power resistors I could test the actual capacity of the device without dealing with the data-line issue.As such, I was able to draw both 2.1 Amps from one port and 1 Amp from the other, simultaneously.  I can not say the same for the other charger I have tried (and I have two in shipment to test).Thus this device gets 3 stars because it only claims to support Apple devices and without any to test I have to assume it would work great for them.  It also can deliver the current it claims.  It is likely a 5-star product for sole apple users.However, for non-Apple users, I STRONGLY encourage you to look elsewhere for your Car USB power needs.  The other device I've tried is the ""PowerGen Dual USB 2A Heavy Duty Ouput Car Charger"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00622AG6S/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_details).  It has other problems (the 2A port doesn't have the data lines shorted and it only sources a TOTAL of 2A, not 2A on one port and 1A on the other), but at least one port (the 1A, which can really do 2A by itself, see my review over there for more details on that) on that has the data lines shorted to get the full power with non-Apple devices.I've ordered two additional devices:- ""Ultra Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger - 2.1A Output"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00470C35E/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details)- ""Bracketron Universal Dual USB Car Adapter (UGC-298-BL)"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056VNVV8/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details)Hopefully one of the two of them will be able to deliver to their specs for my devices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5ZMIXCR863Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PU01M4#wasThisHelpful","R3S5ZMIXCR863Q","A1CBB2CYNLU8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CBB2CYNLU8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The great news is that you have unlimited hints to get you through.There do not seem to be any egregious permissions, although Facebook programming is embedded, it is not required in order to play.The only reason I deducted a star was that the file size is significant.

You can play against the computer or a person with you in the room (passing the device back and forth) and have up to 4 players in the game (mixing computer and live players).

In the easy level, the computer often takes the third or fourth best choice turn, leaving you with a lot of opportunities to beat it if you have  a decent strategy.there are menu buttons that take you to the Amazon app store and the dev's website, but the good news is that I did not find any strange permissions and it passed a Lookout scan with no virus warnings.Overall, a great game!

"First - 1 star for no strange permissions and another for no IAPThe game play itself is a fun word search-type puzzle. You search for words in the tiles on the board, then rearrange letters to form a quote. The easy level is very, very, easy, but there is an option for a harder difficultly level. That seemed to be an ""average"" difficulty for most word search puzzles. It is a fun game. However, I'm not sure about the ""Presidents"" aspect. I would have expected more than quotes from the presidents, especially since some quotes seemed rather generic. I think it would be a great game if categorized as a general word game. It is worth the price, even if you miss out on the FAOTD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6Q3TCXDLHG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E290UZU#wasThisHelpful","R2C6Q3TCXDLHG9","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, first the prosThere are no invasive permissions - automatic + 2 stars to all developers for this very important feature in a paid appYep, only two stars on this review means....The cons-There are only 20 puzzles-They are all at an easy level-If you want more puzzles, you need to pay for additional Sudoku apps-You can't customize the puzzles-There is nothing ""different"" about this app from a paper and pencil Sudoku book or even a free online search of SudokuI got a former FAOTD called Sudoku 10,000 while that app is more than this one, it offers MANY more options and puzzles than this app does. If I had not downloaded that app, this one would still be two stars, but knowing what is possible in apps, I would definitely not buy this one.

"I love this app! I was on vacation with my family at a zoo over 100 miles from home. My phone was stolen out of my purse and I didn't notice it for a few minutes. When I realized it was gone, I went to the zoo's main office and was allowed to go to the lookout website where I tracked my phone - on its way to a town another 150 miles away.After it stopped moving, I contacted the police and was able to give a location thanks to the Lookout app. The police were able to go to the house and retrieve the phone. Within 48 hours from the time it was taken, it was in police custody.I recommend this app to anyone with a cell phone.It is also great for scanning files for malware and has caught one app with spyware.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJVALXR4QSP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QEFQIM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJVALXR4QSP1","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 5 year old loves My Little Pony. I figured the box was cute and would encourage her to brush if I got it with a My Little Pony toothbrush. I was right, but amazed at how much she wants to brush.She actually reminds ME it is time to brush with Pinkie Pie. She has no trouble getting up in the morning, and making sure to brush every day. I love the fact she is motivated to brush!The only reason I removed 1 star is that the tube of toothpaste is not large. Granted, kids should not use much more than a pea sized amount, but, even with that amount, the tube is gone relatively quickly. If your child is a big fan of My Little Pony, I highly recommend this toothpaste to encourage brushing, but by the multi-pack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GF39MCMQDZ86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHJNIY6#wasThisHelpful","R2GF39MCMQDZ86","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute game similar to Temple Run in that you are going through various scenes, avoiding obstacles, and collecting power ups. The graphics are nicely done and the game play is challenging (I think it can be too challenging for me, but my teen loves it).It is fun to play for a while and the tutorial is useful, but not overdone.The great news is I didn't find any spyware or a lot of excessive permissions. It does connect to Amazon's Game Circle for score listing and that means it does connect to the internet and has permissions to do so.The theme involves the concept of needing to get clean water to third world countries. Some may find this aspect annoying, but the game play is still good.My biggest problem is the size of the file. It takes up A LOT of space on my Kindle Fire HD. I needed to delete two smaller apps on the device (saving to the cloud for later) in order to play this. When I (or my kids) decide to play one of the other games, this will likely be placed in the cloud to save space on the device.Overall, a worthwhile app, but a very large file with some rather overt PC messages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397IBY9L9APPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFFXOM2#wasThisHelpful","R397IBY9L9APPV","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, as far as safety is concerned, the app downloaded and was scanned by Lookout and found not to contain any spyware. - 1 star!There were no in app purchases that I could find! - 1 more star!You may at this point notice a total of two stars in the review.... that is because the game play itself is definitely not one I plan to use again. The front page opens with a menu of topics - but the language is not standard US English and it appears to have several areas where the words were mistranslated. For example, when you select a topic, you can choose from Adjectives, Verbs, Animals, and Substantives. OK, in law, ""substantives"" is used to explain the topic of ""nouns"" but why are Animals not part of the noun category?  A bit confusing, but something I could get used to, I guess.Then there is the set of directions, a button labeled ""How it's played."" The game is summarized in two sentences and the word ""then"" is incorrectly used instead of ""than."" Admittedly, I don't really need much to know how to play, but it is still disconcerting that a game designed to help with vocabulary does not know correct grammar.Next, there are buttons on the main page that give you an option to send an email with directions in a language I don't recognize. Another button sends you to the Google Play web site to buy the game --- if you bought it here, why is this necessary? A third button takes you to the Facebook page for the developer, but I couldn't see it properly on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm not sure why. This seems to be a game that was almost a free giveaway then changed at the last minute to be a single purchase game.During the game, you have the ability to select any letter, consonant or vowel as one of your guesses. If you are correct, the letter appears in the grid above the hangman image. If you are incorrect, you see more of the skeleton. I played the game several times and won a few and lost a few. I was rather annoyed that, if you do not solve the puzzle, you are not told what the word was. I also didn't like the message -""Damn it, they hanged you!"" I can just see my teens telling me this phrase is acceptable since it is used in the game ""for all ages."" The idea that the character is a skeleton and not an 8 bit man is a bit strange enough, but I would really prefer to see at least the ending comment edited. Finally, if you win, you are given a ""Congratulation"" instead of a ""Congratulations.""The minor qualms I have with the game play theme, though, are nothing to the concerns I have with the overall language issues of this app. As a result, I would not recommend a purchase of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THZ8CIKLWBG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHMPFOM#wasThisHelpful","R3THZ8CIKLWBG3","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the feel of this game. The graphics are beautiful, as is the music. There are no intrusive permissions!If you remember the 80's there used to be ""electronic pets"" called Tamagotchi that you would hatch and care for on a daily basis. To me, this is the same concept, but with much more advanced feel. In addition to simply ""caring for"" your pet, you get to decide what it eats, and therefore, what type of creature it becomes (carnivore/herbivore). By choosing this, your creature then develops and, with each new development, can achieve different options.It is strangely meditative at times to watch the little ""embryo?"" float around. This is not a game, per se, but it is entertaining. If you see it on the FAOTD, it is definitely worth the download. If not, it is worth its price. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2951S140KCQ4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFRA9AS#wasThisHelpful","R2951S140KCQ4A","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoy playing Flow Free and appreciate that the graphics do not require a tablet. I can pass the time waiting to pick up kids in the school parking lot by playing this on my phone, or spend time getting through the levels on the tablet at home.You CAN get through all the levels without paying anything, but there are in-app purchases available to get extra hints, themed colors, and getting to the extra levels before working all the puzzles before them. I have played this game as a free game for a lot of time and still enjoy it -without any purchases.Be aware that if you give this (or any app, really) to a child to play with, you will want to set up parental controls either on the device or with the Amazon store to avoid making purchases without permission.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTYU9PKQJUE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JGSM6G#wasThisHelpful","R1PTYU9PKQJUE8","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This app is cute...for about the 5 minutes you get to play it before you need to buy more time. You can't earn the stars without popping al the frogs and that can't be done in the time given. In order to get more time, you need to PAY for it - in real money through in app purchases. The In app purchases are not just seen in a simple store button, but are noted throughout the game. Further, in order to proceed in the levels, you almost NEED to buy the time. This is not what Amazon defines as For All Ages. That category is listed as ""contains no objectionable material or advertisements."" The in app purchases are NOTHING BUT advertisements - and it also wants you to log in to Facebook and Twitter to be able to share those accounts' info too!This is not a game for kids - be warned!

"OK, first, today is Easter and it is the FAOTD. So we are in an Easter bunny type of mood and this is free to download today. It is very much a holiday-type app so it is not likely to be used much throughout the year.However, that is OK since there is not a lot to the app. There are 12 puzzles that I and my daughter found. I don't think there is any more unless you follow the link to the developer's website to get more games.The puzzles that are included are fun and my daughter played with them for about 20 minutes (this is a long time for a preschooler). However, I doubt she is going to play with it much more since she has seen all the puzzles. So I'm deducting a star for the small number of puzzles in a paid app.I also don't care for a link to the developer's website. My daughter is plying this on my Kindle Fire HD in the Kindle Free Time app, so I am able to lock it down with parental controls that keep the device from starting the internet. However, if you have another android tablet, I would recommend locking the device so that your child cannot go on the internet while in the app. If you cannot do that, the button itself can be removed by holding it for about 3-5 seconds. However, I am deducting a star since it is there in the first place. Preschool apps don't need links to external websites. Linking to the Amazon Appstore would be sufficient.Overall, it is fun for my daughter, but it doesn't have enough replay ability to justify a $2 app fee.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DBKX58OAV34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMQM93A#wasThisHelpful","R26DBKX58OAV34","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a sample of two stories from a larger book. I enjoyed reading these two, but they were rather predictable. In The Key the friends of a girl whose mom is the town fortune teller comes to ask her help in finding their friend. After reading the first five pages or so (it is hard to tell how many pages I read on my Kindle since it displays ""Locations"" rather than pages), I had pretty much figured out what had happened to the friend. In The Brothers Piggett, I saw the plot lead to a familiar story as soon as the house of the first baker was described. As a result, I was not shocked by the result. I also would have preferred a different ending, but I won't ruin it for anyone who plans to read the story by suggesting how I would have changed it.If you have read a lot of fairy tales, you are likely to be able to predict the outcomes, as well, however, the stories themselves are well written. The second one has characters I even started to care about. Overall, it is a good sample of two short fairy tales/morality plays. I don't think I'd be willing to pay for the full book, though, given the predictability. So, based on the idea that these were fun, easy reads, this pair of short stories is worth the download, but I'm only giving 3 stars since I wouldn't want to buy the full book based on these two.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USYODJUG5X07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKBIPKA#wasThisHelpful","R2USYODJUG5X07","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many apps offer practice in writing and recognizing capital letters, but this one offers both capital and lowercase letters, and even numbers. It is great to be able to let me daughter play while helping her practice learning skills she will, literally, use the rest of her life.The app lets her trace with ""bubbles"" as she puts it, that show the direction to draw each line. I admit some of them seem a bit off to me since I learned it a different way, but the final outcome is great. She enjoys learning and is starting to be able to write some letters herself. After playing with the app for only about ten minutes, she came to me with her notebook (she has a Doc McStuffins tablet of blank paper) and her pencil and wrote the first two letters of her name! I was impressed both with my daughter and the app.I did not find any adware or spyware and no in app purchases. This is definitely a keeper!

I admit I normally look for permissions first, and when I saw no ad or spy ware, I did not see any issues with the app. HOWEVER, I just saw that my daughter did not actually exit the app - and that was over an hour ago.

If you get at least half right, you get the country and start stacking them, similar to the idea of answering questions in Trivial Pursuit to get wedges of the pie.There are, of course, differences, such as no board and all the questions are in world geography, but overall the concept ifs the same.Be aware there are many HARD questions in this app, so the younger kids may spend more time simply guessing than actually playing. For junior high kids, though this is great for learning about countries around the world.I recommend playing on a tablet since some of the maps require details to see some of the smaller countries.If you enjoy world geography trivia, this is a fun app to buy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3H5275TOBUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4A6VZS#wasThisHelpful","R2D3H5275TOBUS","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I expected an ""interpreter"" program would let me type in a phrase in English and then translate it into the other language or let me type in a phrase in a foreign language and then translate it to English for me.Actually, it is a multi-media book. .. and a large one, at that. Be aware that the app will immediately request a download of images that may be another 200 - 300 Mb. Then, each language you want to download will add another 2-30 Mb. So you may need to double-check your available storage on your device. Once all the downloads all complete, you end up with the ability to look up common phrases in each language. The app does a good job of playing correct pronunciations for each. The written translations are spelled correctly (for the ones I tested).However, if I was traveling in a foreign country, it would be difficult to find everything I'd want to say very quickly unless I was VERY familiar with the locations of every phrase in the program. That is a lot to learn.This seems more geared to someone studying a foreign language. You would be able to get a great opportunity to practice key phrases and in the process become familiar with the sounds of the language. For this purpose, I think it is an excellent app.If you are looking for practice of a foreign language, I highly recommend this. If you plan to travel and use it to translate, it has some limitations. Overall, though, it is worth purchasing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13Q2L3S7IMKNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UB9SKS#wasThisHelpful","R13Q2L3S7IMKNW","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed Megg Jensen's Cloud Prophet and Swarm Trilogies, so I was really looking forward to another fantasy novel series.I was not disappointed. The story begins with mystery surrounding a village separated from the rest of the world. I enjoyed following the quest of the main characters, along with Tressa's struggle to deal with personal issues.I felt the characters were well developed and wanted to read it all in one sitting just to be able to find out what happens next. I was frequently surprised to discover a twist.I don't want to spoil the book, so I'm not giving a lot of plot details, but it is definitely worth buying. The only negative is that there are some pages that appear to not have been completely edited and there are some overtly sexy scenes, so read before giving to teens. I suspect the editing will be completed by the publisher in the future.Overall, a great read and a tantalizing intro into a new series.

"I admit I didn't expect much from this app. First, it runs constantly in the background so it is always using some of the battery power. Second, I thought I could simply adjust the brightness and shading of the screen manually so I didn't see this as useful or necessary.However, after trying it in a dark area of our house, I will admit I noticed less eye strain. Truthfully I had never noticed before I was having trouble with the lighting, but after trying this, I noticed I was actually more comfortable reading in low light with this app.The app lets you establish lighting levels and remembers them for future use. So, the manual adjustments don't always have as much options as are available in this app. I also like being able to set the light levels and have the app remember them.I did not see any intrusive permissions or scary additions to the program and no IAP that I saw.Overall, a useful program. It is definitely worth the download, whether free or not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMGDQGDVCLLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZAY5GY#wasThisHelpful","R1IMGDQGDVCLLP","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great app that simulates the Solitaire wood and peg games. The + design is one very common version that I have always had trouble solving. By playing electronically, I can quickly see whether or not I have the right process.I like the multiple boards but really wish there was a triangle one since I'm so used to the triangle version at Cracker Barrel. However, as a time waster, this is a fun game. There were no obtrusive permissions that I found and the game appeals to all my kids, although less to the 16 year old girl. Still, as a time wasting game for a few minutes, it is a well designed solitaire app worth owning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTP1TRUMD83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLQ5SK8#wasThisHelpful","R2CTP1TRUMD83","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a parody of sorts. It plays like a roll playing game where you explore the land to find various prizes. The fun of this game, though, is its ""unique"" sense of humor. Adults familiar with the game genre may find references to popular RPGs of the past. Children, however, are less likely to get the jokes. Furthermore, some of the jokes do reference sex in a mild fashion. Nothing is graphic. Alcohol, like in old games such as the Bard's Tale, is also referenced. The adult topics don't really go beyond PG-13 but be aware this is not for a little child. I would definitely block it from my four year olds Kindle time.What I am thrilled about most, though, is that there are no IAP, no intrusive ads popping up and no requests from the game that last after closing the app. Usually, when I see ""Guidance Suggested"" in an app, it is because the app offers IAP or sends the player through a button to a web site to buy other games, or else offers a way for the player to share info. I did not see any reference of any of these in this game. It is simply a fun game with a quirky sense of humor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCHE4QBAYQWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQR26EC#wasThisHelpful","RHCHE4QBAYQWC","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All the kids, ages 4 - 16 enjoy playing this game. It is an endless runner game similar to Temple Run, but with the minions from Despicable Me. You get to venture through several different areas found in the movie and collect bonuses for upgrades by running into other minions, bananas, and even unicorns.It is a cute game that has challenges for the older kids and is easy to pick up and play for the younger ones. This is definitely worth the download. My only recommendation, though, is that you turn off the in app purchases before giving it to a child. This is a free game, but there are in app purchases to help you upgrade faster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LYRC2JL0XZBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJFIMW6#wasThisHelpful","R2LYRC2JL0XZBN","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son loved the first Angry birds Star Wars (and so did I - but I haven't gotten nearly as far as he has ;)  ) and he thinks this one is even better. He has spent at least an hour on the game in one sitting and plans to return to it tomorrow when the Kindle recharges.The game is set in the prequel trilogy - and in this game, you can be either good or bad. Different characters have different abilities so you get to use different birds to attacks the familiar walls.This game offers several hidden levels, as well as hidden characters, however, my son has not found them yet...but he plans to work on it.I highly recommend getting this game. If you can get it for the FAOTD, do so, but if not, it is still worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I54N2WHUT7T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8GYC1Y#wasThisHelpful","R2I54N2WHUT7T9","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great app that lets preschoolers take the chance to drive ..over lakes, buildings, and other objects. The actual ability to steer is not too easy for my 4 year old, but the concept of the app was picked up very quickly. She designed her own driver (you can choose a boy or girl) and then select a map. There is one already designed so it is easy to start nearly immediately.She loves playing this and will likely play it regularly.I did not find any intrusive permissions or problematic spyware/adware, so combining this with the high interest from the child in the target age range, I give it 5 stars! If you see this as a FAOTD, it is definitely worth the download. If it is no longer offered as a free app, it is still worth buying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OMLGIYCN5LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G118LYY#wasThisHelpful","R18OMLGIYCN5LF","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this app gets 4 stars automatically being a kid-friendly app without any annoying hidden permissions.On its own merit, it is a good book app that does a great job of keeping children's attention. My 4 years old loves this and has played with it, then come back to play with it again later. The story is like the movie and is easy to follow along as it is read out loud. I believe it also lets you read the story yourself, but since she doesn't yet know how to read, the only setting I have seen has been the one where the book is read automatically.So, for being a good story overall and a safe kid app, I give it 5 stars. Definitely get this if it is the FAOTD, but even buy it if it is a paid app and you or your kids like the Smurfs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N34L6R1VBQ3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EA8F7ZG#wasThisHelpful","R1N34L6R1VBQ3Z","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Hidden Picture Puzzles, so a free Christmas-themed HOG was perfect! However, the game is very repetitive. You look for three types of hidden pictures - in one list, you see a list of the names of the missing objects, in another, you see the outlines/shadows of the objects, and in the third version you get clues to finding the missing objects. There are a few mini games and a plot that doesn't really fit. Also, the music, which I would expect to be public domain Christmas carols, is rock music?? It feels like parts were done by several different people who didn't realize they were all working on one Christmas-themed game. It is fun for a while, so feel free to try it out, especially if it is the FAOTD, but I will likely remove it from my device in a few hours, once I finish the game. It does appear that it will take more than a day to finish the entire game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FPL6IXTI0FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AE6SS5O#wasThisHelpful","R30FPL6IXTI0FZ","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read several reviews stating the controls don't work on the Kindle but it appears the developers have addressed this issue. I had no problems (other than my ""mom lack of video game skills"") in playing the game.It is a well-designed racing game. Instead of the typical track, you get to race on water in some very fast boats. I liked the overall designed of the game and the look. You can unlock special boats with better racing abilities. You can also earn achievements for various skills, and can compete in the leaderboard on Game Circle.Personally, I don't care for this sharing of scores since it opens up network sockets that can leave your device open to other files also being downloaded (for example, your personal info and contacts, possibly our passwords), but this particular game does not seem to be set up to do any of that. I did not get any virus messages in the download. However, since I don't like this open exchange, potentially without my permission or knowledge, in the background, I dropped a star.The game itself, though, is very fun. I probably won't play it much since I crash... a lot.... but my sons will love it. They will enjoy competing against each other and trying to get all the achievements completed, while unlocking the boats.Overall, definitely worth the FAOTD download.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY6Y26LKQWNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GKHE6G#wasThisHelpful","R2JY6Y26LKQWNC","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never played this with cards, but the tutorial in the Android version makes it very easy to understand and play. You take turns with each person or computer player placing tiles on the board to connect land and roads while placing people on tiles with these features as well as farms and cloisters to earn points. There is both strategy and luck involved, making this a great board game.The AI players were challenging and encouraged me to think ahead a few turns to decide when to place a ""follower"" on the tile to score points. The computer tells you where legal turns can be made, so it does not take long to be able to pick up the game.I did not see any intrusive permissions and it plays well, whether with friends or alone.

"I've seen several people posting the problems associated with the hidden spyware, so I'm not going to make much of a comment except to state that, although it is present, the game will play if offline. However, the lack of a proper exit button means it will run in the background until you turn it off...so it may be running when you do not realize it after you decide to turn the wireless connection of your device on.The game itself needs much, though. The idea that ""sums"" is a category would indicate it is addition practice, however, the problems actually require practice in addition and subtraction, with a few multiplication facts thrown in. This is the basic level category. In order to practice the other topics, you first need to pass this. So, when I got this to help my son practice his times tables, it took several minutes just to unlock that ""level."" If this is meant to practice math skills, all of the practice lesson topics should be available. If the developer wants to unlock levels, the levels should be more challenging ones.When you do succeed, there is not much fanfare. The graphics are very minimal, almost as though you are typing on a calculator..except there is no backspace so if you press one number incorrectly, you have to clear the entire entry and start over. Admittedly, this may only be one or two digits, but I personally find it annoying.If you want to take a look at it, I highly recommend doing so today since it is a FAOTD, but if you have to pay for this, look elsewhere for a math facts practice app.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7Q1S2FDFL55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGYCGZK#wasThisHelpful","R2F7Q1S2FDFL55","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was a cook book app where I would have interactive recipe info. It would be nice to see recipes with the ability to see how each ingredient offsets a particular ""bad"" food (lowering salt needs, reducing fat, etc.), but this is really nothing more than an app to link to other websites. I could have quickly searched for any of these recipes online without paying for this app. I'm not really sure if the developer got permission to link to these sites, but assuming he/she did, it is still not an app worth more than a dime. You really have access to all of these recipes for free if your phone/ tablet has the ability to access the internet...and it must or else you couldn't download the Amazon store. As a result, it earns a total of 2 stars.Furthermore, be aware there are some permissions that allow the app to work in the background and give permission for information exchange when you are not even using the app. This might simply be downloading ads, but why does it need ads in a paid app? Unfortunately, it may also be trying to get your info. Regardless of the reason, I don't see a need for it.

"First, I want to say that I ran antivirus and anti ad programs and neither picked up anything bad in this app. Next, I was able to play it without connecting to the internet. It is possible the people who are experiencing an issue are dealing with the Amazon Store requirements. All the apps you buy here ""check in"" every now and then to verify they were legally purchased. You will know that is the case since NONE of your Amazon apps will work until you connect to the Internet. However, if you are only using one or two, it might not be as apparent.As for the game itself, I thought it would be another Flow Free game (which is what I wanted since I'm running out of levels, and so are my kids ;) ) but it has a twist. There are no special colors to connect. Instead, you turn paths to connect the wires from the houses to the ""power company."" I like the twist.The only reason I am deducting a star is because the info in the description on Amazon states there are over 1000 puzzles and there are 9x9 grids. I did not see any 9x9 grids and it appears to only have 270 or so levels. If the harder levels need to be unlocked, then that should be stated somewhere, but I don't see a 9x9 grid list of puzzles with any ""lock"" logo, so I don't think that is the case.Overall, this is a fun game that everyone can enjoy - even off of the Internet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT6087II8K4U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFYAELM#wasThisHelpful","RT6087II8K4U8","AUA6NLJQYT56Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUA6NLJQYT56Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter is a fan, and I have to say that for the most part I’m impressed.  The pieces all fit together nicely and securely, and the design here is flashy, colorful and fun.  The doll is a bit too big for the tea-cup seats, which was a cool idea but poorly thought out.  That being said, I love the way that most of the pieces all become a part of the actual playhouse (if you call it that) and so they become window dressing as well as play pieces, which makes packing it away in the room easier to do as well.  These Ever After High dolls are all the rage now, and they’re quite expensive, so this little pack, while pricey, feels oddly cheaper in retrospect, since Raven Queen is included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WCLHI7Z4BOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03U6A2#wasThisHelpful","R10WCLHI7Z4BOE","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I’m not sure how much substance is here, but it’s a set-up for an obvious series, so hopefully they’ll be able to create something fun here, and the idea/concept has promise.  The characters are interesting, and the adventure presented here is fun from a child’s level.  I do wish that some of these kid’s books wouldn’t make avoiding parents and avoiding being responsible so commonplace though.  I mean, kids love to imitate what they see, and there is some stuff here that I definitely DON’T want my kid to repeat.  That said, she liked this and we’ll see where the second book takes us.

"I feel bad for ‘Selma’.  Initially intended for a 2015 release, the post-production was pushed through in a seemingly weak year and the hype machine built this film as the socially important film of the year and immediately the faith the studio had in its Award’s chances started to seep into the prognosticators fingertips and, before it was shown to the world, it became the film to beat.  Then it was seen and reviewed and the response to the film was tepid, to say the least.  The social relevance was obviously seen and the importance of the message was heard loud and clear and yet, the film itself wasn’t warmly embraced.  Then Oscar season heated up and the word ‘racist’ started getting thrown around and the fight for this film became ugly, even though it had no chance to pull a win away from the two clear frontrunners.  When the nominations were announced, and ‘Selma’ managed the BP nom and…a Song nomination, the film in a way became a joke.  Its BP status was immediately questioned (no writing, directing, acting…not even a costume nod!) due to the fact that it was clear it wasn’t really liked that much.  This was a case of ‘we nominated you here because we had to’ and not a case of ‘we think you were one of the best films of last year’ and because of that, ‘Selma’ kind of has this stigma around it.Like I said, I feel bad for ‘Selma’.  I was one of exploited that stigma after the nominations were announced.I’ve seen the film now (I hadn’t seen it then) and at the end of the day, the fact remains that ‘Selma’ was not one of the best films from 2014.It’s also not a joke, which is why the whole Oscar BP nom, in a way, hurts this movie.  If the film had just been regarded for what it was (or given the extra few months to hone and develop better and then been released, as intended, in 2015), then I think the film itself would have a better reputation.  Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.But enough about all that, let’s talk about the movie.‘Selma’ does not tell the life story of Martin Luther King, Jr.; it tells the story of the marches, led by King, in 1965 to fight for equal rights in Alabama.  Chronicling just a few months, the focus here is much tighter and direct than one may initially expect, and because of that the story told carries a heavier, more secure weight.  Biopics can be tricky when they attempt to cover too much ground, and so while I feel like King’s story deserves a complete film, I understand the decision to keep this story more centrally compact (and Spielberg has exclusive film rights to King’s entire story, I believe).My issue with ‘Selma’ is this; when the film has its lens off of the actual marches, it lags.There is such intensity and brutality conveyed in those marches that the rest of the film can’t compete.  It feels stuffy and longwinded and laborious, and so it starts to completely lose an audience, only to be shaken at its core by these electrified sequences of violence and injustice.  I’m shocked at how monotone so many scenes felt, because the material really could have sustained the intensity or at least the energy if it had been handled better.  Instead, everything from the cinematography to the framing to the performances (Ejogo and Wilkinson aside) felt stilted and unmoving.  Even Oyelowo, who commanded those monologue moments, gets lost in a sea of ‘mellow’.But those marching sequences are astonishingly well directed, crafted, framed and edited.This is a shame to me, because this story is so socially important.  I wish that DuVernay had been allowed more time to edit and compose this film, for maybe with that extra time she could have compiled a film that felt for alive, but unfortunately the heartbeat of the film was lost in the finished product.  If the media circus had left this film alone, it would have skated through Oscar season without a single nomination and it may have been regarded as a handsomely mounted portrait of an important man, but the unfair criticisms heaped upon a voting body have tainted this film forever.The biggest shame about all this is that Tom Wilkinson’s scene stealing performance as Lyndon B. Johnson was soured by ridiculous controversy and thus excluded from the Award’s race early on, since his performance is the best in the film and was truly deserving of any Oscar attention it could have received.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNMX3RQ75HTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMF8SEK#wasThisHelpful","R2HNMX3RQ75HTW","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chris Kyle murder trial was a huge deal near me.  It took place roughly 40 minutes from my house, and so that is all I heard about for months.  The murder itself was a big deal, but after the movie it was like our whole area capitalized on the success of the film in order to make this trial is BIG DEAL.  Regardless of your thoughts on war itself, there is no denying that Chris Kyle’s story is not only a fascinating one, but a profoundly poignant one.  I will never hide my neutrality.  I hate warfare and find it to be an unnecessary means and I am NOT ok with the way that this particular war transpired and progressed, but that is no disrespect to the men and women who lay their lives on the line for something they believe in.  Granted, not all are there for the right reasons (I literally had to sit at dinner for a week on a cruise with strangers, one of which was a marine, and hear them talk about how the only reason they would want to go to war would be to kill people), but for those who are there for a just cause, I can’t fault them their convictions.Chris Kyle seems to have been there for the right reasons.Still, ‘American Sniper’ takes those best of intentions and helps us to see why war is such a disastrous ‘means to an end’.  I only wish that it had developed those themes a little tighter.Chris Kyle was a legend.  He was known as Legend thanks to his kill count as a sniper for the US Army as a Navy SEAL.  The saying goes that there are some things you can’t un-see.  My grandfather fought in World War II and spoke many times of the things he saw when he closed his eyes (one such story, of lampshades made with human skin, haunted my childhood), and so, as Kyle’s story is told, we can see in his eyes the things he’s reliving, the things he’s still seeing.  As Kyle spends his time on his tours we see his personality change, and this makes coming home all the more difficult, because these are all things he takes with him.  His reaction to his fellow soldiers after a kill says it all.  While at first he’s filled with a hesitant pride (“What did I just do?  I can’t believe that was me.”), his demeanor eventually portrays an inner self-loathing and almost guilt (“What did I just do?  I can’t believe that was me.”).For me, ‘American Sniper’ is on the cuff of greatness, but loses sure-footing with a lack of focus.  By continually switching from Kyle’s time in the trenches so-to-speak to his time at home, the core of this story doesn’t have time to fully develop.  That internal struggle that Kyle undergoes when he’s home isn’t given the due attention it deserves, and the finale loses almost all momentum as the ending gets a ‘tacked on’ treatment that undercuts the impact it could have had.  I’m not suggesting anything like showing the murder, because it’s too new, too fresh to be an appropriate thing to show, but Kyle’s own emotional turnaround isn’t given the attention it deserved.  His shift from introverted and depressed to ‘filled with purpose’ and happy was too swift.  It basically happened within the confines of a single scene, and so it felt underdeveloped.  I take that back; it didn’t ‘feel’ underdeveloped, it WAS underdeveloped.This, for me, was a real shame.While I understand the importance of the war scenes, and some of them were absolutely stellar in their technicality, they became redundant in many ways and could have been trimmed, some even excluded altogether, in order to focus more on what Kyle was going through at home.  The front end and back end of the film were in dire need of more development.  The relationship with his wife Taya was also painfully underdeveloped, and while Sienna Miller (what a comeback she’s having) delivers some heartbreaking moments, she felt like a plot point to me, like a character that was exploited for her tears (notice how just about every scene she’s in, save her introduction, she’s crying) and dramatic effect.The savior of this film, surprisingly, is Bradley Cooper, who delivers his most mature and defined work to date.  I am not his biggest fan, and I’ve made that clear before, but here he completely derailed me.  He does so much with the underdeveloped lines in the screenplay, coloring in every single scene he’s in (which is nearly every single scene) with this complete understanding of Kyle’s emotional development.  You feel his shifts, even when the script refuses to define them.  His eyes KILLED me.And be forewarned: Eastwood GOES THERE with this, presenting some startling images and scenes that almost feel too far (the child killing is brutally extreme) but represent the realities of war with crushing detail.So, in the end I admire what Eastwood was trying to do here.  He presented a story that underscores the atrocities of war without being a direct advocate against it.  It’s a film that can appeal to both sides of the coin, giving those who are pro-war the stirring feeling of a united brotherhood and the passions of protecting the country we love and also giving the anti-war advocates the crushing realism that causes us to take the stance we have taken.  It isn’t partial, bias or preachy (which is not what I was expecting, to be honest).  It just tells its story.I just wish that it had told it a little deeper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GXP5K8P9X5PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGZ94SG#wasThisHelpful","R1GXP5K8P9X5PO","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s compact, sturdy and traditionally attractive (it’s not ugly, just plain), this little stepstool is exactly that, a step.  I’m not sure how much use this will ever get, since its height is so limited.  I really wasn’t expecting something so small, but I guess that’s alright for cleaning the tops of things (maybe).  Like I said, this is a mere step, for some not even a step.  It also has a 300 pound limit, so weigh that out before purchase.  The stool itself folds up nicely and has the non-slip grip on the feet, which will keep this in place nicely as well.

"We all remember when the nominees for the 2014 Academy Awards were being read off to us and we got to the Animated Film category and…no one heard the name ‘The LEGO Movie’.  Actually, you may not remember it.  You see, the film was heavily considered the frontrunner to such an extreme that I personally didn’t notice the snub until a few minutes later when I was compiling my list of the nominees and I noticed I didn’t type ‘The LEGO Movie’ down in the list.  I did a double take, looked it up, and low and behold, it was indeed snubbed.Outrage ensued.I, personally, was pretty upset about it.  I was upset because I had seen three of the actual nominees (‘How to Train Your Dragon 2’, ‘The Boxtrolls’ and ‘Big Hero 6’) and while I liked all of them to a certain extent (some more than others), ‘The LEGO Movie was a notch above the rest.  I was NOT upset because ‘The Tale of the Princess Kaguya’ and ‘Song of the Sea’ were nominated.  I had not seen those films, but I had read the raves, and I have no problem with foreign films sneaking in anywhere, so that was not a problem for me at all.  It was the American films I took issue with.But, a lot of people didn’t look at it that way.  Did you happen to read the ‘Brutally Honest Oscar Voters’ comments from that year.And I quote:“…for that movie not to be in over these two obscure freakin’ Chinese f***in’ things that nobody ever freakin’ saw, that is my biggest b***.”Ignorance people, ignorance.  I absolutely hate ignorance, but when  it comes from your craft then I hate it even more.  These are Oscar voters, which means they work or have worked in the industry.  Have some class.  Honestly, it shows that these voters consider Animated Films to be lesser works that are to be judged by their children (one voter actually stated that she let her children decide the winner) and not judged on the merit of what they contribute as a standalone film, and this is a shame.Here’s the thing; ‘Song of the Sea’ is a better film than ‘The LEGO Movie’.  This isn’t a knock on ‘The LEGO Movie’ a film I found endlessly entertaining and extraordinarily clever, but ‘Song of the Sea’ is pretty close to absolute perfection and, in a just world, would have won the Oscar (I still haven’t seen ‘The Tale of the Princess Kaguya’).‘Song of the Sea’ tells the story of Ben, a young boy who loves his mother dearly, but on the eve of his sister’s birth his mother disappears in quite the tumultuously mysterious way, and so Ben has grown to nearly despise his younger sister, Saoirse.  But there is something special about Saoirse.  You see, she’s the last of the selkies.  If you aren’t familiar with selkies, they are basically Irish mermaids, creatures of folklore that are seals who transform into beautiful women.  The film then follows Ben and Saoirse as they journey to undo a curse placed on her people and free them once a for all, in the process saving Saoirse’s life, as she struggles to survive without her coat (in Irish folklore, a selkie sheds her seal coat when she becomes a human, but needs it in order to survive).I’m personally quite fascinated by selkies.  I love that kind of fairytale, and I’ve seen a few wonderful films that have touched upon the subject.  ‘Song of the Sea’ is the best that I’ve seen.  It has such a beautiful way of being both magical in scope and yet so intimate and honest in texture.  The way it touches upon the bitter and consuming aspects of grief is so heartbreaking, whether it be the way that Ben and Saoirse’s father, Connor, becomes a mere shell of a man in the wake of his wife’s disappearance, or the way that it was one man’s uncontrollable sadness that caused his mother to curse the land in order to spare him (and herself) the continued grief.  It also shows how grief can be overcome and can be used to make us stronger, to help us love deeper and appreciate what we do have.  And let’s not forget the beautiful tale of the bond between siblings here, which is so touching, so moving, so heartwarming.Not only is ‘Song of the Sea’ a profound piece of storytelling, but it’s a visual wonder.  The animated here is truly transfixing, with complex and spellbinding sets and a range of details that light up the screen.  The scope of this animation is astonishing.  And the music, oh the music.  The rich Irish musicality complete with some stunning Original Songs by one of my personal favorite singers, Lisa Hannigan, bring such life, spirit and culture to this brilliant film.So, ‘The LEGO Movie’ should have been nominated for the Oscar; no doubt.  I’m in agreement with you there.  BUT, it should not have been at the expense of this cinematic wonder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWZVVJWLGK1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVDRPI4#wasThisHelpful","R2IWZVVJWLGK1I","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michel Gondry has directed one of my Top Three favorite films of all time; ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’.  I’m starting to feel like Gondry is a one-hit wonder.  I haven’t seen ‘The Science of Sleep’, although the reviews left me cold and I never felt drawn to it.  I did see ‘Be Kind Rewind’, which was…interesting.  It was fun, but it also felt forgettable.  ‘The Green Hornet’ had some sharp moments, but overall it was a thankless film.  I never even knew ‘The We and the I’ was made, so I guess I’ll need to check that one out (or will I?), and then we have ‘Mood Indigo’, a film that didn’t get very good reviews but managed to snag my attention with the visual look of the film.So I was excited to see Gondry excite me again.He didn’t.While ‘Mood Indigo’ is a stunning visual treat (albeit purposefully tacky in some spots), the film itself is the wrong kind of whimsy and winds up being a completely forgettable (and somewhat draining) experience.  It took a near forty minutes for me to even begin to care about this film.  The first twenty minutes or so was so intendedly bizarre and pointless that I found myself literally checking out.  I didn’t care.  It was quirky without purpose and so, in the end, was just silly.The prose is one that I actually found endearing.  I love adult fairytales and I love bizarre, and Gondry had such success with a whimsical adult fairytale before (like, that really is what ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’ is) and so I thought the idea of a woman with a flower growing in her lungs and the desperate attempt by her lover to find a cure sounded so…fresh and exciting.  Visually, the film is.  The sets, the cinematography, the colors and lighting and the musical accompaniments are so exciting…but the movie itself is just a chore.Romain Duris is pretty awful here, Audrey Tautou (who I loved that one time…you know the time) was just kind of there (she’s so pretty, but you have to give me more than that) and Omar Sy is just kind of hard to watch (awkward), but really, I blame Gondry for doing everything wrong with this premise.  The screenplay is just plain bad.And this is where I’m seeing a trend in Gondry’s missteps.  His Oscar winning masterpiece was written by the brilliant Charlie Kaufman (Gondry had story ideas, but Kaufman penned the screenplay).  Gondry penned ‘The Science of Sleep’, ‘Be Kind Rewind’, ‘The We and the I’ and he adapted ‘Mood Indigo’.  Maybe Gondry’s problem is that he has great ideas and no idea how to craft them in a clever and profound way.  His films apart from Kaufman lack a feeling of depth of importance.  They lack real substance.  They are just there, and when they’re not there, they’re gone.They don’t linger.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HIIW7GVQDW6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQVSE22#wasThisHelpful","R2HIIW7GVQDW6A","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liv Ullmann.  What a tremendous actress.  She was the muse of the great auteur Ingmar Bergman, and she earned that status by repeatedly delivering complex and shattering performances in films like Face to Face, Scenes from a Marriage, Autumn Sonata and Persona.  She is, without question, one of the greatest actresses who ever walked the earth.Did you know she’s also a director?Yeah, I knew this, and yet I still haven’t seen any of her work (she’s only directed 3 feature films, a segment in another film, a documentary and a television movie), until now.  Yes, my introduction to the world of Liv Ullmann ‘the director’ was with this little-seen (or is it just widely ignored) adaptation of ‘Miss Julie’.I prefer Liv Ullmann ‘the actress’.When ‘Miss Julie’ arrived in the mail, my wife and I were both pretty excited.  We are both big fans of Colin Farrell.  My wife has been impressed with Jessica Chastain, or at least what she’s heard of her talent (my wife has actually only seen Chastain in ‘The Help’ and ‘The Tree of Life’, and she fell asleep five minutes into Malick’s film so she probably doesn’t even remember that Chastain was in it).  I adore Samantha Morton (she really should be in everything) and of course, as I mentioned, I’m a giant fan of Ullmann.  Throw them all in a period piece, add sexual tension and the promise of romantic angst and you have our attention.You had our attention, until you lost it.I have many, many issues with this film that all really seem to blur into one gigantic problem.  This is my first encounter with the story as well, so maybe I’ll take issue with every version of the story as well (I have the 1951 Sjoberg version on my DVR at the moment), but I’m holding out hope that Ullmann just messed up royally, because I see so much potential squandered.My problem, as my review title suggests, is that these characters are so incredibly unstable and unbearably tonally challenged that the whole film feels like absolute ridiculousness.  The unabashed scenery chewing is so aggressive and in-your-face that it strips away any real character development and presents to an audience a barrage of ‘emotions’ with no actual substance.  There is no connection or chemistry between any of these actors and so all their actions feel forced and unauthentic.  Chastain is abysmal here, yelling and heaving and clutching things and then trying her hardest to be all ‘stern and commanding’ and coming off like a child playing house.  She isn’t convincing at all, and in many instances she’s just downright embarrassing.  Farrell fares better, but the way his character is handled is baffling.  He appears innocently manipulated and then completely taken over by unexplained or really perplexed passions and then conniving and heartless, and then back and forth and back and forth again.  It was like his character completely changed with each passing scene.  And then you have poor Samantha Morton, who lingers in each scene like an unwanted step-child, sulking in the background with her downtrodden expression that gives the appearance of a woman with severe mental problems.  The fact that Farrell is probably the best he’s ever looked in the film, and Morton is at her absolute frumpiness, doesn’t help this situation, since their ‘love’ never appears genuine.  It’s not like Chastain looks any better (like, hot mess, for real), but the attractions are just unbelievable all around.This all makes for a film, story, whatever, that I couldn’t honestly care less about.  I wanted to, but I believed nothing and by the time it was through I was really hoping that a massive fire was going to break out and everyone was going to die.Oh, and I know I fell asleep during part of this, because my wife told me something about gangsters, and I have no idea what she’s talking about, but I have no desire to watch this again and find out.When this ended, my wife said to me that this was the worst movie she’s ever seen.  I’m almost obliged to agree with her.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EKOPN6C7Q2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV6BA9E#wasThisHelpful","R35EKOPN6C7Q2J","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We don’t use this as a phone.  My daughter has been given this phone to use as a camera and for music.  She’s too young for a phone, in my opinion, and so I see no need for her to get a plan or a number yet, but she’s been begging for a camera and this gives her an easy way to take pictures with her friends and chronicle her days.  For what she’s using this for, this works well.  The battery life is insane.  My daughter is on this constantly, taking pics and listening to music and playing games and it lasts her all week.  It’s a nice size, fun display screen, takes good pics and has a lot of nice features that will eventually transition into a nice phone in the future.  I will note that the phone froze, apparently for no reason, the other day and was an absolute pain to restart and correct.  It took a good five minutes to get the phone to actually turn off and restart, but once it did the issue was resolved.

"First, a disclaimer:The packaging was so poor that this nearly completely leaked out in the box and arrived to me near-empty.  So, word of caution, don’t order this one online.  Buy it in the store, where you can drive it home without spilling it all over the place.The box smelled ridiculously strong though, like overwhelmingly strong, and while I do note that that is mostly due to the almost the entire contents of the bottle leaking out (to the point where it was actually leaking out of the box and the mail-lady wrapped this in a plastic bag and dumped it on my front porch), I still have to say that this left an awfully strong smell in left in my house.  We had to open doors and windows to air it out, it was so strong (headache strong).What little was left in the bottle was a nice texture on the hands and left the hands feeling clean and smooth even, but that lavender smell is overwhelming, and for the price I’d expect more; much more.  At $20 a bottle, and with all the mentions of natural ingredients, it contains a lot of ingredients that aren’t very…natural, and so for that I find this to be a waste of money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N7OM1YPCZQYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I06ZXPS#wasThisHelpful","R3N7OM1YPCZQYJ","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fame, stardom, celebrity, immortality; these are things that many, many people dream of attaining.  To be considered legend, to attain unending youth and be a beacon of joy, hope and entertainment for the masses for an indefinite amount of time; who doesn’t want that?  With the stars of today (and of yesteryear), the only way to attain such immortality was to aspire to being a part of something that would, in due time, become classic and beloved.  This is the only way to assure that their legacy, their stardom, would live on.In that sense actors like Marlon Brando and Vivian Leigh are immortal.In Ari Folman’s semi-animated film, ‘The Congress’, the theme of stardom and immortality is broached from a bold new vantage point.  Here, Robin Wright is playing herself.  She’s the same famed actress she is in real life, but she’s also facing the obvious fact that she is not a young starlet anymore and despite the fact that she’s been in a few well received (and semi-beloved) films, she’s somewhat considered washed up.  Her career is at a brick wall that she may not be able to get through.  This is when she’s given a proposition.  Sell your likeness, your being, to the studios so that they can use you in any film without restriction and in this way you will be compensated duly and, in many respects, become immortal.  She will be forever young.  She will be a true star because she can, and will, be everywhere; all things to all people, and in the meantime she will be able to live her life separate from the harsh realities of celebrity, care for her sick child and enjoy her life.Sign on the dotted line.Then the years pass by, her fame rises and her contract nears expiration, and so Robin travels to The Congress Convention, where she is to contemplate renewing her contract, only to have her world thrown into complete disarray as she starts to debate, question even, the morality of what she’s done.‘The Congress’ asks a lot of questions between the lines, but there is something that leaves me feeling like the film is somewhat underdeveloped.  It doesn’t feel complete in the sense that I would have liked it to.  While it contains some great ideas, it doesn’t quite tackle them in a manner that feels fully answered.  The struggle to decide whether our free will, our freedom of choice, is worth losing for the longevity of a career, of a name, is given light, but in the final frames it never feels wholly fleshed out.  Instead, ‘The Congress’ feels like a lot of ideas tossed into a pot that is never quite stirred enough for them to all mesh together and become one.And yet, there is a beauty to ‘The Congress’.  Wright delivers a tender and thoughtful performance, and Keitel (who isn’t used enough) shatters in one of the most absorbing and outstanding scenes of the film year.  The score is simply perfect, soaring in all the right areas and lifting the film it remarkable heights.  And like I said, there is a commendable complexity and relevance to the themes presented here, even if they don’t always come together how I’d like.It’s intriguing and thought provoking, which is what cinema should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9SDOLL8A92O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LOCLD2W#wasThisHelpful","R9SDOLL8A92O5","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Uno is a game my kids like to play, but my youngest has a hard time with it and so we thought that maybe this version would make it easier for her to grasp and be more fun for her to play.  The game is fun; brisk but fun.  It takes just a few minutes, sometimes less, to play, considering that there is no real challenge here.  You are matching faces and colors, colors of which are visible to every other player, and so the person that goes before you can pretty much force a brisk game by playing to every other player’s hand, or they can force a victory by purposefully causing you to draw…and draw…and draw.  Still, the setup is nice and the packaging is something my kids find fun, so there is that, and they did like to play this a lot for the first week.  It, sadly, does not have the same replay value as the original version of the game, and so this has been sitting in a closet for the better half of a month without anyone asking to get it out.

"There is a saying that ‘it’s not the story you tell but how you tell it’, and for me, ‘Two Days, One Night’ is a perfect proof of that.  There is an extreme simplicity about this story, some could even say that the simplicity is almost skeletal, but the way that the Dardenne brothers have told it (and, really, how Marion Cotillard has told it) is so earnest, so honest and so rich that this simple tale becomes much more; so much more.  It’s odd to say that a film that is practically a repetition of scenes with different faces can be so enthralling, but at a brisk 95 minutes, ‘Two Days, One Night’ packs in SO MUCH character development in those repetitions scenes that it remains one of the most effecting films I’ve seen in all of 2014.The story told centers around Sandra.  Sandra has recently suffered from a bout of depression that left her unable to function in life.  She took a leave from work, and it’s apparent that her husband has taken most, if not all, of the household duties upon his own shoulders, including taking care of the kids.  Finally feeling able to re-enter the world (and reliant on medication for that), Sandra is ready to return to work, only to find out that her workmates have elected to have her fired in order to receive their bonus.  Unfortunately, without her income, her family is going to suffer.  It’s already a struggle with both her and her husband working full time, and due to her time off they are in dire-straits.  With the prodding of her husband and close friends, Sandra decides to fight for her job, despite depression rearing its head again and urging her to just give up.  So, in an attempt to save her job and her family, Sandra gets the addresses of all her co-workers and sets out to talk to them all face to face and plead for them to reconsider their vote, giving up their bonuses so she can keep her job.And so she does…talk to everyone.For a film that repeats its scenario so much, the depth in Cotillard’s performance (is this even a performance?  I mean, it feels like home movies of a real woman) is so alarmingly acute that it keeps us completely glued to her journey.  Cotillard is, in a word, incredible here.Now, I debated bringing up this point, but I feel as though I really need to address it in order to really explain myself and my feeling towards this film.  So, for those of you who haven’t seen this, I am going to mention a minor spoiler (although I will NOT mention the outcome of her struggle) so just be forewarned.This film, for me, became something so incredibly special in the very last seconds, when a simple phrase (here we are with more simplicity) left Sandra’s lips; “I’m happy”.  With those words, this film and Sandra’s story become something so rich, so complete.  Having lived in a home with a woman experiencing deep depression, I understand how desolate one can feel, how empty and lost and helpless one can feel, even when they are without reason.  Sandra, broken to the core, wants to just give up on life, throw her hands in the air and walk away from this situation, her troubles, her struggle and inevitably, her life.  But, through the course of her own determination, no matter how forced, she found in herself a sense of self-worth.  She found a reason to continue, and so regardless of the outcome, she had found happiness.  I tell you, when those words left her lips I broke.  Tears were streaming down my face and I was shaking.  No two words have had such an incredible impact on me, cinematically, in a very long time.Within the confines of simplicity, the Dardenne brothers and the marvelous (like, greatest actress of all time) Marion Cotillard have delivered something far from simple; they have delivered absolute truth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLKMTO7SO8KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4JJCKK#wasThisHelpful","ROLKMTO7SO8KV","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the cover of the DVD for ‘The Two Faces of January’, it boldly declares that this film is from ‘The Producer of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, the author of The Talented Mr. Ripley and the writer of Drive’.  By that description, you’d expect this film to be outstanding.This raises the question; why doesn’t anybody know about this movie?The reason for that is because despite having a producer, writer and source that have all, in the past, created something memorable, exciting and iconic, together they produced something forgettable.  I’m not saying at all that it is a bad movie, because it’s actually pretty good, but it’s extremely forgettable.  There is nothing about this film that stays with you.  It’s all rather nice and yet…nice all too often gets lost in the shuffle.‘The Two Faces of January’ tells the story of Chester MacFarland (if that is your real name) and his wife Colette who are in Athens, pretending to be on vacation while in actuality they are hiding out from angry investors who are after Chester for stealing their money.  While in Athens, the couple runs into a young con-man, Rydal, who takes a liking to Colette and finds a way to squeeze himself into their lives.  Once he witnesses what he assumes is something rather innocent, Rydal becomes a major part of the MacFarland’s lives, and then things get dangerous.I just wish they felt more dangerous.You know that feeling you get when a film is going somewhere and yet you never really feel that urgency to follow it because it’s not really ‘going anywhere’?  That’s the feeling that ‘The Two Faces of January’ gives me.  It’s never wholly compelling, so despite some nice performances (Dunst is surprisingly dull here, but both Isaac and Mortensen are giving it their all) and some beautiful scenery, the film feels overly long and drool despite only being 90 minutes long.  It also fumbles some character development in the later half, pitting the two men against one another in a way that seems to set them up for some rich character analysis and then throwing it all out the window for a ridiculous finale (like, Chester would NOT have done that) that almost adds a campiness to the film, which was striving so hard to be taken seriously.I wonder how this story (which is interesting but nowhere near as compelling as Highsmith’s other stories) would have fared better in the hands of a director who understood how to build the tension it needed, but unfortunately first time director Hossein Amini isn’t up to that task.  It all feels very generic, one note and somewhat cheap; like a TV movie.  He has a range of writing credits to his name, most of which are actually impressive (he wrote ‘Wings of the Dove’, ‘Drive’ and ‘Jude’), but ‘The Two Faces of January’ marks his first time in the director’s chair.Maybe he should have stuck to penning the screenplay, and then passed the directing duties to someone with vision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QIEVZYT1C2DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLIIEZK#wasThisHelpful","R3QIEVZYT1C2DA","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you remember early 2002, when a certain “generic” biopic won the Oscar over the mega-popular one-two punch of ‘Moulin Rouge!’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring’?  It was inevitable, we all saw it coming (or we should have) and yet the months that followed brought scorn and resentment over the Oscar winner, scorn and resentment that are still heaped upon its back.  You see, I liked ‘A Beautiful Mind’.  I still do.  It’s a simple made film that follows some basic tropes that all biopics tend to fall into, and yet it was engaging and enjoyable and littered with interesting and beautiful performances.  Still, it’s a film that can be taken for granted and dismissed as ‘by the books’ and, as I noted above, generic.I never truly realized how good of a movie ‘A Beautiful Mind’ was until I sat down to watch ‘The Theory of Everything’.It had the comparisons running alongside it all year, many calling this 2014’s ‘A Beautiful Mind’, and it was clear why, for both films were essentially stories about brilliant men saddled with a disability (one mental, the other physical) who were saved by the love of a woman.  The difference is that ‘A Beautiful Mind’ actually has something to say.  While ‘The Theory of Everything’ is quite beautiful to look at and has a stunning (albeit obvious and at times distracting) score, but it also doesn’t tell us anything about the man in question, throws out jargon no one is going to pay attention to, and features two performances that are (while technically accurate and, at least for one, physically outstanding) quite boring and empty.If I knew nothing about Stephen Hawking before watching this, I’d know nothing more now, other than the fact that he got sick, fathered kids and didn’t believe in God (or did he?).‘The Theory of Everything’ seems pretty content with putting flashy filters all over every scene and regurgitating depictions of grief through showy edits (that call into question just how involved Redmayne’s ‘transformation’ really was) but never really settles down to tell us the story of this man, what he’s thinking, who he is…inside…apart from his crippling disability.  I understand that explaining to us Hawking’s lifework would have been hard, and it would have gone over many heads, but the point of a biopic isn’t really to explain a profession but an individual, and I feel as though Hawking, the man, is never cracked open for us.  We know nothing about him outside of the fact that he’s smart and awkward.  We learn a great deal more about his wife, Jane, but sadly Felicity Jones is so dreadfully dull in her delivery that she may as well have not even existed.At least when ‘A Beautiful Mind’ ended (which, by the way, is nowhere near as generic as it’s accused of being) I felt like I knew this man and I knew his wife and I felt their love and their support and I felt his pain and I felt his growth.  When ‘The Theory of Everything’ ended I felt nothing but the urge to eject the DVD.But it’s pretty, you know, visually.As far as Redmayne and his Oscar win are concerned, I get it.  I mean, from a physical aspect he really goes all out there and commands every movement, every physical deteriorating moment.  Like I said, some of the flashy edits call into question how far he went or if his performance was sliced, diced and spliced to create something that looked more incredible than it was; but regardless, he is convincing as a man suffering from ALS.  What he’s not convincing as is as a man.  There is nothing behind those eyes, no real character to explore.  It’s all surface, nothing genuine here.  Charlie Cox is the only person who really shines here.  Felicity Jones has the most fleshed out character but, like, she does nothing with it.I wanted to like this.  I mean, it was getting such a thrashing from so many people who were mad that Michael Keaton lost the Oscar, and so I was hoping that it was just vitiral and nothing really warranted.  Yeah, this movie is just empty and that bleeds into every aspect of the film.  Even the cinematography is overtly showy, pretty with no real substance, and the score, which is genuinely beautiful, is used to death in a way that makes it feel cheap; like it has nothing to say.That’s the problem here; this film has nothing to say.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CO9KWIKL7BZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFSIIFK#wasThisHelpful","R2CO9KWIKL7BZC","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I talk a lot about films about parenthood.  Being a father has changed the way that I look at things, and because I that I find a deep connection in the exploration of parenting, of fathers and mothers and even children because, in many ways, I feel as though I can relate regardless of the situation.  Even in depictions of situations that so clearly differ from my very own, I can find that kernel of universal truth that rings so clear.I had no idea that ‘Starred Up’ was even about a father/son relationship when I saw this, but…wow!‘Starred Up’ is a chaotic film, but not in the sense that you may assume given that description.  It’s extremely focused and makes a sharp point at being so, but it absorbs the atmosphere of the climate with which it festers and it explodes, scene after scene, in chaos; controlled and lingering chaos.  Within that chaos, there is raw, tender beauty; believe it or not.  In fact, ‘Starred Up’ is probably the one film that has grown so much for me since first laying eyes on it.  It’s a film that has rested in a way that swells in my heart, for it creeps up on you with a message that is so real, so invested that it makes an incredible impact.That finale...my god.‘Starred Up’ begins to tell the tale of Eric Love.  Eric is a teenager with a very violent history, and due to his reckless behavior he has been ‘starred up’, or transferred to an adult prison.  It is here that he becomes the center of attention for pretty much everyone in the wake of his storm, as his outlandish and abrasive attitude swirls around the halls and cells like a tornado.  At either side of this tornado are men who want to help Eric in their own way.  First, there is Eric’s father, Neville, a nasty man who personifies everything that Eric will eventually become if he doesn’t uproot his course and change.  Neville, despite his temperament and disposition, only wants to see Eric survive his stay.  Then, there is Oliver Baumer, a social worker who thinks that he can manage Eric and eventually help him change, reform.  Somewhere in the middle is Eric, a boy with almost no choice anymore but to accept the help he is so adamant to reject, because leering over every shoulder are people bent on getting rid of Eric, who is nothing but trouble.The beauty of ‘Starred Up’ is found in the moments when the chaos finally explodes to reveal hearts on sleeves.  Yes, hearts bleed, eventually, and these moments will last with the viewer long after the film has concluded.While I talk about the father/son relationship factor, and that factor is huge, it is also not exclusive to blood, for the relationship that forms between Eric and Oliver is almost like a blossoming adopted father/son relationship that rights all the wrongs in Neville’s approach and presents Eric with a perfected example of what it means to have ‘someone in your corner’.  With both of these relationships building, breaking and rebuilding before our eyes, we are told a tremendous story of shattered love rebuilt in a way that gives hope to the wayward; father and son.David Mackenzie’s direction is sharp, abrasive and impactful, but the film truly lives and breathes in the performances of its stars.  Rupert Friend and Ben Mendelsohn swirl around the protagonist with such fiery convictions, pushing and pulling and leading the way; but this is all about Jack O’Connell, who delivers a star making performance that shatters all expectations.  He goes there, just goes there so strongly, allowing the chaos to absorb him and propel him into the face of the audience.Chills.‘Starred Up’ is more than a prison drama.  This is a film about rebuilding family, about righting our wrongs, finding the folly of our ways and realizing that our actions can always be reformed for the betterment of tomorrow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQPQKISBHTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLYUA2S#wasThisHelpful","R3CQPQKISBHTS","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s hard to know how to review this book.  Because I’ve already seen the film, and absolutely loved it, I’m not sure how to separate the two, since the aspects of the film that struck me so strongly are aspects changed from the source, and while they share a common core, this is one of those instances where the film is better than the movie.That does not mean that this is a bad book, like at all.  It was thoroughly entertaining and really well written, from a storytelling perspective, and the themes addressed and characters explored are really well designed and explained, but for reasons I’ll get into in a moment, I felt like the restraints placed on storytelling from a cinematic medium served this story well; very well.The story told is one that is hard to explain without spoiling anything pertinent to the overall experience, but I will assure you of this, whether you have seen the film or not, but novel is still wholly enjoyable, even with the big ‘twist’ revealed (and visa-versa, since I knew the twist before seeing the film and it was still extremely effective).  Still, I’d hate to be the one to spoil anything, so I’ll just say this; Flynn’s story is that of a troubled marriage that is shaken to the core when the wife, Amy, winds up missing on the morning of their 5th wedding anniversary.  Nick, her husband, is left to piece together what happened, an apparent struggle and what looks like abduction written all over his home, and yet eventually clues left behind place him in the hot seat when he is perceived to be the guilty party.  What follows is a superbly conceived, yet not always superbly crafted, tale of marital unraveling and a rather astute take on the relationships that bind us.So, here is the long and the short of it; Gillian Flynn did herself and her story a massive favor when she gutted out the unnecessary, cut down on the obvious and altered, if ever so slightly, that ending.  I remember all the talk about the script changes when the film was in production, and many fans of the book were concerned about what the finished product would be.  What about the ending!?!?  I heard she made changes!!!!  What about Nick!?!?!  I heard he’s more sympathetic in the movie!!!!  Yes on both accounts and yet I’m so glad that she did.  During the whole awards run last year (where Flynn was disgustingly snubbed the Oscar nom for her tremendous screenplay), there was an interview with Flynn where she talked about adapting her own work, and she noted that as a screenwriter you need to take out all bias to your work and understand that not everything will fit into the confines of a film.  You have to take out things, things you may love.  You have to alter scenes to make them flow better within the scope of a film.  Not everything has room to breathe like it does on the page, when you can always add another page of explanation to make the last one make sense.  And so, with that in mind, Flynn got to work making ‘Gone Girl’ more cinematic, and in the process she made amendments that only helped bolster those core themes.Sure, some characters suffered (Andie and Nick’s father most notably) and yet others were saved altogether (surprisingly, Desi works far better on film than on the printed page, and I was not the character’s biggest supporter when I first saw the film), but the most important thing here is that the core characters, Amy and Nick, are given more depth in the choices Flynn made with her screenplay.My biggest issue with the book itself is that Nick and Amy, in many moments, feel like broad caricatures.  Yes, there is a lot of ‘extreme’ going on here, and the satirical nature of the way this story is told needs that, but on the printed page I felt like Flynn went almost too heavy with ‘on the nose’ references to set up these characters.  So much of what Amy but especially Nick were thinking made them feel like contradictions at times, and while I love the fact that these characters feel like victims and villains in almost a single breath, there is an absoluteness to some of what Flynn does here that laces these characters with a detachment I didn’t feel in the film.With the right amount of restraint, the right amount of subtlety (this book is far from subtle), Flynn was able to turn broad caricatures into living breathing representations of you and me and everyone we know.But this is where I feel like my coming at this from this particular vantage point is skewed or manipulated because of how much I loved the movie and, more specifically WHY I loved the movie.  For me, Fincher’s film said so much about marriage that we don’t often acknowledge, about the way that we manipulate relationships through lies and the way that we detach ourselves from others due to our reaction to discovering who these people really are.  While Flynn’s novel says those same things, it does so with a more definite hand, with a louder voice, and because of that it feels a little too…contrived.With that said, I still wholly loved this read.  It’s an extremely well written book in that it completely immerses you in the story, and Flynn’s writing style (and the brilliant way she constructed the book) is so unique and says so much about her talent.  She is a gem of a writer, and even more than a novelist, she’s a superb screenwriter, which is almost harder to do.So read the book and see the movie, in whichever order you would like, because they are both worth experiencing for what they bring to the table.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVSK8ZCXXUXML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307588378#wasThisHelpful","RVSK8ZCXXUXML","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m a good father.  I know this.  I don’t need anyone to tell me this for me to know it.  I’m also not a perfect father.  I know this.  I don’t need anyone to tell me this for me to know it.  Being a good father does not mean you are perfect.  In fact, I’m going to tell you a story.Two years ago, my family went on vacation.  We rented a boat and we went out on the ocean and we looked for dolphins and we floored it head on into waves and we just had a great time…until something happened.  The boat hit a swell and the whole front end was engulfed by the ocean.  It looked, for a brief moment, like we were going to sink.  My whole family was on this boat.  My wife, my daughters, my father and mother.  In a flash of panic, I did something wrong.  I ran to the other end of the boat.  I fled from the wave, leaving my wife and one of my daughters (who were seated near me) to get drenched completely.No one died.  It was false panic.  The boat flooded and then quickly was…unflooded (not a word, I know) and everyone was safe and sound, and my daughter who was completely soaked thought the whole experience was fun.Thankfully my wife laughed it off and didn’t make me feel awful about it.‘Force Majeure’ tells the story of a family, Tomas and Ebba and their two children, on holiday in France.  They are at a ski resort, taking on the slopes as a family.  One day, at lunch, the family experiences a ‘contained avalanche’ that, for a brief moment, looks like it’s not so contained and is about to kill everyone.  In a panic, Tomas flees.  He grabs his phone off the table and books it out of there, leaving his wife and children behind.  No one was hurt, everything was fine in the end, but the situation shakes this family to its core as Ebba starts to question her husband’s actions, picking at them, unnerved by them, feeling abandoned because of them, and this sends Tomas into a downward spiral of guilt and near madness as he starts to completely unravel.‘Force Majeure’ asks a lot of poignant questions about relationships and the way that we can perceive actions of others if we’ve never been in their shoes.  It’s so easy to dissect a mistake when we have a different reaction, and yet how would we feel if we were on the other end, if we were the one being dissected?What I took away from this film so completely was that I personally want to strive to give people the benefit of the doubt.  I’ve been there, sat back and analyzed another person, spoken against their actions, adopted my own assumptions about their nature and uttered those ridiculous words “well I would have done it differently”.  Yes, they are ridiculous words, because unless we have already done it differently, we don’t know that is what we would have done.  Situations, moments, are also always exclusive to one another.  A person who is heroic in one instance could, and most likely will, react differently in a similar circumstance because every single event is isolated and our reactions are always a result of various elements.  The film also shows how we can allow ourselves to become affected by other’s perception of us, allowing it to completely unravel us, even second guessing what we already know about our nature.  Tomas exits the situation unshaken, and yet as his wife starts to pick, dig, pry, accuse and attack, he starts to come undone.  He starts to believe her.  He starts to break apart, tearing at his own actions and feeling as though she is right and he is a failure.Another aspect of this film that I find alarmingly acute is the way that it attacks gender roles, or explores them through the attack of them, especially within the family dynamic.  Tomas is supposed to be the hero, the savior of his family, and in the eyes of his wife, he has failed.  Tomas is not afforded the opportunity for mistake because this is not the man he is supposed to be.  Even his own guilt is met with a near distain.  How dare he crumble…how dare he fall apart?But when the shoe is on the other foot…‘Force Majeure’ is a tremendous film that explores aspects of relationships that we often take for granted, we live with and push aside and never really stop and say “wait a second” because it’s a part of life.  We are expected to be a certain way, and when we fall off from that expectation, we are met with criticism.  The question remains; can you say for certain that you wouldn’t have done the same thing?You can’t.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZQFETWECTR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2WGOAA#wasThisHelpful","R1YZQFETWECTR8","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a parent sucks.I don’t even know if there are words that can fully explain all the ‘meanings’ in that statement I just made, but really, it truly sucks.  It’s the hardest, most heartbreaking, completely emotionally obliterating thing that anyone can go through, but the biggest reason it sucks is the fact that you asked for it.  You wake up every single day asking for more because the moment those kids are no longer in your life is the moment you just…die.‘Mommy’ tells the story of Die, or Diane, a single mother (her husband died three years ago) who loves her son, Steve, deeply.  She is foul-mouthed trailer-trash with a biting temper and a lack of a filter of any kind, but she loves her son, despite his flaws.  You see, Steve has problems.  When ‘Mommy’ starts, we are informed that Steve is being kicked out of a detention center for setting the cafeteria on fire, brutally injuring another ‘inmate’.  Steve has ADHD, but a very severe kind that leads to extremely violent and uncontrollable outbursts.  When we meet Steve, he shows no signs of remorse for his actions, which sent another kid to the hospital with possible third-degree burns.  Instead, he cursing at and physically assaulting the guards.  When he leaves with his mother by his side, it’s apparently he views her more like a chum, a pal, than an authority figure.  He’s joking with her and cursing at her and despite the nature of their relationship, all you see is love.  She loves him, deeply, and he loves her, deeply.  They just have a non-traditional way of showing it.Then something happens that changes the fabric of the film we think we’re watching.  Steve comes home baring gifts for his mother, and his mother is immediately skeptical as to how he attained those gifts, and after accusing him of stealing, Steve loses it.  Within seconds we see all the glee and jovial charisma that brushed Steve’s face upon handing his mother her new necklace fade away to expose a intense defensiveness that explodes in the form of brute force and complete domination over his mother.  He beckons her to hit him.  He hits himself, thrusting his body towards her, transforming into an animal, screaming at her and practically chasing her through the house, threatening her with physical violence.In this moment, we understand Die’s life, and we understand more fully her love.‘Mommy’ is a hard film to watch, at least for me it was.  I feel like a broken record when I say this, because I know that I’ve mentioned this a few times, but being a parent changes the way that you look at things, the way you feel things.  You look at things from the perspective of a parent and you can feel internally every emotion, every feeling that that parent is bound to be going through.  It doesn’t hurt that Anne Dorval delivers a tremendous performance as the conflicted Die, but regardless of her strength in conveying those feelings, as a parent we watch and develop our own.  Watching Die observe her son was one of the most heartbreaking cinematic moments for me in quite some time.  The way that she so earnestly desires for nothing but Steve’s happiness, the way she selflessly gives of herself and sacrifices her own wellbeing is so reaching, so captivating.  She’s a pill, and she parents in a way that many will find questionable or even distasteful and yet no one can tell you how to love your child, you just do, and in your own way, and in the way that you, as a parent, feel is best for that child.  No parent wishes for a child with special needs, whatever those needs turn out to be, but it happens, and you can either coil back in fear or you can meet those needs head on, and while Die may seem, to the critical observer, to be irresponsible, she knows her son and she is doing her very best, believe me.There is a moment when Die explains a parent’s love to her son.  She tells him that a parent never wakes up one day not loving their child.  She tells him that it is the other way around; that the child will start to love the parent less and less, but that a parent’s love only grows.When she said those words, my heart broke.‘Mommy’ illustrates beautifully the harsh reality of coming to terms with the real needs of a child and not merely what you want them to need.  As Die strives to be everything Steve needs, to mend his every wound, to fight his every battle, she eventually has to come face to face with the fact that she cannot do this alone, and even as she receives help and even a sense of balance and stability from an unlikely friendship with her neighbor, Kyla (another beautifully woven example of a mother trying her hardest to be what she needs to be), the writing is on the wall from the moment we adjust to the aspect ratio; this is a war Die can’t win.As Die’s worldview expands, her innermost desires for her life, for her son, start to blossom in her mind, her crushing reality flitters away and her heart is full and, as an audience, we become a part of her dream world where everything is right, where everything is as every parent wishes it would be; and then she comes to her senses and everything is stripped away from her and a part of you, as a sharer in her journey, dies.I don’t want to paint ‘Mommy’ as a soul crushing experience, even though a part of my soul has been literally crushed, because the ending note to ‘Mommy’ is one of such remarkably exposed and understood parental love that it is almost, as Die puts it herself, hopeful.  As Steve’s actions place him at risk of hurting himself (notice how Die never contemplates drastic measures when the only person at risk was herself), Die makes decisions that conflict with her own personal wants.  She has to learn to let go, and in the process she has to believe that here is hope, that her son will one day find the freedom, not mere physical freedom but emotional freedom, that he so richly deserves.  She has to believe that her choices are giving him the best possible chance at a healthy, productive and happy future, no matter how much pain he, and she, are going through at the present moment.She has to have hope, as does every parent, hope that they are doing the right thing.Any true great depiction of an artistic portrait of real life needs to have every facet working in harmony in order to achieve that overall sense of true, brutal honesty.  Xavier Dolan is fortunate that he had an incredible team working under his wing, giving him exactly what he needed to make this portrait perfect.  His actors, all of them, deliver such richly layered performances, especially his two leads.  Dorval’s exploration of a mother’s love is so heartbreakingly honest and grounded.  There are moments where she is just watching Steve, watching him interact with Kyla, watching him exude this happiness, and we see this undeniable calm rush over her face.  She finds a moment of peace in knowing that he is, for the moment, happy.  That is what it’s like to be a parent.  I know that feeling so well.  Clement is remarkable here as well, finding so many nuances within the fabric of Kayla’s situation.  We are never given the whole backstory for Kyla, but in the bits and pieces we gather from the details that Dolan puts into place and the layers Clement finds in every single breath she takes we are given a story that feels whole, feels complete.But, for me, the performance of this film belongs to Antoine-Olivier Pilon.  At just seventeen years old, Pilon delivers the most complex, organic, moving and brutally honest character portrait of the decade.  This was such a difficult performance to pull off, one that really needed the right touches to steer it clear of a gimmick, and Pilon found all of these.  He makes everything feel so grounded in this sense of absolute reality that you feel his every tonal shift.  He’s so natural.  His furious rages, his tactless cackling, his moody pouting, his reckless abandon, his overt happiness, his repressed emotions, his fear, his pain, his overflowing love; NAIL ON EVERY HEAD!  There is one moment in particular, when his obnoxious and overbearing behavior becomes too much for Kyla to take and she pounces on him, berates him, controls him.  When we see him, a puddle of tears on the floor, urine staining his pants, fear induced anger and gutted sadness dripping from his face, we are torn apart.  I physically reacted to this moment, my stomach contracting I was in so much distress over the reality of his situation, his daily struggle.But it’s not just about the performances, for Dolan and his technical team deliver tremendously as well.  From the beautiful score from Noia (which is used in one of the most stunning ways possible during the aforementioned ‘fantasy’ scene) to the intentional cinematography from Andre Turpin, ‘Mommy’ is a stunning film from start to finish.  The decision to restrict the audience’s view of everything through the use of a boxed in format makes itself such a spectacular facet of the film, and the moment it becomes clear as to WHY it’s there is a moment that will take your breath away.Xavier Dolan is a name that I have championed a lot.  I was nothing but gushing praise the minute I saw ‘Laurence Anyways’, a film that I feel is one of the greatest explorations of identity ever depicted on film.  ‘Mommy’, believe it or not, is an even greater film.  The maturity that Dolan expresses here as a filmmaker is remarkable.  He has been accused of lavishly beating a point to death with his visual cues and extreme symbolism.  I have never really taken issue with this (although I found it distracting in his debut film, ‘I Killed My Mother’), but I have understood to an extent the issue that was taken with it.  ‘Mommy’ is a perfect example of a director with undeniable talent finding a way to weed through his every idea and intention to find a perfectly balanced way to express himself articulately to an audience without losing the very thing that makes him unique.  The rush of symbolism and visual expressiveness is there, but in a more contained and appropriate capacity and his ability to depict tones through his exploration of his characters is just uncanny.The film takes on a life so fluidly connected to the state of his characters, and this is such an intentional and painfully moving asset to this brilliantly told story.  And, while some have criticized Dolan’s use of music within the film, I have to come to its defense.  Music is such an important medium for expression and emotional transference, and using it in such a specific and intentional way, like Dolan does here, is so rewarding.  The fact that these songs all carry the weight of meaning, both literal and figurative (they represent a time in Steve’s life when he was happy and free/the songs obviously play to the film’s themes in an intentionally obvious manner), adds to the impact of each scene, each moment.‘Mommy’ is an eye-opener.  It’s a film that proves the truth in that statement ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’, because it forces us to see the reality of life outside of the one we live.  As humans, it is so easy for us to pass judgment on others, to look at another’s situation and think that we know more than we do.  We do it all the time.  Heck, even I do it.  You walk through the supermarket and you see a parent struggling with an unruly kid and you hear those words and you see those tears and you think to yourself “what an awful parent” or “control your kid” or “what a brat” and yet, you don’t know what happens behind closed doors; you don’t know their reality.  Films like ‘Mommy’ help us to appreciate, just a little better, that which we don’t know, and hope to never know.So now comes the hard part, summing everything up.  How do you close out a review of a film that you feel so passionately about?  How can you justify the excessive amounts of hyperbole you just spewed all over the page?  I’ve not been shy about my love for Dolan’s work and his career, and so my adoration of this film probably comes as no surprise.  I also think that I’ve proven myself balanced with regards to his work, as I’ve voiced concerns with some of his previous work (I gave ‘I Killed My Mother’ a B- and ‘Tom at the Farm’ a B+) so I know his every work isn’t perfect.‘Mommy’ is perfect.  It truly is.  That’s the best way that I can think of to sum this up.  Perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZL7G7X7CYP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS9NGTM#wasThisHelpful","RLZL7G7X7CYP1","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s strange how you can know nothing about a movie and yet know everything about it at the same time.  I mean, I can know that ‘They Shoot Horses, Don’t They’ is about a dance marathon set during the great depression and that it stars Jane Fonda and Susannah York and yet, my preconceived notion about what this movie was actually about was so far off, SO FAR OFF.I thought this was a comedy.Well, I can assure you that there is nothing ‘funny’ about this film.  In fact, there are fewer films that I can think of that are this bleak, this emotionally crippling.  When the film ends, in those final moments, all hope, all faith, all possibility of a happy future is lost.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt so empty at the climax of a film.  My wife even turned to look at me when it ended and asked, “Why did you want to watch this, again?”We watched it because it’s brilliant.‘The Shoot Horses, Don’t They’ centers around a group of people at the end of their ropes, so-to-speak.  Gloria, Robert, Alice, Sailor…remember these names, for you’ll remember their stories.  This group of distraught and lost souls enter a dance marathon with their eyes on the cash prize, but more immediately, they are just looking for food and shelter.  As the contestants grab their partners and their numbers, they crowd the dance floor, earnestly determined to outlast everyone else, patiently awaiting their rest breaks and supplied food.  While they dance, their ringmaster as it were, the emcee Rocky, pulls strings to create a chaotic and desperate atmosphere that pleases onlookers and creates entertainment out of misery, determined to stir the pot and make the exercise all the more ‘worth it’.It’s not worth it.I’m going to throw something out there, but hear me out before you disagree; ‘They Shoot Horses, Don’t They’ is kind of like an adult, more focused and literal version of ‘The Hunger Games’.  This is a story about people desperate for their own survival, cast about and hopeless, agreeing to participate in a game that will strain them, test them and in some cases kill them, all for the hopes of receiving a prize that could sustain their lives.  While they are participating in this competition, they are betted on, sponsored and cheered by wealthy spectators who take a fancy to their stories.  They’re lives are made spectacle of; they are sold to the public through the lens of commercial marketability.  When things aren’t progressing fast enough, they are poked and prodded, forced into a corner where they must exert themselves or bow out, or die.  When it is deemed fit, their personal lives are manipulated to make for better entertainment, going as far as to elicit tension and force relationships that may be budding into full-fledged affairs if it’ll gain more attention.And then, when all is said and done, the winners don’t really win at all.For a film this desperate and this bleak, it really needed an anchor to make it palatable, and Sydney Pollack is remarkably perfect here.  The way he surveys the whole proceedings, coming in at the right moments to make the characters come to life for us, but knowing when to scale back and just give us enough to keep us at a distance is so smart and so effective.  He makes us feel for these people and he gives us an innate longing to plead for their happy endings.  They won’t get them, but he forces us to pine for it in a way that feels genuine and never manipulative.  Films like this are important for they help us to understand a time we can never fully understand, and yet all too often that understanding is marred by a director’s ambition.  Pollack knows how to balance to grit and honesty with the faade in a way that is remarkably poignant.And that cast!  Jane Fonda has never been better, ever.  Her hard exterior masking her brittle state is so effective, so crushing.  Gig Young is the perfect foil, creating a tense atmosphere within his own brashness, but subtly exposing his own desperation.  Red Buttons delivers such a harrowing performance as Sailor, a man lost in his own struggle to remain relevant, clinging to a past and devoid of any real future.  But the star here is Susannah York.  WHAT A PERFORMANCE!  She bleeds such honesty, such raw emotional unraveling.  Every scene chips away at her soul until we’re left with a shell of a woman.  It’s one of the bravest and most compelling performance I’ve ever seen put to film; period.No, ‘They Shoot Horses, Don’t They’ isn’t a comedy.  In many ways this isn’t even entertaining.  It’s one of the hardest films to watch, and when it ended I felt dead inside.  Still, it’s perfect, a masterpiece of storytelling importance and a film that I wouldn’t change a thing about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KC6JOOFTOMVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=630401709X#wasThisHelpful","R2KC6JOOFTOMVR","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great scent, but more importantly, this leaves hair fresh and buoyant.  I have naturally oily hair, and this has really helped keep my hair feeling light and clean, even overnight (which never happens for me).  I’m a real fan of this one.  It’s meant to be used as a secondary conditioner, but even used as the only conditioner, this works just as described.  A little goes a long way, and that’s always a plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HWM08ZA9VK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP25AOA#wasThisHelpful","R29HWM08ZA9VK5","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a parent sucks.I don’t even know if there are words that can fully explain all the ‘meanings’ in that statement I just made, but really, it truly sucks.  It’s the hardest, most heartbreaking, completely emotionally obliterating thing that anyone can go through, but the biggest reason it sucks is the fact that you asked for it.  You wake up every single day asking for more because the moment those kids are no longer in your life is the moment you just…die.‘Mommy’ tells the story of Die, or Diane, a single mother (her husband died three years ago) who loves her son, Steve, deeply.  She is foul-mouthed trailer-trash with a biting temper and a lack of a filter of any kind, but she loves her son, despite his flaws.  You see, Steve has problems.  When ‘Mommy’ starts, we are informed that Steve is being kicked out of a detention center for setting the cafeteria on fire, brutally injuring another ‘inmate’.  Steve has ADHD, but a very severe kind that leads to extremely violent and uncontrollable outbursts.  When we meet Steve, he shows no signs of remorse for his actions, which sent another kid to the hospital with possible third-degree burns.  Instead, he cursing at and physically assaulting the guards.  When he leaves with his mother by his side, it’s apparently he views her more like a chum, a pal, than an authority figure.  He’s joking with her and cursing at her and despite the nature of their relationship, all you see is love.  She loves him, deeply, and he loves her, deeply.  They just have a non-traditional way of showing it.Then something happens that changes the fabric of the film we think we’re watching.  Steve comes home baring gifts for his mother, and his mother is immediately skeptical as to how he attained those gifts, and after accusing him of stealing, Steve loses it.  Within seconds we see all the glee and jovial charisma that brushed Steve’s face upon handing his mother her new necklace fade away to expose a intense defensiveness that explodes in the form of brute force and complete domination over his mother.  He beckons her to hit him.  He hits himself, thrusting his body towards her, transforming into an animal, screaming at her and practically chasing her through the house, threatening her with physical violence.In this moment, we understand Die’s life, and we understand more fully her love.‘Mommy’ is a hard film to watch, at least for me it was.  I feel like a broken record when I say this, because I know that I’ve mentioned this a few times, but being a parent changes the way that you look at things, the way you feel things.  You look at things from the perspective of a parent and you can feel internally every emotion, every feeling that that parent is bound to be going through.  It doesn’t hurt that Anne Dorval delivers a tremendous performance as the conflicted Die, but regardless of her strength in conveying those feelings, as a parent we watch and develop our own.  Watching Die observe her son was one of the most heartbreaking cinematic moments for me in quite some time.  The way that she so earnestly desires for nothing but Steve’s happiness, the way she selflessly gives of herself and sacrifices her own wellbeing is so reaching, so captivating.  She’s a pill, and she parents in a way that many will find questionable or even distasteful and yet no one can tell you how to love your child, you just do, and in your own way, and in the way that you, as a parent, feel is best for that child.  No parent wishes for a child with special needs, whatever those needs turn out to be, but it happens, and you can either coil back in fear or you can meet those needs head on, and while Die may seem, to the critical observer, to be irresponsible, she knows her son and she is doing her very best, believe me.There is a moment when Die explains a parent’s love to her son.  She tells him that a parent never wakes up one day not loving their child.  She tells him that it is the other way around; that the child will start to love the parent less and less, but that a parent’s love only grows.When she said those words, my heart broke.‘Mommy’ illustrates beautifully the harsh reality of coming to terms with the real needs of a child and not merely what you want them to need.  As Die strives to be everything Steve needs, to mend his every wound, to fight his every battle, she eventually has to come face to face with the fact that she cannot do this alone, and even as she receives help and even a sense of balance and stability from an unlikely friendship with her neighbor, Kyla (another beautifully woven example of a mother trying her hardest to be what she needs to be), the writing is on the wall from the moment we adjust to the aspect ratio; this is a war Die can’t win.As Die’s worldview expands, her innermost desires for her life, for her son, start to blossom in her mind, her crushing reality flitters away and her heart is full and, as an audience, we become a part of her dream world where everything is right, where everything is as every parent wishes it would be; and then she comes to her senses and everything is stripped away from her and a part of you, as a sharer in her journey, dies.I don’t want to paint ‘Mommy’ as a soul crushing experience, even though a part of my soul has been literally crushed, because the ending note to ‘Mommy’ is one of such remarkably exposed and understood parental love that it is almost, as Die puts it herself, hopeful.  As Steve’s actions place him at risk of hurting himself (notice how Die never contemplates drastic measures when the only person at risk was herself), Die makes decisions that conflict with her own personal wants.  She has to learn to let go, and in the process she has to believe that here is hope, that her son will one day find the freedom, not mere physical freedom but emotional freedom, that he so richly deserves.  She has to believe that her choices are giving him the best possible chance at a healthy, productive and happy future, no matter how much pain he, and she, are going through at the present moment.She has to have hope, as does every parent, hope that they are doing the right thing.Any true great depiction of an artistic portrait of real life needs to have every facet working in harmony in order to achieve that overall sense of true, brutal honesty.  Xavier Dolan is fortunate that he had an incredible team working under his wing, giving him exactly what he needed to make this portrait perfect.  His actors, all of them, deliver such richly layered performances, especially his two leads.  Dorval’s exploration of a mother’s love is so heartbreakingly honest and grounded.  There are moments where she is just watching Steve, watching him interact with Kyla, watching him exude this happiness, and we see this undeniable calm rush over her face.  She finds a moment of peace in knowing that he is, for the moment, happy.  That is what it’s like to be a parent.  I know that feeling so well.  Clement is remarkable here as well, finding so many nuances within the fabric of Kayla’s situation.  We are never given the whole backstory for Kyla, but in the bits and pieces we gather from the details that Dolan puts into place and the layers Clement finds in every single breath she takes we are given a story that feels whole, feels complete.But, for me, the performance of this film belongs to Antoine-Olivier Pilon.  At just seventeen years old, Pilon delivers the most complex, organic, moving and brutally honest character portrait of the decade.  This was such a difficult performance to pull off, one that really needed the right touches to steer it clear of a gimmick, and Pilon found all of these.  He makes everything feel so grounded in this sense of absolute reality that you feel his every tonal shift.  He’s so natural.  His furious rages, his tactless cackling, his moody pouting, his reckless abandon, his overt happiness, his repressed emotions, his fear, his pain, his overflowing love; NAIL ON EVERY HEAD!  There is one moment in particular, when his obnoxious and overbearing behavior becomes too much for Kyla to take and she pounces on him, berates him, controls him.  When we see him, a puddle of tears on the floor, urine staining his pants, fear induced anger and gutted sadness dripping from his face, we are torn apart.  I physically reacted to this moment, my stomach contracting I was in so much distress over the reality of his situation, his daily struggle.But it’s not just about the performances, for Dolan and his technical team deliver tremendously as well.  From the beautiful score from Noia (which is used in one of the most stunning ways possible during the aforementioned ‘fantasy’ scene) to the intentional cinematography from Andre Turpin, ‘Mommy’ is a stunning film from start to finish.  The decision to restrict the audience’s view of everything through the use of a boxed in format makes itself such a spectacular facet of the film, and the moment it becomes clear as to WHY it’s there is a moment that will take your breath away.Xavier Dolan is a name that I have championed a lot.  I was nothing but gushing praise the minute I saw ‘Laurence Anyways’, a film that I feel is one of the greatest explorations of identity ever depicted on film.  ‘Mommy’, believe it or not, is an even greater film.  The maturity that Dolan expresses here as a filmmaker is remarkable.  He has been accused of lavishly beating a point to death with his visual cues and extreme symbolism.  I have never really taken issue with this (although I found it distracting in his debut film, ‘I Killed My Mother’), but I have understood to an extent the issue that was taken with it.  ‘Mommy’ is a perfect example of a director with undeniable talent finding a way to weed through his every idea and intention to find a perfectly balanced way to express himself articulately to an audience without losing the very thing that makes him unique.  The rush of symbolism and visual expressiveness is there, but in a more contained and appropriate capacity and his ability to depict tones through his exploration of his characters is just uncanny.The film takes on a life so fluidly connected to the state of his characters, and this is such an intentional and painfully moving asset to this brilliantly told story.  And, while some have criticized Dolan’s use of music within the film, I have to come to its defense.  Music is such an important medium for expression and emotional transference, and using it in such a specific and intentional way, like Dolan does here, is so rewarding.  The fact that these songs all carry the weight of meaning, both literal and figurative (they represent a time in Steve’s life when he was happy and free/the songs obviously play to the film’s themes in an intentionally obvious manner), adds to the impact of each scene, each moment.‘Mommy’ is an eye-opener.  It’s a film that proves the truth in that statement ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’, because it forces us to see the reality of life outside of the one we live.  As humans, it is so easy for us to pass judgment on others, to look at another’s situation and think that we know more than we do.  We do it all the time.  Heck, even I do it.  You walk through the supermarket and you see a parent struggling with an unruly kid and you hear those words and you see those tears and you think to yourself “what an awful parent” or “control your kid” or “what a brat” and yet, you don’t know what happens behind closed doors; you don’t know their reality.  Films like ‘Mommy’ help us to appreciate, just a little better, that which we don’t know, and hope to never know.So now comes the hard part, summing everything up.  How do you close out a review of a film that you feel so passionately about?  How can you justify the excessive amounts of hyperbole you just spewed all over the page?  I’ve not been shy about my love for Dolan’s work and his career, and so my adoration of this film probably comes as no surprise.  I also think that I’ve proven myself balanced with regards to his work, as I’ve voiced concerns with some of his previous work (I gave ‘I Killed My Mother’ a B- and ‘Tom at the Farm’ a B+) so I know his every work isn’t perfect.‘Mommy’ is perfect.  It truly is.  That’s the best way that I can think of to sum this up.  Perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0QS70B9BZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS9NKGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1M0QS70B9BZQ","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of directors who try and replicate the great tension building aspects of legendary master Alfred Hitchcock.  In fact, Hitchcock’s name has become synonymous with the thriller genre, and his knack for building said tension and creating such moody atmosphere and capitalizing on key moments has made many a director restless in their attempt to capture just a mere essence of his mastery.  Many have tried, many have failed, but every once in a while a film comes out that feels truly Hitchcockian, like a film the master himself would have made had he had the time, money and lack of censorship restraints.‘Tom at the Farm’ is that kind of movie.Xavier Dolan has made a real name for himself exploring the relationships between mothers and sons and the plight of the misunderstood gay man, and he fuses those two together in this rapturous thriller adapted from Michel Marc Bouchard’s stage play.  What he does here though, is make this film about so much more without making it ‘feel’ like it’s about too much.  The explorations of grief, universally felt, and the decline into reckless and even obsessive abandon is so brilliantly fitted into the fabric of the film itself that the audience is almost blindsided by their existence.  Dolan has been accused of being melodramatic and too obvious in his progression of points, but here Dolan shows a very mature and very unique side to his filmmaking ability.  Nothing is forced, nothing is pushed too hard.  He shows incredible restraint in his dissection of themes, allowing everything ‘unsaid’ to do most of the talking.While not a perfect movie, ‘Tom at the Farm’ shows Dolan’s incredible range as a director, and I hope that he pushes himself to explore, and perfect, this genre in the future.The film opens with words being jotted down on what appears to be a napkin.  Those words, written by the grieving Tom, are for his deceased lover’s funeral, for which he is traveling to the middle of nowhere.  His lover, Guillaume, never disclosed his sexual orientation to his mother, and so Tom is already on edge as he descends on the family farm, but soon after meeting Agathe, Guillaume’s mother, Tom realizes he’s in for more than he expected.  The presence of Francis, Guillaume’s brother, looming over Tom as he sleeps, presents an outright antagonist, a man bent on preserving his family’s reputation and his mother’s memory of her dead son.  Francis is aware of just who Tom is, and he isn’t ready to allow Tom to expose himself.  Forcing him into a lie, Francis’s domineering presence begins to swallow Tom whole, consuming him almost, and soon he begins to sink into a way of life, a routine almost, that betrays everything he knows to be correct.‘Tom at the Farm’ can, at times, feel a touch underdeveloped.  As I reflect on what Dolan did here, and the story that unfolded, I can’t help but wish a few loose ends were tightened.  I am not familiar with the source material, and so I’m not sure if this ambiguousness was what Bouchard intended, but there are aspects of this film I wish had a little more detail added to them.  This is especially felt in the film’s climax, which is sudden and tonally heightened to perfection and yet almost feels too abrupt, too thin.Still, ‘Tom at the Farm’ is a film that I feel takes some time to establish itself in one’s memory.  My feelings for the film flittered around, changing and morphing and concluding and re-concluding so many times since I saw it last week.  While watching I was spellbound, when it ended I was confused, when I went to bed I was full of pondering and when I awoke I was smitten, completely.  It’s a film that, as I said, works those themes in so fittingly and so delicately that one doesn’t initially notice them, but as the pieces start to fall into place and time starts to pass, one starts to understand where Dolan was going with this.Francis is one of the most compelling antagonists in film that I’ve ever seen.  The use of sexuality as a ploy to flesh out a villain is not something new, but Dolan and his actor, Pierre-Yves Cardinal, develop something so richly textured and so intricately detailed that he feels like a completely new and remarkably original creation.  As Francis’s mental state shows fractures and bouts of intense violence and unstable domination, the film’s atmosphere almost feels completely tied up in just WHO this man is.  In fact, Dolan uses Francis as a plot point almost as much as he uses him as a character, because it is through the development of this one character we see the themes presented take full shape.  As Francis exposes himself, ever so slightly (and in such fleeting moments) to Tom, we begin to see the full breadth of even Tom’s own sanity, and the deteriorating effect of Tom’s grief (haunting, and eventually destructive) begins to become evident.  Tom latches himself to Francis, a man who is brutal, controlling and abusive, and yet the rationalization in the fabric of the film’s scenes feels wholly believable just because of the way that Dolan and Cardinal build this one man.The more I think about it, the more I’m completely unnerved by it.Dolan’s exploration of grief is an admirable one, for sure.  The film is unsettling and uncomfortable for all the right reasons, and it is anchored by a very capable ensemble and a very capable director.  The way that Dolan handles key moments (the tango scene, the mother’s verbal attack on Sarah) show just the right amount of melodrama to sustain a tone while creating a true sense of heightened awareness.After this, I’d LOVE for Dolan to get his hands on some Highsmith, maybe an adaptation (a TRUE adaptation) of ‘Strangers on a Train’!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35P9FH7AO3BO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLMY7I#wasThisHelpful","R35P9FH7AO3BO2","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you practically open your film with a homeless man stabbing another man in the face in a public restroom, you pretty much set yourself up for one of those expected crazy horror-type movies, and so within the first twenty minutes or so of ‘Blue Ruin’ I was, wholly, anticipating some sort of Rob Zombie, homeless man on a rampage, blood soaked yet entirely forgettable and pointless lesson on gore and how to coat every frame with it.Yeah, ‘Blue Ruin’ is not that kind of movie.That isn’t to say that ‘Blue Ruin’ isn’t a terrifying film, but it is a smart kind of terrifying, a film that understands the strength of subtlety, and despite a pretty abrasive and blunt opening (like, that bathroom scene is remarkably intense), it shows so much restraint in the building of each moment that the bigger moments truly explode with impact.  This is one of those films that makes good on the slow burn, allowing us to soak in the anticipation of the inevitable and then, it just takes your breath away.Like I said, ‘Blue Ruin’ opens with a bang.  For the first ten minutes or so we pretty much watch a homeless man, in silence, go about his every day; bathing in the homes of strangers, rummaging trash for food, sleeping in his rusty heap of a car…and then he’s approached by a police officer, who is obviously a friend, and then handed a newspaper and next thing we know, this man, now identified as Dwight, stabs a man in the face in a bathroom and then leaves, but he leaves behind him a trail, a trail that he needs to get rid of.And then the story gaps start to fill in.Dwight’s parents were murdered ten years ago.  This basically sent Dwight into a depression that wrecked him to the point where he became a nomad, a wandering homeless man with no connections to his former life, including his sister who has done her best to move on and is now married with children.  The newspaper reported on the release of the parent’s murderer, and the man Dwight killed in the bathroom was, to his knowledge, the man responsible for his overbearing pain.  But it’s not that simple, and it’s not that clear.  You see, this is a story about family, about vengeance and about some really messed up stuff, and with an unreported murder, it became clear that Dwight’s act of vengeance was not about to go unnoticed.  No, even more vengeance was in the air, and the trail Dwight left, unfortunately, led back to his sister.  Intent on ending things before they went that far, Dwight sends his sister away and holes up in his sister’s house waiting for things to happen.And then they happen…and continue to happen.I don’t want to say much more, plot-wise, because the way that Jeremy Saulnier builds this film is so incredible that you need to see this to appreciate it.  I have never been this nervous watching a film.  It doesn’t hurt that Macon Blair (a completely new face/name to me) is completely in this every step of the way.  His development of character is remarkable, and his depiction of grief, destitution, anger and pain is uncanny.  The way his eyes well up when he sees the man he loathes released from prison, the way he stares, blank and weary, after his initial actions…the way he cuts that arrow out of his leg!  My god, he sells it so hard.Some may consider ‘Blue Ruin’ just your typical thriller, and in some respects they’d be right.  There is nothing new here, story-wise.  It’s not some incredibly intelligent film, but it is a brilliantly constructed film.  Sometimes it isn’t about the story you’re telling but the way you tell that story, and Saulnier and Blair tell this story brilliantly.‘Deliverance’ meets ‘Straw Dogs’ meets ‘The Brave One’; ‘Blue Ruin’ is one of the very best thrillers I’ve seen in a very long time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QXWRJSGKEA15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV0547O#wasThisHelpful","R1QXWRJSGKEA15","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was in fifth grade, I won the lead in our school’s production of ‘The Life of Johann Sebastian Bach’.  I was a young kid who felt somewhat like an outcast, who didn’t really have many friends and didn’t really fit in anywhere.  I hated sports, I was mostly picked on by the jocks, the few friends that carried over with me from Grade School had found other pockets of peers to sit with at lunch and I mostly stayed to myself.  I didn’t really know that I could sing (it was a musical) or that I could act until we were brought it for tryouts (it was pretty much mandatory that everyone in my grade go and read the same lines and sing the same song).  I read my lines, I sang my song, and then I went back to class.  Then, two weeks later, I was sat down in front of the whole grade and handed a script and told that I had the part of Bach.WTF.The whole process was new to me, but it was exciting.  It was electric.  I learned my part and every other part in the entire play.  I became sort of this celebrity in the school, especially after rehersals started, because I just went for it.  Even the jocks, the same kids who used to kick me at recess, steal my books and call me names, were inviting me to sit with them at lunch.  The coolest kid in school’s girlfriend, who played my wife in the play, even gave me a kiss during rehursel’s even though it wasn’t part of the script.  The big night, which was strategically placed on the last day of school, went incredibly.  I got a standing ovation (which, like, was going to happen even if I sucked because it was school and parents do that kind of stuff) and after the curtain dropped every other kid in the play came over to tell me how incredible I did and how awesome the whole thing was.Then I woke up the next morning, the debris of my life as an actor floating into thin air, and I went on with the life I had before I became famous, because with Bach in the past (recent, but still past), I was now back to being me, which was a nobody.‘Birdman’ tells the story of Riggan Thomson, an actor who was at one time a celebrated face, a man who donned a cape and became a hero on screen and off, but who has lost himself and his purpose, as an actor, as a husband, as a father, as a man.  Without the success to define him, he has become a nobody, and so in an attempt to regain what he’d lost (and maybe even reinvent who he wanted to become), Riggan decides to write, produce, direct and star in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver’s ‘What We Talk About When We Talk About Love’.  Reinvention isn’t easy though, and it isn’t free, and with opening night looming in the foreground, problem after problem, both external and internal, begin to fray the edges of Riggan’s intentions and his sanity. With an ex-wife, a recovering addict daughter, a neglected girlfriend, a panic-stricken agent, a vicious critic and an egotistical actor on his hands, Riggan begins to crack under the pressure, but it is his own inner demons that pose the greatest threat.There is something so fluid about ‘Birdman’, something so natural and organic, that makes it so infectious and engaging.  Maybe it’s the fact that it feels like one long take, moving from room to room, from place to place, without a single glitch in the fabric of the ‘scene’, or maybe it’s the way that the ensemble as a whole (every single performance pitch perfect) works with such natural progression of character, falling in and out of character (the one they portray in the play) with such naturalized tensions, or maybe it’s the way that the film’s script moves from verbal communications and expressions to internalized ideas with such raw and rich detail.  Maybe it’s all of those things coming together in the hands of a director capable of guiding them to the right place.It’s funny to me how the world has openly accepted ‘Birdman’ as a comedy, because this isn’t really a funny movie at all, but a darkly complex look at what self-deprecation will do to a human being.  Sure, there are zingers here, and the dialog is sharp tongued and at times makes us laugh and smile, but this is not a comedy; at all.That scene, with the critic, in the bar, says so much with such harsh realism.‘Birdman’ explores acting in a way that feels so relatable, identifiable and honest, exploring it in a way that puts it in our realm of understanding.  This transcends acting or mere depictions of acting because it is about individual purpose, what makes us feel alive, important and loved.  The way that Riggan’s experience and his determination to reinvent his own success is remarkable astute and really speaks to everyone’s individual need for reassurance and love.I also want to say that, personally, I don’t understand that ‘Black Swan’ comparisons, since that film, for me, was a tacky and shamelessly exploitive film that didn’t really contain any deep understanding of its own intentions (and it was a blatant ‘Red Shoes’ rip-off).  ‘Birdman’ may deal with actors and may have a man haunted by a talking bird, but he isn’t so much burdened by his ambitions as he is weighted down by his own self-perception and his total loss of what his reality really means.  ‘Birdman’ is a universal and complex story of a man, an average, everyday man, trying desperately to remember what it means to feel necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0JQBOH0W0VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RO49JEI#wasThisHelpful","R1A0JQBOH0W0VA","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brit Marling is one of those new cinematic talents that I’ve actively tried to campaign.  Her story is so inspiring and her talent in front and behind the camera is very obvious and varied, which is nice.  She basically got tired of being offered stock roles because of her appearance and decided to take her career into her own hands, writing and producing her own films.  Those films, ‘Another Earth’, ‘Sound of My Voice’ and ‘The East’ are all very good, very different and pretty inspired works.  She has this knack for developing interesting stories and characters and bringing them to life on screen.‘I Origins’ reteams her with her ‘Another Earth’ director, Mike Cahill.  Because of this, I was excited, for ‘Another Earth’ is still my favorite Marling film, and the idea of the two of them reteaming for another dose of science fiction felt fresh and exciting.I didn’t realize that Brit Marling didn’t write or produce this film, so maybe that’s why it’s so awful.‘I Origins’ has a very interesting premise, but sadly it is a film that is so completely uninteresting that it fails to live up to any potential that storyline could have had.  The premise is rather intriguing.  A biologist and atheist, Ian, attempts to play god in order to disprove that god exists.  In the process, he meets and falls in love with a woman who, ironically, has very strong belief in a spirit world.  Despite their obvious differences (there are many), the two form a bond that is shattered, unexpectedly, leaving Ian desperate and disillusioned, until the very thing that made him so adamant in his disbelief in a creator begins to sway his seemingly solid beliefs.There is a lot of stuff about eyes here, but I’ll let the film explain that for you.Here’s my problem, or problems.  First, ‘I Origins’ feels like two films that are trying to be cohesive and yet can’t really find a meshing point.  The first half is tiresome in its pointlessness, establishing relationships and ideas and yet never really grounding any of them.  We know what Ian thinks and what Sofi thinks and who Karen is and yet their intertwining never really feels honest or even believable, and despite the ideas implemented by the fragmented way in which Cahill shoots the first half, those ideas almost become forgotten.  I think a major reason for this is that Michael Pitt, as an actor, is just so uninteresting.  He just feels so blank and he can’t convey anything deeper than a surface expression, and even there he struggles, and so leaving the whole film’s crux on his shoulders was a very poor decision.  The lack of real character development with the two female stars, who are far more charismatic and engaging as actresses, also dampens the progression of story.  The second half is such a sharp contradiction to the first that it feels like Cahill had no idea what he was really trying to say and so he said two vastly different things and just went with it.It doesn’t work.Anyone else disturbed by the very nonchalant way that both Ian and Karen talk about experimenting on their baby?Anyways, I really wanted this to be an interesting and richly constructed film, but at the end of the day, ‘I Origins’ says absolutely nothing, like at all.  It had all these chances to say something smart or at least interesting about the debate of life, creation, atheism, religion or even grief and loss, but it throws all of those ideas out there with no grounding and no retort.  It honestly says NOTHING about ANYTHING.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WL2S2QEN0VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTR96J6#wasThisHelpful","R6WL2S2QEN0VW","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m white.As a white male, I know that I have privilege in this country that others don’t, and I know that I don’t carry over my shoulder a legacy of oppression and a stigma of stereotype, at least not an overtly harmful one.  I don’t walk into a place of business and get racially profiled (at least not by the majority) and my skin color or gender will not hinder me from the things in life that I want to attain or achieve.  I also know that I am judged, due to the color of my skin, by those of a darker complexion, and I do know that, while racism still exists (I mean, you cannot deny that), prejudice also exists, and that knows no color.  I know that not all white people are evil, and I know that not all black people are ‘part of the solution’.  I know that white man does not save the black man (stop white washing history, Hollywood), and I know that not all white people are entirely ignorant.Not everything is black and white.So, despite the reviews and obvious critical attention, I was weary of ‘Dear White People’.  The reason for this was that I was not in the mood to sit through nearly two hours of being told that I was ‘the problem’.Much like Gillian Robespierre’s smart look at another controversial subject, abortion (and yes, I’m talking about ‘Obvious Child’), I thank the heavens that Justin Simien’s eventual observations are intelligent and balanced.  The exploration of race relations is so clever and smart, that despite some glaring flaws, this biting satire actually says something truly profound about a subject that we see continually regurgitated on screen.Despite developing many of the same clichés that it feels intent on dispelling (let’s be honest here, some of the development of character feels a tad over saturated with ‘subtext’), ‘Dear White People’ has such an honest soul, and the fact that it truly dissects the fascination with black culture and the way it can be distorted and even manipulated by both sides of the race coin is remarkably solid and poignant.  By exploring the feelings and intentions of four black students, Simien’s satire develops a balance that would not have been there without the whole being represented, and so maybe it is within those overt stereotypes that we see the complete picture, the more balanced and realistic portrait.One thing to consider here is that this is not really an exploration of race relations as a whole but more an exploration of the way in which African American youths deal with those relations.  White characters are never fully developed here, but are there to serve as plot points and narrative markers, and while I would normally balk at this as being an unfair representation of our side of the coin, I have to look at things within context, and the context of ‘Dear White People’ never feels offensive in its presentation.  Yes, Kurt Fletcher and his band of miscreant frat boys are presented as the worst possible type of ‘white privilege’, but Gabe is pretty much the best possible type, and so with the two extremes represented, I feel like Simien made his point.This story isn’t about us.No, this story is about a young man who feels as though he doesn’t fit in anywhere, being too black for the white guys and too gay for the black guys.  This story is about a young woman who feels that the color of her skin is a reason to be ashamed, constantly trying to play down her roots and her attraction to men of color.  This story is about a young man so confused by his father’s ambitions and idea of black ascension that he loses his own identity within the pursuit of achievement.  This story is about a young woman so confused by her family and the tone of her skin that she pushes herself into a movement that she doesn’t fully understand.And within that mixture of faces and intentions, we see a side of race relations that isn’t often explored this sharply.The question of responsibility is brought up a lot here, and the fact that it is up to those in certain positions to be attentive, observant and assertive, and it places the spotlight on these four young people as beacons of the reason this responsibility is so important.  It also asks all of these people to be honest with themselves, which is a very important point.  All four of these students are almost afraid to be honest, afraid to look in the mirror and be themselves because they feel as though there is something expected of them because of their skin color.  The final moments, that offensive and utterly disgusting Halloween party, is a moment of deep reflection, not really on the white students involved (who were idiots to begin with), but on the black students who allowed it to go that far.And for what?Simien’s subplot of a reality show feels a little too ‘on the nose’, and honestly wasn’t necessary, but it does make a point with regards to perception and what we as a unified country have done to promote a misrepresentation of race as a whole.And isn’t that really the truth.  We help create and cement these stereotypes into our culture and our everyday life by promoting them as the only depictions of race in this country, and that is appalling and horribly misguided.For me, despite the flaws, ‘Dear White People’ is an excellent film that looks at a splintered viewpoint from daring eyes and asks questions and presents answers that maybe we never considered before, or weren’t willing to admit.  In many ways, I find Simien’s work here even more compelling and poignant that the racial dissections of Spike Lee, maybe because Simien’s work doesn’t feel so one sided and bias but actually feels like the work of a man who is actually intent on identifying and correcting a problem, but stirring the pot to see who gets angry first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDVEG51LSFAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMCCI8Y#wasThisHelpful","RCDVEG51LSFAI","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"History is not my best subject.  I hated it in school.  In fact, I got in trouble a lot for goofing off and making fun of history.  It was also so stuffy and boring and just uninteresting to me.  As I’ve gotten older, and now that I have children (who I also home school), history has come back to haunt me.  It has become this thorn in my side, as I attempt to try and teach something I’m having to learn myself.Pay attention in school kids!Anyways, there is some history that we aren’t taught, sadly, and in films like ‘The Retrieval’, we are given a chance to learn something we may have completely taken for granted.  Slavery isn’t an unfamiliar subject, not in the least, and film tends to attempt to depict it in various forms time after time, but some aspects of slavery, the grittier, more awful aspects, are often avoided.  Most films on the subject focus on the liberation of slavery; the eventual abolishment or the fight for freedom, but rarely does a film dwell within the realm of slavery and stay there.In Chris Eska’s ‘The Retrieval’, there is no liberation, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, there is just that looming feeling of inevitable injustice.‘The Retrieval’ takes place during the Civil War and centers on a young black boy working alongside his uncle for a group of white bounty hunters, earning the trust of runaway slaves and then turning them in for money.  Will is thirteen and still developing a conscience, while his uncle, Marcus, has already lost his.  Marcus and Will are tasked with their largest assignment, and most profitable, when they are asked to find a man named Nate and bring him back to their boss.  Things are different this time, though, and when Will discovers that Nate is not a runaway slave, but actually a free man, his conscience starts to rattle him.  Once Marcus is out of the picture, and the boy finds himself escorting Nate into dangerous hands (after earning his trust, based on a lie), he begins to battle his inner emotions and sense of morality as he bonds with the man.Eska’s tale is a simple yet ambitious one, for it plunges us into a complex and controversial chapter of American history.  It forces us to contemplate the actions of a confused young man, just trying to survive, and the moral dilemma he’s placed into.  Slavery is such a disgusting stain on a history rich with stains, but this story focuses less on the white man’s part and more on the moral conundrum some black men and women were faced with.He handles this subject with grace and clarity.‘The Retrieval’ is a beautifully shot and constructed film, with some brilliant performances by the two leads.  Ashton Sanders carries the weight of his youth and struggle so well, his eyes bleeding for some answers, and Tishuan Scott is a marvel as a man weighted down by his past and his decision to move forward, even though it caused him to lose everything.  I was not all that taken by Keston John’s portrayal of Marcus, which felt clichéd and uninspired, but his presence is forgotten the moment he’s gone.  The film is also stunning to look at, with such breathtaking scenery captured by Yasu Tanida.If I were to fault the film anything, it would be that it tends to linger in moments, and while the film is only 92 minutes, there were many moments I felt could have been tightened to deliver a more impactful (overall) experience.  In fact, I feel like all of the emotion and events captured could have been edited down to a short film and carried the same impact, maybe even more so, but that is just my personal opinion.Still, ‘The Retrieval’ offers a look at a moment in American history we may have never given attention to, and because of that it deserves to be seen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9Y3DB52UI9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWY0WKW#wasThisHelpful","RQ9Y3DB52UI9T","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beauty of a film like ‘Love is Strange’ is that it says so much without appearing to say a whole lot.  I know that that sounds, off the bat, like a criticism of sorts, but it really isn’t.  This is a film that rests very easy, never forcing any of the film’s narrative themes, but gently coaxing from them so much depth that we don’t even realize what it is we are taking in, but we are taking it in.  While our focal point is centered on the unfair situation that newlyweds Ben and George find themselves in, so many little, subtle things are floating around the surface and popping up for our interpretation and contemplation.Prejudice, aging, respect, infidelity, economy, grief; all of these things are explored in subtle ways, sometimes in just a passing comment, but are fully represented when considering the context.‘Love is Strange’ (which by the way is a confused film title, since it says nothing about the film itself), tells the story of same-sex partners Ben and George, and opens on the day of their marriage.  They’ve been together for a VERY long time, but are finally able to legalize their bond.  Unfortunately, legalizing their love has brought George to an uncomfortable spot with his employer, a Christian School that has strict rules about the image of their teachers (he’s a piano teacher).  Despite knowing full well about George’s relationship with Ben, having a wedding placed the school in a position where they felt the need to let him go.  Now, this happy couple finds themselves financially strapped, and with the rising cost of housing in New York they are at a loss for where to go.  They settle on the decision to live separately, Ben moving in with his nephew and his family, and George sleeping on a friend’s couch.  Separation is bad enough, but living with other people poses its own set of hardships.A story like ‘Love is Strange’ moves briskly, and with no real seeming purpose, but it is in all the little details that the purpose of the film is firmly implanted.  In the way that Ben’s family tends to take him for granted, or the way that Ben feels a need to defend his nephew’s son, or the way that George subtly deflects temptation, or the way that Ben and George nonchalantly discuss previous indiscretions; all of this background noise (because, it’s never given center attention) completes a picture of life and love in all of its stages.And the ensemble is just beautiful, with Lithgow and Molina turning into such rich and honest portraits of these men, and the rest of the cast, most notably Marisa Tomei (one of the greatest character actresses working today, or ever) rounding out a very natural and impressionable ensemble.Some have balked that the lack of central focus on Ben and George TOGETHER has dampened the impact of the film, especially the finale, but for me it was the way the focus was spread throughout the entire family that this film’s finale found its sharpest impact.  The film, by spreading the focus, delivers a real insightful look at the way the elderly are regarded and nearly disregarded in the same breath, and the way that respect can be lost without reason and then slowly developed, almost unbeknownst to us and not until it’s too late.  Yes, this is about an unwavering love between two people (and yes, this deals with prejudice and the debilitating economy) but the ending note is the lasting impression made by the development of ‘family’ and what that really means.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7OS4R9LNY8YK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5B5BHS#wasThisHelpful","R7OS4R9LNY8YK","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, my wife and I recently started training for a half-marathon.  I’ve been a runner for a while now, but never more than my personal leisure or for, at most, six miles or so.  But, my wife takes everything to an extreme and the minute she started running was the minute things got serious.So, now I’m getting prepared for a 13+ mile run.Expanding the length of my runs leaves me rather drained, and there are times when I get done and literally want to pass out.  I’m always looking for something that refreshes without making me sick, and sometimes those overly sweet replenishing drinks can make you feel worse.  I’ve been really happy with this Vega Sport Recovery Accelerator.  Taken, as directed (right after your workout), it really works, and has made my new schedule manageable.  It’s also, thankfully, rather tasty.

"So, a couple of months ago I was asked to join a book club and I was all like, that would be awesome, because I love books and reading and the whole idea of getting together with a group of people who also love books and reading and sharing our innermost thoughts on a particular book, prose, author, subject, whatever just felt so awesome to me.  The book was chosen; ‘Wolf in White Van’.  I ran out to find a copy and found that the local used bookstore had none, the local mom and pop bookstore had none and even freaking Barnes and Noble was sold out.So I had to order one.By the time my copy came in the mail, the entire book club (which was hosted online) had already read it, discussed it and kind of dissolved due to, I don’t know, no one really caring enough to keep it going.  This made me sad, but I was determined to give this a go, because I paid top dollar for this book (something I rarely do) and I didn’t even know what it was about.  Like, I literally thought it was about a wolf or something, or at least a van, but like…it’s about neither.I have so many thoughts swirling in my head with regards to John Darnielle’s debut novel that I’m not sure where to begin.  I guess I’ll start by discussing his writing style, because it’s the easiest thing to dissect.  He has such a sharp wit about his writing, and he isn’t afraid to color in his characters with flaws that we wouldn’t normally be taken with.  This is probably so politically incorrect to say, but reading about physically unattractive people feels almost painfully honest.  It also feels so against the grain.  I mean, authors tend to pretty up their protagonists because, as a rule, we find it hard or uncomfortable to personally connect with the undesirable.  The fact that Sean, our protagonist (and first person at that) is horribly disfigured repels and yet somehow endears us.  Sean, despite his obvious ugliness, feels honest.  I was reminded of the work of Chuck Palahniuk, an author who has made a career out of embracing the ugly (figurative and literal) in life, and his protagonists rarely are the model of physical beauty (and if they are, he works hard to mess them up).  This physical aspect is a perfect symbol of his emotional and inner person, one of almost apathetic defeat.But this is only part of the equation.Another key aspect to the stories unraveling is the composition or construction of the story.  Darnielle tells everything in a semi-reverse order, basically giving us the end before our beginning, making us work backwards to answer the questions that the stories conclusion (or beginning) dare us to ask.  There have been a few other stories that have embraced this unconventional narrative, ‘Stuart, a Life Backwards’ being one I’ve read not too long ago.  This is an interesting, conceptually, narrative choice, but I can’t say that it always works out.  It fares better here than in Masters’ debut, but the one issue I take with this kind of narrative is that it almost sets us up for an anti-climactic conclusion.  We are always interested in where a story is going, but by giving us the end upfront and then making us dig for the beginning, we wind up ending at the point where we wish to start from, and without the right detailing, it can all seem rather empty.I kind of get where Darnielle was going with this, and Sean is a very complex character, but his tale isn’t spun in a way that feels ultimately complete.  As a character, I feel upon conclusion to know no more of him than I did on the outset, and that dampens my affections for the book.  I kept waiting for some kind of revelation, some kind of distinct observation that was going to make everything feel right, feel like it made sense, and yet it just felt flat to me.I think another thing that hurts ‘Wolf in White Van’ is that it is juggling two sets of stories that run parallel and yet neither feel completed or whole.  The one story, which we’ve already spoken of, regarding Sean and his disfigurement (which is the result of a mysterious gunshot), is only half of the equation.  On the other side of things we have Sean’s business, a mail-in role playing game, which has caused some unwanted media attention and a lawsuit after two players of the game went a little overboard, took things too seriously and wound up dying.  Because we start with this story (this is the end) and work away from it, by the time we get to the novel’s center, we’re passed it and it all feels kind of dropped, even though it isn’t (or is it?) and so this is a moment where I feel like the gimmicky nature of the story’s narrative really hurt it.  If this secondary plot-point had been introduced at the halfway mark, it would have felt more alive, but dissolving it at that point felt awkward to me.I get the parallels, and I appreciate the way that Darnielle used Sean’s physical features, social habitat and professional decisions as a way to color in his personality without really having to do just that, but at the end of the day this felt somewhat hollow to me.  It’s a well written work, in that it flows with ease, but it’s also somewhat poorly written in that it doesn’t truly connect the dots it has laid out.  Or maybe it’s just that it’s poorly conceived, because despite being conceptually intriguing, this obviously wasn’t thought out very well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9GLVJL69VPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374292086#wasThisHelpful","R3M9GLVJL69VPY","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some films seem right up ones alley.  You look at them and you assume that they are going to be everything you could have asked for and more.  A few years ago, I would have never made that statement about a film like ‘The Public Enemy’, but after years of ingesting 30’s cinema and adoring the contained chaos of the gangster noir and falling head over heels for the undeniable range of James Cagney (I nearly convinced my wife to name our son Cagney, that’s how much I adore the actor), I was super excited to see ‘The Public Enemy’ because I was convinced that this film was ‘right up my alley’.Unfortunately…There is just a lot wrong here.  While the setup and storyline itself isn’t truly the problem, it’s all been done so much better in other films.  To say that the film isn’t fresh is an unfair criticism, since this is the film that kind of started them all, and all the films that ‘did it better’ came afterwards, but the fact still remains that they all did it better, and because of that, ‘The Public Enemy’ just doesn’t age well.  Wellman’s direction is stagnant in many parts, with serious pacing issues (for a film that is a brisk 83 minutes, it lags in more than one place), and the ensemble is so awkward in their delivery that they make the film feel stiff and unlived in.  I mean, I have seen enough noirs to know and understand and appreciate the way that these performances are supposed to be crafted, that mannered appeal, but this is just plain bad.  Like, Jean Harlow is cringe worthy awful, and Donald Cook looks so uncomfortable in his verbal sparring with Cagney.But maybe it was just that Cagney was so comfortable and so loose and so good here that it just emphasized the poorness of the rest of the cast.Yup, Cagney is the film’s primary saving grace; a spitfire of real intensity that sinks into every fiber of the character and creates a well-rounded and complete portrait of a kid lost on the wrong side of the tracks.  I love the way that he almost adopts a flamboyancy as the film progresses, easing into the natural comfort of his character’s new life and strengthened confidence.I wanted to love this one.  I feel like I should have loved this one.  Still, I can’t help but feel like it misses the mark.  It served as a great stepping stone, but so many films that followed (a lot of which starred Cagney himself) took this formula and made it something richer, stronger and more memorable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYWQV2TZBXQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HBV2S#wasThisHelpful","R2PYWQV2TZBXQL","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been a fan of Gabriel Iglasias for a long time.  The way he tells a story is really like no other mainstream comedian working today.  He just has this relaxed knack for making his stories so relatable.  When Fluffy talks, it’s as if we’re in his living room, sitting on his couch with our hands in a bowl of potato chips and our attention firmly set on his moving lips.  He just has that effortless quality.It also doesn’t hurt that his stories are funny.  He has a normal life with an abnormal job, and the two make for some really relatable and inspired stories.But this just didn’t work for me.It’s hard to decide how to review a comedy special, because there isn’t a plot, but a collection of stories and jokes, and so without re-telling you every story and joke, it’s hard to truly ‘review’ this.  But I’ll try my hardest.Two things about ‘The Fluffy Movie’ irk me.First, Gabriel’s material just isn’t as strong.  This really is the main reason why ‘The Fluffy Movie’ ultimately doesn’t work as a whole.  He’s released quite a few comedy specials, and all of them have been pretty on the money.  His stories about his work on ‘Magic Mike’ or his travels through Hawaii or his frustrations with his step son are really, truly, hilarious.  Sadly, the material on ‘The Fluffy Movie’ just isn’t as funny.  His tone is also too direct at points, dragging out his stories in a way that lay flat for too long until he finally reaches the end of a ‘not so funny’ story to hit that one funny moment, and the effect is lost.  He also choses some more mature material (not content-wise), in that he discusses some weighter personal matters; like his weight (shocker) and reuniting with his father.  The weight stories are laborious and uninteresting, unfortunately (we know you’re fluffy, we know you’ve lost weight, we know you like being fluffy, we know it’s a health risk) and the last story, about his father, while touching, is just not funny.  It’s not funny.  This is a comedy special.  Your stories NEED to be funny.  I want to laugh, and while I care enough about you as a performer to be happy for you when your life and your issues come together in your favor, I didn’t pay to hear a heartwarming story; I paid to LAUGH!Second, Gabriel’s ego is getting too big.  He’s become extremely famous in a short period of time.  In about a five year span, he’s become GLOBAL, and he knows it…to the point where he likes to remind us about it, and this takes away from his usually likable persona.  He’s getting full of himself, and his overly vocal ‘humility’ is starting to feel forced and fake.I haven’t given up on Fluffy.  When his next comedy special comes out, I’ll see it, but he’s on thin ice.  He needs to develop some new material and not just rely on the previous laughs he got for jokes he’s already told us.  I don’t want an extension of a story you already told me about your step son and how little he cares about his hygiene.  I want something fresh, something exciting, and most of all, I want something funny.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PR04QVIBJQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU1YEY0#wasThisHelpful","R4PR04QVIBJQ5","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never saw the television show, ’21 Jump Street’.  It was popular way before I was old enough to care.  My sisters liked it, I think.  When it was announced that the show was getting a big screen adaptation with Tatum and Hill in the leads, I didn’t really care.  Some dumb buddy cop comedy that was going to get slaughtered with the reviews and produce a hand full of belly laughs resulting in a mediocre yet mildly entertaining trip to the movies; that’s what I thought.I didn’t expect to pretty much love everything about the film.Sure, it was stupid, but in a really clever way, and Hill and Tatum were such inspired (and surprisingly so) choices, and their chemistry was undeniable, infectious even.  Hill has always had a knack for developing believable chemistry with his co-stars (whether it be Cera, Pitt or DiCaprio), but there was something so deeply honest about the way he meshed with Tatum that it felt even more real, even more authentic.I totally believe that these guys are major besties off screen, and that’s all that matters.With my surprise adoration of the first film in check, the idea of a sequel left me super excited and super nervous.  There were so many ways that they could have completely screwed this up, and yet they didn’t.  No, this is NOT as good as the first film, but despite some snags, it knows when to recycle previous gags and scenarios for comedic effect and when to bring out something fresh, and while the same formula of jealous egos butting heads is used here (this time in a reverse order), the jokes and core themes are developed so well that it doesn’t matter.We know we saw this before, but we saw it differently.My main issue here is merely the film’s running time.  Sure, it isn’t that long (not quite 2 hours) and yet, it feels long.  The last segment (that Miami sequence) feels like it drags out the film, even if it does give us closure and tidies up the storylines.  It just felt like the film could have used some trimming to make it a tad brisker in parts.

"Some films know exactly what they are, what they want to say, how they want to say it and how they want you to feel about it, and with all the right intentions in place and all the proper artillery in hand, they do just that; they swoop in with an undeniable identity, speaking their words elegantly and directly, with the right touches of power and inflection and you feel it like a whisper to your heart, because that is exactly where they want you to feel it.And yet, when all is said and done, you smile and shrug and walk away.I don’t know what happened here, but despite everything in all the right places and all the right words and all the right moments, ‘Pride’, as a whole, felt nothing more than ‘nice’ to me, and while ‘nice’ is good, I think I wanted more.Right?I think my major problem with ‘Pride’ is that, when the whole thing is said and done, there is nothing truly memorable about it.  It is all very well constructed, with a great ensemble who all work effortlessly with one another and all play off one another well, and the screenplay is cheeky and tender and politically astute and gives these actors and actresses dimensions to play, and the message is one that feels poignant to today’s social setting, and yet it all just kind of lays there.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s a delightful romp in many parts, and the thing is that I can’t find anything technically amiss here, nothing is wrong or out of place or offensive and I’m not sure that I can really think of anything that I would have done differently, and yet there is still this overwhelming forgettable feeling about the whole exercise.  It’s doesn’t linger, it doesn’t stay with you.My kids, the love suckers.  You know, those little dum-dum things they give you at the bank.  Anyways, they’re always begging me to give them one whenever we leave the house to go anywhere.  We have a small bowl of them by the front door.  And so, whenever we leave, they grab one.  They sit in the backseat and they suck on them for a few minutes, savor the flavor, then bite into it, chew it, swallow it and within a few minutes it’s as if they never had one.  They’re already begging for another one.  And I’ll tell them “you just had one” and nine times out of ten I hear “no we didn’t”; and they mean it.That’s how I feel about ‘Pride’.  This is a sweet, fun little film that was totally entertaining while I was watching it, and then it was over and in a few minutes I had forgotten that I had even watched it.That doesn’t make it a bad movie at all, just not a great one; and this year has produced a sea of ‘great’ ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34JBRA1GXCEJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY7YNKI#wasThisHelpful","R34JBRA1GXCEJX","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are fewer films that I’m as nervous about writing a review for than I am for this beautiful ode to the life and journey of one of the most celebrated and beloved men in the cinematic world; Roger Ebert.  Yes, ‘Life Itself’ is a film so elegantly and yet honestly crafted that I’m nearly at a loss for words at how best to convey what this film means to us as cinephiles and yet I feel compelled to try my hardest to give it justice, since it is that beautifully important.And yet, when you are reviewing a film about a man who pretty much wrote the greatest reviews of any film critic, there is this element of inferiority that overtakes my fingers.No matter how many strokes I make, my words will never be as satisfying than had Ebert just penned this review himself.When Roger Ebert died, back in April of 2013, it was a huge blow to the cinematic community.  Ebert, whether you agreed with him or not, was the most well know and well respected film critic who ever was, and he had become, in many ways, a celebrity as powerful and as well respected as the ones we keep fawning over, movie after movie.  When I heard that they were going to release a documentary about his life, and more importantly, about the final months of his life, I was skeptical.  With such a beloved figure, it is easy to get lost in sentiment and I was truly afraid that this would be another one of those instances where demons were skirted and sainthood was emphasized, and I have such a hard time with biased depictions of real people.  I can’t love someone who never feels real.  I’d rather know all of your flaws, even the hard to swallow flaws, than be force-fed this idea that you are perfect.Roger Ebert was not perfect, and he knew that, and more importantly Steve James knew that, and so the biggest compliment that I can hand ‘Life Itself’, which is basically the biggest compliment you can hand any documentary, is that this feels wholly honest.From his humble beginnings to his rapid rise to fame to his ego-centric alienations, to his oddly lovable charm to his complete awareness of his nature and embrace of his unexpected charming honesty, Roger Ebert feels like a real man to us, like a complete picture, thanks to this beautiful documentary.  It never takes an easy way out of anything.  It shows Ebert at his worse, whether it be from depictions of his past demons or showing us his final hours, his deplorable situation, letting us in to those moments that no one but those closest to him were allowed to see, and because of this we can truly love this man.  He was a flawed soul, and he rubbed some people wrong, but even those people fell in love with him because the one thing Ebert always was, was himself.The hole that Ebert left in the cinematic community is still visible.  I’m not sure if it will ever be filled.  Up until his final breath, Ebert was there to give us of himself, to share with us, to remain with us, and the transcendent beauty of ‘Life Itself’ is that, through this stunning documentary, we are with him once again.Now, let’s watch another movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZJG5EUNG5BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6WYT40#wasThisHelpful","R34ZJG5EUNG5BH","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know that feeling you get when you know something bad is going to happen.  You don’t always know when it’s going to happen, and you may not even know what exactly it is, but you know that it’s going to happen.  Your stomach drops, your palms get sweaty and every time that someone says “hey, can we talk” you just know; it’s the end.Now, imagine that you not only knew what that bad thing was, but you knew exactly when it was going to happen.‘Calvary’ is one of those films that starts with a scene so jarring, so emotionally harrowing that you’re almost convinced that the tone set with obliterate your soul, but the way that John Michael McDonagh shapes this complex morality/spirituality tale is so effortless and so controlled that it literally sits comfortably on the viewer from frame to frame.  This is a hard film to digest, because it is so controversially spun, and yet it is an easy (or at least easier than one should expect it to be) film to swallow.But I’m telling you, that opening scene sent shivers from one end of my body to the other and really, it alone should have earned Brendan Gleeson (who’s never been better) an Oscar nomination.In that opening scene, Father James is informed, through the confession booth, that he is going to die.  He is going to be sacrificed as a bold statement against all those Catholic priests who have taken advantage, sexually, of young boys.  His murderer himself was abused, horrifically, and wants justice to be served.  The thing is, Father James is an innocent man, and this murderer knows this.  But wouldn’t the murder of an innocent priest make more of a statement, a cautionary impact, than the murder of a man everyone knew was corrupt?  So, with just a few days of life left to live, Father James goes about his business.  He doesn’t want to burden the ones he loves most, and so for the most part he keeps his impending death a secret and just continues with his commission.  He continues to make himself an integral part of his small seaside community, extending his hand to those in need and waiting out the inevitability of his future as he contemplates the man at the end of the gun.‘Calvary’ cuts.  It beautifully rests in this place that feels so natural and honest and so human and so when we watch Father James mediate through his day, we feel a part of his life, a part of his soul, and we understand him.  We collect the information of his past and of his emotional frailties and we begin to understand the construction of his present self, which makes this man so relatable.  He isn’t just a figment, a fraction of a being, an ideal with no name; but Father James is a man, an honest man, a man trying to be what he promised himself he’d become because of the man he used to be and longs to forget.And this is where ‘Calvary’ becomes more than just another movie about the Catholic Church and their history with child abuse.Yes, child abuse is mentioned more than once, and the allegations that continue to swarm the church are used as ammo against an honest man and his vocation, but at the core of ‘Calvary’ lies something more; a feeling of universal failings and the encroaching corrosion of sin and guilt.  Father James, a man who was, for all intents and purposes, completely innocent of the crime he was being punished for, was not an innocent man, at least not in his own eyes, and being confronted with this act of essential martyrdom brought flooding back to him the unsettling realization that no matter how hard you may try and dress up your mistakes, hiding them behind a title and a robe, you can never fully escape your past mistakes.  Father James was a good man.  We watched him as he bonded with his daughter and reached out to those in the community in clear need and heard out the cries from those in clear pain and we saw the genuineness in his face as he took in their circumstance, but we also saw that the damage had been done.  He had been reminded.  He had been outed, so-to-speak, and because of that he would forever be doomed to his inevitable.‘Calvary’ has so many interesting things to say about faith, about our past mistakes and our own willingness of forgive or to persecute ourselves, regardless of where we are on our current path, and how much faith can or can’t fix those things for us.Just contemplate the decision Father James makes…about his own life.It haunts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGV83WZ8KZ7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9KD460#wasThisHelpful","R1KGV83WZ8KZ7A","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes it’s the simple things in life that make the most impact.  They hold us close, comfort our soul and whisper in our ears that they love us.  It’s often these simple things that we take for granted, always reaching for something that feels bigger, bolder and more obviously poignant, and yet it can be within these simple things that we find the biggest, boldest, most poignant impact.The same can be said for film.  Oftentimes films are convinced that beating us over the head with their views and ‘importance’ is the way to our hearts, or at least to our memories, but sometimes it is that film with a simple message told in a simple manner that contains the most heart and soul, and the one that reaches us deeper than we ever expected it to.‘We Are the Best!’ is that kind of film.I’ve said many times that children and stories about children fascinate me.  They reach to the core of me.  They find a soft corner of my heart and they blossom.  Now that my eldest daughter is getting older (my GOD, she’s inching closer and closer to those double digits), stories about adolescence are starting to work their way in there as well.  ‘We Are the Best!’ is one of those soft-hearted yet boldly idealistic portrayal of honest adolescence that makes me smile ear to ear and hope and pray that my children, but daughter’s especially, grow up into the young women THEY want to become.  All that prodding and pulling every direction, all that well intentioned guidance and advice and coddling is to be expected because we’re parents and we love them and we want the best for them, but at the end of the day, I want my girls to be THEM and only them and never what they think I or their mother or anyone else wants them to be.So, when anyone tells my daughter than “PUNK IS DEAD”, or anything to that nature, I hope she flips them the bird and PROVES THEM WRONG!‘We Are the Best!’ takes place in Stockholm and revolves around two young girls who are somewhat outcasts because of their lack of conformity to the stylings and likings of the in-crowd.  They don’t fit in much at home either, at odds with what their parents want from them and constantly feeling as if they’re taken for granted and not even heard.  And then, on a whim, they decide to form a band.  It’s really a complete whim, something that forms out of the burstings of their heartstrings; a desire repressed yet always lingering that consumes them at the same moment to where, despite ignored consequences, they just go for it.  It is then, through their rushed yet well intentioned music, that these girls (now ‘three’, thanks to the adoption of another outcast) find something special within themselves.I feel like the topic of misogyny comes up a lot when film is discussed.  I personally got engaged in the conversation this week.  It’s not really a reality you can ignore, especially when you glance over the array of male-centric films that are force fed to the populous on a daily basis.  The wonderful thing about a little film like ‘We Are the Best!’ is that is takes a genre and even a subject that could have, and most likely would have normally been centered around boys and makes it a matter of female empowerment.  What is even better is that this film doesn’t make this ABOUT girls as much as it makes it about growing up, regardless of sex.  In fact, the girls themselves stress at one point that they are NOT a girl band.  In this way, this film proves that you can make a film featuring strong female characters that aren’t there because the story RELIES on it.  For me, we need more films that integrate male and female roles in this way, because there are so many stories that don’t demand a specific sex in the lead.  Let’s give more of these roles to women!And what astonishing child performances from the three talented young ladies!  Mira Barkhammar anchors this film with such beautifully composed honesty.  You can sense the inner struggle she faces to be herself, to be who she feels is swelling in her heart that is looking for any way to escape, and it reads so effortlessly on her face.  For me though, her two co-stars really steal the show.  Liv LeMoyne handles Hedvig’s flowering beautifully, with such attention to the smallest detail, and Mira Grosin (who I demand become a HUGE star) is so organic here, so natural in all of her detailings of Klara.  She gets everything right, from the attitude to the immaturity to the honest childlike emotions.  She lights up every scene and, for me, possessed the strongest character development.Such a beautiful performance.Lukas Moodysson deserves major credit for making this story as fluid and as universally compelling as he did.  It would have been easy to make this a gender thing, to pander to the obvious and beat things over the head, and yet there are so many moments when we forget we’re talking about three girls in a boys world; we’re just watching three kids finding themselves in their world, because this world does belong to all of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W88R1V3S0U0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6AW920#wasThisHelpful","R1W88R1V3S0U0G","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me a while to get into Pedro Almodovar’s films.  They have a very distinct tonal quality to them.  That whole ‘glorified Telenovela’ thing can be, for the lack of a better word, awkward to watch.  Sometimes these tones can make his films feel like a really glossy Soap Opera, and I’ve never been one to embrace that form of storytelling.  But, his status and reputation within the cinematic community always had me sure that I should attempt to get more acquainted with his work, to try a little harder.It’s funny how when you start to explore something you aren’t initially comfortable with, you start to discover nuances and details and tidbits of merit that help grow your appreciation for it, despite your initial reservations.  I’ve noticed this in myself many times when it comes to film.  When I first started exploring film as more than just a medium of immediate entertainment, I was urged to explore foreign cinema, which to me only existed (at that point) in laughable Kung-Fu movies and ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’.  The idea of subtitles just didn’t appeal to me at all and so I had no real interest in digging in, and yet I did and I found this whole new world.  My preconceived notions that lead to initial observations were soon dismissed for a real appreciation.  For instance, I initially considered Asian cinema loud, obnoxious and overtly theatrical (granted, some of it is), but the more I saw, the more I found such rich texture and such variations of tone I took for granted initially.So, the same can be said for Almodovar.So far, I’d only seen six of his films, ‘All About My Mother’ being my seventh.  Like I said, he can be a bit much to take at first, but as these six films rest in my mind they help build a real tapestry of appreciation for his gifts as a filmmaker and the sheer originality and unwavering vision within his work.  Almodovar loves color, flamboyancy, drama and women, and he uses them all in such distinct and vibrant ways.  While I don’t always react to his films with unabashed delight, I do get a little giddy now when I watch one of his films, for I know what to expect and I know what to look for.I really liked ‘All About My Mother’.  This is one of those film that I have felt, for a long time, that I needed to watch, mainly because so many tout it as one of Almodovar’s finest films, lauding it in a year that is lauded as one of the greatest cinematic years (the greatest, by many) since 1939; 1999.  The fact that I had sought out some of his more obscure titles and yet hadn’t found the time to see this one was a shame on my part, but I’ve finally rectified that.  Anchored by a truly inspired ensemble, Almodovar’s black comedy of sorts covers so many characters and so many sub-plots and so many hidden agendas that keeping up can be exhausting, but the finished product is so splendidly delivered that I can’t help but smile when thinking about it.  Whether we’re lamenting alongside Manuela as she grieves the loss of her son, or we’re secretly judging Huma and her oddly distracting relationship with the troubled Nina, or we’re rooting for Rosa and her desperate situation or trying to figure Agrado out, we are constantly IN this movie, which is something so refreshing.I can’t say that I loved this movie, but I will say that it never let me stop watching; and I didn’t want to.Some of Almodovar’s flagrant touches don’t come off as smooth as in other films, and I have to say that I’ve always somewhat preferred him when he reigns it in, just a little, but his attention to character detail is just unreal.  He creates such lived in worlds for his actresses, all of them so full and ripe regardless of their actual place within the plot.  Even Agrado, who is far from a main character, has her moment and her completeness which all makes her feel so whole and real.  You understand these women because Almodovar understands these women, and that love for his characters (even the troubled, hurtful ones) shows up so well in these films.  In fact, his finest films, that I’ve seen, are the ones where he allows women to take center stage.  Throw a man in, and things start to get murky.Roth is outstanding; such a powerfully layered performance, and Marisa Paredes and Penelope Cruz are also just wonderful.There is a lot going on here, and it doesn’t always mesh as cleanly as I would have liked it too (just edit a little bit), but overall, ‘All About My Mother’ is a beautiful dissection of these women, what makes them tick, what makes them whole and what unites them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5GRYPGRK5C7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M2T1VI#wasThisHelpful","R5GRYPGRK5C7Z","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife baffles me.  She hates animals.  She has banned them from our home.  She makes us all strip at the door if we’ve been in the home of anyone who owns animals.  She shuts down any conversation about owning them.  When we are at a friend’s home and they own pets she avoids them like the plague, talks about how awful they are and begs our friends to get rid of them.  I know, this should make her a terrible person, right?  But, she’s also quite fascinated by them, and from a distance she adores them.  It’s strange, but she makes our kids watch nature shows every Saturday morning and drags the whole family to those awful IMAX movies that play in our local museum that are basically the most boring depictions of wildlife put to film, with someone like Morgan Freeman explaining every single detail to us; ad-nauseam.  She pleads with us to go to the cinema anytime Disney decides they want to create a fake family of animals to ‘document’ for our enjoyment.  She did it with that ‘Chimpanzee’ movie and I wanted to kill her (my god, that movie was awful) and she did it again with ‘Bears’.Well, she almost did it.In fact, the film came out and I refused to suffer in the theater for this movie and so we waited until it was released on DVD.  She kept prodding me every week, “has it come out yet?” and I prayed we’d never find it, and then we did find it and I wound up sleeping through the whole thing.  I needed a nap.  I was exhausted.  The next morning my kids wanted to watch it again, and I was kind of shocked because they usually complain about these kinds of movies despite my wife’s constant insistence that they are wonderful films, and so my interest was slightly piqued to the point where I decided to laze it on the couch with the kids and watch the movie I’d snored through the night before.This is in no way shape or form a benchmark for documentary filmmaking, but it is in no way shape or form as pointless, silly and pandering as that awful ‘Chimpanzee’.The thing I hated so much about ‘Chimpanzee’ is that it felt like it tried way too hard to make this ‘documentary’ a movie.  It gave awful names to these apes and gave them backstories that felt forced and it fed in conflict that felt anticlimactic and overly dramatized and it focused on inane things, trying to give it meaning beyond the obvious and by the end of the movie it felt so pointless that it might as well have just been scrapped altogether for an animated film about chimpanzees, since that’s really what they wanted to do.  My fear for ‘Bears’ was that it was going to suffer from the same construction issues, but it doesn’t, at least not wholly.‘Bears’, narrated by one of my favorite underappreciated actors, John C. Reilly, tells the story of a mother bear and her two cubs and their journey from hibernation caves to life giving streams of the open valleys.  From first step to last, the journey is dangerous, exciting and rewarding, and the way in which directors Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey capture this journey (the cinematography is stunning) is a very solid and touching experience.  There are some moments that feel overwrought, and this is Disney, and so the film does suffer from a saccharine glaze at points, but for a family wanting to educate their children while entertaining them, this is actually really well done.  The weight of the average journey taken on by these majestic creatures is captured in a way that will educate, captivate and touch your whole family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6C7BSMUM6JCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPWERCO#wasThisHelpful","R6C7BSMUM6JCS","ANCOMAI0I7LVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANCOMAI0I7LVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just got these bags in yesterday from Amazon and promptly used them as I was cleaning up and throwing away a lot of stuff.  What I first noticed that while there is odor protection in these bags, the fragrance is not near as over-powering as the ones that I used last - the GLAD bags.  While I got used to the fragrance in the GLAD bags, I like the lighter fragrance with this bags from Hefty.  They seem strong as I stuffed these pretty full and they did not tear apart.  I also put in some liquid food stuffs and did not notice a leak (which unfortunately this is a problem with the GLAD bag (I always have to double bag with those if there is a lot of liquid).  These bags expand which helps with stuffing more garbage in but what I also like is that the draw string at the top expands so that the top actually will grip (hug) the garbage can so that it stays put (which is also a nice feature).  While I thought the GLAD bag was an improvement in garbage bags, I like this one better and think this is the one I will continue to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJTSX8VBPPF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBGVQE8#wasThisHelpful","RJJTSX8VBPPF8","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not had a George Foreman gill for a long time.  I got one when they first can out which as been quite a few years now.  It was small and tended to dry out the food.  My have things changed!  This is a lovely grill that is absolutely huge and what a joy that you can use it out on the patio or in the kitchen.  It has a removable stand (thus you can set it up to grill outside or take the stand off and use it on the kitchen counter.  This is a great solution for me as I am just not comfortable using my Weber grill because of having to get the charcoal just right.  I use a chimney and that certainly helps and honestly, I am a bit afraid of propane.  So, this is just a nice solution.  The one thing is that you need an outdoor electrical outlet as the grill is electric and while I suppose you could use a heavy duty extension cord, it is best to plug it in directly.  This grill as I said is huge and is big enough to serve 12 or more people depending on the size of your burgers, chicken, steak, etc.  It has a slanting surface which helps to drain the grease away which is the other reason I really like this grill is because it is more healthy cooking than some other methods.  I am glad that I tried this grill as I was not sold on the older versions but this is a really nice one.  I doubt that anyone looking for a nice grill (and does not want to mess with the clean up of a charcoal grill (or if you are like me and afraid of a propane grill), will be disappointed!

"This is a popular toy with my adopted grandkids.  The fact that it is Disney's Frozen characters makes it popular right off the bat.  It is an interactive toy with a brief musical interlude about building the snowman which even I find quite cute and intriguing.  This reminds me of toys that I played with (albeit updated version) but the bicycle, the dolls, all can be used for imaginative play.  I recommend this for children old enough not to put the smaller pieces in their mouth (I would say that this is the only draw back to the toy and thus why it has 4 stars vs. 5).Update - the kids have been playing with this toy for a bit now and unfortunately I am having to resend my initial review.  The durability of this toy is very poor, especially for the bicycle.  First of all, the bike's front wheel does not roll well and the dolls' feet do not stay on the pedals.  The main problem though is that the bike broke at several places within the structure and has since been abandoned.  The kids do like the dolls as they have jointed legs and arms and so they can play with them like they are marionettes.  This toy is a good idea and the girls still like the Frozen theme of the toy but over the long haul, this toy did not hold up well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UH2L53JDLFDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FDM60#wasThisHelpful","R2UH2L53JDLFDS","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I want to say I am writing this based on the taste of the bar.  It has that salty sweet thing going on that many people enjoy (me included).  It has a chocolaty (cocoa) drizzle on it which adds to the depth of taste.  I could really taste the nuts and it was crunchy and chewy at the same time.  It is supposed to have a hint of orange but I did not take that.  I can tell it is a health bar (if you know what I mean) as many of these bars that that ""taste"", (you know this is supposed to be good for you and not a candy).  I think a lot of people are going to love this thing.  Easy to carry (like a candy bar) but again, supposed to be good for you.Now, here is the problem for me, generally I am not allergic to nuts (except cashews) but I had not been munching on this thing for long before my mouth started itching.  Thank goodness I only ate a bit or two as I was busy doing other things and was just taking my time with it.  I wound up taking some Benadryl to stop the process.  Again, I am not usually allergic to stuff but I was to this.  The other bar i had difficulty with was a Kind Bar (it took me eating several of those bars before I had difficulty with it - same symptoms).  So, whether this bar is processes in a factory with other tree nuts like cashews (I did not find that the outside wrapper said this but I could have missed it) I am not sure but for those with potential allergies, I would say be careful.  This was really a surprise to me (although as i said I had trouble with the Kind bar).","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DE1XXL9M0CQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VK5SQO6#wasThisHelpful","R1DE1XXL9M0CQ7","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all Mead has been putting out quality products for years and this item is no exception.  The cover is simple and looks just like the picture which shows the item.  Also, as the description says, it has a plastic cover which not only protects the planner but it also can be used to hold loose items that you might need (which I find this a really good feature as I often has loose notes from my students about scheduling, etc., and I do not want to loose them but I often misplace them.  Having a specific place to keep them makes keeping up with them easier.  Most planners tend to go a calendar year but this one is an academic year starting in August.  This is also great for me as I teach and like to have the same planner for the school year without having to get another one in January when the new year starts.  This is great because I need notes and phone numbers, etc., for the entire school year and I do not have to worry about transferring the old info into a new planner in the middle of a year.  I also like this because (again as the description says and is a great feature) is that the month is spread over two pages and there is plenty of room to write appointments and there is a lot of room for notes.  If you are a teacher, this is a nice tool and it is big enough to keep a lot of information but it is not too big that you cannot put it in a backpack, large purse or briefcase/satchel. I have had a lot of planners but none of them have been ideal but I think this one is going to be and I think this would be a good tool for any educator!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SI5OJSXUUCI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCF9F6I#wasThisHelpful","R2SI5OJSXUUCI6","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these from Amazon yesterday and used them for house cleaning today.  I like them.  I often use Bounty paper towels and put soap on them to clean the kitchen counters, stove, etc.  These already have Dawn impregnated into the towels.  Once you put water on the towel, they soap up (in fact, they are really soapy.  You can rinse the towel and use it to remove the soapy film or use another regular paper towel (so I am not sure if I am saving  anything by using twice the paper towel for the cleaning but they sure do clean and cut the grease (which is why Dawn is a good product).  The towels are strong and convenient.  The reason for 4 starts vs. 5 is because of the above comment with using extra paper towels but also I accidentally pulled off a paper towel from the Dawn ones vs. a regular one to dry my hands and of course I got my hands soapy again.  So, you really need to make sure you keep these towels off the counter where they will be used for regular paper towels.

"This is an excellent resource for any teacher - experienced or otherwise.  You know you have an excellent text when you spent all of your lunch with a colleague talking about various aspects of the text (which I have did today)!  Stephen Brookfield captures much the emotion, angst, and joys of teaching.  One of the points that comes through is that you cannot please everyone and you cannot know everything there is to know about teaching.  I like the fact that ""muddling through"" can be a positive.  The chapter on understanding students"" resistance to learning is priceless as well as there are a lot of strategies talked about to build a working relationship with students for better learning. There is a nice section about teaching online (which is sorely needed).  As he says, online learning is going too be important to all faculty where you are teaching face-to-face and have a online supplement or actually teach a whole course online. He touches on some very sensitive topics as well including racism.  Much of what he talks about I have read about in other articles and resources.  I think the whole idea of micro-inequities is certainly a pertinent topic in today's diverse classroom.  This book is written so that anyone can understand it.  It is what I think is profound yet simple to understand.  In my own practice I have been discouraged at times because some of my students really do not like my teaching style, activities, and sometimes they just do not like me.  This book addresses this topic and helps one understand that this situation is going to be inevitable but there are things that one can do to improve some of it.  Sometimes the fact that you are doing your job (and doing it well) does not jive with some students.  Education equals change for the student and change can be threatening!  I highly recommend this book for any person that teaches at any level (K-12 or higher education).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8H5298APFTCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118450299#wasThisHelpful","R8H5298APFTCS","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have eaten other Fiber One products and liked them.  Generally I love anything ""cheesecake"" and especially strawberry but this was not my favorite product.  First of all, it is really a pretty tiny square; not that would make a difference as long as it tastes good.  This brings me to my second point, it has sort of an artificial taste.  When looking at the ingredients, I would not have expected it as I did not see a lot of artificial anything in the list.  My third issue is that after eating the bar, I had a weird after taste and it was not pleasant.  It is hard to describe but sort of a mineral (maybe slightly metallic) taste.  I did feel full after eating it though (which is probably because of the fiber - which it has quite a few grams).  So, if you can get past the taste, I think these might help one to feel full and eat less.  I just did not like them and will no buy them.

"My doctorate is in educational leadership (although my specialization is in curriculum development and instruction), so anything on educational leadership is going to peak my interest.  Jossey Bass publishing does put out some of the best materials on education, so I had a feeling this book would be valuable. As Thomas said in his review (Dean and professor at the University of North Texas), the strength of the book lies in its ""thoroughness"" and ""documentation"" of the recommendations for building academic leadership capacity.  While one tends to think of those in administration as being the leadership, the book indicates and talks a bit about how anyone can be a leader.  I think that is the value of this book is that the situation can dictate who will be a leader. The book talks about much of what I learned about in graduate school including change theory, reflection, systems approach,inclusion, and skills development.  There is also a nice resource guide in the appendix as well as several diagrams and charts that help to summarize key points.  I think this is an excellent resource for anyone in academia as all of us (at some point in time) are in leadership positions in some aspect of our careers.

"The first thing that struck me was the author.  When I ordered this book I had no idea that the author was ""Erin"" on the old TV show ""The Waltons.""  This was one of my mother's favorite shows especially the early shows where multi-generations were living together.  I think the author thus has had a lot of experiences from the show related to exploration of family situations from a multi-generation perspective which is indeed what the theme of this story is all about.  The book explores both the good and the not so good situations that affect the members of a family in the South (Virginia) to be specific (not unlike the part of the country that was key to the Waltons' TV show).  The second thing that struck me was how much reading is involved in this book.  This is a fairly lengthy tome and while the book is very interesting, it does take quite a bit of time to get through it.  I think overall that the quality of the writing and the story line is very good and certainly a book that I would recommend if you are attracted to novels that chronicle the life of a family and an interest in the Southern way of life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37Z4AM4SKYOVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758293496#wasThisHelpful","R37Z4AM4SKYOVI","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Christian based mystery so it does not have any adult language but the situations in the story do push the boundaries of what one would think of in a Christian novel (thus the 4 star rating).  With that being said, this story caught my attention pretty much from the start by taking off with a bang which includes a murder which is integral to the rest of the story.  There are lots of twists and turns including a romantic situation which keeps the reader interested.  The basic theme of the novel is how one's past ""sins"" catch up with one in the end especially when they are compounded by lies and regret.

I have read the reviews of some others that have reviewed this second season and I tend to agree.  It is too bad that a writing strike or some such thing limited the number of episodes during the second season and while I have liked some episodes better than others, what I am surprised about is that there is some pretty profound philosophy that comes out from some of the characters in some of the episodes.

The knives are very sharp and hopefully they will stay that way since they are surgical steel.  They are suppose to resist rust and tarnish which I would think would be the case (although over the long haul is the test) since again, they are made from surgical steel.  The blades are very shiny.  I like that they are light weight, feel fairly good in relationship to holding them in my hand and this is in part to the ergonomic design.  I was a bit worried about the plastic handles but I have been using these knives for a while now (using them everyday, putting them in the dishwasher, cutting up frozen chicken, etc.) and these knives are holding up well.  No cracks in the handles (which was my main worry) and they are staying sharp.  In fact, these are better than my Ginzu knives that I bought.

Penny, the main character and her dog move to the country and discover a murder, thus the beginning of the journey to finding the killer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJHY14LR86F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGQXDWE#wasThisHelpful","R1FJHY14LR86F8","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My old toothbrush bit the dust and I saw the reviews for this one on Amazon and thought I would give it a try before I bought another Rotodent.  At first I did not like the sound emitted by this toothbrush and I did not like the feel of it.  With continued use I got use to it and thought that it was doing a good job as my teeth looked clean and even a bit whiter after using it.  I liked the 30 second intervals and time system and the fact that it quit after two minutes which is as long as I would use it anyway.  I had been using this tooth brush at least 3 months or more and I started having a toothache.  This is significant as I have not had a cavity or a toothache for years (not since I started using the Rotodent back around 2004 of 2005).  I started using the Rotodent because of cavity issues.  I went to the dentist and indeed I had a cavity.  Even though I thought this brush was working, it just was not getting in-between my teeth and under the gum line like the Rotodent.  My dentist reluctantly agreed because he was hesitant to have me purchase a Rotodent because the product has changed since another company (not the original owners of the company) took over.  The Rotodent is not quite as smooth operating, you get less brush heads (2 instead of 4), and you no longer get a stand to hold your Rotodent for charging.  Also, the company will not stand by its warranty unless you buy the Rotodent from your dentist or from the online company listed on the Rotodent website (my dentist no longer sells them because of the warranty issue and the changes in the product).  I decided to take a chance and bought the Rotodent classic (the latest version of the product has terrible reviews) from dentist.com and I am OK with the product even though the company has changed.  I have been using the Rotodent now for about 3 weeks and I can already tell the difference in how my teeth feel.  I tried this Health HP product but the toothbrush head just is not fixed so that it goes in-between teeth and under the gum line like the Rotodent.  For me, that is what I need to prevent cavities.  It is too bad since I sort of liked this product but the proof of product effectiveness is the absence of cavities and I do not have that with this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MXVXFKPR32AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFB07FC#wasThisHelpful","R1MXVXFKPR32AO","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had this computer about 2 months now and I am still having a difficult time getting use to it.  I think I am fairly good at using a computer as I got my doctorate online and I work with a computer all the time in teaching.  However, I am having trouble finding files, getting the resolution and the size of the screens right.  One minute it is the right size for reading and the next it is too small (and I have no idea what I did to cause it).  I am finding it a bit easier to do the touch screen than using the keyboard (which is a bit of surprise).  It is probably the new Windows 8.1 system that is throwing me off but I also find the sound in this HP not nearly as good as my old HP Pavilion (and it is 8 years old and thus was the reason for buying a new computer).  The keyboard and the built-in mouse area feels a lot different to me.  My other computer the keys are smooth and the mouse control area is smooth under my fingers and the new computer, it is more of a texture feeling (this is kind of hard to describe) but I am just not as happy with the whole system and the ""feel"" of the computer.  I find the screen a bit more glaring and thus I had to buy one of those screen filters to put over the screen to decrease the glare (I did not have to do that with my old computer).  I am sure that eventually I will get the hang of it but I find that I am going back to use my old computer once I got a lot of the information off of it and cleaned it up to make it faster and run better.  I can't say if it is just me but I am not as impressed with this HP computer as I have been with those in the past and this is my 3rd or 4th one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EIO0BOZDG25W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PL0HRNC#wasThisHelpful","R1EIO0BOZDG25W","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the nicest tools in my kitchen.  I was really surprised about how nice this grater is when I opened the Amazon box.  It is a lot larger than I thought.  I have a rasp that I use for zesting limes and lemons and garlic, but it is quite small with little surface area compared to this tool.  This rasp grater has a nice weight to it and I really like the plastic cover that comes with it.  It just feels comfortable in my hand when in use.  I really think that if you are looking for a durable, useful rasp/grater, this is a great choice!Update - this is really the best tool I own in terms of using to grate zest and best of all garlic.  I have used a garlic press for years but find it hard to compress now that I have a bit or arthritis in my hands and the garlic is hard to get through the holes in the press in any major proportion to use in a recipe.  This tool grates it wonderfully.  I am just thrilled with this item and would not be without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZIANLJUVKQ6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8BP7FA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZIANLJUVKQ6Y","A2263F1WASP2PG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2263F1WASP2PG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hard core Christian themed novel.  The main character is subject to a life review and has to deal with the traumatic and ""ugly"" things in her life.  It is about choices that one makes and the choices that others' make that can impact the lives of not only ourselves but those around us.  As I always say in recent years, Christian books take liberty with subject matter.  This book would not be for everyone.  Not only does it have a very hard core Christian theme but it deals with sexual situations, incest, rape, abortion, and bigotry within the Church.  It has a supernatural overlay dealing with angels and demons.  So, again, this is not a book for all on many different levels.  Those sensitive to subjects as mentioned prior and would be offended or disturbed by reading this type of material, this book is not for you.

"While one can never tell for sure about the success of a product like this until one has used it for a while, I do have to say that I think my toenails are better even after just a couple of days or so of application.  I like that there is no odor to the product, I cannot feel anything when it goes on.  My skin around my nail is slightly less red.  Most products that go on topical have a hard time penetrating the nail and therefore do not work very well, but I really think this product is worth a try.  I will write more later after I use this for a while but this product has a good beginning as I am definitely happier with a natural product vs. a systemic anti-fungal that might have a lot of side-effects.Update - I have been using this a while and unfortunately, it is not taking care of the problem.  The package says that you might need to use more than one bottle but I am not going to spend my money.  As a nurse I have read that topical treatments just will not work.  You need a systemic medicine or they are now talking about laser working.  You need to see a podiatrist and follow his/her recommendations.  While I really had hopes that this product would be a topical that would work, it does not.

"I like the regular Starburst as they have nice fruit flavors and they have a slight ""milky"" taste and feel.  While the flavors are OK in the minis, I am just not a fan of the texture of these.  They do not seem to have the same mouth watering production in the mouth and they definitely do not have that slightly milky feel and taste.

"I have been looking forward to another installment of this series.  This is actually one of my favorites from this author as well as the Corduroy Mansions series.  While the synopsis on the back of the book taunts this story as a mystery with a bit of paranormal overtones (and it is) but what I find most interesting is the discussion of philosophical topics.  This look is loaded with ""food for thought"" brought about through Isabel and her husband Jamie (which is really who I think the story is ultimately about - these two characters).  There is discussion about death, life after death, politics, spirituality, sex, and of course ultimately relationships and happiness (which is indicated by the title).  These books are ones to be savored.  It is not your typical cozy mystery where you can read straight through.  This book is one that takes a few days to ponder and as I said savor.

"This is an excellent book.  As one can surmise from the title, it is very Christian based. so if you are not interested in the Christian faith and the church in a global sense, this is not the book for you.  I found this book fascinating.  As the title indicates, the author found herself ""called"" by God to explore how Christianity is lived in other countries.  This is the everyday worship of God and the how the Christian faith plays out in 5 different countries including Wales (in the UK), Brazil, China, Tanzania. and Honduras.  This is a very intimate and personal view from Ms. Hudson's viewpoint.  As the author says, this book is about expanding one's horizons related to our spirituality and our faith.

The author is at the beginning of his life and the Nun, she is at the end (thus the 5 year time limit on this relationship).  There is a lot of truth, wisdom, and contemplation in this story.

"It would surely be a tough task to abridge Thoreau’s “Walden” enough to fit into a 32-page picture book. (Heck, it took Henry seven years, seven complete drafts, and lots of thought to create the original and longer version.) You would also have to make sure that your selections did justice to the main intent and message of the classic. And additionally, you would have to gauge that the quotes were simple enough for a young audience to understand and to enjoy, too. Whew! But you know what? Steve Lowe chose wisely. This storyline makes sense. Appearing here is Thoreau’s reason for going to live at Walden Pond, as well as his reason for leaving it after two years, two months, and two days. We share a few of his experiences and nature observations along the way.  And Robert Sabuda in turn provides good visualizations to match the words. It’s a short but somehow complete presentation.The four-star ranking comes as a result of the introduction written by long-time Thoreau Lyceum director Anne McGrath. For years, Anne did much good work in promoting Henry to visitors to Concord. Her passion for all things Henry knew no bounds. I’m sorry I never had a chance to meet her. Unfortunately, I’m disappointed in her biographical summary here. The gist of it is okay; but a lot of the details are not quite correct. To elementary and middle grade students who are inspired to learn more facts about the rest of Thoreau’s life, I recommend that they look elsewhere. But enjoy Lowe and Sabula’s book as a step into one part of his history.Three more Walden-related Thoreau picture books have been published since this book was released. Henry David's House also uses quotes from the book “Walden.” They’re longer than the ones here, and they tell only the story of how Henry built his pond-side house and how he lived in it. It doesn’t get into his reason for going to the pond in the first place, and it doesn’t mention the fact that he left after two years. Readers may get the idea that he stayed there for the rest of his life.The Trouble with Henry: A Tale of Walden Pond is a fictional story based loosely on Thoreau’s reputation among his Concord neighbors. Here, people think he’s odd and crazy until he shows them the great things he finds in nature and at Walden Pond. Too bad these final scenes didn’t happen in real life! It’s a fun story, though. The book concludes with a decent summary bio that could lead readers to learn more on their own.If You Spent a Day with Thoreau at Walden Pond (Christy Ottaviano Books) synthesizes Thoreau’s approach to nature, to Walden Pond, and to life, in a what-if style format. It fantasizes that a young person has met Henry at Walden and is learning from him. It’s a terrific way to put readers right into what they’re seeing on the colorful pages.  The book concludes with a selection of Thoreau quotes. And Wendell Minor’s illustrations throughout the text are soft and enticing.So. Young folks (and anyone who reads these books to or with them) now have a number of options to choose from.  All while they’re still too young to read and understand the original “Walden” for themselves.Corinne H.

"Portland, Oregon, has city code ordinances against graffiti vandalism. This doesn’t stop some young people and amateur artists from arming themselves with cans of spray paint and filling what they see as blank canvases all around them. One teenager named Kelly has taken the art to a whole new level – literally – as she combines her love of mountain climbing with her slightly illegal love of tagging. Lawyer Cal Claxton doesn’t know it yet, but the artwork he suddenly spots halfway up the side of his downtown office building (Caffeine Central) was created by Kelly.The trouble is, when you’re out and about during the darkest hours of the city, you may see things you’d be better off not seeing. Kelly is perched high above a street one night when she witnesses a deadly shooting that takes place below her. She scrambles out of the killer’s sight, she thinks, and is injured in the process. Now she has to make sure that no one discovers that she is “K209.” In spite of the danger, though, she’s curious enough to start figuring out on her own the identity of the killer she thinks of as “Macho Dude.” What is really happening in Portland?Cal also has connections to this murder. The victim was Claudia Borrego, the fiancé of Cal’s office landlord and friend, Hernando Mendoza. Nando asks Cal for support and for help in learning about the reasons and the responsible parties behind Claudia’s death. Cal is eager to lend an investigative hand, while he tries at the same time not to interfere with the efforts of the local police force. By now he already has “history” with some of its members. He too begins to track down the primary players in this tragic tri-fold drama.The chapters of this book alternate between the first-person narrative of main character Cal and the third-person story of young artist Kelly. As you may expect, the separate paths of the lawyer-investigator and the teenage painter begin to narrow as both of them start following similar leads. This is a great tension-building technique chosen by the author. And by the halfway point of the book, we don’t want to leave either character. We keep reading and turning pages, hoping against hope that the two will soon come together and team up against the evil parties. We also want Cal to be able to help Kelly out of whatever trouble she may find herself in (or vice versa), because this incident is obviously bigger than just the untimely death of one woman and two men. The trail unfortunately seems to stop at a city gun shop. And too many guns are involved. Still, we expect justice to be served to the killer(s) in the end.If you’re a mystery lover, you MUST read this book.  And be sure to read the first two episodes in the series, too:  Matters of Doubt and Dead Float. I guarantee that once you reach the midway point of any one of these books, you won’t want to stop.

"It's May 1848, and once again, there's trouble going on in Plumford, Massachusetts. This time the problems surround those residents who have chosen to become part of the Underground Railroad. Ezra Tripp, one of the ""conductors,"" is killed in the line of duty, and his ""shipment"" -- the young woman he was transporting -- is now missing. Leave it to Henry David Thoreau to find Tripp's body and to start piecing together what's going on.This book is the third episode of the trilogy, following Thoreau at Devil's Perch and Thoreau on Wolf Hill. And although it can stand on its own merit, you should read the others first to get a firm grasp of background. In any event, you'll soon see that the narrative is told in first-person tag-team style through chapter-length journal entries written in the alternating points of view of Dr. Adam Walker and his non-blood cousin and now-girlfriend, artist Julia Pelletier. (Ironically, the story is NOT told through Henry's writings, even though he would become famous for his journal ruminations after he was gone.)Emotions are running high in the New England anti-slavery movement these days. Thoreau's mother, aunts, and sisters participate in rallies and sign written proclamations.  And Henry has been known to help a former slave or two reach a railroad station in order to continue the journey north. The roads seem to be filled today with any number of dubious travelers: especially those men who may be wearing disguises and may be bounty hunters, looking for runaways. They make decent suspects in Tripp's murder. As does Julia's French husband, once a slave trader himself, who shows up from Europe unexpectedly. Julia made such a mistake marrying this guy! She would like nothing better than to see him jailed or otherwise out of the picture. If she can pin a murder on him at the same time, so much the better. In the meantime, she does some investigating on her own and finds important evidence in the case, so to speak. Unfortunately, other ""conductor"" murders seem to create an even more disturbing pattern.Adding to the mystery is the fact that Tripp was killed at the edge of Phantom Bog. Did the slave or even the murderer fall and drown underneath its sphagnum mat? When Henry, Adam, and a group of men from town tiptoe across the moss and do some probing, they find only bodies of decaying animals. But they also see a wispy visage of a young woman, rising from the mist. What really happened here? And can Adam, Julia, or Henry located the missing runaway before the bounty hunters do?If you're a savvy mystery reader, you may discover the one perfect clue that points directly to the identity of the murderer. Other readers will no doubt skim right past it. And that's okay. Either way, the story makes for good reading.  And rest assured: justice will be served in the end.There are hints at the beginning and the end of this story that something romantic was going on between Henry and Lidian, wife of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Some Thoreau fans (including this reader) will grouse and grimace at this implication. But if you've read Amy Belding Brown's novel Mr. Emerson's Wife and agree with the same conclusion, you may feel the repeating of the supposition is warranted here.I have met and corresponded with the authors, Ben and Beth Oak, and they are a delightful couple. I know they work hard to maintain historical accuracy. They are also devoted Thoreauvians who portray the man as close to historical record as they can. Alas! This third book appears to be the last in the series. For the same reason that Henry Thoreau left his Walden Pond house after two years -- ""Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one"" -- the Oaks have decided to listen to the voices of the many other projects that beckon them.  They leave us to consider on our own the future of Adam and Julia and the rest of the people of Plumford. We can predict where the couple is headed. And we definitely know that Henry Thoreau will soon be sitting down to polish his writing of a book called ""Walden.""""Thoreau in Phantom Bog"" is recommended as solid historical fiction, as an intriguing murder mystery, and as good entertainment for a few days' worth of reading. I recommend reading the other two episodes first.[I was given a free advance reading copy of this book by the authors, with no expectation of a written review of any kind: positive, neutral, or negative.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US66F9N95K7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758290276#wasThisHelpful","R1US66F9N95K7Y","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the longest time, the standard reference for Henry David Thoreau's correspondence has been Harding and Bode's 1958 The correspondence of Henry David Thoreau. It's more than 650 pages long, and it goes well beyond the scope of any previous volumes that contained random letters.  I have to admit that I once spent some time and money standing by a library copy machine to create the copy I now keep in a purple three-ring binder in my office.But now, voila! As part of the long-range Princeton project for Thoreau writings, this first volume of Correspondence was released in 2013. The project is known for its meticulous detail, its deliberate publication pace ... and its hefty purchase prices. The plan was to go back to the original manuscripts and to fully update the 20-volume set of writings from 1906.  The team has finished ""Walden,"" ""A Week,"" and the other ""books,"" as well as about half of the journal. Finally, here's the first Correspondence volume.  The first!  Two more will follow! Because as the decades have passed, many more letters have come to light, and much more context has been deciphered. It will take three books to cover it all. Amazing.Major kudos in this effort go to Correspondence editor Robert N. Hudspeth. I admire Bob's diligence in locating all of the references for each and every letter. I've even offered some tidbits to him that may appear in several entries in the third volume.But even if I didn't have any knowledge of the people and the work behind the scenes, I would value this publication. I'm happy to still use the two-volume Dover reprint of Thoreau's journals, unabridged yet condensed in format from the 14 volumes of the 1906 edition. And I'll recommend them every time to individual users and to public and school libraries.  These folks don't ""need"" and usually can't afford the Princeton editions of the journals. But Correspondence is a different matter. This new publication doesn't mark a mere update. It's a major overhaul and monster addition. The three volumes will eventually become the standard reference for Thoreau's letters. In the meantime, we have to satisfy ourselves by pairing this first one with Harding-Bode for semi-complete coverage.I've already consulted this volume to confirm the text of several letters as part of my own research.  But on some long weekend in the future, I plan to sit down and read this book from cover to cover.  I know I'll learn a lot about Thoreau, his friends, and the mid-19th century by doing this.And I won't recycle the pages of my Harding-Bode notebook just yet. I won't drop them in the bin until I have the second and third Correspondence volumes both lodged firmly in my grasp. I know the rest of the process will take a while. But for this unique set, it will certainly be worth the wait.Corinne H.

"Self-improvement books abound. Yes, other titles can help you devise a strategy for dealing with clutter and for tidying up your home. Other books can motivate you to get your life back on its intended and most purposeful track, one way or another.  Many also employ visualization techniques in order to reach your goals. What's the big deal about having one more book addressing these subjects? Well, this one is different.  John Benz's approach is a deeper and more comprehensive one.  It turns out that a lot of our problems, negative attitudes, and most frustrating issues can be linked to two things that make up a large part of our lives: residual ""stuff,"" and residual personal relationships.  Here we learn how to dispatch and remedy our associations with both.The first half takes on the task of ""clearing your possessions.""  This act goes beyond just cleaning up a room or sorting through the litter on a cluttered table. Which items make you feel powerful?  Which ones make you think only of stressful times or annoying people?  Scrutinize each and every item, make your decisions, and get rid of the ones with the negative vibes.  They've been bogging you down without you even realizing it.The second half is all about ""clearing your residual relationships."" Think of personal encounters from your past that ended badly. Benz explains how you can resolve them by confronting the individual, apologizing, and forgiving.  You can visualize a new ending to every story, make it happen, and clear the way to a brighter future.Of course, I've oversimplified his process here, for the sake of providing basic information.  Benz goes into much more detail in his text. He has devised specific steps for the actions he recommends. He gives real-life examples. He explains why it's important to follow the method.  He shares client successes (with names and facts altered, for confidentiality). His plan may take a lot more thought and more time to apply than any others.  But he assures us that the results can be more fruitful and lasting.I've read my share of de-cluttering books and can attest that Benz's approach is fresh, different, and interesting.  Some may think it's far too complex.  But anyone can be motivated by anything at any time.  For many people, this approach will be the perfect one to help them take charge and to improve their lives.  At the very least, it'll give readers ideas. Benz advises that all of the steps must be taken in order for the plan to work.  And admittedly, a lot of people will want to shortchange the system.  He cautions us not to pick and choose what we want from his recommendations.  But of course, people will. I myself have decided to do a streamlined version of the possessions-clearing portion.  I honestly don't think I have any residual relationship problems to resolve.  (Maybe Benz would convince me otherwise, in person.)The book is well written.  At 304 pages, it's too long for anyone who is looking for a quick fix. You have to really want to change your habits to stick with Benz all the way through to the end. Naturally, there are some ways the information could have been presented that would have made the process a bit more user-friendly.  The pages outlining the steps could have been typed in form style, like typical full-page worksheets.  They could have all been reprinted in the back of the book, for easy access and for copying to use in each instance.  Benz could even have made them available on his web site, with password protection for purchasers of the book.John Benz is more than a therapist. He's a cheerleader, eager to champion your good efforts.  But he's also a tough taskmaster.  If you choose not to follow each step and to go the distance, he will be quick to explain why you'll soon return to your old habits. Overall, this is a good and thoughtful book.  It does have the power to change lives. In order to do so, however, the reader has to devote his/her full attention, commitment, and participation.[I was given a free paperback copy by the author in exchange for a fair-minded review.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHD8N9XCNUG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150238552X#wasThisHelpful","R1GHD8N9XCNUG6","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been reviewing books here since 1999.  At one time, I was ranked as a Top 500 reviewer.  I've fallen back, in recent years.  But my name is still on mailing lists for folks who are frantic to get reviewers for their books. And now I get besieged by companies selling various ""products,"" who seem desperate to get as many good online words associated with their items as possible, in attempts to attract customers.  I ignore most of their requests.  I said yes to Clear-Ad because I knew I could use the brochure holder after I wrote this review.As another reviewer has suggested: This brochure holder is a little thinner than its competitors.  It's fine.  It works well on an undisturbed desk or counter.  What does it need to do, anyway?  Stand straight and tall without wobbling.  Hold what is put into it. Not collect a lot of dust and dander.  For this last requirement, two slots at the bottom of this holder appear to have this job.  I assume they're there so that dust doesn't accumulate and so the holder never requires much rinsing out.  Please note that this holder also slants back at a bit of an angle, so that brochures more directly meet the standing customers' eyes.  As a result, it's not a candidate for wall installation, so there's no need for holes on the back. And it's a little wider than a standard brochure or rack card is. So if your publicity people decide not to go with that standard width (or don't know what it is), the printed promotion may still fit in here nicely.I recommend this product, especially if you're just going to keep it on your counter or desk and not move it around constantly.  If you want take it along to trade shows as part of a display on your vendor table, you should pack material around it in your traveling cases so that the back doesn't break.  If you do lots of these kinds of mobile presentations, then maybe a more solid and durable holder is the right product for you.  Otherwise, this one is just fine.

"Ian Marshall has found another way to bring mountains and literature together. In Story Line: Exploring the Literature of the Appalachian Trail, he paired sections of the Appalachian Trail with pieces of literature that were representative of each region.Here, he uses Abraham Maslow's psychological ""Hierarchy of Needs"" as a foundation for mountain and personal exploration. We go along with Marshall as he hikes with the spirit of fulfilling basic human needs, even while he relates the experience to appropriate literary references. Got it?  Whew!  It makes sense when you read it.  And aside from the psychology and the literature: ""It is the purpose of this book to remind us why we need the earth, why we need to make contact with earth, why we experience renewal there."" (p. 4) These are worthy goals.The five chapters take us to five different mountains or regions in North America, as we also scale the sides of Maslow's pyramid.  The accompanying literature selections are: Henry David Thoreau's ""Walden;"" Homer's ""The Odyssey;"" Pattiann Rogers's poems; John Muir's essays; and Walt Whitman's ""Song of Myself.""But the narrative isn't filled with serious stuff all the time. This is not an overly scholarly tome.  It's fun and compelling.  It contains many thought-provoking moments, posing questions about life and nature and priorities and such. Along the way, Marshall isn't afraid to put his own story into the mix, or to bring one of his children along on his hikes.  He reveals what's happening in his own life: both the good and the not-so. He gets downright poetic himself, especially in the Whitman section. ""Song of Myself"" is conveniently divided into 52 cantos.  So Marshall takes the text with him up the nearest mountain to his home in central Pennsylvania, once a week, for a year.  The object is to see how Whitman's classic relates to the mountain, to Marshall, and to the population at large.  What a great idea!  Some readers may be prompted to do the same after experiencing this project vicariously on the page.When you read ""Peak Experiences,"" you may want to have two other books at your side.  I recommend borrowing a library copy of Pattiann Rogers' Song of the World Becoming: Poems, New and Collected, 1981-2001, which is what I did to get the most from the third chapter.  I wasn't familiar with her poetry; and the additional collection contains every poem referenced by Marshall.  This way, you can read each one in its entirety and separately, away from Marshall's comments and explanations.  You may also want to have a copy of Whitman's Leaves of Grass: The Original 1855 Edition handy so that you have the full text of the poem, ""Song of Myself."" You can follow Marshall's 52-week journey with Walt, and maybe find your own mountain to celebrate it with.I recommend this book to lovers of nature writing; to those who like hiking stories; and to fans of Thoreau, Muir, Whitman, Rogers, Homer, and/or Maslow.  You're sure to find some new ideas, insights, and perspectives here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HAIOBUP2LDO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813921678#wasThisHelpful","R1HAIOBUP2LDO1","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have to appreciate the thought that went into the design of this clear glass teapot.  The pink butterfly knob on the lid is said to represent change for the better.  The dots on the handle and the sides are like drops of tea; and the intermingling lines on the sides represent waves.  This is creative but serious stuff. And what the folks at Tea Beyond want you to do most with this teapot is to use it in combination with their blooming teas. (Tea Beyond Tea Combo FLS-TCBO-FJEC001 Fab Flowering tea plus assorted whole leaf tea)I conducted the blooming tea experiment in my workplace to share with others.  The flowery directions (such as they are) didn't specify whether or not the glass infuser needed to be in the pot during the ""blooming.""  But it looked absent in the photos, so we went without it.  This was the right thing to do. Otherwise, there's no room for the flower to grow correctly.Each bloom begins about the size of a large marble.  After you pour hot water (acquired from another source, please, as this container is not stove-top safe) into the clear glass teapot, the mass begins to bloom and expand.  The tea that results is very light in taste and in color.  It's not overpowering, but not it's very memorable, either. My co-workers felt the same way.I think the pot and the blooms would make a unique centerpiece, or a host beverage for an intimate gathering of no more than three people.  The pot is rather small; but it does keep the tea warm for longer than you may expect.  You can keep adding hot water regularly, too.You'll also have to be respectful of the delicate nature of this glassware.  It could easily be broken. My everyday teapot is a heavy one, made of dark brown ceramic.  I chose it deliberately so that it would be durable for daily use, and so I wouldn't have to be diligent about washing it thoroughly between brews. (!)  It's perfect for me.  This clear glass teapot is too dainty.  I'm sure someone else out there will find it a perfect match, though.The blooming teas and the teapot didn't wow me.  I'm glad I had the chance to try them.

"This nicely-wrapped box consists of 10 items: two resealable packets each of three loose premium teas (Jasmine Green, Earl Grey Black, and Caramel Black); and four of Tea Beyond's tea blooms, especially for use with its clear glass teapot.

I'm not much of a fan of the Caramel Black, however.  It had a dusty taste, I thought.  This is probably a matter of personal preference and not an indication of its quality.  For reference: When I'm left to my own devices on a typical day, I throw three bags into the pot: one of store-brand green tea, one of brand-name black tea, and one of Celestial Seasonings' Nutcracker Suite.

"These days, aspiring and veteran authors can find and attend writers' conferences in just about every nook and cranny of the planet.  Decades ago, this wasn't the case.  And one of the most notable series was the Fiction International gatherings sponsored by St. Lawrence University and held at Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks.  From 1975-1979, this beautiful setting served as the backdrop for some thoughtful conversations about the act and art of writing, among folks who knew what they were talking about.  (And went on to know even MORE about writing, as the years have passed.)  Here, via printed transcripts and archival photos, we can transcend both time and place and put ourselves right back into those audiences, with a volume that is singular in both content and physical format.We can eavesdrop on individual interviews with Margaret Atwood, Joyce Carol Oates, Ann Beattie, Annie Dillard, Gail Godwin, Jayne Anne Phillips, and Russell Banks.  We can replay discussions that involved some of those writers, as well as John Hawkes, William Kittredge, Robie Macauley, Carolyn Forche, Rosellen Brown, E. L. Doctorow, Charles Simmons, Maxine Groffsky, Nancy Nicholas, Daniel Halpern, G. E. Murray, and Annabel Levitt, and additionally Joe David Bellamy, who hosted the conferences and who edited this volume.  You'll hear a variety of voices from a variety of writers and writing-related professionals.  You can fill in the blanks of the successes have that since followed some of these folks.  In the later years, a continuing topic centers on the ideas raised by John Gardner in On Moral Fiction. in 1978.  You'll also get a glimpse into some writing processes, and what the publishing world looked like back then.  Before the Internet.  Before Amazon.  Before self-publishing could be masterfully achieved with a few clicks on a few keys and with electronic delivery.This hardback book is simply a joy to hold and to behold.  It was produced to look like an old-fashioned binding, with cloth-looking boards and a leather-like spine.  It's delightfully smooth to the touch.  It's heavier than it looks too, at 3 lbs.  The front cover has a round die-cut that allows an archival b&w scene to show through from the flyleaves.  And the reader's fingers will find it as well.The back cover summary ambitiously predicts: ""Open the covers of this book to become part of a special exchange that will forever change the way you live your writing life.""  I don't believe these pages will result in life-changing experiences for each writer.  For some, it may.  For anyone who aspires to be a writer, any book on writing or any conference can become a jump-starter.  It all begins with an eagerness to listen to the mentors.

"Daphne Michaels is a psychotherapist who conducts her own motivational programs in Tacoma, Washington.  This book is the first installment of a five-part series on these Gifts, ""the principles that guide the Daphne Michaels Institute.""  It can therefore be seen as a promotional piece for her seminars.  Which is fine.Each chapter here outlines one of the nine Gifts:  Awareness, Potential, Stillness, Disharmony, Harmony, Ease, Clarity, Freedom, and Engagement.  Most of them have additional sub-qualities associated with them, too.  Michaels defines what she means by these concepts and how important each presence is in our lives.  She's really just reminding us of what our instincts and inner voices should already be telling us -- although the Gift of Disharmony may sound a little counter intuitive and startling at first.  She concludes with a four-sentence paragraph, saying that if we deliberately acknowledge and live with these concepts, we will be able to ""live the life of our dreams.""  This advice is kind of like what we hear when the Beatles sing ""All You Need is Love.""  (Though love is NOT one of the Gifts outlined here, nor is it a sub-quality of any of those identified.)  These nine Gifts are all we need, Michaels implies.I like how she makes her points, then continues to reference and to link them from one section to another.  The writing is well thought out and polished.  The trouble is that the audience is given no takeaway, nothing to think about or to do in response.  At least a chapter-end series of questions or suggested activities would have made her philosophies more relevant to the average reader.  The book ends up being a theoretical lecture, and not an interactive or empowering experience.  And just like those old Lennon and McCartney lyrics, the message sounds wonderful at first.  You're eager to sing along.  It's only when you think about it later that you question the practicality of it all.  You ask yourself how you're going to implement the advice.  And the songsters can't help you.  They've already moved on to the next town.Michaels probably wants to use this book as a teaser, a customer attractor for her seminars.  And she doesn't want to give away all of her material for under $15.  Fine.  But if she markets this title to a wider population who will never venture to Washington state for a personal encounter, then she needs to give those readers an extra nudge to get started on their course of self-improvement.  Questions, considerations, exercises, some tangible somethings. Maybe a link to special offerings on her website.  Otherwise, it's all in the clouds.Ms. Michaels likes to use metaphors; so here's one to describe this book.  It's a recipe for living more fully and authentically.  The author gives us a list of nine ingredients.  And that's it.  We don't know whether to mix them together in equal amounts, bake them, broil them, or toss them into the air to see where they land.  Maybe it's enough to merely gather them together on a table and stare at them until something magical happens.At any given time, any individual can be motivated by any book, any person, or any experience.  The Ripple Effect can show up at any time.  The bottom line is that this general conceptual approach may be all that's needed to gently prod some people into living a fuller life -- or even to seek out the programs at the Daphne Michaels Institute.  I suspect that the larger majority, however, like me, will want and expect more concrete examples and more definitive ways to put these theories into practice.  Without them, we can just breeze through the chapters, put the book down when we reach the end, and then say, ""Okay, I understand the importance of these Gifts.  Now what do I do?""[I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WVY5BPYW5Q9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991468902#wasThisHelpful","R1WVY5BPYW5Q9W","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Trogdon made his now-famous cross-country back-roads drive in 1978.  His subsequent book Blue Highways: A Journey into America was released in December 1982, more than 30 years ago, under the name William Least Heat Moon.  How did he transform himself from traveler and interviewer-photographer to author?  How did his experiences finally reach the printed page?  These are the subjects of this memoir.  And they form an interesting story:  one ""more of labor than luck, more of fight than fate, but it also wasn't without those other two elements."" (p. 133)We have the advantage of knowing how this tale ends. We know the book will come out and that it will become a bestseller.  But the process of getting there -- yikes!  It's enough to drive a sane person to craziness.  And that's one of the points.  This business of writing and publishing may be one of the most frustrating endeavors ever devised by mankind.  (Witness ""Eleven Thoughts on Rejection Dejection,"" p. 77.)Heat-Moon walks us through the process:  through various drafts and readers and submissions and rejections ... until the magic day arrives at last, when someone says Yes.  But more writing and negotiation must take place first.  Many months pass, and at last he is PUBLISHED.  Along with the release date comes the emotional tumult realized in seeing the tangible manifestation of one's work.  It's a satisfying feeling.  For a short time.  Then as other authors do, he finds he has to move on to the next project.He concludes with more specific advice for writers, outlining the kinds of references and resources we should have at our fingertips.  Some are classics, and some may be new to most writer-readers.  This book is therefore recommended to both Blue Highways fans and to writers of all kinds.This book happened to come my way just as I was under deadline to produce a finished manuscript myself.  Instead of working on my own chapters, I chose to take a few days off to read William's book.  I'm glad that I did.  His words reassured me that I should be able to survive and succeed.  If he did it, I can too.  Thanks!I owned a copy of Blue Highways back in the day.  It has since found another home.  (The bulky silhouette of PrairyErth: A Deep Map, however, is quite noticeable on the shelf.)  I may need to get another copy and travel down those roads again.  I'm quite certain that the original book (along with others, like On the Road with Charles Kuralt) pointed me toward the possibilities.  It helped to prod me to get out and explore the countryside past the interstates in the 1990s, 2000s, and today.  Double thanks!~ Corinne H.

"What a terrific idea!  Compile a volume of 44 of Garrison Keillor's best stories and poems.  His admirers can then sit down with him and hear them again in person, this time with additional words of explanation.  A few b&w photos are even sprinkled in for good measure; and at least one of them will generate a giggle or three.If you listen to ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (APHC) on NPR on Saturday nights ... if you've attended a live broadcast ... if you've seen his one-man shows in person ... if you've read at least one of his Lake Wobegon books -- then some of this material will sound familiar.  Nevertheless, It's all good, as the saying goes.  Each story comes with introductory remarks from the author himself that give insights into the background, the characters, or even into the writing process.  The selections venture well beyond the region of Lake Wobegon and Minnesota.  As with most of his tales, the audience can never really be sure where the memoir ends and the fabrication begins.  That's part of the fun.  His people seem to get themselves into quirky situations that are all too plausible in real life.  And yes, a shortened version of the pontoon boat story appears early on in the text.Here we hear his voice rise off the printed page, in the style to which we've become accustomed.  Mr. Keillor is one of the most creative and prolific writers of all time -- a true lover of language and a master of description -- and we are fortunate enough to share the planet with him.  When we consider his career, we have to wonder how the man has time to do it all.  He is constantly penning poems and stories for books, columns, live appearances, the weekly radio show, and more.  Yet he made the effort to create a unique and substantial book in this one, and not simply a literary greatest hits volume of pieces that could be found elsewhere or that everybody already knows.  You may even shake your head or laugh out loud as you follow along.  Don't rush!  Take your time and savor the moments.  Please also note that the nuances of some selections may come with an R rating.  (Including a poem that no publisher wanted to touch, until now.)I'm especially glad to come upon the inclusion of Mr. Keillor's New York Times review of the first volume of Mark Twain's autobiography.  It's a classic on its own.  He's honest about a book that he could easily have given a mere and courteous nod to.  Instead, he points out its many inconsistencies and failings.  It was the bravest stand he could take.I became one of his fans and admirers after picking up Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories in the late 1980s.  When I turned a page and saw the line, ""Corinne doesn't believe in God, but there is some evidence to show that God believes in her,"" I had to say out loud, ""Whoa!  How does he know me so well?""  Anyway:  Yes, I've read several of his books; and I have witnessed his performances and the APHC broadcasts in person many times over the past ten years.  When I learned that this new reader was in the works, I knew I wanted to get a copy as soon as it was released.""The Keillor Reader"" will not merely appease APHC and GK fans (although it will do this job thoroughly and sincerely).  It should also be welcomed by fellow and aspiring writers:  both for the back stories that Mr. Keillor provides, and for the example he sets in his own writing style.  (If you REALLY want to know the secret of how ""the news from Lake Wobegon"" gets done, turn immediately to page 35.)  And if you like what you find here, you'll be happy to know that you can always hear more.  Just tune your radio to the proper station each Saturday night, or go back and read one of his previous books.  There are many to choose from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNTNZFDTOBDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670020583#wasThisHelpful","RNTNZFDTOBDB","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The famous Gutenberg Bible.  We all know that it was the first major book to be published on a printing press with movable type, instead of being handwritten by humans.  But what's the story behind the basic facts?  This is what Alix Christie explores here in her first novel.The tale is told through the eyes of Peter Schoeffer, a young but experienced scribe who is apprenticed to help Johann Gensfleisch, the man known as Gutenberg.  Peter's adopted father Johann Fust is the merchant who is backing Gutenberg's project.  We hear the details here in retrospect, when Peter describes to someone else just how the Bible came to fruition, as he looks back about twenty years after its publication.  Enough time has passed and enough people are gone that he feels safe enough to reveal the whole story.This is the 15th century, a time that would later be referred to as the Early Renaissance.  The town of Mainz is Germanic, but there is no Germany.  This region is instead part of the Holy Roman Empire, a church-dominated society with a complex hierarchy of archbishops and cardinals and elders and such, all operating beneath the auspices of the pope in Rome.  And there are decrees and bans and indulgences and seemingly, a lot of tension all around.  Add to this mix a man like Gutenberg, who creates this new and exciting and revolutionary process that has to be employed in near secrecy, else the church officials or the powerful guilds discover it and take it away from him.  And then they may see fit to remove him and his associates from that society as well.  It's a near miracle that he finds any success at all.  And IS it truly success?Once Peter designs and carves the type, and once the decision is made for the first major print job to be a Bible -- a rather long and ambitious text, don't you think? -- the stress increases exponentially on the small handful of Gutenberg's men.  Peter is caught in the middle between his two mentors, the visionary and the funder.  At the same time, he's working daily with Latin verses that seem to grow more sacred and more personal with the turning of each beautiful page.  It takes two years for the shop to produce the book.  TWO YEARS!  And even as they set type and roll out paper or vellum and pull the presses, the workers are always looking over their shoulders, always wondering when the project will be interrupted or ended by lack of funds, by technical problems, by church interference ... or even by Gutenberg's unintentional self-sabotage.  And even though this narrative advances nicely for us readers too, it sometimes seems to take just as long for us to read about it as it took them to print the actual books.I chose to read this novel out of book-lover curiosity, even though I'm more comfortable with American settings and with events of the last two centuries.  This historical period is thus not one that I know well or really, at all.  At times I felt as if it confounded me, and that I surely didn't understand the nuances of all of the politics and the pervasiveness of the Catholic church and the craftsman guilds.  I glossed over a few of the more confrontational scenes: not because I wasn't interested in them, but because I couldn't quite get the sense of their importance and what the relationships were of the authorities involved.  Maybe an opening chart of Empire hierarchy or an introductory note of historical background would have helped me.  Still, Christie's work here is quite good, and it represents a tremendous achievement for a first-time novelist who herself also has a background in the printing process.I am VERY glad that I read this book.  Its story will stay with me for a good long time.  I recommend it to members of a general literate audience -- especially to those who love books and the printed page -- knowing full well that its subject matter and time period won't appeal to everyone.  (In fact, I know EXACTLY which friend I will be passing my copy to.)  This is a perfect book for church- or religion-based book clubs.  Read ""Gutenberg's Apprentice,"" and you will look at books and typefaces and the whole process of publication more intently from that moment on.  Once again, an instance of historical fiction gives us a terrific way to learn real history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23MUIBSGSNJRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062336010#wasThisHelpful","R23MUIBSGSNJRA","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In other books about writing, I ran into enough quotes from the creative wisdom of prolific American author John O'Hara (1905-1970) that I finally decided to seek out the source.  If others thought this man's insights were worthwhile, then maybe I should read them in their original context.  They were right.  These pieces are worth reading and underlining.  Some are even laugh-out-loud funny.This book offers an interesting mix of stuff.  41 separate selections consist of O'Hara's lectures, speeches, forewords, published and non-published essays, and interviews.  They span the decades from the 1930s through the 1960s.  Writing or a specific aspect of the craft is the main topic of each.  Its act and art transcend time.  A full section addresses the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald.  (""[He] was a RIGHT writer, and it's going to be a damned shame if the generation after mine ... and the one after that don't get to know him."")  O'Hara's asides offer some of his funniest moments, too.  I wish we could know what reactions he got from his initial audiences.You may get bored if you first study the table of contents too closely.  You may think that you won't want to read each selection.  I recommend that you instead launch into the pages and proceed from front to back without worry.  That's the only way you'll come upon the gems that speak most to you.  It's all common sense material here, but someone had to actually say it or write it down.  Examples of his simplicity:""You do not think of becoming a writer; you KNOW that you are a writer, with even fewer doubts, I suspect, than the doubts that bother a young man who suspects that he should study for the priesthood."" (p. 32)""The most truly satisfactory reward a writer ever gets is the moment he holds that book in his hand and says, This is my baby."" (p. 68)""Old authors never die, they only talk for pay."" (p. 71)No, this book isn't a narrative like Stephen King's On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft or Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life.  But in their own way, O'Hara's collected lectures and essays aptly convey his approach to the craft and the profession.  This volume deserves to share the writer's reference shelf with King, Lamott, and the rest.  Sometimes you need to plop down beside a crusty, experienced curmudgeon and just listen.  And on some days, it's easier and more inspirational to READ about writing than it is to actually sit down and WRITE.  I'll bet John O'Hara would have an opinion about that, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XEHL2YNOAJ8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809307960#wasThisHelpful","R1XEHL2YNOAJ8L","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... with the help of terrific insights, like the ones Michael Sims offers us here.  There's nothing like a new Thoreau biography to re-introduce our favorite author-naturalist to another population.  And veteran Thoreauvians are entertained as well, because it gives them new material to chew on and to debate.Yes, quite a few Thoreau biographies already exist.  In the beginning they were written by Henry's friends, as a way of honoring and remembering him.  Then a few fans at the turn of the last century (and on both sides of the Atlantic) took on the task of adding to and refining the information, because they could still ask crucial questions of those few remaining people of Concord who had once known Henry.  During the WWII years, the literary scholars joined the crowd; and they set the standard for many decades.  Today we hear a diversity of voices, from a variety of sources -- many of them, from those folks who encountered Thoreau in high school or in college in the 1960s-1970s-1980s.  Like Michael Sims.  (Like me.)We all have our own personal versions of Henry.  For Sims, he's forever young and vital.  The focus here is on the first 30 years of Henry's life:  up until the time that he leaves Walden Pond in 1847.  He paints the picture of a highly sensitive man who is curious about the behaviors of both Nature and mankind.  Someone who wants to be at least a little successful at being a writer, but who encounters difficulties in getting published.  Included are naturally the usual stories and the near-myths of Henry's life -- abruptly resigning after teaching only two weeks at a public school; becoming devastated by his brother John's death; accidentally setting the woods on fire; moving to Walden Pond; spending a night in jail for non-payment of the poll tax, etc. etc. etc.  To those who know or who have read a lot about Thoreau, many stories will be familiar.  Some won't.  All of them are told in a fresh, new style.  Sims also adds more context than is found in some previous biographies, and he includes intricate details that have not previously surfaced.  He also adds more references to Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe than most people do.  The result?  More voices telling the story, and some new connections made.  Nice!Sims also writes with a Thoreauvian flourish, casually weaving in some of Henry's own turns of phrase.  His narrative will have the most savvy readers nodding and smiling and thinking, Ahhh, I know why he said it this way.  These pages will also set a few devoted fans and accomplished scholars who are approaching any ""new"" facts to scratching their heads, saying ""Wait -- what?  No!  Really?  Are you sure about this?""  (He had me scrambling to my stash of reference books on more than one occasion.)  The answer is, Yes.  And he's got all of the documentation to back up his facts.  He did original research.  This book isn't a mere rehash of the old stuff.Sure, Sims may have overlooked or omitted a few aspects or incidents that will surprise readers.  For example:  he glosses over the fact that Thoreau taught himself surveying and took on jobs marking many local property lines around Concord, beyond his initial scrutiny of Walden Pond's depth and borders.  The author may not have had a chance to read Patrick Chura's Thoreau the Land Surveyor before finishing this manuscript.  (This ground-breaking book isn't included in the bibliography.)  And of course, this narrative doesn't touch much on the last 14 years of Henry's life.  Only one final chapter serves to summarize ""the rest of the story.""This book is highly recommended:  not only for Thoreauvians, but also for the general public and certainly for libraries of all kinds, including public and college libraries.  (Don't dare weed out Harding and Richardson!  Just put Sims next to those guys.)  Thanks to writers like Michael Sims, we're learning even more about our old friend Henry Thoreau.  Someday we may know it ALL.Corinne H.

"What is ""home""?  How and why are animals drawn toward it?  That's the topic of Bernd Heinrich's new book.  Thanks to the title and to the dust jacket illustration, we initially think here of the act of migration, and especially of the most noticeable ones:  of large groups of birds flying overhead in the spring and the fall.  But Heinrich gives us additional examples of homing in species of insects, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals; from his own observations and from the research of others.  The animals may be led by instinct, sight, or a combination of reading the landscape and responding to magnetic earth forces.  The choice depends on species, location, and opportunity.  It's interesting stuff.  The topic of homing is a much richer one than it may appear at first thought.Then:  What comes after the creature finds its best territory?  Home building and home maintenance, of course.  And we learn more fascinating details about the kind of structures that animals create, if they feel the need to build them.  Now Heinrich turns his sights toward humans.  (And we knew that he would get to this eventually, after we read the Preface.)  We follow him to Maine, to his own most familiar places.  Here he gives us further fodder for consideration, especially in debating why humans developed into home-builders at all.  I wish he had reached this connection a bit sooner, though.  And he doesn't quite resolve the personal conflict that he references in the Preface.  Still, I do appreciate his final, environmentally savvy, conclusion.Animal lovers should be forewarned or reminded that Bernd Heinrich IS a scientist.  He ""collects"" animals for study, hunts for deer, and has no qualms about sacrificing bumble bees to orb spider webs.  If you can't bear even the mere idea of treating animals in such a manner, then you'll have to skim over a few passages.  But the book is well worth your efforts.  And I hope you're familiar with the metric system, too, because all of his measurements run to centimeters and meters and such.As always, Heinrich's drawings are wonderful additions to his text.  And he leaves us with a terrific bibliography that could lead us in reading directions for the rest of our lives""The Homing Instinct"" is recommended for those who crave more information about animals -- and especially about birds, insects, and humans.  The book release is well timed for Spring, the period of migration and home-building.  I found myself remembering reading Edwin Way Teale's North With the Spring: A Naturalist's Record of a 17,000-Mile Journey With the North American Spring at this time of year:  a classic and similar book, and yet quite different.  Since Heinrich has already given us Summer World: A Season of Bounty and Winter World: The Ingenuity of Animal Survival, perhaps this new book is his way of offering us both Spring and Fall at once.  We'll see.  The bottom line is that our world is full of amazing sights and behaviors.  We can all be inspired by people like Berrnd Heinrich, who seek out and find this kind of amazement in even the smallest things ... and then are nice enough share it with the rest of us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91ZMX7PX3I3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547198485#wasThisHelpful","R91ZMX7PX3I3N","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those of us who grew up in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in the 1960s and 1970s don’t have to ask who Bill Saylor is.  To us, he’ll always be the weatherman for WGAL-TV, Channel 8:  the one who wore the blue Atlantic uniform when he stood in front of a simple U.S. map and told us what kind of weather we could expect the next day.  Bill has finally taken the time to write a memoir that includes some of the details of his broadcasting career as well as highlights from some of his other endeavors.Bill grew up in the wake of the Depression in Reading, Pennsylvania.  He talks about his childhood, a few of his family members, and some of his school memories, especially with playing baseball and football.  Then he served for two years in the U.S. Navy and got to see a bit of the world beyond Reading and Philadelphia.  A few post-military jobs got him into radio and television broadcasting … which landed him in Lancaster.  And he’s been here ever since.  He talks about those relatively early days of TV and of the later attempts to bring unions into the station.  He showcases his celebrity interactions, along with b&w two-shots of his interviews with the most famous.  He also reveals some of the issues surrounding his recent campaigns for local office, as a floating Democrat in a sea of Republicans.  If I had lived in the area at the time, I would have voted for him.  Alas, no.His narrative makes for easy and interesting reading.  But I have to admit, there are a few oddities and quirks in his telling.  Bill rarely makes references to dates or years, so it’s only by happenstance that we can figure out that he started working at WGAL in 1961.  And even then, you have to almost be an insider yourself to understand the connection, because he NEVER mentions the station’s call letters or its channel number.  He doesn’t tell any stories about being the Atlantic weatherman.  He doesn’t talk about the majority of the reporters or the on-air people that he worked with at Channel 8, and he doesn’t drop any local names that we would recognize or remember.  He doesn’t call his closest family members by name, either.  Perhaps he was wary of recrimination or backlash.  Perhaps he figured his audience would know what or who he was talking about.  I guess some will.  And as is the case with many self-published books, these pages could have benefited from the services of a casual proofreader or a freelance editor.  Occasional lapses in punctuation or spelling slipped through a few cracks here.I had the terrific opportunity to meet Bill Saylor at one of his local book signings.  Now that I’ve read his book, I’m REALLY glad that I had a chance to chat with him for about 30 minutes.  He told me in person the kinds of stories and details that I had hoped were in the book.  Now I know that they aren’t.  If you get the chance, go see Bill.  You too may be impressed with what a nice guy he is, as well as startled by how tall he stands (6’3”).This book is recommended for anyone who wants to know “the rest of the story” …  although we have to understand that this isn’t ALL of it.  Not by a long shot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IDWA2VC9PN9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1491717238#wasThisHelpful","R3IDWA2VC9PN9O","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life is nice for Betsy Devonshire, owner of the yarn shop called Crewel World in Excelsior, Minnesota.  Her live-in boyfriend, Connor Sullivan, is simply the grandest gentleman who ever stepped out of Ireland.  Her business is doing well, especially in the capable hands of store manager Godwin DuLac.  And Betsy is taking good care of herself by eating sensibly and by participating in regular water aerobics classes.  It’s when the venue for these classes is temporarily relocated that her routine changes and a murder takes place.  How can she NOT get involved in solving it?The lifeless body of Theodora “Teddi” Wahlberger is found in the pool of the senior citizen residence called Watered Silk, a facility Betsy has just gotten to know by teaching a punch-needle class to some women there and by using that same heated therapy pool.  But why was such a young woman killed?  And why was her body put there, of all places?  When the guard on duty is fired for negligence in the line of duty, his aunt asks Betsy to find Teddi’s actual murderer.  Betsy does her best to trace Teddi’s life and friends -- especially since the woman was pregnant and had associated with at least three different men in recent months.  Her investigation steps up a notch when another woman is killed at Watered Silk, probably because she knew too much.  Now Betsy has two murders to solve.  Naturally, she lets local police officer Mike Malloy in on her findings.  We have no doubt that the killer will discovered in due course.  In this case, it’s good that Betsy has friends to help her with stake-outs!Avid fans of Monica Ferris’ series will gobble this one up.  Newbies can be attracted to this title but will ALWAYS be encouraged to go back to the beginning to catch up. Incredibly, this is our 17th encounter with Betsy, Crewel World, and the people and pets of Excelsior.  It’s difficult to believe that Betsy was once brand-new to the town, to running a stitchery store, and to puzzling out murder mysteries, and not all that long ago, either.

"No doubt about it:  Henry David Thoreau's most famous book can be a tough nut to crack.  How can contemporary readers understand its lengthy passages?  And why should anyone page through the ruminations of a guy who lived next to a pond for two years, back in the 1840s?  What could his words possibly mean for us today?These are the topics that Dr. Payne has generally taken on here.  Whew!  At only 89 pages of text, this slim book serves as a teaser, a prod, or a nudge to the potential WALDEN reader.  First of all, Payne provides biography and context.  He drops Thoreau and the book in the Concord of the mid-19th century and describes the times, the people, and the surroundings.  Then he aligns some of his chapters here with selected ones from WALDEN, covering a few of its main themes.  He includes some small b&w illustrations, which are usually present-day photographs taken around Concord and Walden Pond.  These images may mean more to people if/when they've seen the sites in person.  Or they could assure long-distance readers that these places do still exist, even if they don't quite mirror the landscape that Thoreau saw and wrote about, himself.I'm not sure Payne definitively answers the Why.  His approach instead is to rustle up the evidence and to let the audience members themselves realize how much Thoreau's thoughts, words, and actions are still relevant to our own lives.To be fair:  I met Dr. Payne at the conference that he hosts, the John Burroughs Nature Writing Conference & Seminar series at SUNY Oneonta, in 2012.  I consider us to be professional acquaintances.  He did not ask me to read and review his book.Readers should note that early editions of this print-on-demand book contained a number of typographical errors.  I have been assured by the publisher that these have been corrected.  This book could now act as a prompt or a supplemental study guide for those opening WALDEN for the first time.  It's not as detailed as the analysis you can find in Leslie Perrin Wilson's CliffsNotes Thoreau, Emerson, and Transcendentalism, but Dr. Payne's book is certainly a resource that a frantic undergraduate under studying deadline could be grateful for.By Corinne H.

"And who wouldn't be?  The part-time public library director in Battle Lake, Minnesota, has discovered at least one dead body per month since she arrived in town last Spring.  Her most recent interactions with bad guys and investigations have left her so scared that she's taken to sleeping UNDER her bed.  How can she get herself out of this funk and back to a reasonable life -- the one that includes being nestled in the arms of her charming boyfriend, Johnny Leeson?Well, being mugged by a couple of druggies from Chicago doesn't help matters at all.  Seems there's a new gang in town.  Literally.  And before you know it, not only has Mira had contact with these thugs, but she's also spied a body in the lake that may have ties to the newcomers.  Mira's got to figure out what's going on.  But at the same time, she needs to run the library, write a newspaper article about a local history museum, and put in some PI-in-training hours to find a missing person.  AND make time for Johnny.  AND deal with Mrs. Berns, her ever-exasperating library staffer and co-conspirator in crime-related shenanigans.  Really, it's a wonder the woman even has a chance to breathe.  We have to turn the pages quickly just to keep up with her.Once again, author Jess Lourey has crafted an intricate and satisfying series of plot lines that have no choice but to converge.  Mira James is one of the most likable people in contemporary mysteries.  And she has to get everything done in order to understand the situation herself, and to reveal it to everyone else.  This time, readers will probably put two and two together on at least one front, before Mira does.  It still makes for intriguing and fun reading.  And even at the end, we're left with questions.  Will Mira get her PI license?  Will Mrs. Berns continue to be her sidekick?  Will love prevail with Johnny Leeson?  I have to admit that I'm already a little sad that we may share only three more escapades with these people.To be fair:  I've been a fan of this series since the beginning.  I met and chatted with author Jess Lourey at a book signing for November Hunt in 2011.  I've interacted with her on Facebook.  I've found her to be an approachable author who doesn't hesitate to help and to motivate other writers.  I probably won't read the non-mystery books that she has planned -- she's got lots! -- but I will devour the rest of this series.""January Thaw"" is highly recommended for any mystery lover.  You don't need to have read the previous Murder-by-Month episodes before this one; but as is often the case, your reading experience will be greatly enhanced if you do.  Begin at the beginning with May Day.

"For Lynn Darling, this is the perfect time to figure out her place in Life.  Her daughter Zoe is away at a college in Maine.  Lynn now has a chance to contemplate her roles as a mother, a widow, a woman, and a writer.  She chooses to buy a small house in South Woodstock, Vermont, in the heavily-forested Green Mountains.  The trouble is, she has a habit of getting lost.  She's directionally-challenged and can't even read a simple map.  She goes out for a walk and can't find her way home.  This memoir is thus a book-long metaphor on getting lost and then becoming found -- both in the woods as well as in Life.What works here?  Well, Darling is an accomplished wordsmith, first of all.  She's good at descriptions and she comes up with unique observations.  Secondly, I give her kudos for embarking on this self-imposed exile -- which is even interrupted by a diagnosis of breast cancer and a series of subsequent treatments for it.  I feel very strongly that individuals need to be spend time alone and know themselves before they can successfully manage getting caught up in relationships with others.  It seems as if Lynn is finally getting the chance to do this here.  She's long overdue for it.What doesn't work?  Well, Darling takes the concept of being lost to a point of obsession.  You have to wonder if maybe the law of attraction is at work here, and that the more she focuses on being lost, the more lost she becomes.  She does a great deal of research on folks throughout history who have gotten famously lost and how they coped with their situations.  She knows she needs help, and she gets some decent advice from a variety of wilderness-oriented teachers.  She even takes a stab at learning how to use a compass and a topographic map.  But she seems to take on her overall task as more of a required assignment than as an intrinsic desire.  Is her Vermont house a sanctuary or a prison?  The fact that she names it Castle Dismal (after Nathaniel Hawthorne's assessment of his childhood home), is a more revealing act than she may care to admit.  And she will probably never get over the stranger-in-a-strange-land syndrome of being a big-city girl plopped down in a rural and mountainous New England town.In the end:  Has Darling changed?  Is she better off when she leaves the woods four years later than when she first got there?  Only she can truly decide.  The bottom line for me is that I didn't always see her as a likable person in this book.Still, I recommend ""Out of the Woods"" to women who are going through the kinds of cancer treatments that Darling did.  Her experience may help others who are coping with similar struggles and tangled emotions.  This aspect of the book is not the one being most promoted, but it may prove to be the most useful one for readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJFMQAY1UPHK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061710245#wasThisHelpful","RJFMQAY1UPHK4","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Canadians Robert and Signe McMichael didn't begin their adult lives as deliberate collectors of art.  And in the early 1950s, when they first bought a large piece of farmland in Kleinburg, north of Toronto, they did so because the land spoke to them with the kind of beautiful voice that they felt represented all of Canada.  It was not because they quickly envisioned it as a place to create and open a unique public museum.  At least, this wasn't their initial intent.  The idea came to them over time.""When we searched out a site in the unspoiled countryside, built a shelter of natural materials and filled it with art drawn from nature we felt we had somehow created a symbolic microcosm of our nation,"" describes Robert McMichael. (p. 30)  And that was the beginning of something special taking place at the building they called Tapawingo, ""a place of joy.""This is Robert McMichael's autobiography, but it's actually a history of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, too.  It also serves as an interesting study in fine art collecting, and specifically of the works and nuances of the members of the Group of Seven (Franklin Carmichael, Lawren Harris, A.Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Fred Varley; and A. J. Casson, Emily Carr, who number among later additions).  Initially it's the artwork of Tom Thomson (pre-Group) that the McMichaels are most attracted to.  And so they start to collect Thomson paintings as pieces become available.  Along the way, they also collect key connections with friends and relatives of the Group of Seven -- most of the artists themselves, being already gone.  And these encounters lead to the purchase of more pieces and more encounters and more connections, and so on and so on.  It's The Ripple Effect, in startling Technicolor.  As the couple adds to the collection, the house grows organically to display all of it at once.  Eventually Inuit art of First Nations people fits nicely into the mix, too.  The collection can thus be said to represent the creative historic work of residents of the entire country.Since Robert is telling the story, he's not exactly unbiased.  You have to remind yourself that the narrative is told from his own perspective, even though he obviously tries to be both neutral and polite in some cases.  Humble, as well.  This tiptoeing is especially noticeable when he's dealing with the legal hoop-jumping and paperwork regarding transference of the ownership of the museum to the province of Ontario in November 1965, as well as in various administrative actions that happened in the years afterward.  You just know there are more details to these stories than he's revealing.  And he chooses in the end to keep the reputation of the museum clean, within the covers of this book.  A wise decision.One frustration is that Robert talks about the various Group of Seven paintings as if we know them simply by title and can accurately envision them.  Alas, there are no reproductions of artwork in this book, other than the small graphics that head each chapter.  Sure, it's nice to see the b&w portraits of the McMichaels and their friends and associates in the photo section.  And yes, putting images of art into a publication can be problematic; and b&w reproductions could never do full justice to the original vibrancy that Group paintings are known for.  But still.  To get the full experience of this history, the reader should have access to a nearby reference book that showcases pieces by the Group of Seven.  Or, he or she should be standing physically in the museum itself, and be able to gaze upon the real-life paintings.  Just as Robert McMichaels may have, as he assembled this manuscript.""One Man's Obsession"" should be mandatory reading for lovers of Canadian art, philanthropists, and anyone intimately familiar with the legacies of Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.  It offers an interesting story that a lot of people will overlook because they've not heard of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection and haven't been to Kleinburg.  To this audience, it's an intriguing introduction to something brand-new.  If you HAVE visited this place, then you should pick up this book and read how it all got started.  You'll be prompted to return to the museum for a second, more knowing, look.  At least.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUPV0KR4ORMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0135669448#wasThisHelpful","R1BUPV0KR4ORMY","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New Hampshire-ite Ben Kilham has spent many years studying black bears, raising cubs, reintroducing them into the wild, and coming to conclusions about their behaviors and habits.  Because the females in bear society control the organization of the territories, we most often get to follow Squirty, the dominant female in Ben's local beardom.  Through her actions and Ben's narrative, we learn about food supply size and distribution, communication modes and patterns, ways of treating both family members and strangers, and the simple system of rules and punishments that guide the acts of cooperation and altruism.  With bears, you ask?  Yes, with bears.  And it all makes sense.  Even when Ben discovers the special organ that bears have in their skulls in order to discern the edibility or the trustworthiness of something or someone new, it makes sense.  It turns out that bears lead relatively quiet but fairly interesting lives.  And they certainly don't aim specifically to attack humans, as some fearful people have been led to believe. (""The solution to the nuisance bear problem is not so much about managing bears; it's about managing people"" ... and ""controlling smell."" pp. 164-165)He gives us enough to go on -- because you just know that he's got tons more data and documentation and illustrative stories -- and then he proceeds to the topic of how we can learn from the examples presented by these creatures.  He anticipates the silent ""So what?"" that his readers may ask, and he answers the query quite admirably.A basic but key connection is how we humans acquire bits and pieces of information, over and over, every minute of every day.  ""Somewhere in our past we began relying on the writings of others and lost the ability to use the high-quality information our brains were designed to process,"" Ben says, on p. 138.  If we could take the time to observe and to process the details ourselves, like bears do, we'd be in much better shape.  That the concept of war is alien to the bear world is the single most important lesson we can learn from them, and from many other animals as well, I believe.  Bravo to Ben Kilham for bringing this issue to the printed page.  And for his work with New England black bears, Chinese giant pandas, Russian browns and polars, and other four-footed kids around the globe.""Out on a Limb"" is a book that should first be read by anyone who lives in a natural habitat where bears reside.  Next, it should be read by every animal control officer, every wildlife manager, every animal lover, every public-serving naturalist, every environmentalist, every peace activist, and even every legislator -- all of these, regardless of location, and perhaps not in this order.  I haven't felt this strongly about a nature-oriented book since I mailed paperback copies of David Brower's Let the Mountains Talk, Let the Rivers Run: A Call to Save the Earth to all of my then-legislators.We also need to make space in our canon to welcome the wisdom of independent researchers like Ben.  These are folks who approach their favorite topics out of interest and fascination and love; and not out of academic requirement, perceived financial gain, or celebrity accolade.  Even so:  Here's hoping Ben Kilham gets much praise, many donations for continued research, and a big stand of mountain blueberries for Squirty and her relatives to share.  Because we have every confidence that they WILL share.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H6PK15UX6674/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1603583904#wasThisHelpful","R2H6PK15UX6674","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... so now is the perfect time to revisit the formal investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Howard P. Willens was part of the 23-man legal team that assisted the 8-member Warren Commission in its mission to puzzle out The Truth back in 1963-1964.  Willens is the sole surviving member of the overall supervisory staff, so it makes sense that he should be the one to confirm these details.As soon as those gun shots were fired at the presidential motorcade, the facts of the tragedy became tainted with rumors and speculations.  The Warren Commission had to launch its investigation amidst all of the inconsistencies that were being fed to it at every turn:  from the hospitals, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, and from the Secret Service and its Treasury Department overseers.  It had to work with and maintain good relationships with each one of those entities, as well as with security and political authorities in the city of Dallas, the state of Texas, the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Justice Department, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the IRS, and even some contacts in Mexico, Cuba, and the Soviet Union and their embassies.  It had to research the lives of both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.  It gathered testimonies from 552 individuals.  It dealt with the ever-present media and a confused and worried American public.  And all of the Commissioners and lawyers assisting them had to work closely together, get along, and agree on their findings.  The task became the largest criminal investigation ever conducted in the United States, and one of the most politically sensitive.  And it took place in a pre-computer and pre-Internet world, when surveillance cameras were not mounted upon every city lamp post, and as Cold-War anxieties simmered at the surface.Willens' re-telling of the procedure at times reads like a detective novel.  In this, it also reminds me of Woodward & Bernstein's All the President's Men, back in the day.  Both are full of many details, names, dates, and who-knew-what-whens.  (You may want to create your own list of the major players in the game, in order to keep them straight.  I did.)  This book follows all of the threads of the Commission's daunting investigation.  Obviously the emphasis is on the undertakings of the staff members, who were the real worker bees for the project.  It's fascinating to watch them tunnel their way to real results.  I understand now that the Warren Commission did the best job it could, within some limitations and certainly under pressure-cooker conditions.The JFK assassination will always be debated.  It will always be controversial. It will always serve as a case study for political science students to consider the interactions of crime, authority, procedure, and law.  Willens may hope that this is the final word on the subject, but it cannot be.  The Warren Commission report served just as a beginning point for discussion.  While tons of other JFK-related books and media continue to surface -- especially in this anniversary year -- this book is among the most important one.  Read it:  for background, if for nothing else.  Read others, if you wish.  And then read Stephen King's 11/22/63: A Novel to see how one fictional character tried his best to stop the whole ordeal from happening.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18MPGQ1NW8ID8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146830755X#wasThisHelpful","R18MPGQ1NW8ID8","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""If not for books and animals, I'd die from boredom."" (p. 76)  Looking back, Helen Peppe dares to share with us her memories:  not only as the youngest of nine kids, but also as an animal lover living on a working farm where creatures are offed, eaten, or sold on a regular basis.  It doesn't take long for us to get sucked into her world of childhood misery.  We all have had some of these feelings, or at least we imagined that we did.  Helen's are magnified by a factor of nine (or really, more than eleven, if you count her parents and the ever-present household hanger-on).  No wonder she continually begs for time to move faster so that she can become an adult and can lead her life the way she really wants to.This is not your Tourist's Maine.  This is not the place of picturesque rocky beaches or thick green pine forests.  This is the hardscrabble interior, living past where the paved road ends, visiting the City-of-the-Library and the City-over-the-Bridge only for grocery shopping and occasional visits to the doctor.  And Helen portrays it authentically, as she does with her family members.  In her words, her siblings include: the blustery-and-favored brother, the holier-than-thou brother, the brother-I-barely-knew, the tough-yet-admirable sister, the hair-twirling-pretty sister, the sad-tittering sister, the sister-of-poor-choices, and the sister-who-holds-grudges-longer-than-God.  This is Helen's story, after all.  She doesn't have to name names.With the wisdom of hindsight, the author can be downright practical and humorous in considering the highlights of her past.  Perhaps she looks back now to puzzle out how she became the woman she is today.  Here the younger Helen compensates with her difficult or eccentric circumstances by losing herself in Stephen King novels, loving the animals she can, becoming a vegetarian, and dreaming of a different grown-up life.  We turn pages and keep up with her, also anticipating that day.When I first read the summary and decided to read and review this book, I warned myself that animal deaths would be probably be part of the narrative.  I was right.  I steeled myself, but I wasn't quite prepared to be hit with so many.  Helen Peppe is a compelling writer, however; and the fact that I didn't skip a word says a lot about her craft and talent.  Fellow animal lovers need not dismiss this book, but they may anticipate a possible need to pass over some passages.  (I considered giving it 4 stars instead, because of the horror.  But Helen's excellent writing overshadows the bad stuff.  It also helps to know that today she's a photographer of horses.)We read memoirs in order to find out what other folks were doing while we were simultaneously growing up elsewhere, involved with our own daily dramas.  This tale ends with another beginning, as Helen and her boyfriend Eric head toward high school graduation.  She leaves us wanting more, to keep hearing the news from Maine.  ""Pigs Can't Swim"" will appeal to and will entertain a wide variety of readers, as well it should.  As for the title itself -- Ah, but it turns out that they CAN.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ON8RFL3VO4ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306822725#wasThisHelpful","R2ON8RFL3VO4ZZ","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's August 1846, and there's trouble in the town of Plumford, Massachusetts.  A dead man has been found at the bottom of a cliff along the Assabet River.  Who is he, and how did he die?  The fact that the man is an African American adds an extra challenge to the direction that any further decision or investigation will take.  But Dr. Adam Walker and Henry David Thoreau will not be deterred in any event, and neither will the doctor's cousin, Julia Bell, who is an independent and headstrong woman with an interest in the case.  All three do their best to puzzle out the mystery.  Some other nasty business takes place, unfortunately, before the unapologetic perpetrator can be identified and dealt with.The narrative is told in first-person tag-team style, with chapters as journal entries written in the alternating points of view of Adam and Julia.  (Ironically, not from Henry's, even though he would become famous for his journal ruminations.)  It's a good example of historical fiction, with characters accurately operating under 19th-century attitudes toward minorities and toward women.  (Enough to goad at least one female reader into yelling advice to Julia at key moments in the plot.  Alas, the young woman wasn't able to hear it, in the dimension where she lives.)Plumford is a fictional town, located just west or southwest of Concord.  At the time of this story, Henry Thoreau is still living at nearby Walden Pond; and he hasn't yet published even his first book.  Though he expresses his investigative opinions to Adam, it's really the doctor who seems to do the majority of the detecting in this book.  Perhaps we get this impression because we're reading Adam's journal entries all along, and we get to follow his lines of thinking and his resulting actions.  And Adam and Julia may be cousins, but the two of them obviously have inclinations to become more than friends and goofing-around relatives.  Will circumstances ever allow them to be together?I've met the authors, Ben and Beth Oak, and they are a delightful couple.  I know that they work hard to maintain historical accuracy, especially when it comes to the medical practices that Adam Walker must employ.  They are also devoted Thoreauvians who portray the man as close as they can to historical record.""Thoreau at Devil's Perch"" is recommended as historical fiction, as a murder mystery, and as good entertainment.

"Right on the heels of Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker, Ms. Chiaverini offers us another insightful Civil War-era book in ""The Spymistress.""  This one too is based on fact and on a real-life and little-known person of the day.Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Van Lew is her own kind of independent woman:  a spinster of middle age who manages her extended family property, complete with slaves, on Church Hill in Richmond, Virginia.  When her beloved home state secedes from the United States, Lizzie's allegiance remains with old Virginia and with the country headed by Abraham Lincoln -- and decidedly NOT with the new Confederacy.  She's far from the only Northern sympathizer around, for there are a few other ""Unionists"" hidden and scattered across the city.  Lizzie vows to do whatever she can to help the cause from her impromptu post in what becomes the Southern capital.  She begins by taking food and medical supplies to the Northern prisoners, now kept in former tobacco warehouses and in ever-worsening conditions.  Eventually her self-assigned duties lead her to become even more of a spy behind enemy lines.  She's eventually recognized for her good work by authorities in the Union army and is given additional tasks to accomplish.  All while maintaining the artificial faade of being a loyal Confederate.This book is not only the tale of one fascinating woman.  It's also the story of her hometown of Richmond, and its own transformation and tragic heritage during the war years.  Readers will have the advantage of knowing (at least, in general) what will happen to both as the war progresses.  The characters on the pages don't have this benefit.  And so we are led on, always wondering if / when the Confederates will finally figure out what Lizzie and her compatriots are up to.  We Northern readers silently applaud their diligence.""The Spymistress"" is recommended for readers interested in American history, the South, or in real-life escapades of decisive women.  For quick or casual readers, however, the book may seem to contain too much history, too many explanations.  Kudos to Jennifer Chiaverini for following these historical paths and for diverting us away from the quilts for a while -- although ALL of her books make for good reading.  Additional nods to the author for tackling the traditionally male-oriented topic of Civil War prisons, and in offering it up to a female audience.  The narrative calls to mind the vivid scenes in Mackinlay Kantor's Andersonville.  And anyone who has read that classic will gasp at the name and its baggage, whenever it is mentioned here.  Surely these situations could never have been that bad.  Could they?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NMQ4ETD1TXUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953620#wasThisHelpful","R2NMQ4ETD1TXUM","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a fair number of financial advice books, and specifically every one that was written by CBNC's Saturday night maven, Suze Orman.  But in such a critical arena, we can always use a second opinion.  That's why I opted to read and review ""Give Yourself a RAISE.""  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the helpfulness found here.  Gordon Bennett Bleil is no Suze Orman, and that's OK.  We don't need another Suze.  I think Bleil has done a terrific job at explaining issues and details and offering remedies for resolution of money quandaries.His best audience will be individuals who are in debt and have thus far been unable to manage it.  But in order to use this book most effectively, you have to WANT to make a change.  There are a variety of spreadsheets to fill out, in order to understand where your money comes from and where it goes.  A LOT of spreadsheets.  In the book and on the author's web site.  (Suze generally has only one.)  But they sure outline your situation in black and white, and are crucial for unveiling the truth.  And you don't have to use all of them for Bliel's approach to be enlightening.The strong points of Bleil's techniques are in analyzing one's financial situation and in managing debt, especially credit card debt.  Other good sections are the ones that focus on setting goals and analyzing the personal reasons for overspending.  We can all use a push to get moving.  Especially regarding our dealings with money.I see one notable difference between Gordon Bennett Bleil and Suze Orman.  Bleil treats a credit card as a funding source, and not as a pure expense.  It's an interesting and critical nuance.  It gives you a different perspective on how a credit card should be viewed and (if necessary) used.Please note that the First Edition of this book was published in 2010, and the Second Edition came out in 2013.  The First credited the author as Gordon Bennett, and the Second lists him as Gordon Bennett Bleil.  Reviews and product specifics of both editions appear to have been unfortunately combined into this one merged entry.  The ISBNs that I see on the screen don't match the ones on the title page verso in the paperback copy of the Second Edition in my hand.  The bottom line is that if you are truly interested in learning how to better manage your financial life, make sure that you are indeed getting the Second Edition of this book.I'll still watch ""The Suze Orman Show"" on a regular basis.  I will also recommend ""Give Yourself a RAISE"" to those people who are frustrated enough with the state of their personal finances that they want to commit to making a change.  Just like facing other challenges in life, the first step here is in admitting that you have a problem.  After that, the paperwork and explanations will help you on your way to attaining a more sustainable financial situation.[I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3899GFFCFD6G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988149184#wasThisHelpful","R3899GFFCFD6G3","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It takes only several dozen pages to catch up with 30-something PI Kinsey Milhone, whom we last hung out with nearly two years ago in V is for Vengeance.  Veteran storyteller Sue Grafton is aware of our possible forgetfulness and eases us back into Kinsey's Santa Teresa life by giving us subtle clues without making us feel like dolts:  checking in at her studio apartment and with her generous landlord Henry Pitts and his hypochondriac brother William; driving around so that we can pass Rosie's Tavern and visit Kinsey's office and get to the beach, which she jogs along every morning; even looking in her closet and seeing the all-purpose black dress.  Ah, yes.  We remember this place and these people.  In the meantime, a new set of mysteries has already surfaced.Two deaths have come into Kinsey's life.  One is the murder of Pete Wolinsky, a PI who had his own shabby little practice in Santa Teresa.  He was neither a friend nor a real competitor for Kinsey's business; but their paths crossed enough that she can feel some sorrow for his loss.  Given the kinds of people he associated with and the site of his murder, we shouldn't be surprised that he got caught up in something bad.  Author Grafton craftily uses back story and change of point-of-view in four separate chapters to help us learn the details of his demise.The other body belongs to a homeless man who died in his sleeping bag on the beach.  The only information left with his body was Kinsey's business name and phone number.  Who was he?  Why did he carry her number around with him?  And why doesn't Kinsey recognize him when she's called to the morgue?  Kinsey at least helps out the coroner in learning the identity of the man, which leads her to interview three of his homeless friends.  Without really meaning to do so, our favorite PI gets even more caught up in what was the life of this man named Terrence.  Almost before she can turn around, she's up to her shaggy brunette hairline in legalities.  And her name is at the top of the paperwork.  Will this scenario indeed turn out to be her highest-paid case to date -- and one that she wasn't even hired to investigate?And of course, all this action takes place during the autumn of 1988:  well before the days of computerized everything and ubiquitous handheld devices and the ability to look up answers via the Internet.  Kinsey and the authorities she deals with are relegated to searching for answers the old-fashioned way: by telephone, travel, personal interview, and looking through primary source documents and reference books.  It's actually a breath of fresh air to go back in time with her.  It wasn't so long ago, really, but it represents a step back from how such an investigation would be conducted today.Once again, stories that at first seem to be separate, eventually converge.  Once again we are able to fill in some of the blanks in Kinsey's personal history -- whether she's willing to learn them or not.  Once again, some surprises from the past pop up.  And once again, some brand new entities enter the picture.  (Can you say ""cat""???) And we willingly tag along for the ride, page after page.  I won't reveal any more salient details.We avid mystery readers demand regular product and consistent quality from our favorite serialists.  Sue Grafton continues to deliver on both counts.  ""W is for Wasted"" is a worthwhile and gratifying read, whether it takes you a full day and night, or the savory course of a week to finish.  Fans will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30G5HK0XIR9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158987#wasThisHelpful","R30G5HK0XIR9W","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wyoming resident Jenna Elliot happens to be driving home on a dark night when she stops to pick up a hitch-hiking Washington politician who's in trouble.  She helps him escape the bad guys without hesitation.  After all, he's Ken Marsden, the President of the United States.  But who is after him?  Which one of his advisers can he still trust?  And once he figures out what's going on and the proper individuals have been identified and subdued, will Ken remember the woman who helped him at his most critical time of need, out in the American West?What follows is a variety of chase scenes, both throughout the Wyoming landscape and within the District of Columbia.  Some are physical pursuits, while others are psychological and emotional.  Frustration builds for both Jenna and Ken, as they both seem individually unable to prove the facts of the situation.  What can you do when forces beyond your control thwart your efforts at every turn?  Can the real truth ever be unveiled?Norma Pyper Mitchell's first novel has the strengths of an intriguing plot with interesting characters.  Readers will also have to figure out who's leading the attack against the President and therefore by association, against Jenna.  The manuscript itself could have used one more round of proofreading, especially when it comes to dealing with instances of punctuation surrounding dialogue.  A few segues of character point of view could have been tightened as well.  Overall, however, this is a good first novel.I recommend ""25 am"" to most mystery readers, as well as to people who enjoy political thrillers, or even episodes of political nonfiction, like All the President's Men.  When read at a time when the White House appears on the TV news every night, the mere sight of the building makes the action in this book seem even more plausible.  It makes you wonder -- like the movies The American President and Dave and others do -- if fiction does indeed mirror fact.  How true could this story be?[I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R542FD1JDEAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482724251#wasThisHelpful","R1R542FD1JDEAS","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this fictitious account, Red Hawk remembers being at the site of the fighting at Little Bighorn, Montana, as a 15-year-old Lakota warrior in 1876.  Here he outlines what he saw and what happened that day.  His story is based on actual native recollections.This is a well-known but somewhat complex event to convey within the limitations of a children's book.  Paul Goble meets the challenge by depicting the bands of soldiers and Indians in a special way, in his ledger-book style.  Aptly, these illustrations look very much like the kind of Native American pictographs you might find on the smooth rock walls of a western canyon.  Paired with native narration, the presentation is complete.  The confrontation itself is confusing and messy without being bloody, with soldiers and Natives sometimes heaped in piles of humanity.  But through it all, we can always pick out General Custer in his fringed buckskins and lighter-colored hair (which is seen here as being short, because Goble explains that he had just had it cut.).  A good map of the river valley and battle positions is included.I've read a fair amount about Custer.  I also once happened upon a reenactment weekend at Fort Lincoln in Bismarck, North Dakota; and there I walked past General Custer in his buckskins, sitting astride his horse.  I could think of nothing to say to the man.  I've stood on that grassy Montana hillside among the markers of the downed soldiers.  What a brief two-dimensional approach cannot ever convey is the eerie feeling you still get in that place, and what it sounds like when the western wind blows hauntingly across the blades of grass.  That landscape doesn't show up at all in this book.  It just can't.This release is said to be a ""revised and updated"" edition of the 1969 book, Red Hawk's Account of Custer's Last Battle : The Battle of Little Bighorn.  Author-illustrator Paul Goble is pleased to explain that he finally got the picture book layout that he wanted for this story when it first came out more than 40 years ago.  Instead of the original 64 pages, this one has 44, with fewer all-text double-page spreads and less white space around the illustrations.  The pictures have been digitized and are more vibrant than the old ones were, especially in the hues of blue in the soldiers' uniforms.  Tribal historian Joe Medicine Crow added a new foreword.  Goble revised his author's note accordingly.  The volume looks more like a contemporary children's book.What's bothersome to me is that the updates are almost entirely devoted to layout.  In a quick scan of the text, I noticed only one minor change, and that was a difference in a tribal name.  Although Goble includes in his new author's note a paragraph about the American Indian Movement and what was happening to Native Americans in the 1960s and 1970s, that's where he ends the information update.  The bibliographies on the final page are exactly the same as those found as the 1969 book, with one exception:  a book about the Cheyenne that was re-released in 2008 by Wisdom Tales, the publisher of this book.  The rest are almost exclusively from the 1930s to 1960s, with the majority having been published in the 1950s.  How disappointing!  Over the past 40 years, a tremendous number of relevant books have been published about Custer, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Little Bighorn, and Native American tribes and culture.  At the very least, Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West should have been added to the list.  It came out shortly after the first edition of this book.  Directing children (and adults) to books that their school and public libraries no longer carry is a major oversight for a brand-new publication.I also recommend adding a glossary (defining the tribal distinctions of Lakota, Oglala, Hunkpapa, etc., and the tradition of counting coup, which Goble had in his former note but omitted from his new introduction) as well as a summary paragraph stating how many men on each side were killed, what the long-term consequences and historical significance of the battle were, and so on.  A ""Rest of the story"" explanation.Without more acknowledgement of new information and resources, ""Custer's Last Battle"" represents just a freshening-up and re-polishing.  To me, it offers more questions than answers.[I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEV63QYGS5HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937786110#wasThisHelpful","RAEV63QYGS5HA","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Widow and former librarian Mary Fisher has opened a new bookstore at Ivy Bay on idyllic Cape Cod, where she used to spend summers when she was young.  During a book-signing event for a well-known mystery author, Mary spies a familiar face in the crowd.  It's Claire Wilkes, her former best friend.  The two women had parted ways -- badly  -- decades earlier, after Mary met and married John Fisher.  When Mary tries to reconnect with Claire this time, the woman evades her efforts.  Confronted later, she gets downright rude.In the meantime, Mary learns that the plot line of Addison Hartley's new book mirrors the Mary-Claire-John triangle from the past.  Did Claire somehow divulge the details to Addison?  Who else on the Cape knew or still knows about them?  And what about the mysterious checkbook of John's that Mary found hidden in an old school yearbook?  Could it be that Claire and John really DID have some sort of relationship behind Mary's back?""Rewriting History"" is a satisfying read: a benign mystery without a murder that still carries puzzling elements.  Since it is part of a Guideposts series, you know that religion will enter the picture.  Its appearances are not overwhelming; and those readers who would rather not get involved with it won't have to skip many lines to keep up.Still, a few aspects of the story are terribly unrealistic.  First of all:  the publishers have the chutzpah to let a character open a new bookstore, in this day of e-readers and diminishing print sales, and when real independents are closing by the dozens.  Is this wishful thinking, or clinging to either the past or to a presumed ideal paradise?  The Cape is known for being a book-friendly place, but even shops there must be feeling the pinch. And this new store sells 200 copies of a bestseller at one author event.  Really?  A small store like Mary's wouldn't even carry 200 copies of one book.  They'd be lucky to have 30-50 in anticipation of the book-signing.  And later, when Mary finally breaks through Claire's defenses, the other woman casually agrees with the reconciliation.  It's too easy an acquiescence, I believe.  In fact, since this is Christian fiction, I'm surprised that Mary doesn't share her faith with Claire in order to resolve their differences.Anyway:  Suspend your disbelief, and enjoy a decent story.  If the rest of the series is as good as this installment, you'll have even more pleasures to follow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGICTUFKCBMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009O16HPS#wasThisHelpful","R1YGICTUFKCBMU","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, I'll admit that I've been remiss.  I still haven't gotten around to reading Jack Kerouac's On the Road: The Original Scroll. My neglect hasn't stopped me from enjoying other vicarious and even quirky road trips through the printed page.  In fact, I'm attracted to them.  So it shouldn't surprise anyone that I recently picked up this copy of The Potomac Circle while I was traveling through northern Michigan, the author's home region.  I found it in a Mackinaw City gift shop, read the back cover summary, and promptly carried the book to the checkout counter.  Then I made my way through it as I followed my own path home.  It proved to be as good a traveling companion as a chewy slab of Mackinac fudge.Here, 40-something George Mills is in search of some mid-life clarity.  He recently lost his job in Virginia, and then lost his marriage too when his wife Maggie divorced him soon afterward.  Cut free of such ties, he's not sure what his next step should be.  So he loads up his Jeep and takes to the road heading west, as all great adventurers do.  By the time we catch up to him, he's already gotten as far as Idaho.  We follow along as he meets a few intriguing people, including possible love interests.  Or not.  Then California calls, and off we go, passing through Nevada, of course.  Will George find solace or any answers at the edge of the Pacific shoreline?  We'll have to wait and see.Invariably, as George turns around and heads back east, his thoughts swirl around his problems in Virginia.  His only true and trustworthy confidant has been his 22-year-old daughter Jenny, whom he continues to reach by phone.  It seems only appropriate, then, that he invites her to fly out and ride back home in the Jeep with him.  With her by his side, George experiences even more realizations.  What road will he choose in the end?The climax comes, not just with George's return home, but with the high school class reunion that he attends right afterward.  It's been 30 years since he's seen some of his old friends.  Naturally, Maggie is there too.  Have George and Maggie now come full circle as well?""The Potomac Circle"" offers a decent storyline, and also a chance for readers to think about their own pasts, choices and life-changing decisions.  Because it was either self-published or released through a tiny press, a few noticeable mistakes escaped the proofreader's eye. Nevertheless, it's too bad this effort hasn't attracted a wider audience.  I recommend it for any reader (esp. 40-ish or older) who longs to take to the highway and get that motor running.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EJKLJXVHWW15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0970134207#wasThisHelpful","R2EJKLJXVHWW15","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most authors want to be paid well for their efforts, and many also hope that their words will ultimately make a mark on the world.  Here veteran (but fading) fiction writer Conner Joyce has a chance to fulfill these dreams through a Faustian-like arrangement with a man of mystery, means, and presumed power.  And yet fairly quickly, Conner's life and work don't take quite the turns he expected they would.  In fact, his decision merely increases the complications.  Is there a logical and decent way out of this mess?His confidant in this dilemma is the narrator of the story, Adam Langer.  Adam is another author who is struggling with his own daily challenges.  He can barely find remedies for his own problems -- regarding career, residency, and family matters -- let alone help Conner figure out a way to resolve his more dangerous ones.  But he's intrigued enough to listen whenever and wherever Conner needs a sounding board.  From New York to Chicago, from Bloomington IN to Delaware Water Gap PA, we follow along as the two writers puzzle out their situations and do what they think is best.  It's all about choices and results.The framework of the overall plot is as layered as a set of Russian nesting dolls.  Revealing too much of it would spoil the delight of discovery for the reader.  Suffice it to say that it makes for compelling reading, especially for fellow writers who understand that the current state of the publishing industry could easily lead to this sort of happenstance.  Has it in fact done so already?The fuzzy lines of authority add another dimension to interpretation.  The narrator of the story shares his name with the real-life author of this book.  You have to wonder:  Where does fiction end and real life begin?  Ah, you see, that query merely adds to the fun.Highly recommended for readers who enjoy most genres (mainstream, literary, mystery, suspense, thriller), and especially for those who write or who aspire to write.  They will be the most receptive and nodding-along audience.

"As an aspiring and sometimes published author, I like to get inspiration and validation from reading books about writing.  Here's a terrific one.  And don't let the title put a false limitation onto you.  It's got great writing advice for EVERYONE, and not just those folks who believe they have time management challenges. (Then again: who DOESN'T have a problem with time management?)Aine Greaney's main focus is on making the most of our days and using every opportunity for writing, editing, revising, and being creative.  She finds minutes to fill at every edge.  She's high on journaling, finding a good writers group, and attending occasional workshops, conferences, and retreats.  She offers exercises to help with planning and implementation.  Additional sidebars offer concrete advice on technique: on employing various points of view; developing memorable characters; fleshing out settings; working with scenes, mastering authentic dialogue.  Granted, these familiar topics are covered in other writing books.  The difference here is that Greaney puts herself into the narrative.  She's practical and down to earth.  She talks with us as if we're in a face-to-face conversation.  She supplies examples from her own writing life.  She's not pontificating from an academic tower.  Hers is not a household name, and she is not taking advantage of any best-selling fame to issue declarations.  No.  She's One of Us.  And if she can succeed and meet her own writing goals, then we realize that we can follow her lead.If her voice isn't enough to get you going, then the 20 additional author interviews at the end may give you more motivation.  These people reveal their own habits and writing processes, as they work around and through their Real Lives.  Surely a few of their situations will resonate with you.I have already recommended ""Writer with a Day Job"" to several friends and acquaintances in person, and I'm already following Aine Greaney on FB.  If you're serious about getting the most from your writing life, you need to add this book to your home reference shelf, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJS8JV24L5BA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582979960#wasThisHelpful","RJS8JV24L5BA8","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since Henry Thoreau spent two years living in a small house at the edge of Walden Pond in Concord MA, people have been finding remote places to hole up in and to experience Nature.  And then they write about it, too.  This book, first published in 1977 and then in paperback in 1982, falls into this category.  Except that the author doesn't take credit for it.  Readers will have to figure out who actually wrote it.  (The assignment shouldn't take long.)As a busy college professor, Edward Lueders spent time in his northern Wisconsin cabin only during summer breaks.  Imagine his surprise, then, when he ventured into the forest in June 1970, only to find that his retreat had been used by a nameless stranger and that a sheaf of papers waited for him on the living room table.  Someone had broken into the place and had lived here over the winter months, and that same someone had left all of his writings for Lueders, as partial payment for the opportunity.  Do I hear the suspension of disbelief ratcheting into place?The bulk of the book is the text of these left-behind papers, introduced and ""edited"" by Lueders.  While the Clam Lake area of the 1970s didn't resemble Walden Pond in the 1840s -- the house sat in the middle of Chequamegon National Forest but was equipped with running water and electricity and therefore had heat, radio, and TV -- the site did allow for the resident to ruminate, especially during the cold and snowy days of the Wisconsin winter.  His thoughts and observations appear here as brief entries, reminiscent of the style used by Walter Collins O'Kane in The Cabin and Beyond the Cabin Door.  Some report on the weather, animal tracks, and what's going on outside the warmth found within the cabin walls.  Most however are more cerebral, and many address the literary device of the metaphor:  what it is, what it isn't, what it should be, how and when it should be used, etc.A nice enough and interesting read for an afternoon or two.  The hook about the mysterious author is a way for Lueders to distance himself from the opinions, but I'm not sure the supposed disguise was necessary.  ""The Clam Lake Papers"" is recommended for avid cabin-book readers, as well as for residents of the Upper Midwest.  Oh, and if you're interested in the crafting, development, and employment of metaphors (and how they are the essence of human life), this one's got your name written all over it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O1HP4Y2GJ2RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060653124#wasThisHelpful","R1O1HP4Y2GJ2RL","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cindy Ross was a young adult when she tackled the Appalachian Trail and hiked the 2000+-miles from Georgia to Maine.  It took her a few separate stints over two years, and two different hiking partners went with her.  Here she describes portions of her experience for us.  Her highs and lows are nearly as dramatic as the mountains she traverses:  with utter euphoria in successes, and sobbing sessions at setbacks.  Nevertheless, this is an endeavor that will change her life path forever.This book is not a step-by-step AT guide.  (Other volumes and maps serve that purpose.)  Ross's approach is more emotional.  Instead, it's about the spirit and personal accomplishment of the act, and not necessarily about the miles themselves.  The text also appears in a flourished italic font in order to resemble a handwritten journal.  Ross's own line drawings go along perfectly with her words.This was evidently Ms. Ross's first foray into the field.  More miles and more adventures lay ahead for her.  She has since published a variety of trail-related books, including her memoirs of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, Journey on the Crest: Walking 2600 Miles from Mexico to Canada and the Continental Divide Trail in Scraping Heaven : A Family's Journey Along the Continental Divide.  She still lives as a writer and artist in the mountains of Pennsylvania.AT through-hiker stories abound, and I've read several.  My favorite is Leslie Mass's In Beauty May She Walk; Hiking the Appalachian Trail at 60.  It obviously offers a different perspective than ""A Woman's Journey"" does.  Readers looking to be inspired by empowered women could turn to that book, too.There's nothing wrong with vicariously thru-hiking by turning the pages of the memoirs of others who have really done it.

"I bought a copy of this book because David Petersen quoted it profusely in Writing Naturally: A Down-To-Earth Guide to Nature Writing.  As a result of reading that text, I wanted to read this one.  What fun!  It sure doesn't take long, though.  Of its 99 pages, only 78 actually have words on them.  And many of those sheets are not crammed full from top to bottom margin.Guthrie warns us on the opening page:  ""Here I put down, as concisely as I can manage, what I have learned through effort, trial and error, association, rejection, and acceptance.""  He's definitely concise, I can attest to that part.  And sometimes his succinctness can be downright amusing.  He comes off as a curmudgeon about the profession, too.  I like his style.  The way he presents himself here makes me want to finally read The Big Sky and his other western novels.I read a lot of books about writing.  (Yes, I admit that it's sometimes easier to READ about writing than it is to sit down and WRITE.)  As Guthrie suggests, beginning writers need a copy of Strunk & White's The Elements of Style (4th Edition) (which this book resembles, in a way).  He also recommends John Gardner's The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers, which I own but have yet to read.  Then Guthrie zips through it all:  viewpoint, characters, plots, dialogue, plausibility, figures of speech, and so on and so on.  Forty of the shortest chapters you'll ever read -- and yet, all of them worthwhile.  His practical advice is aimed at writers who are in the middle of the muddle and who either need reminders about such things, or a kick in the pants.  True beginners won't know enough to understand the whys and wherefores.  And they may not know who A. B. Guthrie, Jr. was.Guthrie's guide is not a necessary purchase.  But when so many used copies are offered at bargain prices, it becomes an easy addition to make to any personal library.  If you're someone who loves to read about writing and who gets inspiration by doing so, then this book is one to get, read, and keep on a nearby shelf for a random quick fix.

"Lately I've been reading a lot about nature writing:  what it is, and how to do it.  This title keeps popping up in bibliographies and reference lists.  I thought it might be dry or potentially unhelpful, since it appeared at first to be merely a slim transcript of four academic presentations.  But no!  I can attest that it's instead a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the craft and the profession, courtesy of a handful of key contemporary writers of natural history.These four dialogues were held at the University of Utah in February 1988.  The talks were moderated but left unstructured.  Each evening featured a pairing of two writers:  Barry Lopez and Edward O. Wilson; Robert Finch and Terry Tempest Williams; Gary Paul Nabhan and Ann Zwinger; and Paul Brooks and Edward Lueders (who moderated all of the sessions).  The subjects of their talks overlap, but never cover completely identical ground.  General topics include:  the roles of natural history writing in our culture; the importance of storytelling; the different approaches taken by scientists and by creative writers; the commitment to a strong sense of place; and the technique of taking field notes and expanding upon them at home.  Each discussion contains a number of gems worthy of highlighting or underlining.The conversations are interesting, as is the participants' booklist at the end.  It could serve as a checklist for your own shelf inventory or for planning future reading choices.  Each participant has written and published more work since this paperback was released in 1989.  It's just a starter list, then.Of the eight, only Paul Brooks (1909-1998) is no longer with us.  Some of the others are ""getting up there,"" you may say.  I've been fortunate enough to hear Robert Finch and E. O. Wilson speak in person.  But if you don't have those kinds of first-hand opportunities, this book will help to provide personal insights.While books like John Murray's Writing About Nature: A Creative Guide and David Peterson's Writing Naturally: A Down-To-Earth Guide to Nature Writing give you advice about craft, this book delves into the why and how of nature writing.  Mostly, the why.It's obviously dated.  So, it sure would be wonderful if someone got a grant and gathered new sets of nature writers to discuss the genre.  Maybe every couple of years, even.To readers who are merely curious about these people and their writings, I give this book four stars.  But to those who are fans or are practitioners who write about nature too, I recommend this book as required reading.

"An outside consultant flies to an Asian country in order to explain to an organization how to improve itself.  (Basically, it's either shape up or ship out.)  For possibly one of the few times in his career, he meets with some success.  And as success can breed success, we witness this weary milktoast of a man suddenly rising to the occasion.  He transforms himself into a Super Consultant:  a cocksure firebrand who doesn't need notes or previous thought in order to deliver his spot-on advice and recommendations to whoever needs to hear it.  Soon he's in demand and off again:  to Denver, to New York, and then to parts of remotest Africa.  And he's being courted by other companies to work for them.But just as quickly as roller coasters climb, they soon crest that top ridge and begin to fall.  And that's what happens to Our Hero as well.  Or does it???I admire some aspects of this book.  The compelling plot and its unique resolution deserve 4.5 stars for craftsmanship.  But occasional grammatical and/or spelling errors knock the finished product down a few pegs for me.  (I'm demanding in that way.)  And the fact that the storyline is very psychological grew to be mind-numbing for me as well.  Nearly all of the characters, including Our Hero, remain nameless in the text. Surely some literary critic could claim that this technique serves to focus on the internal processes rather than on external identities.  Or some such analysis.  For me, it grew a tad bothersome.  And although the story was quite plausible, the main character became likable for me only toward the very end of the book.  The VERY end of the book.Still, ""The Traveller"" is recommended reading for anyone who is a long-distance business traveler, for they will certainly find themselves on some of these pages.  It is especially appropriate for everyone who hates -- truly HATES -- their bosses.  And if you dare to read this book, you may have to turn right around and read it a second time; for after reaching the climax (!), you may want another go-round to take advantage of knowing NOW what you did not know THEN.For me, once was enough; but it did make for interesting reading.

"I must begin this review by saying that I've admired John Hanson Mitchell's work for years.  This isn't the first of his books that I've read and reviewed.  I've seen John at readings and conferences, and we've had a few quick chats in person and in letters.Here he's brought us back to a territory called ""Scratch Flat.""  We first encountered this place in several of his previous books:  Ceremonial Time: Fifteen thousand Years on One Square Mile and Living at the end of Time; and as a tangential reference in two more, Trespassing: An Inquiry Into the Private Ownership of Land and Walking Towards Walden: A Pilgrimage in Search of Place.  This time the focus is obviously on the plant and animal life that Mitchell has witnessed -- and often, whose presence he has even initiated -- over the decades of his residency.  His main topic is his garden; but as usual, he doesn't mind at all about digressing into adjacencies.  He wanders at will.The exact location of these two acres is described only in general terms.  Perhaps Mitchell truly wants to keep the site a secret.  Perhaps he uses this technique to better connect with readers who may be looking for qualities of their own properties in these pages.  After all, too many of us have witnessed the carving out of highways or the dropping of suburban developments on fallow fields:  both too-new scars on previously open and presumed worthless landscape.  We long to create sanctuaries from the storm, for the benefit of those other wild ones who need consistent habitats.  Mitchell has done this.  So even though I know the name of his town, I'll go along with its anonymity here.  Let's just say, it could be anywhere.""I have always favored gardens that are rough around the edges,"" Mitchell says. (p. 54) In and around his planned-out plots, he has let Nature take her course.  He's quick to admit that he's rescued or even stolen plants from other properties in the region, and has found worthy sites to relocate them.  He talks about how this place has evolved in his lifetime, and what he's planted and why.  We also follow him as he prepares the scene for an upcoming late-summer wedding.  Will the grounds be ceremony-worthy by then?But this isn't a gardening book, per se.  (You'll enjoy the reading more if you can at least distinguish a dandelion from a delphinium, however.)  This is instead a natural history book at its core.  And Mitchell explores the full range of other creatures who share this site with him:  mammals, amphibians, fungi, fairies, and insects, tons of insects.  ""The children of the compound"" often accompany him, as do a few domesticated animals.  Surprisingly enough, this long-time MassAudubon editor puts off a study of birds until one of the later chapters in the book.  Mitchell's insightful and thoughtful prose flows across the pages, especially when he bows toward environmentalism.  Suzan Osborn's vibrant impressionistic watercolors lend just the right amount of perspective and chapter-leading glimpses at a place that's still kept ""rough around the edges.""  Countryman Press also did a terrific job with the high quality of the physical book itself.John Hanson Mitchell is among my favorites, and I enjoyed this newest vicarious visit with him.  ""An Eden of Sorts"" is recommended for lovers of natural history; for those who have read Mitchell's previous books, even though those titles are not exactly prerequisites for this one.  Avid gardeners may find a kindred spirit here as well, especially if they like to continually ""improve"" their spots.  (Fans of Sara Stein's Noah's Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Backyards may especially like it.)  Non-gardeners will at least be inspired to go out and attempt to inventory the various species they can find in their own backyards.  You have to care about a place in order to want to save it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9D36OV48S3DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1581571720#wasThisHelpful","R9D36OV48S3DI","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must begin this review by saying that I admire David Petersen's work.  His 2005 release, On the Wild Edge: In Search of a Natural Life, sits on a nearby shelf:  the one that's reserved for secondary and contemporary nature writers.  (The top shelf is crammed full of the best of Abbey, Burroughs, Dillard, LeBastille, Leopold, Muir, Olson, Teale, Thoreau, and others.)  So in my recent search for books about the CRAFT of nature writing, I was pleased to see that a familiar author had penned one.  Then I had to read it.Petersen has a unique informal style in addressing his readers.  His narratives read like in-person monologues and conversations, complete with opinions loudly voiced.  Readers can choose to ride along for the fun, learn a bit, laugh on occasion, and let some prickly remarks slide by.  Or they can become incensed at the author's presumed authority and rail against him.  The decision is free to make.  I take the former stance.The ""basics"" of this book are great, even as a refresher course.  Petersen covers a good deal of territory:  how to write essays, articles, journals, and books; attending to grammar, style, transitions, publishing, and the personal writing process.  His is an easy and thoughtful read, worthy of underlining or highlighting terrific salient points and relevant quotes.  And his concluding page is a sure-fire motivator.  Every nature writer should read it.  Every WRITER should read it.  It's guaranteed to get you putting pen to paper or placing finger on keyboard.  But don't jump ahead.  Read the rest of the pages first.I've got only two bones to pick with this book.  The first one comes with the chapter about writers' workshops and conferences.  Petersen freely admits that he never attended any as a student, and that he taught at only one, in 1998.  (This book grew from his instruction there.)  So it's difficult to take without question what he says about workshops.  I suspect that many folks who are apt to pick up this book will have already gone to at least one writing seminar or session before reaching this chapter.  They can surely use their own judgment and experiences as their guides in this case.The other caution comes as a caveat emptor.  This book was released in 2001.  Petersen worked on it in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Considering the length of the publishing process, this text is now well on its way to being a decade and a half old.  So while the basics still apply to the art of writing in general, there are indeed certain spots where Petersen's advice now fails.  The chapter on research desperately needs an update about the current state of library and online resources.  And the Internet and the preference toward digitalization have both since changed the ability to publish as well:  with the explosion of online outlets (blogs, etc.), e-books, and even the method of checking web sites for submission details.  We may not need to rely on the newest print edition of ""The Writer's Market"" anymore.  We certainly don't need a whole chapter about that.  There are other ways to submit and to get our pieces out there.Today may be a good day to assemble a second edition of this one, David.  You'd have few competitors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JMVU7MRBE76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555662730#wasThisHelpful","R21JMVU7MRBE76","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great story!  It's about a quirky and challenging self-imposed project that involves travel and adventure.  And it happens to be true, which makes it even more delightful.His first homemade boat sank when he was six years old.  That's when John Pollack vowed to himself that he would build a boat that had no chance of sinking -- one made entirely of corks from wine bottles.  So he and his family members began to save them, one at a time.Fast forward a few decades, and John is at loose ends in Washington, D.C.  He just finished up a great speechwriting stint for President Clinton.  But when the Bush administration steps in, John's ready to get out of the political scene.  Why not revisit his lifelong goal of building a cork boat?  And the action really picks up from this point on.  Soon John is dealing with a perfectionist partner and a multitude of corks, rubber bands, assembly line volunteers, and tow truck drivers.  Two-thirds of the book deals with the process.  The final third of the book details the Cork Boat's unbelievable inaugural voyage down Portugal's Douro River.The narrative is well paced, and John is obviously a good writer.  This is the kind of book where the intrigue of the idea alone can compel you to start reading; but the action and language serve to sustain your interest.  Gradually you have no choice but to sit back and cheer on the guy and his team.  The hardback edition is even a joy to hold, with its palm-sized pages, depictive dust jacket, and handy-dandy maps on the flyleaves at both ends of the block.  Even your hands won't want you to put it down.""Cork Boat"" is highly recommended reading for anyone who enjoys a good tale, especially one with a travel element.  No nautical experience is required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TE4QA88GUOZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375422579#wasThisHelpful","R3TE4QA88GUOZ9","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's an interesting assignment:  Frame a story around the songs found on a classic record album.  That's what Chad Gayle has done with ""Let It Be: A Novel.""The action does not take place at the time of the release of the final Beatles album and famous group break-up, however (1970).  Instead, it's nine full years later:  musically, unfortunately, in the midst of the disco era.  The setting is Amarillo, Texas, where members of one small family are doing their best to survive.  Michelle and Bill Jansen are divorcing.  Their children Pam and Joseph have moved with Michelle into a new-to-them city.  Each individual has his/her own struggles to deal with and to resolve.  For 10-year-old Joseph, it's finding his niche in the hierarchy established by the other local kids.  For teenager Pam, it's discovering what she can get away with.  For Bill, it's a douse of denial and settling scores.  For Michelle, it's getting used to a new job and the possibility of dating and falling in love again.  Let It Be is the album she puts on the turntable whenever she wants to feel good about herself and her stressful situation.  The melodies take her back to a better and less complicated time.So yes, it's a simple story, and one that could be considered to be a universal one.  What makes this telling unique is its connection with the music.  I borrowed a copy of the ""Let It Be"" CD after I finished reading the book.  (Something I recommend that all future readers do.)  While I applaud Chad Gayle for the idea and the approach, I believe he didn't go far enough.  Of the 12 songs on the album, only 8 are used as chapter titles in the book.  I was disappointed that four songs were left out.  I think if you intend to use this premise as your framework, you should go for the whole enchilada.  And I think the omitted ones could have been worked fairly into the plot line.For a first novel, this work is innovative.  The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of the book, even though I don't especially like most of the characters.  Without the album connection, this novel would have been merely a coming-of-age story for young Joseph.  If all 12 songs had been used, it could have been a masterpiece.  Gayle's approach does give us an added dimension and the interaction of both the visual act of reading and the aural act of listening. Overall though, I think this is a slightly above average book that could have been a bit better.Recommended for readers of either gender who may be intrigued by the story-song framework.  Beatles fans may be especially curious.  Just be sure you have your old CD or vinyl album handy.[This review is based on reading a promotional copy donated in exchange for a fair review.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRHWRI0DTSG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988661004#wasThisHelpful","R1VRHWRI0DTSG9","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was overjoyed to come across this book on a mystery swap table a few weeks ago.  Bill Tapply remains one of my favorite writers.  I read all three of his Stoney Calhoun books, as well as the three mysteries he wrote in tag-team style with fellow New Englander Philip Craig.  (I've read some of his nonfiction outdoors books, too, and even had a chance to chat with him in person to thank him.)  I thought it might be time to go back and finally read the whole Brady Coyne series.  This is the 10th episode in the full run of 24, and I have to admit that for Bill Tapply, it's merely average writing.  Then again, he produced it during only the first decade of his long writing career.  I don't believe he had hit his stride yet with this one.Attorney Brady Coyne is invited to a client's home on Cape Cod for the weekend.  Who could resist such an offer, especially when the fish are biting?  But in the middle of the night, Brady is assaulted and the client is robbed, beaten, and left for dead.  No one has asked the Boston lawyer to play detective, but this situation has quickly gotten personal.  Can he figure out who orchestrated the theft?  Can he locate the seven gold Mayan jaguars with the emerald eyes?  Can life ever be normal again for his client?  And -- as usual -- can Brady get the girl in the end?A lot of puzzling goes into unraveling the truth here, and a fair amount of additional violence has to take place before Brady understands what happened and who was responsible.  Some answers come from a different place, and others were just hiding in plain sight.  Brady is one of the good guys, though, so we are fairly assured that he'll be successful in his quest.Readers should be cautioned about a printing error in an early edition of ""The Spotted Cats.""  The hardback copy that I read is missing about two pages of text at the beginning of Chapter Four.  It's not that any pages were torn out, or that the pages were left blank.  Someone wasn't paying attention during the initial publishing process.  A sentence is left dangling, and the next paragraph doesn't continue the action where it left off.  It jumps ahead.  Luckily, I found another copy from another printing at our local library, and I was able to see and read the missing portion of the initial police officer interrogation scene.  You can figure out what happens without it, but of course it's nice to have access to the full story.""The Spotted Cats"" is recommended for Tappy, Craig, and Brady Coyne fans.  Newbies to the series can start with this one if they wish.  Just be aware that while this one is good, there are other Tapply mysteries waiting out there that are even more compelling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J96E8OTEEKVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385302339#wasThisHelpful","R3J96E8OTEEKVQ","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Business executive and widow Linda Crill tried for a year and a half to ""get on with her life"" after her husband Bill died.  Nothing really worked.  She was as miserable as ever.  Then a flippant remark about learning to ride a motorcycle developed into a commitment to join three other riders on a 10-day bike tour of the Pacific coast.  Linda had to quickly learn how to manage the machine, take a class, pass the driver's test, practice riding a borrowed cycle, buy leathers, and make arrangements for the flight from Virginia to Vancouver, the starting point.  Her trip from the board room to VROOM! was not without its glitches, but she succeeded.  We join her journey here.We follow Linda through all of those tasks she must master before she hits the road with Ron, Alberto, and Eva.  Then we go along for the ride as the quartet rides hundreds of miles a day, passing through the spectacular scenery of Washington, Oregon, and California.  Driving a motorcycle is different from driving a car or a bicycle.  At first there's so much to remember that Linda spends more effort paying attention to the bike and to the road than in appreciating the places she's traveling through.  Sure, on this trip she learns much about motorcycles and the culture surrounding them.  But she also gains quite a lot of knowledge about herself.  Here she's asked to be a follower or a team member, dropping out of her typical business role as leader or analyzer.  She can't help but continually scrutinize situations, however.  Now she has the time to be introspective, with opportunities to analyze herself and her own behavior, under circumstances that she never expected to be in.  These realizations are worthwhile for both Linda and for us (though they sometimes last longer than we may need).  It turns out that the term ""blind curves"" makes for a nifty metaphor.""Blind Curves"" is recommended for female readers of all ages, and could be especially helpful for those who are facing challenges of their own.  Linda's lesson is that we sometimes need to be jolted out of our comfort zones in order to understand ourselves better and to regain control of our lives.  She leads by example.  And it's a guarantee that we'll all look differently at motorcycle riders from this time on.[A review copy of this book was sent to me by The Cadence Group, in exchange for an honest review.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZMEIWL8RHJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098589850X#wasThisHelpful","RJZMEIWL8RHJ8","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've driven around Minnesota fairly frequently over the course of the past decade, especially for someone who is based on the East Coast.  So I was pleased to have the opportunity to get an advance copy of this new road atlas from National Geographic.  I had a 2006 edition of DeLorme's Minnesota Atlas and Gazetteer sitting on the passenger seat of my car during my previous trips to the Gopher State.  I thought that it might be time to get an updated reference.Some introductory matter begins the book.  A four-page spread of ""Places of Interest"" outlines 36 worthwhile sites to visit throughout the state, with one-paragraph descriptions for each one, and photographs of 20 of them.  I've been to only six of the sites, and the write-ups for these six are fairly accurate.  But the entries are not in any regional or even alphabetical order.  They include the names of the towns where the sites are located; but since the names are embedded within the text, they're not found quickly or easily.  The biggest oversight is that there are no page numbers and map coordinates to go along with the descriptions.  If a place is indeed of interest to the user, she'll have to read the paragraph, find the name of the town, turn to the back of the book for the index, find the town name with its page number and map coordinates, and then turn to the proper page and look for the town and site.  <sigh>  I'm very surprised that the National Geographic editors didn't think of the users in this respect.  AAA guides do it.  So do the DeLorme books.  And the charts that follow the ""Places of Interest"" here -- for campgrounds, state parks, trails, golf, and recreational lakes -- DO include page numbers and map references.  Although smartphone QR codes are also printed on the ""Places of Interest"" pages, they lead people to the state tourism web site, Explore Minnesota.  This direction probably won't help them find any of the individual sites any easier, either.Then again, most users may not read or even look at the first few pages.  After all, this is an atlas, and people will buy it for the detailed maps that National Geographic is known for.  Here the book is very much like the DeLorme books.  Can maps really differ all that much?  Well, sure they can, especially with varying type styles and colors.  And don't forget scale.  NG offers a closer look with the 1:175,000 perspective than DeLorme does at 1:190,000.  This book thus has more maps and pages.I decided to evaluate these new maps by looking for the sites that I've visited.  Most were fine and appeared just as I expected.  But although NG outlines the territory of the Lower Sioux Indian Community along the Minnesota River, it does not pinpoint the site of the nearby Lower Sioux Agency History Center, which is affiliated with the Minnesota Historical Society.  (Though it does mark the casino down the road from it.)  Other MHS sites are noted with squares and names.  Why not this one?  My Delorme book marks it.And a glance at the city of Red Wing, along the Mississippi River, shows the location of ""Barns Bluff Park.""  Really?  ""Barns""?  Barn Bluff is a singular geologic formation that NG map makers should be familiar with.  It's in every print gazetteer, and it's easily found online.  And it's Barn, without an s.  Always has been, always will be.  Hmmm.  If some of my favorite places are missing or mislabeled here, what else could be wrong?While it's nice to now have a newer Minnesota road atlas to take with me on my next trip west, I have to admit that I'm not throwing away my older DeLorme edition.  I'll take both along from now on.  Your results may vary.~~ Corinne H.

"When we go hiking at an outdoor recreation area, we rarely notice the condition of the trail itself.  That is, unless a recent storm has blown down a sizable tree, right onto the path.  (And even then, we'd only have to problem-solve if we had to climb over it or walk around it.)  This is as it should be.  This means that the park's maintenance crew did a good job.  Who are these ""traildogs,"" and what do they really do?  Christine Byl draws back the curtain on the world of these underappreciated workers, as she and her colleagues tramp through some of our most beautiful and wild western places.She frames her memoir with six tools of her trade:  axe, rock bar, chainsaw, boat, skid steer, and shovel.  Don't worry if a few of them are unfamiliar.  She'll explain.  Along the way we hear her own story, beginning as a seasonal laborer at Glacier National Park in Montana.  These are days of learning how to fell trees, build bridges, and even pay attention to angles of walkway ascent and descent.  Naturally, there are interactions with wildlife of both varieties:  animals and tourists.  We tag along with Christine and her husband Gabe as they move to Alaska, where they first work for the Forest Service in Cordova before landing jobs at Denali National Park and Preserve.  Are you kidding me?  Living and working within sight of the tallest mountain in North America?  Is this the pinnacle of park service maintenance work as well?  Read more to find out.Some may wonder, Why read (or write) a book about people digging post holes and tearing down trees?  Well, Christine's account is not just about the down-and-dirty daily tasks (many of which require heavy lifting), but also about the people who choose to do them.  You'll meet some real characters here.  An outsider might have glamorized this work, might have romanticized it, given the stereotypical idea readers may have about working close to protected nature.  Admittedly, the book's subject matter alone may deserve only a four-star rating.  It's Christine's terrific and engaging writing style that brings the narrative up a notch.  She's a pro who can craft elegant turns of phrase even while describing the grimiest of situations.Sure, there are underlying themes here that readers can dwell on, if they wish.  Gender roles, and the whole woman-in-a-man's-job routine.  National parks vs. other wild areas. Montana & the Lower Forty-Eight vs. Alaska.  Even, Man vs. Nature.  Christine offers her succinct opinions in these areas and then moves on.  This isn't an outwardly feminist, environmentalist, or political book.  And that's good.  She's given us just enough insight into a complex workplace and has brought into view the invisible lives of the traildogs.  It's obvious that for Christine and Gabe, this once seasonal and temporary employment has become not only a passion, but also a year-round livelihood.  I can't wait to find out what comes next for these two.""Dirt Work"" is recommended reading for anyone who loves the outdoors.  It certainly will provide food for thought, the next time you're out hiking.  You may even find then that you've brought Christine and her traildogs with you.  The book would also be a great selection for book discussion groups, especially those with a nature focus, for it should appeal to a wide audience of readers.  I took my time with this one in order to savor every page.  I didn't want my time with the traildogs to end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AW7PLPM8UY0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807001007#wasThisHelpful","R3AW7PLPM8UY0Z","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twenty-something Nathan Lochmueller is a professional bird watcher in rural Indiana.  His job may sound idyllic, but it can be a tough one, especially since he's working in an area where most wildlife stalkers carry guns instead of binoculars.  Nathan is also young enough to be still living the carefree, college boy kind of life.  Girls, booze, whatever.  Without fully realizing it, Nathan is searching for his role and his place in the grand scheme of Life.  So are his friends.  And although Nathan is an Indiana native, it sometimes seems as though he's living as a stranger in a strange land.Since the main character tells his own story here, the plot lines wrinkle forward and back in his memories and conversations.  His recount resembles other coming-of-age stories.  Some incidents are mildly amusing, others are downright dangerous.  In a way, the book somehow reminded me of Richard Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America from 1967.  When I grabbed my old copy and paged through it, though, I decided that No, it wasn't much like that book after all.  Not off the wall enough.  I ended up mostly feeling sorry for Nathan.  Is the place changing, or is he?  It's depressing to think that the people in such rural spots are the way they're depicted in these pages.  Yet the portrayal is all too realistic.""Snapper"" is a decent enough tale to visit for a while.  What it might mean in the long run is up for grabs.  Did I like it, or Nathan?  Not a lot.  I don't agree with the publisher's back cover blurb that it reflects ""a great, hilarious new voice in fiction.""  Maybe it's a guy thing.  Or a younger generation thing.  Author Brian Kimberling does offer a fresh view that we could expand upon to consider the choices we make, especially in the places where we decide to live.  That's the sense that I gained from it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3910T0XEUGJIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908054#wasThisHelpful","R3910T0XEUGJIL","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This picture book is a wonderful international embodiment of ""the ripple effect:"" What you do affects me; what I do affects you.  It offers a universal lesson to not take casual encounters for granted.""Because Amelia smiled, coming down the street, Mrs. Higgins smiled, too.""  The story begins simply enough.

"During a fifteen-year time span, I lived in or near Altoona, Pennsylvania.  I always heard that the Germans had intended to destroy Horseshoe Curve during World War II, but no one I ever talked to could provide any details of the story.  That's why I was intrigued by the title of this book.  But as a previous reviewer has already noted, the book addresses the POTENTIAL sabotage of the Curve and the THEORETICAL subversion in Altoona; and it provides more back story and diversions than one might imagine possible in one volume.  Still, if you're intrigued by the subject matter, you may find this to be a worthwhile read.The narrative is divided into three parts.  The first one describes the German sabotage mission that landed four men on the coast of Long Island and four others on the coast of northern Florida in June 1942.  The Germans were assigned eleven targets to dismantle in order to cripple the United States:  key factories, transportation centers, and public works facilities that were located in the Northeast, Midwest, or Mid-South.  Included on the list was the Horseshoe Curve, which led the main railroad line west of Altoona and through the Allegheny Mountains toward Pittsburgh.  But the eight saboteurs never had a chance to implement their plans.  Almost immediately, they were caught and their mission was thwarted, thanks to one turncoat in the group.  Within two months of their shoreline arrivals, six of the eight men were executed, and the other two (one of them, the informant) were imprisoned.  McIlnay supplies many details of their trials and even the minute-by-minute blows of their executions.  If you ever wanted to know anything about this tale, you will probably find it here.The second part of the book deals with ""subversion.""  At the same time that the Germans were planning their mischief, J. Edgar Hoover was assembling a massive list of ""alien enemies"" who lived in the United States and who represented potential danger to the country's safety.  We forget, if we ever knew, that some German-Americans and Italian-Americans were sent to internment camps in the 1940s, just like the Japanese-Americans were.  On July 1, 1942, 225 potential alien enemies were arrested in Altoona ... and then just as quickly, they were released.  Author McIlnay does his best to track down the real meat of this story, but he ends up merely teasing us.  He finds some people whose relatives had been involved in the arrest, but he chooses not to identify them or even to tell generically of their experiences.  Instead, he devotes his pages to J. Edgar Hoover and the larger reach of his initiative.  The local element is noticeably absent here, except in the reproductions of the newspaper headlines of the day.The third part of the book is a history of the Pennsylvania Railroad itself, and how the Horseshoe Curve came to be designed and built.  Actually, McIlnay first steps back to the days of Pennsylvania's canal system of the 1820s, which eventually lead to the beginning of the railroads in the Keystone State.  (But not before he gives us a history of railroading in general, especially in England.)  Clearly the hero is John Edgar Thomson, who was president of the Pennsylvania Railroad for 22 years.  He was also the chief engineer who defined the route and supervised construction of the Horseshoe Curve.  Rail fans may particularly want to absorb the details supplied in this section, which go well beyond just the creation of the Curve.  But since this history laid the foundation for the possible German sabotage, as well as the arrest of subversives in the state's largest railroad city, we are caused to travel backward as we turn the pages of this book.  Another author might have reversed the order of the tales.Author McIlnay is admittedly at his best at the end of the journey, when he himself makes a pilgrimage to Horseshoe Curve to see what he can see.  The mystique of this feat of engineering comes when you stand in the middle of it, and when trains are clattering all around you, on their way up or down the mountain.  (Don't follow the author's rambling directions on how to reach the Curve, however.  I-99 is a north-south route that he insists on describing in east-west terms.  If you're interested in railroads and the Curve, you should first visit the Railroaders Memorial Museum in downtown Altoona.  It's a great place to start your tour, and maps to the Curve are available there.  You'll also get a discount on admission.)I understand all too well the desire to share everything one knows about a topic.  I hesitate to chastise another author for something I tend to do myself.  McIlnay goes above and beyond in the habit, however.  This book is at times a tangential and therefore tedious read.  I am glad I made it through it, because I wanted to know these stories.  Other readers may not be as forgiving, and may abandon the venture after the opening section.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVPUTPRWBHXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KAF5CE#wasThisHelpful","R2KVPUTPRWBHXI","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On April 16, 2004, Professor Abner Fraume is strangled to death by Professor Emil Kravitz in Bath, England.  Why?  Because Fraume owns a set of rare 15th-century typesetting artifacts that Kravitz desperately wants.  Unfortunately for the murderer, the items are no longer in Fraume's house.  The researcher had anticipated his rival's intentions and had mailed the package elsewhere.  Then he also sent three separate letters to his sister Edythe containing cryptic clues revealing the package's location.  At the scene of the crime, Kravitz sees one of the letters and reads its clue.  He thus knows where his search must lead next:  to Edythe Bender's Olde Victorian Bookstore in Annapolis, Maryland.But alas!  Before Edythe can fully deal with her brother's death and with the artifact clues, she herself succumbs to cancer.  Enter Dan and Rivka Sherman, acquaintances of Edythe.  The bookstore owner knew her time was limited, and she convinced the Shermans to buy the business before she died.  The couple is brand new to this type of enterprise.  Added to the sudden stress of managing a store is the Shermans' necessary entanglement in the artifact search.  They quickly learn the basic details of the murder in England and its American ties.  The mystery writing critique group that they host at the store has attracted a number of new members.  Four of them are male.  One is probably Emil Kravitz, traveling under an assumed name.  But which one is he?  Can Dan and Rivka uncover his identity, solve the clues, and/or find the artifacts before he does?  How much should the two get involved in an investigation that really shouldn't concern them?Readers are served a rather complex plot here.  They are given the chance to know some of the back story and to witness certain developments as they happen, but not all.  This enticement keeps the pages turning.  We can only hope that Rivka and the artifacts will be saved, and that Kravitz will receive the punishment that he deserves.Still, some niggling discrepancies in the narrative prevent this novel from being a flawless offering.  The bookstore seems to operate more like a library, with the clerk filing the volumes by Dewey numbers instead of by genre and surname.  No one notices if anyone is speaking strangely, or with a possible disguised accent, when at least one of the men must be a British investigator who is tailing the Chicago-born Kravitz.  As a reader, I found myself questioning circumstances more often than I usually do.Overall, ""Death Goes Postal"" is a decent read with somewhat compelling main characters that may appeal to an audience of both genders.  I won't keep track as new installments are added to the series, however.  I may have had a different response to this book if I hadn't just read Wendy Welch's The Little Bookstore of Big Stone Gap: A Memoir of Friendship, Community, and the Uncommon Pleasure of a Good Book right before it.  Her memoir depicts the everyday dealings of the used bookstore that she and her husband started in the mountains of Virginia.  If you want to know what it's REALLY like in the independent book business, that's the volume you should pick up.  Cozy mystery series based on bookstores include Carolyn Hart's Death on Demand series, Lorna Barrett's Booktown Mysteries, and Allison Kingsley's Raven's Nest Bookstore Mysteries.  Dan and Rivka's first adventure, though unique and challenging, is relatively average by comparison.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19JM2WKKEW5XE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098385971X#wasThisHelpful","R19JM2WKKEW5XE","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit up front that in 1972, I was 15 years old and liked the Kansas City Chiefs. I hated the Miami Dolphins. I have since grown to appreciate several AFC teams: but alas, never the Dolphins. I like reading good football stories, though, and that's why I chose to read ""Perfection,"" which was released in time to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Dolphins' 17-0 perfect season. After reading this ""warts and all"" chronicle of the team, even Dolfans may have to admit that while Perfection lay in the final record, it was not always found in the team's front office, locker room, or off-the-field behaviors.The 17 chapters follow the framework set by the 17 games. The authors provide the facts of each contest, along with profiles of players and other personnel as they take the stage. It's as if a ribbon is being woven, with the trajectories of single strands coming together to form that singular roster and its common goal: to win the Super Bowl, after having lost it the previous year.We especially learn more about Coach Don Shula and about Bob Griese himself and the intricacies of being a quarterback. When Griese gets injured in Game 5 against San Diego, veteran QB Earl Morrall steps in and leads the team well over the following weeks. Griese appears for a few series in Game 14, the last regular season game; then comes back for good in the second half of Game 16, the AFC Championship Game against the Steelers. The Black and Gold was fresh off its ""immaculate"" win against the hated Raiders. But Miami prevailed. ""It wasn't their time yet,"" says Griese. ""It was ours.""Yes, this is a feel-good, hooray-for-the-underdog, sports story. It's difficult not to smile at the end. The narrative additionally reveals the machinations of the league back then, in its early days. The varying techniques about dealing with trades, the draft, and other practices, are ones that may not be tolerated today. Griese and Hyde are also quite frank about the costs of the game to the health of the team members. They outline those instances where guys played with severe injuries, and used drugs to be able to do so. Forty years later, these choices have manifested themselves in the aging bodies of the former players. The text reinforces the lengths that an athlete will go to be able to play the game and to make the money: which back then, wasn't really much money at all. The fact that this imbedded message comes from Bob Griese, one of the well-known good guys, makes it all the more impactful. And you really have to wonder just how often Bob has watched all of those 40-year-old films.""Perfection"" is not the first recollection of this season. It''s not even the first book by journalist Dave Hyde on the subject. Ten years ago, he did a 30th anniversary book with Don Shula, Still Perfect! The Untold Story of the 1972 Miami Dolphins. Recently Mike Freeman has also chimed in with Undefeated: Inside the 1972 Miami Dolphins' Perfect Season. I have not yet read either book, and so cannot offer advice about them.Football fans are really outsiders looking in, hoping to find heroes. They might find a few here. And this is not a tale just for Miami fans. You'll like this book if you enjoy learning about planning offensive and defensive game strategies. You'll like it if you yearn to recognize names from the past, like Jim Kiick, Larry Csonka, Paul Warfield, and Larry Little (just to mention a few). ""Perfection"" is recommended reading for any student or fan of the game. What I'd LOVE to read (and may even be interested enough to write someday) would be a companion and comparison account of the near-perfect 2007 New England Patriots to the 1972 Miami Dolphins. I wonder if Bill Belichick would ever allow that to happen?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBAVT6L42P3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118218094#wasThisHelpful","R2HBAVT6L42P3Z","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had read and enjoyed Adriana Trigiani's Big Stone Gap novels (Big Stone Gap, Big Cherry Holler, Milk Glass Moon, and Home to Big Stone Gap) when they were first released a while ago.  So I wasn't entirely unfamiliar with this little mountainous corner of southwestern Virginia before I picked up this book.  It's almost ironic that Wendy Welch and her husband Jack Beck choose this very town as the site that could fulfill their long-time dream:  to own a used bookstore.  Had either one of them ever run a small retail business?  No.  Did they know anyone in Big Stone Gap beforehand?  No.  Did they have sizable capital to invest in a new venture?  No.  Were the local and national economies robust enough to encourage such an endeavor, right out of the chute?  Not really.  But these challenges didn't stop Wendy and Jack from launching themselves into the fray.  They were lovers of books, after all.  And they wanted to share that passion and ignite it in others.Wendy relates the sketchy beginnings of Tales of the Lonesome Pine Used Books, as well as the fish-out-of-water encounters with local residents.  In this respect, the narrative resembles the stories of most small but gradually vibrant businesses.  Readers can approach this tale in several ways.  They can appreciate it as a good-things-eventually-happen-to-good-people story.  They can smile and laugh at the questions and antics of the quirky customers the store owners get to meet.  They can savor it as a darned good story that happens to be based on books and literature.  Or they can understand it as either a cautionary tale or one of ultimate inspiration.  The first page reads:  ""If you have ever walked away from doing something 'important' to do something better, this book is dedicated to you.  It's also dedicated to everyone who loves books.""  A wide audience.Each chapter starts with an appropriate quote; and none of them are the tired and overly used ones that we run across often enough.  (Some, I had to write out and save for my own collection.)  They mirror the chapter themes.  Late in the book, Wendy reveals her top reading recommendations, along with a follow-up list of ""Classics that shouldn't be.""  Whether you agree or disagree with her assignments, this section provides much food for thought.  If someone asked *you* for advice on a few good books that everyone should read, what would you come up with?""The Little Bookstore of Big Stone Gap"" is a must for book lovers, wherever they may be.  Adriana Trigiani fans should enjoy it, too, if they are willing to dabble with nonfiction.  And if this story resounds with folks who decide to make the trip over the Blue Ridge Mountains to see the shop in person, so much the better.  Let's keep the independents alive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NWBEDOZQQWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250010632#wasThisHelpful","R37NWBEDOZQQWB","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quirky Minnesotan Mira James finds herself with several weeks of seasonal unemployment, so she bites the bullet and decides to go back home to celebrate the holidays with her mother.  But all too soon a disturbing trend emerges.  A serial killer who strikes only in December has made his/her way north into Minnesota.  In the past two years, young brunette women have been offed in Chicago and in Wisconsin.  The Candy Cane Killer leaves signature treats, but has yet to be caught.  Naturally, Mira -- a brunette herself -- gets in the way of the investigation.  Or does she help to SOLVE the mystery?  With this gal, it can sometimes be difficult to tell.At the same time, Mira is finally taking steps to become a licensed private investigator.  (Why shouldn't she?  She's been stumbling across dead bodies on a regular basis, ever since she moved to Battle Lake eight months ago.)  Her trusty and eccentric sidekick, Mrs. Berns, even shows up in Paynesville to lend a hand, both to protect Mira's mother and to track down the perpetrator.  What the two don't quite realize is the seriousness of this particular endeavor.  They're dealing with someone who is struggling with such intense personal demons, that he/she is taking advice from a brown-haired doll.  We readers are privy to information hidden from the view of our dynamic duo, so we can understand some of the disturbing thought behind the acts.  But that doesn't mean that this is an easy mystery for US to solve, either.  Even when we know that Mira is about to meet the killer in a final face-to-face showdown, we still can't be sure who that person will turn out to be.As usual, author Jess Lourey has given us a terrific read.  The Murder-By-Month Mysteries feature a very likable main character in Mira James.  The antics and banter between Mira and Mrs. Berns rivals that of Lucy and Ethel, or of any other good comedy team.  In fact, at their essence, these stories are comedies with some killing tossed in (unfortunately, for the victims) for good measure.Yes, ""December Dread"" is about solving a mystery and catching a killer.  But it's also about being with friends and family, coming to terms with your past, and having the courage to go home again.  Readers who are drawn into the series for the first time here, through this seasonal offering, should go back and start the whole shebang with May Day.  They won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HVVFT2FOQ88H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738731889#wasThisHelpful","R1HVVFT2FOQ88H","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Renowned German author Gunther Grass doesn't usually keep a journal.  But after the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, Grass felt compelled to jot down daily developments during what would prove to be an historic time.  This volume covers the period from January 1, 1990 to February 1, 1991.  Here is a first-hand account of what was happening in the new Germany and in the burgeoning European Union, as reported by one of the most politically and environmentally conscious writers of our day.But these pages offer much more.  We also get insights into the life of the writer himself.  We witness his creative process at work.  Even while he monitors the continual updates on the reunification front, Grass considers the nuances of fictional characters, settings, and plot lines.  This year sees him begin to sketch out the elements of two books to be published later: Call of the Toad (Unkenrufe) and Too Far Afield (Ein weites Feld).At the same time, Grass holds a schedule of nearly nonstop public readings and lectures.  He simultaneously travels among his homes in Portugal, Paris, Germany, and Denmark, and spends a great deal of time cooking, gardening, and entertaining.  It would be challenging to keep up with his hectic lifestyle, even without such important changes happening in his native region.A few of Grass's exquisite line drawings are included.  He describes making his own ink out of squid and walnut shells, too.  Ever recurring in the text and the illustrations is the motif of the toad.  A real one shows up on the final page.Readers don't have to have a firm grasp of German politics -- past or present -- in order to understand some of the ramifications of the events.  But I have to be honest:  it sure does help.  Otherwise, appendices in the back of the book offer more details about the people, places, historical events, and political parties that are referenced throughout the text.  Grass's concerns about environmental issues are prescient, given what we know now.  And as his journal ends just as the first Gulf war is beginning, we are left to consider what subsequent international confrontations have happened since Grass penned these words.Read these journal entries, and you're apt to wish there were more volumes of them available.  The passages may entice you to read Grass's other writings, especially the two books mentioned earlier.  ""From Germany to Germany"" is recommended reading for German students, for fellow writers, and for anyone interested in this historic era in German history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0SL8XX3GULM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547364601#wasThisHelpful","R2W0SL8XX3GULM","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you survive one of the worst natural disasters in history, your view of what's important in life HAS to change.Here interior decorator Nate Berkus shares his thoughts ""about the relationship between people and their things.""  He begins with his own memoir, and his new-found joy at 13 years of age, when he was given the chance to design and decorate his own basement bedroom.  We follow along as he gets older and first works in an auction house, then launches his own business endeavor.  We meet his partner Fernando Bengoechea.  The couple was together only a year before they were caught in the tsunami of 2004 in Sri Lanka.  Only Nate survived the awful ordeal.  His honesty in recalling the experience is both painful and poignant.Nate shows us around their Chicago apartment and describes the objects that mattered to them.  Then it's on to the stories of other people, their stuff, and where they live and work:  Brian Sawyer, Barri Leiner Grant, Kelly Framel, Steve Berg, Chris Gardner, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Barbara Hill, Dolores Robinson, Corin Nelson, Fabiola Beracasa, Sandy Foster, and Brooke & Michael Hainey.  These friends and/or clients have both inspiring lives and homes.  Nate helps to uncover the bits of their pasts in the present.  The most treasured items often include flea market and eBay finds, as well as natural objects like branches and stones.  This residential excursion concludes by circling back to Nate again:  newly partnered with Carlos Huber and living in a new apartment in New York.  It's the perfect end for the tour.As should be expected, this book is heavy on illustrations, including many double-page spreads.  The advance uncorrected proof included only b&w photographs.  I assume that most if not all of these photos will appear in color in the final publication, which will make for a beautiful book.  It's a tad disconcerting to the reader when objects described in the text are not pictured, or are shown on adjacent pages.  Otherwise, this book delivers as advertised.I have to admit that I've seen Nate Berkus on TV only once:  when he appeared as a guest judge in an episode of HGTV's ""Design Star.""

"Here poet/author Donald Hall once again shares his memories about his grandparents' farm in rural New Hampshire.  In this slim holiday offering, 12-year-old Donnie takes the train from his home in New Haven, Connecticut, north through Boston and through Concord, New Hampshire, and finally arrives at the tiny depot in West Andover.  He's in for a treat:  a chance to spend five days at Christmas with his grandparents.  He had previously visited them only in the summertime, and he always wondered what the farm would be like in winter.  Now he will get to find out, firsthand.This is the simpler time of traveling by horse-drawn carriages, cutting your own wood, milking the cows by hand, filling the dinner table with food raised only on the farm, and going to bed with a hot water bottle tucked between the sheets.  Donnie helps his grandparents with the chores and is amazed at the differences between summer and winter.  He's also dealing with his youthful yearnings to be in two places at once:  in Connecticut with his parents, and especially with his ailing mother; or with his grandparents, here in his favorite, special place.  Yes, the grown-ups talk about FDR and the war in Europe, as everyone dives into the Christmas feast.  But that seems like a world away.Hall's easy style of narration is a joy to read.  An added bonus is the addition of Mary Azarian's line drawings, which add just the right touch of old-fashioned whimsy to the story.  This is a quiet and reflective book that's perfect for the season and for readers of all ages.  It feeds the human need to go back home again.  Only in the concluding Acknowledgements pages do we learn the reality behind the tale.Those who wish to hear more about Donald Hall's grandparents; farm -- which now happily, he calls his own -- can find lengthier memoirs in Eagle Pond, Here at Eagle Pond, Seasons at Eagle Pond, and String Too Short to Be Saved.  Hall has also based some of his children's books at Eagle Pond:  Lucy's Christmas, Lucy's Summer, The Farm Summer 1942, and Old Home Day.

"... at a time when other girls wanted to MARRY the Beatles.  For Ann and Nancy Wilson, making music was almost always an important part of their lives.  The challenge, then, lay in figuring out how they could make successful careers out of doing it.  But if their ancestor Hannah Dustin could wield a tomahawk and kill her captors to gain her freedom in colonial Massachusetts, then surely the Wilson sisters could don guitars, approach microphones, and slay audiences in the twentieth century.  Eventually, of course, they would.Here they share their story in their own voices:  a duet on the printed page, toggling back and forth between the two women.  It's as if we are sitting across the table from them in a coffee shop, just listening to the two of them recount their experiences and memories.  Other voices of friends and fellow musicians chime in when necessary.  (After all:  the sisters are ""merely"" the front-women for a full-fledged rock band.)  But this one belongs to the Wilsons.This book is everything fans of rock music and of Heart could ask for.  We learn of their beginnings and growing up in a mobile military family, and then settling down in Bellevue, Washington.  The sisters played at any venue that would have them in the early 1970s; and at one point they were known as ""Little Led Zeppelin"" because they played so many Zep covers.  We follow them to Vancouver, British Columbia, and tag along as the band called Heart begins to gain real popularity and initially, in Canada.  After that, the path becomes a whirlwind course of music, touring, fame, and fortune, that spans the course of four decades.Naturally, we are treated to some juicy tales from that insider world of sex, drugs and rock-n-roll.  We meet the real-life men and witness the incidents that inspired the lyrics to ""Magic Man"" and ""Barracuda.""  The surrealism of the performers' rising position shows up in their inevitable interactions with other celebrities:  the members of Led Zeppelin themselves, Elton John and Bernie Taupin, the Van Halen brothers, Mick Jagger.  Then there are all sorts of other ""Devil's bargains"" that arise, even beyond the easy availability of drugs and alcohol.  The women learn firsthand about ethics and legalities of binding contracts in the recording industry.  They are almost constantly confronted by the blatant sexism of the chauvinistic business they happen to be in, having to endure insults about appearances even while fending off unwanted advances.  Even so, through the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, we can see their personal and professional lives change course with the inevitable progress of maturity.It's always a gift to be able to see behind the curtain:  to find out what went on in our favorite performers' lives while we were living out our own dramas, out in the audience.  Now in their 60s (!), Ann and Nancy Wilson share their memories with a clear retrospective view.  Not only are these women still performing, but they are still kicking and dreaming and above all, still keeping the love alive.  It's easy to turn these pages to the strains of ""Dog and Butterfly,"" ""These Dreams,"" and other Heart songs ringing in your head, supplying a background to the narrative.""Kicking and Dreaming"" is highly recommended reading for rock music fans of any kind, whether or not they have ever followed Heart.  This book is sure to create new ""Heart Mongers"" as a result.  These talented sisters deserve them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10S4QFGMSSF9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062101676#wasThisHelpful","R10S4QFGMSSF9D","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a coup for the museum on Wyoming's Wind River Reservation!  An exhibit featuring items from Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show is scheduled to include historic regalia belonging to Black Heart, an Arapaho chief who actually accompanied Buffalo Bill on his European tour of 1889-1890.  The hand-decorated adornments had been out of native hands for more than a century.  But excitement soon turns to outrage when the cartons containing Black Heart's pieces turn up empty.  How could this theft happen?  Who was involved?  What are those two noticeable white men doing on the rez, driving around in a dark sedan?  And, as usual:  Can Father John O'Malley and Arapaho lawyer Vicky Holden figure out what's going on in time, so that the artifacts will not be lost to the native people forever?Margaret Coel keeps the story moving as we toggle between the action taking place today and those activities in the summer of 1890, when the Wild West Show was performing in Berlin.  One of the sticking points in the memories of the Arapaho descendents is how Black Heart's valuables were lost in that city, back then.  Thanks to the author's deft design, we are privy to both sides of the debate.  We can only hope that the two strands will merge and culminate in the successful return of the regalia to Riverton.  Though the instance here is indeed a fictional one, surely following this narrative will cause readers to reflect upon the challenge and the rights of Native Americans to recover their own relics.  There's nothing more satisfying than learning about history and culture through the quiet ease of the pages of a novel.Never far from the main plot here is the on-going relationship between Father John and Vicky.  Can they ever be more than friends?  And what will it mean now that Vicky's former boyfriend and law partner, Adam Lone Eagle, has returned to the area?  As usual, Coel has given us another fresh and interesting episode in this mystery series:  almost unbelievably, Number 16!  Avid readers should be pleased.  Newbies to the series could begin here without confusion, but will shortly insist upon devouring all of the other installments.  They won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U8WX64SEMAVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042525271X#wasThisHelpful","R1U8WX64SEMAVI","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kate Garrett works as a police detective in a city in southwestern Ontario.  She's in the midst of a drug-related homicide investigation when she gets the worst news possible:  her father Joe has been hit by a car and killed.  A retired police officer himself, Joe had since turned to running his own private investigation service.  Was it his most recent case that put him in harm's way?  Or was this merely a tragic accident?While Kate and Joe's business partner Jake Carmedy grieve separately for their loss, they both begin to puzzle out what Joe had been working on.  A tension from the past prevents them from working together, at first.  But as additional deaths take place, both find too many threads that lead to the offices of Touchstone Insurance.  With the backup of friends and professional colleagues in the local police department, Kate and Jake are able to collar the ultimate perpetrator in the end.  Whether they will be able to work well as a team from this point on, is anyone's guess.  The dynamic between the two could develop, change, and go in any number of different directions, as the pair takes on new cases.A special nuance to this story is that it takes place over the course of ten days in November 2018.  Kate and her fellow officers therefore use better computer technology than we have now (in 2012) to gather and process information.  Security measures in both private and public buildings have been stepped up a notch as well.  Otherwise, this book that is set in the future -- for now -- is not overly ""futuristic.""  After all:  any such mystery and police procedural boils down to uncovering the vagaries of human behavior.  That idea transcends time.""Deadly Legacy"" sets a good scene for further episodes in the series.  Kate Garrett is a likable character who deserves to have more adventures.  As mentioned above, her budding business relationship with Jake Carmedy is one that has potential.  The author chooses not to name their city in this book.  I believe it would help firm up the readers' imaginations if she did, and if we were told a bit more about the place.  What with the various investigations and the wakes and funerals of all of the deceased, several more minor characters show up here than are probably necessary.  Readers may have a tough time deciphering and remembering which ones are more important than others.Overall, this book is an intriguing first episode that should have readers wishing and hoping for a quick sequel.  We want to tag along with Kate and Jake on at least another outing.[This review was based on seeing a paperback copy, compliments of the author, in exchange for a fair assessment of the work.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVKG3JHWP4GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TYPHYO#wasThisHelpful","R3QVKG3JHWP4GQ","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In considering this book, let me first explain what it is NOT.  When a volume has the phrase ""Nature Writing"" in its title, it often turns out to be a mere anthology of such pieces by a variety of authors.  The editors may preface the pages with a brief history behind the writers and the selections, but that explanation has to be necessarily cut short.  (See examples in This Incomparable Lande: A Book of American Nature Writing, The Oxford Book of Nature Writing, and Norton Book of Nature Writing.)  These compilations are fine, if that happens to be what you're looking for.  Each one is unique, too.A Natural History of Nature Writing is not an anthology or a compilation.  It's a narrative that provides a natural history of the genre as it has progressed here in the United States.  Author Frank Stewart (Univ. of Hawaii) covers the impacts of Gilbert White's 18th-century walks through his native Selborne, England; and then turns to the best-known Americans in the field:  Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, and Edward Abbey.  Stewart analyzes their lives and writings in chronological order, including the overlaps in their lifetimes and the influences each had on one another.  A few additional folks surface as well, like Walt Whitman, Mary Austin (a southwestern author who was new to me), and Bill McKibben.  Some works are quoted for illustration, but no complete pieces appear here.Nearly one full chapter is devoted to the ""nature faker"" controversy that took place at the turn of the last century.  Pitting ""a popular nature writer named William J. Long"" against John Burroughs, this debate bounced around enough in the public media that President Teddy Roosevelt eventually got involved.  Stewart provides a good analysis of the dispute and concludes that both sides ""may have realized that the natural world is more complex than they had been willing to conceive.""  This story is key to any discussion about the scope and accuracy of nature writing today; and it is sometimes difficult to find the details of this controversy.  (Of the anthologies previously noted, only the introduction in This Incomparable Lande: A Book of American Nature Writing gives it a brief mention; and none of the three includes any works by Long.  A quiet lesson in omission, perhaps?)Henry David Thoreau permeates every chapter here.  Stewart is obviously a fan, and he claims (probably correctly) that Henry ""is the touchstone throughout.""  The concept of nature writing in America begins and ends with the man.  Stewart also shows no fear.  He opens the book by tackling the most intricate and most debated passage in Thoreau's WALDEN:  the parable of the hound, the bay horse, and the turtledove.  What a way to start!  If any faint-hearted readers are put off by this intense dissection of just one literary line, they should skip ahead to Chapter Two, where the chronological treatment begins with Gilbert White, and then leads into the others.Stewart concludes the book by getting personal:  by exploring the wilderness found in his Hawaii homeland, and by considering statements made by environmentalist Bill McKibben in The End of Nature.  Stewart is more optimistic than McKibben is, about the fate of nature and by extension, nature writing.  The text thus ends on a positive note.Although this book was first released in 1995, it's still a worthy read and reference for anyone who is interested in nature writing and in the major American authors we associate with it.  A real gift is the 12-page appendix of ""Bibliography and Further Readings,"" which we can use as a home library checklist or as a program for future finds and purchases.  This book is highly recommended for the nature/environment crowd.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXA09IYS52EQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1559632798#wasThisHelpful","RXA09IYS52EQO","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Douglas Wood has his own Walden-like retreat.  It's a cabin on an island in Rainy Lake, at the edge of the Minnesota-Ontario border, ""Deep in the heart of the North Woods.""  This remote site offers not only personal sanctuary, but also a variety of natural scenery to explore, both on land and by water.  It seems like a perfect, idyllic place.In this collection of short essays, Wood invites us to visit the area for a while.  We walk alongside him, and we help to paddle his canoe.  We listen as he shares interesting past encounters with the land or with its inhabitants.  Fairly soon we realize that the man's got a subtle sense of humor.  The sign on his outhouse even reads ""The Church of Peace.""  He also has an easy-going, casual style of storytelling.  His quick monologues cover such topics as fishing, boating, camping, splitting wood, and even feeding cat food to a wild fox.  He pokes fun at himself, thinking of tours he once conducted as a paid wilderness guide, when he would point out to unsuspecting tourists features like the ""Glacial Eroticas.""  These are fun stories to hear.He can also be uniquely spiritual on occasion.  Some of his experiences lead him to call upon the wisdom of the Native Americans or the Zen Buddhists.  And above all else, Douglas Wood is an optimistic man.  It's refreshing to meet one.Author Wood provides for us a delightful read on these pages.  He warns us in the preface that ""Rusticating on an island roost can sometimes lead to Serious Thoughts.  And sometimes not.""  We find both here in ""Fawn Island,"" the book.  It's an exploration of both place and self.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6PSLVAOR7OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0816631751#wasThisHelpful","R2B6PSLVAOR7OM","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel takes place in the fictitious Cape Cod town of Oyster Creek, Massachusetts.  For artistic and romantic types who visit or relocate from the mainland, this close but remote setting can be magical:  full of brilliant light that inspires heightened creativity.  And yet the Cape holds the traditions of its own residents as well:  of the sailors and fishermen who make their livings based on the vagaries of the bay and the sea.  Many of these natives can trace their roots back across the Atlantic to the country of Portugal, where even earlier seafarers once had the courage to set out on that long watery journey to the New World.Oyster Creek harbors a small population of both ""washashores"" and Portagee.  What happens when the two mix?  Well, we find out when washashore artist Sabine Gray entices Franco Neves, the assistant harbormaster, into having an extramarital affair.  Sabine becomes pregnant.  When little Vita is born, Sabine raises her daughter on her own, in their small cottage.  Naturally everyone in town knows that Franco is the father:  including Danielle, his wife.  Attempts at somehow reconciling the two families are clumsy at best.  And yet, Life goes on.When Vita is three years old, her mother is brutally murdered in their home by a local man.  Sabine's will dictates that her friend LaRee Farnham gets custody of Vita.  LaRee is a divorced nurse with no children of her own.  Suddenly she's thrown into the role of mother to a girl who is already a victim on two fronts.  LaRee raises her as best as she can think to, alternately sheltering Vita but allowing her as much freedom as seems appropriate.  Their relationship with Franco and Danielle is also a tenuous one.""The Harbormaster's Daughter"" checks in on these individuals over the course of more than a dozen years, until Vita is close to finishing high school.  It can thus be seen as a coming-of-age novel.  But the story offers quite more than that.  It's about realizing the complexities of life:  How to find your place in your own skin and in your own community, where everyone already knows too much about you.  How to live in the present, when all of the reminders of the past still loom large on the landscape and in the minds of others.  How to refuse to allow your tragedies to define you.  What it means to Belong.  And these are challenges that can face us all, no matter what age we might be.This book is a great summer / beach read that should appeal to both adult and young adult women.  It will be easy for readers to cheer on Vita and LaRee -- and in a way, to root for Franco and his wife Danielle too, and for all of the other quirky people in this far-flung place.  Those who are addicted to Cape Cod novels will not be disappointed in the role of the setting here.  And if this is your first encounter with the author, you might want to pick up the first book she placed in this town, The House on Oyster Creek: A Novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FUAMCQLVXWKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451237870#wasThisHelpful","R3FUAMCQLVXWKK","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knowing that this book was published by the Teachers & Writers Collaborative of New York City is helpful information to have.  Potential readers will then understand that this book is missing a key word from its title:  TEACHING.  Otherwise, individuals may think that, like other published books of ""nature writing,"" this will turn out to be a compilation of nature-related prose and poetry by famous-name authors.  Well, it IS a compilation volume.  But it's a guide to TEACHING nature writing.  And as such, it's a nice manual to add to any teacher's arsensal.Poet Gary Snyder begins here by addressing the concepts of language and writing.  Then twenty-eight writers/instructors offer their experiences and advice in inspiring people to write about nature.  The exercises are intended for a variety of audiences, from kindergarten age to adults; and many can be tailored for just about any type of group.  Some of the assignments focus on penning short essays, while others involve journaling with both text and drawings.  Many of the lessons aim at the creation of poetry.  Most of the contributors include work samples from some of their past students.  An added perk is the recurring theme of how to encourage people to write about nature while living in an urban environment.  Each teacher provides information about resources that were consulted and found to be useful.  But truly invaluable is the comprehensive bibliography that appears at the end of the book.""The Alphabet of the Trees"" contains a lot of ideas for anyone who is considering teaching nature writing, especially for the first time.  Who knew that there were more approaches to the task than just asking folks to go outside, look around, and then put pen to paper?  Tangentially, this volume could also be used by adult and young adult writers who find themselves in need of some inspirational prompts to jump-start their minds and set their fingers to flying on the keyboards.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R249K1N7ZE358Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0915924633#wasThisHelpful","R249K1N7ZE358Z","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first, it may have seemed like just a crazy dream:  to somehow create a brand-new professional sports league from scratch, from absolutely nothing.  But that's exactly what fitness expert Jake ""Body by Jake"" Steinfeld, lacrosse player Dave Morrow, and television exec Tim Robertson did.  Their work toward a common goal -- establishing Major League Lacrosse -- is outlined here.  The casual narration is supplied by Jake, with occasional interjections by Dave.  Their voices are set in two different fonts, so that readers can tell them apart on the page.For those who aren't familiar with the game, lacrosse can be described as a blend of the key elements of hockey, soccer, basketball, and football.  It's the oldest American sport.  Native Americans were seen playing it when European missionaries first arrived in North America in the seventeenth century.  Four hundred years later, lacrosse was mostly relegated to being merely a high school or college sport:  one that had a small but devoted following, mostly in the northeastern part of the country.Through a series of interesting events and circumstances, Jake and Dave and Tim met one another and began pursuing the professionalization of outdoor lacrosse.  Even with Jake's EXTENSIVE Hollywood and Wall Street connections, these guys had myriad challenges to face:  whether it was finding investors, sponsors, or even enough light bulbs to broadcast a game on TV.  Jake's sharing of the fine details has necessarily been condensed and watered down to fit into this one slim and very readable volume.  To his credit, he doesn't drag any famous names through the dirt, even when some deals don't work out.  But since Jake is an extrovert in the extreme, and Dave is a talented athlete but an introvert at heart, you just have to feel a bit sorry for Dave whenever Jake pushes him at every turn.  It's all for the best, though.  Everything works out in the end.The book covers the background of the MLL organization from 1998 to 2001, as well as the first full playing season (2001) and the challenge of putting forth a second (2002).  MLL is now in its twelfth year and can be considered an athletic success.  A section of color photos is included.This tale is also a subtle lesson in motivation.  Jake has been reined in a bit, on this count.  But he occasionally launches into vibrant pep talks for the readers.  ""[L]ife is all about facing obstacles and finding a way under, over, around, or straight through them."" (p. xvi)  ""When you're passionate about something, great things happen -- maybe not overnight, but they do happen.  And they happen in a bigger, better way than you could have imagined.""  (p. 66)  The MLL is proof of that statement.Fans of lacrosse will no doubt be eager to pick up this book.  But most sports fans of any ilk will probably find the book a good read.  It's fascinating to think of all of the work that has to happen for a professional sport to exist.  If this tale motivates you to follow your own passion, well then, that's probably also worth the price of admission.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O4W1AT3IRBNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401940277#wasThisHelpful","R3O4W1AT3IRBNA","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever driven along an interstate highway and wondered about the farms and the fields that were once cut up to accommodate our need for traveling convenience?  Have you thought of the people who might still live there?  Or:  Have glimpses of a handsome house, a bucolic barn, or a serviceable silo sped past your gaze at 55, 65, or 75 miles per hour?  If you answered with quick yeses; or if those thoughts have never crossed your mind at all, you would do well to read Mike Perry's newest book.  It provides more than a few of those off-the-shoulder stories.Mike lives down the road from octogenarian Tom Hartwig, in an area near Eau Claire, Wisconsin.  Back in 1967, the construction of I-94 intruded on and dissected the farm that Tom had already lived on, all of his life.  At least 23,200 cars speed behind his silo each and every day.  The continual whine of engines and tires touching asphalt now provides a constant backdrop for any conversation held in the Hartwig kitchen.  But that's where the real action lies for this memoir:  for that's where Tom is likely to tell the tales of his past, to any eager audience that happens to be seated around the old dinner table.  We are lucky that Mike has written some of them down and has shared them with us here.Lest you think this might be a Tuesdays with Morrie kind of offering, the author is quick to claim:  ""He is not my mentor, I am not his acolyte.""  Funny:  the rest of the book only serves to disprove that statement.  Tom is not only a long-time farmer, but he's also a masterful Mister Fix-it when it comes to any type of metalcraft or machinery.  He's exactly the man you want to know and learn from if you are a young farmer yourself -- which author Perry insists that he is not, despite the fact that he lives on nearby acreage.  Mike calls upon Tom for routine advice, for the ""accumulated wisdom of the elders"" ... and often gets more than he asks for.  In a good way, of course.Through this dual biography, we learn more about both Tom and Mike.  Often, it means old versus young, and old times versus contemporary ones.  The past, present, and future intersect here, and are augmented by a strong sense of place.  Like the rest of humankind, both Tom and Mike have dimensions to them that can be surprising or conflicting.  Tom see-saws on politics, for example.  Mike shows that he is a sensitive man who is moved to deep emotion (even to tears) at chance moments spent with his wife and two daughters.  He can even get misty at the thought of the many boots that have worn down a floor board in an old farmhouse.  And yet, he can take down a buck with a single arrow shot, and can gut and dress his victim in less time than it takes to finish the chapter that describes the hunt.  Go figure.  And while Tom has the legacy of the interstate to live with, Mike is fighting the battle of Starkey Road.  Common threads run amok.Mike Perry has a vivid writing style.  He makes unique observations and uses interesting turns of phrase.  For example:  On a road tunneled by fully-branched trees, ""In autumn, at peak color, it is like motoring directly into the September page of a bank calendar.""  The narrative itself is framed by italicized passages.  Without supplied explanation, the reader gradually discerns that these particular interviews were conducted as photographers were posing Tom on his property, for the purposes of illustrating this book.  We get to see a few of those views as they introduce each chapter.This is the first Michael Perry book I've ever chanced to read, and I'm eager to go back and read the rest.  ""Visiting Tom"" is recommended for anyone interested in farming, in Middle America, in the rural way of life, or in gleaning the ""wisdom of the elders.""

"Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) may be the most quoted and least read American author.  Every year, ""new"" volumes of Thoreau sayings are compiled and released.  Some take the form of coffee table books, fleshed out with illustrations of natural scenes that coordinate with the classic word pictures.  Others let the original texts merely speak for themselves.  Many of the latter follow a specific theme.Nowadays the quintessential and most complete book in this genre is The Quotable Thoreau.  But this nifty paperback from 1991 is one of the better subject-oriented compilations.  I picked up a copy at a used bookstore because of an upcoming project where I needed to find just these types of Thoreau quotes:  examples of his writings that have to do with the concepts of preservation, wildness, and the environment.  I could have done the research and looked them up myself, but who has the time?  Especially when someone else has already done it?Tim Homan put together a nice variety of material here.  Some of it is commonplace and fairly familiar.  ""In Wildness is the preservation of the World.""  ""We need the tonic of wildness.""  Some, not so much, but still gem-like.  ""Nature doth thus kindly heal every wound.""  ""The globe is the richer for the variety of inhabitants.""  And so on.  Good stuff.  With source citations.  And if you don't know much about Mr. Thoreau, this book marks a decent place to start.  It's a testament to the volume's worthiness that new copies can still be purchased here.  Another one of my favorites among the quote books is H. D. Thoreau, a Writer's Journal, which assembles Thoreau's observations about writing and the writing process.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRV35P2ANHCBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561450359#wasThisHelpful","RRV35P2ANHCBR","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mike Link and Kate Crowley believe that endings can often mark beginnings.  So when Mike anticipated retiring from the Audubon Center of the North Woods in Sandstone MN (where he served as director from 1971-2009), both he and wife Kate began thinking about their next project.  With their love of nature in general and of Lake Superior more specifically, the idea grew to take some time to walk around its perimeter.  They already knew much about Superior.  They had visited various shoreline sites in the years beforehand, and had even been married on a boat on the lake in 1986.  After much planning and the gaining of contacts, sponsorships, and a terrific support assistant named Amanda, Mike and Kate began their official journey on April 29, 2010, in Duluth MN.  It took them nearly five months and 1,555 miles to make it back to that city, after their diligent counterclockwise circumambulation of this incredible inland sea.What kinds of pre-trip concerns did they need to consider?  Well, their own physical conditions, first of all.  Both were in their early 60s; and Mike had recently experienced a few medical setbacks.  But they kept track of their health and also benefited from the advice of a few doctors and hospitals along the way.  Weather could also be a factor, as could encounters with wild animals, domesticated dogs, or even with singled-minded property owners.  But it turns out that the biggest danger on this hike lay in slippery rocks, which could cause sudden falls and random injuries on any human body.  And Superior is edged by millions of such potential obstacles.If this pilgrimage had been undertaken merely for personal enrichment, it would still have made for a terrific tale.  But Mike and Kate enhanced its value by collecting data on the lake and its flora and fauna, at three-mile increments.  GPS coordinates and photographs helped to pinpoint locations.  They asked people they met to complete paper surveys about impressions and changes throughout the years.  The resulting details mark the first such comprehensive scrutiny of Superior, whose beaches run through two countries, three states, one province, and many individual public and private parks and reservations.  Some data is shared here; the rest is left to the project web site and to educational institutions in the region.  The additional intent was to bring awareness of lake issues into the public eye, and to reinforce the need to take care of this natural resource.Sure, Mike and Kate saw wonderful water views, beautiful birds, and even interesting lichens during the trek that led them from the appearance of spring wildflowers to the falling leaves of autumn.  But it was the people they met along the way who were the true gems of the journey.  Year-round residents, landowners, and long-time tourists.  Native Americans and First Nation peoples.  Superior means something to each one of them; and Mike and Kate were lucky enough to hear many of their stories.  The number of family members and friends (new and old) who joined the couple enroute to celebrate their last day of walking was a testimony, not only to the intrigue of the trip itself, but also to the strong pull of Superior.  At its core, this is a love story:  one that connects thousands of humans with a place that they honor and care deeply about.With its narrative told in tag-team style, ""Going Full Circle"" is a welcome read for anyone who has traveled throughout the Great Lakes region.  You're sure to find intersections of your own experiences with those of the authors.  And you're apt to learn of new places that you might just want to visit now, yourself.  Yes, there is a road-based Lake Superior Circle Tour that anyone can navigate via bicycle or by motorized vehicle.  But much more can be witnessed and learned by going on foot and by talking to the people encountered along the trail.  Thankfully, we can all make the trip this way vicariously through Mike and Kate.What's next for this well-traveled and water-based couple?  ""Full Length Mississippi:"" a tracing of the great river from its source to its outlet, by bike and boat.  Stay tuned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JT0UMOK1W78P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0942235231#wasThisHelpful","R1JT0UMOK1W78P","A1CZAK4VFV8OFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CZAK4VFV8OFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow. This is an amazing novel for a first-time author. It is epic. It is addicting. This is a book for all time, for any reader teen and up. I am a grandma and I was spellbound. I could not put this down and kept reading into the night, as addicted to the book as its hero Ryan Mitchell is addicted to time travel. He spends four centuries reliving the same year, trying to get his life back on track, trying desperately to find the right combination of events or the right moment to start over and to find the love of his life who got lost when he chose time-jumping due to its addictive qualities. This is a coming of age novel that gets stuck in the same year, and yet the hero has a revelation unlike any other. This is a philosophical novel, and is more about the cognitive dissonance people experience in realizing they have made horrific mistakes  that cost more than they wanted to pay. As Ryan jumps, and plays various roles such as crime-fighter, or even criminal, we learn more facets of his personality, and it all hangs together at the end with a surprising solution. I am amazed.

"This is interesting stuff! Plus, you get TEN yards. I am using this in a brooch bridal bouquet and found that it's pretty versatile. You can glue it to a surface, you can glue a strip of it to itself to make a double-faced strand and then use it as loops in a flower arrangement. That's how I am using it.  But you can tie it in a bow around mason jars or candles or for napkin rings or use it with wrapping paper. This is a reasonably-priced craft item that provides a little bling for little money.

"These faceted bead wires are a decent price considering that if you made them yourself, you'd be twisting wires and if you're a klutz like me, probably cutting your hands in the process.. These beads are exactly as they say..aurora borealis faceted beads. They are plastic. They will look fine in a bridal bouquet for added bling as they they are not meant to be the focal point of a bouquet. They are an accent and as such work just fine for their intended purpose. I gave this four stars because the beads were square and I didn't expect that. I suppose it doesn't really matter, but I hoped for round.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGZS8OLNV4YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054G5TME#wasThisHelpful","RHGZS8OLNV4YM","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am making a brooch bouquet for my friend's wedding and these are the perfect thing to add for a three-dimensional touch. They are exactly as described. While it is true that the rhinestones are flat-backed and shiny only one side, this is not a problem. The little wires can be twisted so only the shiny part shows in the arrangement.  The silver wire on these is sturdy yet flexible. Each  little  branch or spray has about five rhinestones on it. the bunch you see pictured on Amazon is of the entire package of the sprays, not just one. All in all, I am pleased with these.

"This story has enough twists and turns to satisfy anyone. It is a stand-alone book, but I think you would enjoy it more reading the first in the Gold Rush Romance series because many of the characters are first introduced there. However, this particular book is Lily's story--and is a tale of human trafficking told against the historical backdrop of the California Gold Rush. Lily is from China where an evil aunt sold her to a ship captain who abused her and sold her when the ship docked in San Francisco. But Sarah, an independent young woman who runs a restaurant and who also has a habit of taking in stray people who need help comes  to her rescue, winning Lily's freedom in a poker game. What happens after that is a jaw-dropping story you won't want to put down. I am new to reading Mona Ingram but I am certain I will be looking up her other works as well if these are a sample of what she writes. Ingram surely knows how to tell a story and how to surprise the reader. This is not some bland romance book.

"This is a compelling, courageous story beautifully written. Misty Griffin and her sister, Samantha, were victims of the most hideous abuse for all of their childhood. Then, as young women, they were turned over to a strict Amish community where they saw more abuse unchecked. Most people have the idea that the Amish are a simple people, with beautiful ideals. Yet this grim, inside view reveals a culture where incest, child abuse, and attempted murder are covered up by church rules. In this world, women have few rights, and men, sometimes evil men, make and enforce all of the rules. The author  left the Amish in order to reveal abuse and try to help some of the victims. She wrote this to show the world that the abuse is real, but also to bring hope. This book is hard to read because the abuse is described so clearly from the first person perspective. Misty Griffin poured her heart and soul into this and revealed her innermost thoughts growing up in a world of hurt. Yet this book is laced with hope and the idea that no matter who we are, we are people with rights and that nobody has the power to steal the essence of who we are. The only way to stop bullying of any kind is to stand up to it. The personal story of Misty Griffin reveals that in her own life, she managed to transcend the horrible childhood, to embrace it as part of herself, but to also move beyond it to achieve her dream of going to college and starting a foundation to help other abuse victims. While this book is an eye-opener, and not the usual view of the Amish culture you find in movies and novels, this is a true story. It is a lyrical and beautiful book. I am amazed. It is breathtaking. I used to belong to a church that had cult-like aspects and it was difficult to leave it. I totally respect this author for her accurate and intimate look at the cognitive dissonance that occurs when you leave a group like the Amish. This book deserves a lot of attention for its message and also for its incredible style. I hope to see more from this author. .","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G5T0YQGSXUAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RETC8B4#wasThisHelpful","R3G5T0YQGSXUAZ","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having just completed reading this book and also comparing Bible commentaries on 1 &2 Thessalonians, I can't help feeling that Beth Moore is not at her best with this study. It almost seems as if she is distracted. There are too many anecdotes about her, her family, her troubled kids, her failed adoption. The more I read about Beth Moore, the more I feel that her ministry, although it may do  much good and bring Christ to some, is a little bit too  much about her. The study has some scriptures that are misapplied. She uses some of the scripture to talk about doing good, which is fine in of itself, but the verses she chose weren't about that. This means that would-be consumers of her works need to be on guard against false teachings and to be discerning in their studies. Unfortunately, there are a lot of women who follow Beth Moore with almost  cult-like enthusiasm. It may seem petty to some that I am ""picking on"" a woman of God, but anyone who sets themselves up as a teacher, who makes millions of dollars off of the Word of God, must be held to a high standard. Anyone who makes claims that God speaks to them or  who claims to commission women to be a light in the world, (something that is God's place to do, and he has so commissioned all of Christians to be...it's not Moore's place to do it) must then be open to the criteria set forth in scripture, namely, if their words do not come true, they are false teachers. Additionally, if they add to or take away from scripture, then they are false teachers. Proceed with caution studying Beth Moore's works if you are a person who wants to live by the Word. Personally, I feel that the Bible is the book I want to study, but anyone who chooses Moore as a guide to the good book should be really careful to do it critically and to not accept her word as THE word.  There is much good in her writings, but they ramble a bit too much and rely on her own ideas too much for me to accept her as a true teacher of the Bible.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55ROBTHDDOG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1430028602#wasThisHelpful","R55ROBTHDDOG3","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why not five stars? The most demanding application for this is for expresso and we don't use it on that fine grind. We use it on the coarsest grind. For this use, the grinder is perfect, but we can't address whether it works well for those who need the finer grind for french presses or expresso makers. We use fairly dry beans in it and brush it regularly, have had no jam ups from using the oilier beans you might use for expresso. So, although I am giving this four stars, it's noit because of any kind of lack in the product as far as we are concerned. It is easy to use, and grinds the beans the way we want. What's not to like?

"Nemo's reef is a soothing, addictive game. It is a scam. It is KNOWN that the game will not load on Kindle Fire after level 30 or so. So, while it has a relaxing musical theme, it's really playing your wallet's death dirge unless you keep yourself from buying any pearls.  There are quests to complete. The graphics are lovely.  You build a coral reef with various plants, harvest sand dollars or algae, and buy more plants. Rare fish come along and you have to figure out to keep them. I am at level 31 and the game has started crashing or I get messages saying that the server is not available or that the game has stopped. I am playing on a Kindle Fire and I am finding out that others have the same issues at higher levels. Also, it should be noted that you must spend some money playing this game at some point because you need pearls to complete some of the quests. True, you can grow pearls from your rare fish, but this takes days and some quests have a time limit. I would give this game five stars if it didn't keep crashing. I admit it. I love the game, but the annoying stop messages are getting to me. My grandson has a version of this game on my Kindle in the section just for him called Kindle Freetime. Because the kid side of the Kindle has parental controls and the kids can't go online, this game is a little different than the public one which gets updates periodically. The version my grandson plays has the rare fish producing pearls left and right to the point where he has 8,000 of them. Of course, in the kid version, you don't need to spend them as much. He is at level 34 and his game never crashes and never gets the messages that the game has stopped. Even when I cannot get in, he can. So...hmmm....what's up with that? I wish that Amazon would hold Disney accountable to make a product that works on Kindle. Or, they should not sell it. Yet, like hapless fish, I am already hooked.<<  Now I am at level 32 and the game will not load. I contacted Disney and got this email:"" Hi there,We have found that Kindles have troubles loading reefs once they pass about level 30. Kindles are primarily reading devices, and can have troubles loading some games, especially when the profiles get larger.The best way to fix this is to try force quitting any other apps you have running in the background. This may give Nemo's Reef enough resources to load your reef, but I can't guarantee anything. Connecting to a strong wireless network will help, too.If you're unable to load Nemo's Reef at all you may have to start over. If you've purchased any Pearls we'd be happy to readd them to your new account. Simply take a screenshot of each purchase receipt and reply with all of them and your new reef name.I hope you're able to swim around your reef again soon!>>I have no other aps running in the background. I have a wonderfully strong wireless network. And I'm not about to ""start over playing the game.""  Also, how on God's green earth do you take a screen shot of purchaces on a Kindle???Folks, this is a scam game that will rip you off. Don't start playing it. And, if you have, don't buy pearls. ALso, email Amazon and Disney and let's hold them accountable for this ap they offer that is KNOWN to NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRE.>>>UPDATE:Glitches in the game seem to be fixed---but they did it by taking away new stuff, weekend quests, and it makes you seriously plod through collecting endlessly in order to advance. No expansions. No new fish. New plants few and far between.....but I'm addicted and do like this game so I play it anyway. I heard they plan to create a Dory's reef once the movie comes out. But to tell you the truth, I love this Nemo's reef and hate to feel that it's a forgotten product with Disney. At least I don't crash out of the game all of the time and I seem to be able to sign on..","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LLX9P8JB3WWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWBHIUG#wasThisHelpful","R1LLX9P8JB3WWF","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the green quart jars with the wide mouth. I have the plastic lids so I use these to store things in the kitchen such as jelly beans, goldfish crackers, and trail mix. They look good on the shelf or the counter. I only wish they had come in blue. The blue pints are fabulous in color and I would dearly love them in a larger size. So happy they made both green pints and green quarts. These are perfect for canning, of course, but so fun for other things. I found that Ball makes a fruit-infuser lid in green that fits these jars perfectly so they would make a great summer drink jar. I also found a plastic straw and lid combo made by Ball that fits the regular-mouth size jars. These are good for a no-spill drink. So glad that Mason jars are trendy enough that accessories and colors are available! Fun times. Not sure why some folks said their jars smelled like chemicals. The ones bought in blue and the green were all smell-free. I should think that running them through the dishwasher would eliminate any problems, The color in the glass is not painted on. The color is due to adding certain minerals to the liquid glass before it is molded or pressed.

"This is a sort of Cinderella story, Amish style.  It even has a fancy blue dress. No pumpkins, however. I found the characters  a little simplistic and undeveloped and the story itself a little unbelievable, even for isolated Amish. But hey, this is a fairy tale adaptation, right? So I was willing to let some things slide. This is short, so to be fair, there probably wasn't much space to do more with the story. I suppose my main beef is that in Amish fiction, I want reality. I found it a little far-fetched that someone would be able to hide in a barn loft for years without Amish neighbors noticing something. Well, that IS how the story progresses...a neighbor DOES find out that our heroine has been treated like a slave for years. Prince charming is a handsome Amishman who rescues the damsel in distress. Justice is done when her step-family realizes she has been nothing but good to them and they feel shame. There's even a happy ending. Roll the credits. Cue the white doves. Whatever. I don't know if I wanted more or if I was relieved when the story ended. Something is missing. But what's there was good enough to give it four stars. I will have to read more from this author to see if this is a typical story for her or if the limitations were from the boundaries of doing a Cinderella story--which, by the way, is rather overdone in any genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J9TECY5PKAEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G83M4IY#wasThisHelpful","R3J9TECY5PKAEU","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly funny book. The author is one of those people who probably had to coordinate crutches and slings into his back-to-school wardrobe. I decided to read this book mainly because I am one of those people who broke her toe answering the telephone and who once got her hair caught in a mail slot. I survived to adulthood, too. I'm a Grandma now. So it was with some degree of fellow-feeling that I truly enjoyed this book. Matthew Weinrich not only is able to laugh at his many mishaps, he is able to cheerfully show us that despite nearly biting off his tongue and despite messing up his marriage proposal, there is a lot to be learned--and tons of reasons for constant hope.  I wanted to love this book. However, it is too short. It took less than an hour to read. On the other hand, if its target audience is middle school and high schoolers who were bullied or who felt social anxiety and needed some cheering up and cheering on, then it's the perfect length. I can't tell the target audience for this book. Is it young people or adults? Or both?  I found it jarring to read incidents that were not in chronological order. We jumped around the author's life from school days to adulthood, rather willy nilly, I felt. Thus, this book is best read as a devotional for the clumsy. It is best read one chapter at a time, and not in one sitting, methinks.  Matthew Weinrich does know how to tell a good story. He knows how to find the kernel of truth in all of these clumsy moments and shows us what he learned. The underlying message is that human beings can make it, even if events are so out of control we really should carry a parachute and a life raft with us at all times.  The author seems to be a kindred spirit not just to the clumsy, but to all those of us who need inspiration on a dark day, a reminder that the human spirit can transcend emergency room trips, bungled proposals, and broken bones. I recommend this book for that reason.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CID7VB86JX21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID0TC80#wasThisHelpful","R1CID7VB86JX21","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This shade is awesome. It is beautiful. It insulates the window against cold or heat. It is cordless. It works smoothly. However, it didn't fit my 27-inch window. It was about a quarter inch too big to install via inside mount on my window. I am so disappointed because this was a good price for a high-quality window shade. It was not wide enough for an outside mount or I would have kept it and installed it. The installation instructions are pretty simple and  includes illustrations for clarity. All in all, if you have a window that is sightly larger than 27 inches, this shade is the one you should get. From what I understand, if you're getting these shades for a 27-inch window, it is too large, and the shades should be 3/8 to 1/2-inch smaller. I should have realized that if the shade is 27-inches, then it would be too large for a 27-inch window. Hindsight. I just learned this now.  However, this is not the fault of the manufacturer nor does it reflect on the quality of the shade.

My husband, who is a musician in several historical string bands, was amazed that his band's  songs played so well on this speaker. ""There is NO distortion,"" he exclaimed. If there was, it was so slight we couldn't tell.  Indeed, the packaging proclaims the distortion to be less than 1.0 percent. I think this is telling the truth.  This device has a lithium battery that takes two hours to charge, and will play for about ten hours before needing recharging. The packaging says it has a playback time of up to 12 hours. My daughter said it was ten hours for her, so this falls into the acceptable range for the product's claims. It comes with a protective cloth bag to keep it in when not in use, and protect it when you take it along. I am a relic of the days when ""boom box"" meant a huge, clunky box-shaped thing you had to have muscles to carry around. This little thing,  with dimensions of 2.3 by 1.8 inches, is so small it looks like a cat toy.I love that it comes in colors. Adults might not want neon green, but that's the color my daughter chose. It's bright. It is easily seen. But good looks aren't all that critical. She likes it because she is a cheerleader coach and she can put the team's music on her phone and use this speaker for practices. Yes, the team could hear it just fine in the gym. This was pretty surprising. We didn't expect it to be that good! For my daughter, it means not lugging around a lot of equipment. She is delighted as can be. Also, the price is pretty good for a young person to afford to give it as a gift to a friend. This would make a wonderful stocking-stuffer or small gift for people on your list who have MP3 devices or i-phones. Even this grandma might get one--I'm not that old-fashioned, after all.  Disclaimer: I was given one of these devices in exchange for an honest review. If I did not like this device, I would have given it a low rating. I'm like that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M92W5MC7IPQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082E9K7U#wasThisHelpful","R1M92W5MC7IPQN","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This towel bar is getting lots of compliments from guests at my house. We just remodeled a bathroom and I used brushed nickel finish faucet, towel bar, paper holder and shower head. The finish is lovely and resembles pewter and the ceramic adornments give this modern towel bar a Victorian look. It holds the towels just fine and is very sturdy. The  Victorian faucet I chose had ceramic handles for the hot and cold, which is why I chose this towel bar. It matches perfectly. I am delighted with the looks and function of this towel bar and would highly recommend it for its beauty and ease of installation.  It's a classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V51H4NDMXHCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TA9PGK#wasThisHelpful","R1V51H4NDMXHCH","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this cup for my husband who wanted a travel mug to take to work. This one is leak proof. The lid comes apart so it can be cleaned easily. He says it keeps coffee hotter than his thermos does, for longer! It holds two full cups of coffee.  The handle grip is comfortable without getting in the way of car cup holders. The bottom width of this cup is just under 2.5 inches,  about  2 and 3/8 inches. It should fit in standard car cup holders.  We looked at other travel mugs that were more expensive and touted as the best, only to learn that the lids needed periodic replacement because they could not be cleaned properly. This one has a lid that comes off and can be taken apart so all parts of it can be cleaned. It is also dishwasher safe. My husband is delighted with this mug and only wishes I had gotten him one much sooner. The Thermos people knew what they were doing when they made this one! P.S. My husband told me that yesterday, much to his chagrin, he accidentally put this cup in his bag upside down. He was so happy that it did not leak--not even a drip--that he asked me to add it to this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LDZ3OVINEINL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PY7AYI#wasThisHelpful","R3LDZ3OVINEINL","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sweater is a trendy, pullover that looks so much better on than it does in the picture. My daughter wanted it and I got it for her as a gift thinking, ""Well okay if she wants it, but it looks kind of ...large."" It's not shapeless when worn, and the black and white looks good with jeans or a black pair of pants. Billed as a loose pullover, she expected it to be an oversize, loose fit. That is what she wanted, but it fits much tighter than she wanted. Otherwise, it is an okay sweater, with the hem in front shorter than the one in back. This is not designer clothing, and it's not an expensive sweater, and she's keeping it, but we think the description could have included some dimensions in the size offered so there would not be this confusion about ""loose"" fit. We don't know how it washes because she hasn't washed it yet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNWND08U4TF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F13N9L8#wasThisHelpful","R1LNWND08U4TF3","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This puzzle is shiny and fun! My two-year old grandson loves it. It has latches and locks with brass chains, hooks, and even a window latch. He sat down right away and tried all the little doors and latches and was able to do them.  The pictures are bright, and the little doors have numbers and inside, animals in the corresponding number amount. We joke that this will teach the little kids to be burglars because the latches and such are real ones! But it does provide hours of fun for little people who need to keep their fingers busy. Our grandson did get a little bored with it after he solved it and what we did was put it away for awhile. He was thrilled to see it again and enjoy it like it was new. We do this with all of his puzzles and it extends their play life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VM5R9K3B4R7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVBE1A#wasThisHelpful","R1VM5R9K3B4R7L","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This magical book will thrill the millions of people worldwide in 176 countries who tuned into the Cornell University's Heron Cam in 2012. With a  web camera perched high on a dead tree on Sapsucker Pond, viewers were treated to the heron's eye view of courtship, mating, egg laying, hatching, and raising chicks. The author was one of the people who tuned into the camera and chat room online at Cornell's website--and I for one, am glad she did. What resulted from her hours spent online watching this heron drama unfold is a beautifully told tale that teaches children about the life cycle and habitat of herons. But it is more than that. For the people like me who also watched those herons, this book is a handcrafted, loving souvenir of that magical season when we were glued to the screen, watching the five eggs to see if all would hatch. We watched as the Dad heron sat on the eggs during a freak April blizzard.  Our hearts nearly stopped when we saw a great horned owl get chased off by the mom heron. All of us cheered and cried when the last heron, Fiver, finally fledged. All of this is captured, too. The beautiful water colors that accompany this tale are right from the screen shots that those who tuned in saw. This book could have been done with those photographs but it would not have been half so lovely. The watercolors lend a personal viewpoint to the book, and they are lovingly done with spectacular results. I am impressed by them and by the information in the book. This is a book that adults will not be bored reading to their kids and grandkids. I plan to order an extra copy for me. Even if you were not part of the chat group that got hooked on watching the herons, you can share that experience of wonder through this book.My two-year-old grandson is a bit young for this book but even he enjoyed the pictures and hugged it to himself, saying ""Heron birds!!!"" (he is a grandson of two birders, haha)  The goal of the author is to encourage young people to get out in nature and explore for themselves. With a book like this as a jumping off place, how could they fail to want to see birds in real life?  I was there in that chat room, and along with many who bonded over the birds, am part of a group on facebook. None of us remembers  the author there, but while we were chatting away, she must have been frantically sketching at home, with little time to join our chatting. The spirit that imbues this book will bring you joy, knowledge, and a little bit of the experience we all shared watching Fiver grow up.  Thank you, Thank you, Anita Schmidt-Kyanka for this gorgeous labor of love.  Some parents may hesitate to buy this book because it may seem a steep price for a paperback. But the original artwork and the jam-packed pages of information are truly worth the cost. This is well written and well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPG7BGPFX927/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480802506#wasThisHelpful","R1WPG7BGPFX927","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love these pink sterling silver CZ earrings. They actually perfectly match a pink  CZ necklace I bought in 2005. I had matching earrings then but lost them.

He and his wife wrote me to say that the fruit was really delicious and they truly enjoyed it. They said it was packed nicely.

I ordered one of these for myself! My friends were correct on all counts. The fruit is wonderful! The packaging is perfect.

"This faucet caught my eye with its good looks. I really like the shape of the faucet and the fact that it has porcelain handles. I just had a bathroom remodeled. The contractor likes this faucet, too. He says it was easy to install and easy to adjust. What I love about it is that the faucet is up and over the sink. There is ample room to wash your hands without bumping into the sink. When I can, I will post a picture of it. You'll see why I think it's beautiful. But more than that, it's practical. The Brushed finish is easy to clean and doesn't gather fingerprints. The handles feel good and work great. The drain works easily and simply. The instructions that came with it were clear. However, the plumber didn't need them. He said this faucet was simple to install. He liked it because it is sturdy. It's a heavy faucet. I like it because it is beautiful.

"It's a Catch-22 situation. I am giving these things five stars because we needed replacements and lo, there they are, for sale. They fit the cups we bought them for--and they suit their purpose perfectly. However, we have to lodge our complaint that these cups should need replacements in the first place. These valves collect dirt, and sometimes black mold if you don't wash them separately from the cup, and even if you put them in the dishwasher on sterilization mode. I have used little bottle brushes, pipe cleaners, and sprayed them with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide in order to clean them. I finally tossed them and bought these new ones. I called the company to tell them that their valves get moldy over time and they sent me two new ones for free. I guess the message is---replace when necessary. It's cheaper than buying new cups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4B403VWMX0QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RFAAEO#wasThisHelpful","R4B403VWMX0QD","AH2INZ9J1V775","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2INZ9J1V775?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love this clock. it is heavy, and won't get knocked off a table or mantle easily. It tells time accurately. The one thing I dislike about it is that the alarm hand is so large, it is easily mistaken for the second hand. We got the clock because we needed one in the living room, so we aren't going to be using the alarm. If I could, I would rip that stupid arm right off. However, restraining my self from clock disfiguration, I decided to live with this flaw instead of returning the clock. This clock has a traditional look to it, which is why I picked it. It looks good on our mantel, and it is easily read from across the room. Another plus is that this is battery operated, and you can tell time during a power outage, assuming you have a flashlight.

It should be more clearly labeled that it is mainly for folks in the UK. Second, there is hardly any information in it. It is just 64 pages.

"This was a Kindle freebie for me and I skimmed through it, then immediately deleted it. Although it could be a good primer for someone trying to figure out if they want to try food drying or canning, it really is not useful to an experienced canner or to a person who has already experimented with food drying. Without recipes, this is just advice. It is not a how-to. It's half a how-to without the recipes. I rated it OK because I do believe that any publication that promotes home food preservation in a sensible and safe way deserves at least that. I have been canning for nearly 30 years and this book is not as useful to me as a book that contains new ideas and recipes. If you are a novice canner and interested in food drying as well, you should get yourself the Ball Blue Book and start from there.

"It's hard to beat a Peterson's guide. I particularly  appreciate this one because there are not a lot of publications about moths out there. This one comes complete with wonderful photographs, and all the information you need to identify moths. It's confusing at times, because so many moths look alike, but with this guide, I was able to sort out several species I was unable to without it. Like the bird books, this guide has information about range, but also includes information about host plants, or what kind of environment in which the particular moth could be found. Mothing is not the most popular hobby, but serious moth-ers put out lights and sheets and then photograph their moths to create their ""collection"" rather than kill the creatures they want to identify. This information is also covered in the guide, which was, frankly, a revelation to me. I love this guide because it opens up a whole world of moths I never really thought about until a facebook friend began posting beautiful moth pictures. I'm hooked now.

"I bought this mower new from WalMart. It was a bit over $300 and has the American made engine.I have used this mower this Summer with no problems.It has the easy-starting motor. It almost always starts on first pull, very rarely have I had to pull it over twice.The drive speed is adjustable, sort of. There is not much you can do by way of adjusting the speed. This is fine as it works well and I regulate speed by how hard I squeeze the speed control lever.An added bonus with this model is the attachment on top of the deck where you can hook up a garden hose and wash the deck. Simply attach the hose, turn on the water and start the engine.I haven't used the bagger or discharge chute as I use the mower to mulch when I mow. It does a good job.This mower has enough power and hasn't bogged down in moderately tall grass.Assembly was very simple. This mower weighs less than a Craftsman self-propelled that I used.The only caveat and it is minor.....why is it that Briggs & Stratton doesn't provide the oil capacity in the owner's manual? They have the graph for oil recommendation by temperature and how to change the oil but there is no mention of the oil capacity for the engine. Seems like an important omission or oversight to me.I did find the oil capacity (18 oz) online at a Briggs & Stratton website after some searching.Overall I am very happy with this mower and would not hesitate to buy another one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLTKEDEASTV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CNZEQ2S#wasThisHelpful","RBLTKEDEASTV7","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this job-site radio hoping it would be small enough to fit in my locker at work. The older Milwaukee job-site radio(Rockford-Fosgate powered) that I have is bigger and heavier.Well this radio doesn't fit in my locker without marring it up. So much for that idea!What I have found while using this radio at work has been positive in many respects.First the size. This radio is compact compared to my older one(Milwaukee 49-24-0200). It's also surprisingly light in weight.  So toting it in and out of work is easier.The sound quality. This radio is rated roughly 5 watts lower than the other Milwaukee that I own.That's not a negative as the sound clarity with this radio is better in my opinion.I use job-site radios with an mp3 player as an auxiliary device. This radio works well for that. And it is loud enough to hear on the factory floor that I work on.A bonus is the compartment on top of the radio for storing and plugging in an auxiliary device. It's convenient and it is sealed. Nice touch!There is already an auxiliary line to plug in the mp3 player and a phone or mp3 charger plugin.EQ and display..The EQ is pretty basic. You can adjust the level for Treble and Bass. Nothing fancy but it works.The display is powered by two AA batteries and it is a bright red that is easy to see. The batteries also power the memory for preset stations.I can't address the battery power for this radio as I only use it by plugging it in to an outlet. I don't need batteries or a charger.It seems durable and there are plenty of handles on the top, bottom, and sides.I paid $10 more for this new radio at a local store than I did for the older, used Rockford-Fosgate model. From looking around at prices these radios seem to be cheaper, particularly if you don't need a battery charger or extra on-board outlets.This Milwaukee radio has met my expectations for performance and I would buy one again if this radio got stolen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WG0JZ5CQ29PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WTCDE8#wasThisHelpful","R2WG0JZ5CQ29PH","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice screen protector! It comes with the prep kit and clear instructions.Installing the Tech Armor screen protector was very easy. The only part that was a bit tricky was lining up the protector with the screen.The box contained alocohol wipes for cleaning the screen (after removing the old protector).Then there is a microfiber cloth and dust removal tabs.You peel off the coating and that side goes down. If you have the protector lined up it almost adheres itself! There is a bubble removal tool included if you need it.I am impressed with the ease of installation and the fact that this screen protector has no bubbles under it.Another thing I like is the clarity.

"This windshield replaces an older National Cycle model that was 3 inches shorter. The additional 3 inches in height are an improvement.I installed the Street Shield EX on a 2012 VStar 950.It does fit but.... The instructions are next to worthless! Hence the 1 star deduction on an otherwise excellent product.This shield differs from the Deflector screen in that besides being taller, the Street Shield EX has 4 mounting points instead of 2.The handlebar mounts are the same. What is different is that hose clamps are used to mount the bottom of the screen to the top of the forks. Makes for a stable windshield.This screen is also easy to detach quickly.I normally avoid any tinted screens or shields. Surprisingly, I like the tinting a lot! It does not effect visibility much at all.Installation would have been much easier and less time-consuming with better instructions.I found that I needed to tweak or adjust the windshield a few times to get it where it should be. That is an easy task with an open-end wrench and the Allen wrench that was provided.Overall I would buy it again. Just beware that if you don't have experience installing these types of screens the instructions will be of little help.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUFKQ1B5ZZCJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZG6TR8#wasThisHelpful","RUFKQ1B5ZZCJR","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this jacket directly from LeatherUp's website.I wasn't sure about the arms fitting, they are angled. They do fit well even for my long arms. The arms have zippers on the end as well as a velcro cuff.After reading a number of suggestions on ordering one size larger I did just that that. Rather than order a Large as I normally do, I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly! Another tip on sizing...do a Google search for ""XElement jacket sizing"" and you should find a helpful link to a usbikerrescue site that has a size chart by chest size.I really can't find a personal complaint with this jacket.There is a lot to like and these are just a few:Zippered vents on arms, back, and chest for air flow on hot days.All pockets have either zippers or snaps, that's inside and the two outside pockets. There is also a handy cell-phone pocket on the inside. No shortage of pockets for storage!Zip-out liner.It has velcro loop adjustments for fit on each lower side.This jacket looks like it will be durable and it looks well-made.What this jacket isn't is a cold-weather motorcycle jacket. If it's Spring and the 50s you will feel the chill. It's made for warm to hot weather.The zippers are not the YKK heavy duty metal zippers. They work well enough but I thought I would mention that because XElement does use that brand of zipper on a lot of their motorcycle jackets.This is also a textile material as opposed to mesh. I prefer this to the mesh jacket I wore previously.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15N0K87WLSN5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003U684AO#wasThisHelpful","R15N0K87WLSN5X","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been taking this product for 4 months and I have noticed it has been beneficial for me.There have been no side-effects and I only take one of the 500 mgs capsules daily.The key to GABA from what I have read, is taking it with B6 so that it crosses the blood-brain barrier. The accuracy of that I don't know as I have always bought GABA products that include B6.Does it work? Everyone is different, but for me personally, I have felt more calm even on very stressful days. Another positive effect I notice is that I have pumped up some from my Bowflex workouts. That's something I didn't notice before taking GABA.What I appreciate the most is that GABA is natural.

A lot better than any other trimmer that I have owned.I like that the small trimmer is separate rather than being another attachment. It seems that the Norelco attachment used more energy so having a separate trimmer makes sense to me.Another thing I like about these Wahl trimmers is the ergonomics- not heavy, the switch is on the side and it just feels comfortable in my hand when I trim my mustache.

"I bought the silver GoGear Ariaz as an upgrade in MP3 players. I use this player mostly at work. It is plugged into a Milwaukee jobsite radio via the auxiliary jack. What triggered me changing was the short battery life and long charge time of my used Sony Walkman.I like this player better than any other mp3 player that I have used.Some of the features that impress me are:* The battery. I use the Ariaz up to 32 hours playtime and still have juice left. It charges a lot faster than I expected. A matter of a few hours at most when it drops to 1/4 charge.* Sound Quality. I prefer the sound clarity of the GoGear to others I've used. There are a lot of EQ settings to use and there is a custom EQ I can tweak. Full Sound is a nice sound also.* Ease of Use. This player is easy to use with a little practice. It did take me a while to find my playlists. Once you figure out how to get to the Folders it's a breeze to use those. The buttons are laid out nice and convenient.* Computer Compatibility. I use Windows 7 to load music or edit files. I have loaded songs, deleted songs, edited info on music files, and created playlists by hooking this player up though a USB port. Very simple. Drag and Drop comes in handy. The Walkman may be easier for creating playlists, deleting songs etc.. as it can do that on the player. I still prefer the Ariaz because of it's versatility when using Windows Media Player.* The Screen. Another nice feature is the screen. Aside from it's size, the Ariaz screen also shows the information about the song that I like to have displayed- Artist(or contributing artists), album cover, album name, and genre.I have found that mp3 players are not an end-all for every song or genre. Most songs sound great through the Milwaukee radio without the punch or bass EQ activated while others sound better with punch activated. I think this player sounds better for the choices in music that I listen to at work. Everything from classic country(Haggard,Cash) to blues(Bonamassa,Clapton) and hard rock.I don't normally change the EQ from custom and it seems to sound good.I really enjoy this player and if I ever lost it I would definitely buy another of this model. The battery life and charge time alone have been a big improvement for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B9JWSMLRTAGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035JJJQE#wasThisHelpful","R2B9JWSMLRTAGD","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the New Jerusalem Bible after reading the reviews.One thing I was unsure of was buying a Bible that was ""gender inclusive.""To date, I haven't found that to be an issue for me. I rarely see it in the text.I have had the original Jerusalem Bible(1966) for quite a few years and I really like that version.In comparing the two, the new version is not as thick and the text looks to be the same size.This is a revised Jerusalem Bible and in comparing various passages of Scripture this Bible fares well.A few examples that I look at:+ I Samuel 6:19 renders the number of those struck as 70. Some Bibles have 50,000 or 50,070.+ Revelation 22:19 has ""tree of life"" where some have ""book of life.""+ Matthew 6:13 has ""and do not put us to the test"" rather than ""lead us not into temptation.""+ I Timothy 5:17 has ""double reward"" rather than ""double pay.""+ I John 5:7 doesn't include the ""Erasmus Addition.""- Another verse that has different renderings is Mark 10:25. Some use ""large rope"" where this version uses the common ""camel.""Those are some of my personal observations of verses that are commonly translated differently.In the Preface the editor states that when a choice had to made, ""fidelity to the text"" was preferred over ""literary quality.""For modern English versions of Scripture this one reads as well as any of the others that I have used.I personally prefer a good ""study"" Bible. This book fits that bill superbly!Like the original, this newer version is loaded with footnotes that are keyed to the chapter. That is especially helpful when there is a difference between source texts. I like to know the differences whether they are used or not.The paragraphs have captions which is also helpful. Particularly for navigating.There are Scriptural cross-references in the outer margins.There are lengthy, educational Introductions at the beginning of each section.""Yahweh"" is used in the Old Testament.I Like The New Jerusalem Bible a lot.

"I bought a used Sony Walkman to play at work through a stereo.I wanted something a little bigger in size than the Sansa Clip +.The pros on this MP3 player are:+ Easy to transfer music files from desktop to player. I use Windows Media Player.+ The eq options are versatile. You have enough choices to form the sound to a degree.+ There is plenty of room for storage. I have over 725 songs loaded currently and still have a lot of room!+ Sound quality is very good.+ There are capabilities for both bookmarking and playlists. And using that feature is incredibly simple!+ Shuffle works well.The only real negative for me has been battery life and charging.Playtime is nowhere near the advertised length. I get 20 hours on a full charge. Getting a full charge takes much more time than expected. Plugging into the wall takes over 12 hours(closer to 18) when the battery is below 50%.I suspect a weak, old battery. Like most mp3 players that are portable, this Walkman has an internal battery which is not removable.That's the only gripe I have and that may be an inherited problem from buying a used device.For sound quality and features I like this player.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KYPHXG303WA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECRRWTE#wasThisHelpful","R3KYPHXG303WA6","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The binding for the version of Sacred Scriptures-Bethel Edition that I am reviewing is black leather.As far as the overall appearance, this translation is done very well. The pages are quality, gild-edge paper. (The thin ""Bible"" paper).Pages have Chapter and Verse clearly marked at the top.The Preface was very good also.I like a number of things I find in this translation:+ It's based on the American Standard Version 1901 rather than a re-working of the King James Version.+ It uses the Sacred Names in both Testaments.+ The Erasmus Addition is not present in I John 5:7.+ Uses ""virgin"" rather than ""maiden"" in Isaiah 7:14.+ Employs the phrase ""tree of life"" rather than ""book of life"" in Revelation 22:19.I have a short list of Scripture passages that I use for comparing Scripture Versions and I found the following differences-* In Matthew 6:13 they use ""bring us not into temptation"" which contradicts Jacob(James) 1:13.* They use the ""Hebrew Gloss"" of ""fifty thousand and seventy men"" men struck down in I Samuel 6:19.* In Mark 10:25 they used the word ""camel"" rather than rope.For what it's worth those are a few translational differences that I found.This version is not perfect by any means, none of the versions that I have or have had are!Another strong point for this edition is the language used. It's neither English slang nor the stiff Shakespearian English.There are no footnotes.

"I bought one of these National Cycle short windshields for my 2012 Vstar 950.Besides the reasonable price, I like the adjustability of the shield and the quick release.The install was easy. The instructions were ok, not crystal clear but good enough to get it done.It took me 15 minutes to install.I didn't want a tall windshield as I didn't think it would look good on my cycle.This one is just tall enough and it looks really nice on my motorcycle.I figured if I didn't like how it deflected the wind at least it would be easy to remove.I have been pleased with it and don't see it coming off anytime soon! With it set at full forward it keeps most of the wind off my face. I'm 6 feet tall, so a shorter rider should have no problem keeping the wind off his/her face.This windshield is a good value and it works well for me.Would I buy it again or recommend it?

"This book was excellent from start to finish!It's loaded with a lot of information on strange subjects in Scripture. The author has obviously done a lot of research and this book is a collection of appendices from his novels.The information on the books of Enoch was very good as well as various interpretations of the ""Sons of God"".I think the author's definition of ""Elohim"" is the best I have come across so far.One aspect of this book that I appreciate a lot is that Mr. Godawa shows that there are differences in various translations of Scripture. The Septuagint differs significantly from the Masoretic in some passages.Some of the subjects that really piqued my interest were:+ Mt. Hermon as a locale for the Fall of Watchers and how Bashan relates to that area.+ Satyrs and what they may have been. Verses on this subject demonstrate translational differences.+ Ariels. What were they?+ Rephaim and other clans.+ Other possible identities for Nimrod.+ The Name Yahweh.+ The Book of Jasher.I highly recommend this book on the subject of Giants in the Bible.It's on par with Giants: Sons of the Gods","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GF7G5H3Q2D7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991143442#wasThisHelpful","R1GF7G5H3Q2D7N","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This version of the Besorah of Yahusha is a newer version.I think the Tanakh is better in this version than the older one. While there are no footnotes, there are parenthetic clarifications on some passages.Two pluses with this version are the absence of both the Hebrew Gloss of I Samuel 6:19 and the Erasmus Addition of I John 5:8.There is a 12 page Introduction and Table of Contents in the front and the back has a chart of letters, a glossary, and editorial comment. I found these features to be helpful.Every book has both the English and Hebrew name along with the Hebrew meaning of the name for each particular book.The Paleo Hebrew letters and the names Yahuah and Yahusha are used as well as the Hebrew words for day, night, earth etc..Hebrew names for people and places are used throughout the book.The order of the Natsarim Writings (New Testament for Christians) is different than any other version I have seen to date.It takes some getting used to that order but I understand Mr. White's reasoning.In my personal opinion Mr. White did a very good job with this version and I enjoy reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25PDL8MF7R8D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1467583472#wasThisHelpful","R25PDL8MF7R8D4","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bit Defender has long had a reputation as one of the better antivirus programs.From my personal experience with this version that is no longer the case.This antivirus is heavy! Updates hog enough resources that browsing with any internet browser is impossible. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera all slow to a crawl. I have never had an antivirus program run so heavy!Add to that the ""silent update."" On the surface, a silent update sounds like a good idea. I wouldn't call it silent. You can definitely tell when Bit Defender updates as every other program becomes unresponsive.There is the option to prompt for updates. Unfortunately that choice does not get saved. Bit Defender has switched back to silent update three times now without any input or message.One of my privacy cleaners has been effected also. It now takes immensely longer for the cleaner to clear items that took a mere minute before.I am returning to what I used before Bit Defender.

"I have been looking for a book of Psalms that uses the sacred names. This book meets that and more.As promised in the front of the book, the ""biblish dialect"" is gone. This is a modern translation.The translator made it a point to avoid guessing at word meanings that may be unclear. That being said, Psalm 22:16 follows along the line of the Masoretic text rather than the Septuagint. This is the controversial ""lion"" vs. ""pierced"" choice of wording. On another Psalm(40:6) she explains the alternative wording of the Septuagint.That's one of the reasons why I appreciate the Endnotes. If a word meaning is unclear or there are alternative wording, it's nice to have that noted.Most of the Psalms have a brief description at their beginning. Things like the identity of the author and in some cases, the circumstances affecting the writer are given.I have been using this book daily and am happy to have it in my collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VKK6CMYQW9OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450591493#wasThisHelpful","R1VKK6CMYQW9OQ","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Bowflex Blaze home gym from Warehouse Deals. It looks new (there is one small scratch on the lat tower) and works well.It came shipped via semi-truck on a pallet. The box was heavy, but nothing that a dolly couldn't handle.Next was assembly. I thought that the assembly instructions and diagrams were very well done. They were easy to follow. Parts are listed and diagrammed with the amount of each part listed also. That came in handy with the washers especially.It took me three hours to assemble the Blaze by myself.The pulley and cable system was easy to hook up also. I ordered the 310lb upgrade kit and installed that right away. That was easy to install. I had to take three screws out of the bottom of the Power Rod block holder to remove the rod block. The upgrade rods installed with two screws. Very simple!After researching for three weeks I settled on the Bowflex Blaze based on positive reviews, price, versatility, and upgrade ability.The only small issue is the fact that I'm 6 feet tall. That makes leg extension exercises a little cramped. I think the additional seat that clamps on the roll assembly helps with that and it's easy to put on and take off.If you're like me and want something a bit cheaper than the Xtreme 2 but with a wide range of exercises, I think this home gym is a great option.It's a solid machine and switching exercises is easy and quick. I am looking forward to using the Blaze for a long time.I highly recommend the Bowflex Blaze.Update*After using the Bowflex Blaze for almost 6 months I have noticed that I trimmed some weight from my waist. Jeans that were tight before fit much better and I have noticeable upper body tone. This exercise equipment has worked wonders for me! That's exercising thirty minutes three days a week.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCNKSOIN7XT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GRDS6U#wasThisHelpful","R1GCNKSOIN7XT6","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My interest was piqued by the 1st and 10th chapters of Ezekiel and Isaiah 34:14. This book answers some of my questions.What I found most interesting was the wide array of sources she used.

"I bought the Trophy HTC for use on the Page Plus service. As with any 3G Verizon phone, the Trophy works well on Page Plus.Mine is a seller refurb.The best thing about this phone is the Windows operating system. It is still supported and works very well on the internet.Here are some more strong-points for the Trophy:+ It's wi-fi capable.+ No lag on the web.+ Excellent screen layout makes for easy navigation.+ The virtual keyboard is one of the better keyboards. It has large enough keys and a very good spell-checker. Spell-checker is not annoying and it is accurate.+ Signal strength is as good as any phone I have used. No dropped calls.+ The HTC Hub is a nice feature- I like it for local temperature.+ The touch screen has been responsive to fingertips. No stylus needed.+ Another nice feature is that the charging port uses a universal charger plug.+ Syncing with my home computer via USB port is simple. The Trophy uses Zune software to transfer mp3 music to the phone.+ Call clarity is very good.I would rate the speakers as average for listening to music. Some phones have better speakers than what the Trophy has. I rarely use this phone for that.As far as battery life, I haven't used the standard battery. I bought a 3500mAh extended life battery and door when I purchased the Trophy and have used that exclusively. This particular battery will go for more than a day on average for me.This is my second Windows phone and I have been impressed with how well it works and the ease of syncing with my home computer.I haven't found anything negative with this phone so far and would buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFSF336TQHQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5OOTDI#wasThisHelpful","R1HFSF336TQHQQ","A124S6MYD45PIQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A124S6MYD45PIQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ms. Tyldesly presents the evolution of the rediscovery and describes in depth each character with grace and flare.This book is treasure for Egyptian history fans do not miss it!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17E9LAH2NM4XG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045JKEAI#wasThisHelpful","R17E9LAH2NM4XG","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately for sci-fi fans, Cyril M. Kornbluth had a very short life (1923-1958). Nevertheless he was able to deliver several very good novels alone or usually in collaboration with other authors as ""The Space Merchants"" (1952) and ""Gladiator-at-law"" (1954) in collaboration with his friend Frederik Pohl, ""Gunner Cade"" (with Judith Merril 1952).Frederik Pohl (1919-2013) the other co-author was one ""Sci-fi Golden Age"" writers. He had authored more than one success as the already mentioned collaborations with Kornbluth, the underrated but excellent ""Drunkard's Walk"" (1960) and Hugo & Nebula winner ""Gateway"" (1977).""Wolfbane"" (1959) was Kornbluth's last novel, written before his fatal heart attack.The plot is as follows: Earth has been dragged into deep space by a rogue planet, losing the sun as star. Instead the moon is an alternate sun reignited every five years by mysterious forces, probably related with an alien pyramid laid on Everest's top.Human race has dwindled to ten million souls divided into ten thousand ""wolves"" and the rest submissive ""lambs"". ""Wolves"" are defiant and trying to liberate humanity from its prostrate state.The chronicle of this struggle is the subject of the story.This book is more centered in plot than in characters and that is its strength and weakness at the same time. The reader can't feel a deep identification with any character, but what is happening to humanity grows in significance. One other point to notice is the ""compound mind"" devised by the authors and compare it with Sturgeon's ""More than Human"".Enjoy this somehow underrated and little known sci-fi classic!Reviewed by Max Yofre","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JU5Z9204Z9LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LMX7AC#wasThisHelpful","R3JU5Z9204Z9LW","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately for sci-fi fans, Cyril M. Kornbluth had a very short life (1923-1958). Nevertheless he was able to deliver several very good novels alone or usually in collaboration with other authors as ""The Syndic"" (1953), ""Gunner Cade"" (with Judith Merril 1952) and ""The Space Merchants"" (with Pohl 1952).""Gladiator-at-law"" (1954) in collaboration with his friend Frederik Pohl (1919-2013) is one of his best.First of all what an enticing title! You simply can't let it pass by unnoticed!The story describes a dystopia with many traits in common with their previous successful novel ""The Space Merchants"". I think these similarities conspired against ""Gladiator-at-law"" relegating it to a more obscure place than it deserves.The plot is as follows: this future world is ruled by Corporations that control economic and political power.Population is roughly divided in three segments.Top level is the Titans (industrial and/or financial).Middle class (professionals, administrators, technicians) bonded to the Corporations by a contract. They live in permanent danger to loose their job AND housing. Being the housing the key issue of this nearly servitude status.Finally at the bottom of the pyramid a huge mass of dispossessed are nourished and entertained by the state and lives into pauper neighborhoods without law.A lawyer that is barely able to keep into the second class is contacted by a mysterious couple of siblings.From there on action rage without respite allowing the reader to get in touch with a nightmarish world.This book is a wonderful example of a turning point in sci-fi literature from traditional technological spaces operas to a more humanistic and sociological subjects.Enjoy this somehow underrated sci-fi classic!Reviewed by Max Yofre","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QBDAV1U1UTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KF4Q8C#wasThisHelpful","R20QBDAV1U1UTA","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"James Jones is a controversial author and has written a three piece meditation about military life and service men: ""From Here to Eternity"", ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Whistle"".""From here to Eternity"" is a many-layered story. There are explicit and implicit levels to read it; in all of them this book is outstanding.It describes with crude language the life in the Army in times of peace. In this case is the USA's Army just before Pearl Harbor, but examples shown are universal and may apply to any Army in any country. At this level the class structure of Officers, Noncoms and Privates is shown with penetrating sight: the power relations, the subtle struggle amongst them, loyalties, abuses, solidarity and weakness. All these traits are depicted vividly thru the different characters that come across this epic novel.At another level is the story of a young man. He is a Soldier (yes, with capital letter). He is the epitome of soldiership. He knows what is due to the Service and what is due to himself. He sticks to these principles without regard of personal costs.Robert Lee Prewitt is a natural fighter; he has enjoyed boxing until an accident on the ring changed him. He will box no more. Destiny puts him in a Company, where the commanding officer is trying to form a crack team in order to win the Army's championship and enhance his career.Private Prewitt is subject to increasing pressure to join the team. He won't bend. He will pay the price. He will remain Free in his hearth until the end.But this is not all. Romance has its place too. Although unconventionally; Prewitt is in love with a prostitute and Sgt. Warden with his boss' wife. Still love is pure and real and touching.Jones' opus requires the reader to get involved with the story, to cry and laugh with it, to get in touch with the deepest human emotions.A major experience to be sure!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KV6PKA0MPGVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MVNQ5G#wasThisHelpful","R3KV6PKA0MPGVE","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frederik Pohl (1919-2013) was a conspicuous member of ""Sci-fi Golden Age"" authors and he wrote until near his passing. He also was editor of ""Galaxy"" and ""If"" magazines winning the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine for 1966, 1967 and 1968.He has authored more than one great success as: ""The Space Merchants"" (1952 with C. M. Kornbluth), ""Gladiator-at-law"" (1955 with C. M. Kornbluth) and the Hugo & Nebula winner ""Gateway"" (1977).""The Coming of the Quantum Cats"" (1986), is a complex and intelligent novel.The story is as follows: there exist parallel universes, very similar to each other and to our own. Yet subtle historical differences give way to completely dissimilar world scenarios.The author follows three main characters and their avatars in parallel worlds. They jump from one to another surprising and disorientating themselves (and the reader). Some scenes are obviously tongue in cheek, others shed light to deep insights and how the same human clay may take such different forms.This is a very good sample of the author's creativity, his sense of humor and social critic.

"This is the Spanish translation of Heinlein's classic ""The puppet Masters"" presented by Editorial La Factoria de Ideas in its collection ""Solaris"".This editorial house has some interesting collections dedicated to sci-fi and fantasy as ""Ventana Abierta"", ""Fantasia"" and ""Eclipse"". All of them with fine translations and excellent presentation.When I was a teenager, Robert A. Heinlein was one of my favorite sci-fi authors. Time had passed by, but I still love some of his books. ""The Puppet Masters"" is one of them.This book was published in 1951 when the Cold War was raging. That cultural background greatly influences the story. As I pointed out in other reviews, books and films of the period allude the frightful issue of: ""They are LIKE us but they are NOT us. They are DANGEROUS to us"", as in the films ""The Thing from another World"" (1951), ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956) or ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space"" (1958).The story focuses on an alien invasion that expands all around the world with unimaginable speed. Sam and Mary are agents of an ultra secret Security Agency under the control of the Old Man who have a direct link to the President.Both agents go to investigate and after discovering what's up, a fast paced adventure starts.Alien parasites take control of human beings by the expedient of attaching themselves to the back of the host. The first frightful issue to overcome is how to distinguish friend from foes. Then, the Government has to implement some defense against them, that include a ""bare backs"" politic. Finally our heroes try to find the source and origin of the invasion.At this height of his career, Heinlein was more centered in the action than in political or social speculation, as he develops in later books, with uneven success.I recommend this book to all sci-fi lovers and those who enjoy adrenalin charged adventures.Reviewed by Max Yofre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2TXLXLUPKIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006W7QA4K#wasThisHelpful","RI2TXLXLUPKIR","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now I discovered this not very recent (1958) study on Egyptian way of life. This is the Spanish translation of the original French book.This is an excellent, very readable and detailed research, using mainly paintings and carving as main sources to describe thoroughly every single piece of activity.The reader will be presented with succinct yet detailed description of homes, family, country life, professions, religious cult, time measuring and burial amongst many more issues.The author also explains that Egyptian culture was not unchanging as we commonly assume; so he describes specifically Ramesses period.This book is treasure for Egyptian history students and fans alike do not miss it!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11Q1S26CCX0N8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8478802819#wasThisHelpful","R11Q1S26CCX0N8","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack Vance (1916-2013) was an extraordinary science-fiction and fantasy author, deservedly honored with Hugo, Nebula and World Fantasy awards.Vance had a powerful imagination and devices very detailed alien worlds with complex social structures, free of any restriction. He populates it with alien races or strange animals competing with humans, and sometimes amongst themselves.The author construct these universes with the same care for a novel or just for a short story as ""The Moon Moth"" (read it if you may).The plot of this novel is as follows: a human community survives after some ecological catastrophe souranded by hostile primitive communities. Here eternal life is available, but... not to everybody. To avoid overpopulation and starvation this gift is restrained to people who attains notable objectives in arts or science.The main character has obtained this desired status but at the same moment committed a capital crime in the legal view of this society. In his own views he does not deserve to be banished from immortality, yet other members of the community strongly desired impeach him.The author describes minutely this strange culture giving way at the same time to endless adventures that will be enjoyed by readers.This is a very commendable book for sci-fi lovers and general public too!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZSTK14PZJY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032KNKY8#wasThisHelpful","R27ZSTK14PZJY4","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The film ""Dracula"" (1958) (Aka ""Horror of Dracula"" in the USA) was a turning point in vampire's movies.The use of Technicolor and profusion of blood shed produced a shock to audiences when releasedAt that time I was one of the teenagers that crowded the theater. What an experience! Since the starting titles with blood dripping over Dracula's name until the last scene we were enthralled with fear & horror!At the present times general public is used to much more gore and violence, but this film still make your hair stand straight!British director Terence Fisher is able to instill true Stoker's spirit to the film; it is a subtle combination of suspense and Grand Guignol. That ""touch"" was lost in successive new versions and resurrections the dreadful Count.But in this particular first release of Christopher Dracula Lee & Peter Van Helsing Cushing are at their peak.The story in this particular adaptation of Stoker's book is as follows: Jonathan Harker is sent by Dr. Van Helsing to Dracula's Castle in order to destroy the hideous vampire.That fate is easier to plan than accomplish as the unfortunate Harker will learn.After defeating this attack the Count starts an all out revenge aimed to Harker's fiancée and her sister.To stop him there is only on person: Dr. van Helsing. The film chronicles this confrontation.Christopher Lee with his eyes full of tiny red veins and enormous fangs rends a paradigmatic characterization. Peter Cushing as Dr. van Helsing is at the same height.This is an unforgettable horror movie. It is highly recommended for fans of the genre.Reviewed by Max Yofre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UXKLV5N8U439/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6302489067#wasThisHelpful","R1UXKLV5N8U439","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Attention fellow customers: this DVD does NOT run on USA DVD players. Remember Amazon sells for all over the world customers.Whenever you think of Blake Edwards, Comedy comes to your mind!Not in vain he has created and directed ""The Pink Panther"" saga started in 1963, ""Victor/Victoria"" (1982) and ""The Party"" (1968), any of them able to cause riots of laughter in the audience.This movie starts with a little gem. As in Bond movies an introductory sequence is filmed.There you will see a Hindustani bugler (with echoes of Gunga Din) receiving first quite a score of bullet hits, then dozens and then more, much more. Nevertheless the ""heroic"" bugler continue blowing his instrument on and on till... well you'll see it.As a consequence of these events Mr. Hrundi V. Bakshi is perpetually banned from Hollywood and its surroundings.Yet Fate (Nasty Fate to be sure) put in his hands an invitation to a Party in film director's home!So Mr. Bakshi wears his best suit and knocks the door.Then Mr. Havoc enters the party and jocosity erupts!Any kind of gag is displayed, you name it you have it!Peter Sellers gives one of his best performances ever. He displays a mixture of Buster Keaton, Charly Chaplin, the Three Stooges and his own panoply of comic resources.Best of all: he has a great support from the rest of the cast: starting with the waiter thru the cowboy and the teens.Claudine Longet is great and sweet; unfortunately the facts in her life barred her from stage (she performed in only four movies and many TV appearances).This is a great and joyous movie!

"As I say in my Amazon’s Home page I’m a history buff and Rome’s history from the Republic to the late Empire exceedingly interest me. I enjoy well researched historical novels as McCullough’s series “Masters of Rome” or classic texts as Suetonius’ “The Twelve Caesars” and Plutarch’s “Lives”.Looking for more novels about the subject I found Posteguillo’s excellent novel “Los Asesinos del Emperador” (“The Murders of the Emperor”) a story focused on Emperor Trajan (only in Spanish by the time being).Next I searched for more structured information and found “Trajan Optimus Princeps” (1997) presented by specialist as Routledge.Julian Bennett, the author, is a British Archeologist.This is a good little bio about Trajan, a bit “dry” if I may say. It is not a text for starters; the target reader is someone that has some knowledge about ancient Rome and wants to read more about this Emperor or this period in general.The author examines every major issue about the Emperor. The first three chapters describe the background of the Empire, its ruling class and the Ulpian family.Chapters 4 to 13 describe minutely Trajan’s career and the closing two chapters give an evaluation of his government.It was very interesting for me and I suppose it will be so for many readers, how the author illustrates the method used by archeologists to establish facts and dates when little written evidence exists.This book in spite of its dryness is nevertheless very readable.Reviewed by Max Yofre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYVTQ5PF3VTV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5RK2WK#wasThisHelpful","RYVTQ5PF3VTV6","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first contact with Mr. Toland's writings was ""Gods of War"" and found it a great WWII novel. At that time I wasn't aware Mr. Toland was a professional historian on war themes. Researching in Amazon, for bibliography on the Bulge subject, I was gratefully surprised to find another edition of this non-fiction book.Mr. Toland collects hundreds of testimonies from the actors of this war drama, ranging from generals to privates; medics, nurses, peasants, priests. Blend all of them in an overwhelming and coherent picture. He gets in touch with the suffering of the confronting soldiers, their acts of desperate bravery and gallantry, but at the same time having a look into the planning of higher levels of command.Both sides in conflict are researched, their actions scrutinized and compared.His prose is entertaining and informative. The reader has the sensation of ""being there"".Even if this book was written in 1959 and many documents were not available for investigators at that time, it stands as milestone on the subject.A great stuff to read for historians, students or casual readers.Enjoy!!!.Reviewed by Max Yofre","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396C9BLAYZPLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GQWMTK#wasThisHelpful","R396C9BLAYZPLV","A1Y87E22UVYCE6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y87E22UVYCE6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I say in my Amazon Home Page, I’m a history buff and one of the main historical periods on which I focus is WWII.Some of my favorite authors covering this period are: John Toland, Cornelius Ryan, John Keegan, Chester Wilmont, Carlo D’Este, William Craig and Anthony Beevor.I am reading now the monumental work of Winston S. Churchill, when I arrived to “The Fall of France” (first part of “Their Finest Hour”) I realized how little I knew about the whole campaign (except for Dunkirk evacuation). So I look for some aid and found… “The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940” by Julian Jackson.J. Jackson (b. 1954) is a British historian specialized in French history 1930-1970, he has authored “The Politics of Depression France 1932-1936” (1985),  “The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy 1934-1938” (1988), “France: the Dark Years 1940-1944” ( 2001) and the present book in 2003. That is to say his background to write about this critical campaign is solid.Professor Jackson states in the Introduction “The purpose of this book will be: to tell the story of the defeat, explain why it occurred, and reflect on its consequences”.IMHO he accomplishes his goals with talent and gives a very plausible explanation of the “whys” of this astounding defeat.With great patience and skill Mr. Jackson shows the facts at the battleground, the relationship between the Allies, the morale, the politics and the people all described very clearly and coherently.A great stuff to read for historians, students or casual readers.

"""Space Travelers"" (a/k/a ""Marooned"") was a big budget movie with a well-known cast - Gregory Peck, Richard Crenna, James Franciscus, David Janssen, and Gene Hackman (he's always good in everything he appears in).  As Frank Conniff (TV's Frank) mentioned in his new introduction, it was an unusual choice for the MST3K gang to riff on, but the results were hilarious.  The slow pacing of the film worked in favor of their constant riffing.  Next up is Steve Reeves, not to be confused with George Reeves, who played Superman on TV.  Steve flexed his mighty muscles in the title role of ""Hercules"" (1958).  Hercules falls in love with King Pelias' daughter Iole; can't save the King's son Iphitus from getting killed by a lion; and row, row, rows the boat with Jason and the Argonauts on their voyage to get the Golden Fleece.  It's all Greek to me!  As a rule, I don't care for sword and sandals movies, but the original Hercules has a certain charm, which Joel and the 'bots have a field day riffing.  The host segment on the Match Game is excellent.  In addition, there is an interesting bonus feature on the early films of Joseph E. Levine.As Mike Nelson points out about ""Radar Secret Service"" (1950), the film spends far too much time dealing with radar, and not nearly enough time with the secret agents.  In fact, the whole movie is like an expanded short subject that could have been called ""Radar Is Your Friend.""  The only noteworthy performances come from Adele Jergens in the blonde bombshell role, and Sid Melton as the comic relief.  An interesting bonus feature is a travelogue with Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu in England, being interviewed by Bunny Galore, British horror movie host, and Queen of the cult movies.  (Although, going by her name and listening to her voice, I suspect that Bunny is a Drag Queen.  Not that there’s anything wrong with that!)  Last and least is the made-for-TV movie pilot ""San Francisco International"" (1970).  Pernell Roberts stars as the head of airport security.  Tab Hunter chews the scenery as a criminal briefly disguised as a priest.  The plot involves a gang of criminals holding people at gunpoint, as part of a plan to steal a shipment of millions of dollars from Alaska (cold, hard cash).  There's also a subplot about an annoying kid whose parents (Van Johnson and Nancy Malone) are going to get divorced.  The kid steals a small airplane and somehow manages to fly it.  Pernell Roberts has to fly next to the kid, to talk him down safely.  And yes, we can all agree that David Hartman is a goofy-looking guy.  The host segments mostly involve Mike Nelson impersonating Steve Urkel, with everybody laughing hysterically at everything he says.  That strange episode closes out this mixed bag of MST3K movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DM0XVNHMJ6F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJN34R8#wasThisHelpful","R3DM0XVNHMJ6F2","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""Seinfeld"" was one of those series.  Of course, the Fab Four refers to Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld), Michael Richards (Cosmo Kramer), Jason Alexander (George Costanza), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Elaine Benes).  Completing the analogy, the fifth Beatle would be co-creator and head writer Larry David.  There's no need for me to describe the so-called show about nothing, or mention all of the catch phrases and words that became part of our vernacular, such as ""hoochie mama,"" ""no soup for you,"" ""not that there's anything wrong with that,"" ""shrinkage,"" ""that's a shame,"" and ""yada yada yada.""  I especially liked how the show maintained continuity with characters and storylines, which is lacking in many other series.  The important question is, after viewing the show repeated so many times in syndication, is it worth buying the complete series box set?  The answer is a resounding YES!There are three episodes included in the box set that are NEVER shown in syndication.  The first one is ""The Handicap Spot,"" from season 4.  The box set includes the original episode, in which John Randolph played Frank Costanza.  After the great Jerry Stiller joined the cast as George's father, Larry David reshot scenes from that episode, replacing John Randolph with Jerry Stiller as Frank Costanza.  In the Season 9 episode ""The Betrayal,"" the action takes place backwards, in flashbacks.  The box set also includes ""The Betrayal"" in correct chronological order, from start to finish.  In addition, the box set includes ""The Puerto Rican Day"" episode from season 9.  That episode was pulled from syndication, because it contains a controversial scene involving the Puerto Rican flag.  In addition, the bonus features make the box set an essential purchase for all Seinfeld fans.  Many episodes have extended and deleted scenes that didn't make the final cut of the show.  Speaking of not making the final cut, there are many hilarious bloopers sprinkled throughout the box set.  Many episodes include ""Inside Looks,"" in which cast members and writers discuss a particular episode.  ""Notes About Nothing"" provide interesting facts about each episode.  Several episodes include insightful commentaries by cast members and writers.  Last but not least is the bonus disc of the roundtable reunion, in which Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Larry David reminisce about the show.

Living with them is Carrie's father Arthur Spooner, played by the brilliant comedic actor Jerry Stiller.  Another interesting character is Spence Olchin, played by stand-up comedian Patton Oswalt.  I was fortunate enough to see Patton perform live in Boston, and he was absolutely hilarious.  Jerry and Patton are great as second bananas in this series.  They could have easily been the lead characters in a spin-off show, which could have been called, ""I'm Spooner, He's Olchin.""  Other important cast members include Doug's best friend Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Doug's cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine), dog (and Arthur) walker Holly Shumpert (Nicole Sullivan), and hulking neighbor Lou Ferrigno.My favorite episode is ""Life Sentence,"" from the fourth season.  In that episode, Arthur returns homes from the hospital, after having had an angioplasty.  Doug and Carrie install a nanny-cam in the basement, in order to keep an eye on Arthur.  Danny, Deacon and Spence are watching the television set in Doug's garage.  While changing channels, they see Arthur on television.  Enthralled, they end up watching Arthur all night long.  Meanwhile, Doug and Carrie are finalizing their life insurance plan.  Carrie decides that if she died, Arthur should still live with Doug.  Doug thinks that's a crazy idea.  Arguing over who will die first, Carrie smokes a cigarette, while Doug devours a spray can of whipped cream.  Arthur makes an impassioned speech about how happy he was to get out of the hospital, and move back home with them.  They all realize that, despite the constant arguing and craziness, they all really love each other.  They conclude with a group hug, which nearly brings Danny, Deacon and Spence to tears.  For me, that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the show.On the plus side, a disc of bonus features includes a"" Series Retrospective,"" ""Thanks To The Fans,"" a ""200th Episode Celebration,"" ""The Writers Of The King Of Queens,"" and ""Character Profiles.""  On the negative side, the fold-out box consists of two plastic spindles, with two rows of discs piled one on top of the other, without any protection.  I'm happy to report that none of the discs I played were scratched or defective in any way.  In addition, the audio and video qualities of the episodes were very good.  For the bargain price it's selling for, I definitely recommend buying the complete series box set of ""The King Of Queens.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0USGG6XLT8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D0OHA6#wasThisHelpful","R3S0USGG6XLT8I","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast.  ""3rd Rock From The Sun"" was one of those series.  Extraterrestrial Dick Solomon, the High Commander (John Lithgow) is a narcissistic man-child, who revels in the sensations of human experiences.  While not as outlandish as Mork from Ork (Robin Williams), John Lithgow played his part of the oddball with no inhibitions to perfection.  Sally Solomon, Security Officer (Kristen Johnston) is a male extraterrestrial in female human form.  And what a form!  Kristen's beauty is only exceeded by her comedic abilities.  Tommy Solomon, Information Officer/Intelligence Expert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the oldest member of the so-called family, inhabiting the youngest human body.  Joseph literally grew up on the show, and went on to become a movie star.  Harry Solomon, Intergalactic Transmitter (French Stewart), who looks at the world through half-closed eyes, is not the brightest team member.  In reality, French Stewart is a graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, proving that it helps to be smart to play dumb convincingly.Rounding out the cast are Dick's girlfriend, Dr. Mary Albright (Jane Curtin), Sally's boyfriend, Officer Don Orville (Wayne Knight), Dick and Mary's assistant Nina Campbell (Simbi Khali), and Dick's landlady, Mrs. Mamie Dubcek (Elmarie Wendel).  An impressive roster of great guest stars include William Shatner as the Big Giant Head, George Takei as himself, John Cleese as Dr. Liam Neesam, Jan Hooks as Vicki Dubcek, Elaine Stritch as Martha Albright, Harry Morgan as Professor Suter, Laurie Metcalf as Professor Jennifer Ravelli, Roseanne Barr as Janet, Phil Hartman as Phillip, Cindy Crawford as Mascha, and Elvis Costello as himself.  It felt like, just as these lovable aliens became close friends, they had to return to their home planet.  Watching this series reminded me of how much they are missed, and how wonderful the show was.  While not the greatest packaging, the individual discs are in cardboard sleeves with protective lining.  All of the discs played without any glitches or imperfections.  In fact, the colors were sharp and vibrant, and the audio was clear.  Bonus features include interviews, audio commentaries, bloopers, highlight reels, and a brief alternate ending to the final episode.  I definitely recommend purchasing this budget-priced box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZOQGVLQYP53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BM2JVAA#wasThisHelpful","R22ZOQGVLQYP53","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1991, this 2-CD, 36-song Grass Roots anthology was released by Rhino Records.  It includes all of their top 40 hit songs, well-crafted album tracks, and extensive liner notes.  For their debut album, the Grass Roots included the songwriting team of P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri.  P.F. Sloan provided the lead vocals on the album, and was backed by a studio band.  From that album, this collection includes ""Mr. Jones (Ballad Of A Thin Man),"" and ""Where Were You When I Needed You"" (#28 in 1966).  At that point in time, the Grass Roots were a folk-rock studio group.  For their second album, the Grass Roots consisted of Rob Grill (vocals, bass), Creed Bratton (lead guitar), Warren Entner (vocals, guitar, keyboards), and Rick Coonce (drums).  That version of the Grass Roots was a pop, singles-oriented band that toured extensively.  From their second album, this collection includes the catchy hit songs ""Let's Live For Today"" (#8 in 1967), and ""Things I Should Have Said"" (#23 in 1967).  Horns were featured in their hit songs ""Midnight Confessions"" (#5 in 1968), ""Lovin' Things,"" ""I'd Wait A Million Years"" (#15 in 1969), ""Heaven Knows"" (#24 in 1969), ""Temptation Eyes"" (#15 in 1971), ""Sooner Or Later"" (#9 in 1971), ""Two Divided By Love"" (#16 in 1971), and their last top 40 single, ""The Runway"" (#39 in 1972).  Sadly, lead singer Rob Grill passed away on July 11, 2011.  Happily, the hit singles and essential album tracks on this Grass Roots collection have stood the test of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PD06B5TE1ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000032MQ#wasThisHelpful","R4PD06B5TE1ZB","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Actor/writer Simon Pegg, actor Nick Frost, and director/writer Edgar Wright, combined their talents to create the Cornetto Trilogy of films included in this Blu-ray 3-disc set.  ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (2004) was an instant classic, combining the genres of romantic comedy with horror to great effect.  When Shaun first encounters the zombies, he doesn't even realize what is really going on.  To me, that demonstrates a Monty Python influence.  Of course, Shaun and his best friend Ed decide that the best place to take refuge in is the local pub called the Winchester.  When Ed tells Shaun's Mum ""We're coming to get you, Barbara,"" it's a nod to George Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead"" (1968).  Early in that film, her brother intones ""They're coming to get you, Barbara...""  This is a must-see movie for me every October, when Halloween draws near.""Hot Fuzz"" (2007) combines the genres of the action film and the buddy cop movie with horror.  Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a by-the-book, smart super-cop who is making the London police force look bad by comparison.  Nick is transferred to the rustic village of Sandford.  He is paired with the overweight, bumbling Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), who also happens to be the son of the local Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  All is not well in the seemingly ideal village, whose elder members will stop at nothing to win England's Village Of The Year award.  Timothy Dalton (a former James Bond) plays smarmy supermarket owner Simon Skinner.  Among the many grisly accidents that occur, his is the funniest!  Apparently,  director/writer Edgar Wright was interested in doing an action/buddy cop movie ever since he was a young lad.  One of the many bonus features is an amateur film called ""Dead Right,"" which he wrote and directed when he was only eighteen years old.""The World's End"" (2013) combines the genres of the mid-life crisis movie with sci-fi.  Gary King (Simon Pegg) is a 40-something alcoholic whose glory days were in high school.  His dream is to reunite with four of his school chums, including Andy Knightley (Nick Frost), to complete the golden-mile pub crawl, by drinking twelve pints in twelve pubs in one night.  While the trouble-makers were gruesomely murdered in the previous movie, in this film, the imperfect humans are replaced by extraterrestrial robots with blue blood (or lubricating oil) coursing through their bodies.  Pierce Brosnan (a former James Bond) plays a teacher named Guy Shepherd, who has become one of the extraterrestrial replicates referred to as the blanks.  By the time Gary and Andy manage to reach the twelfth pub, called the World's End, they have a very close encounter with extraterrestrials that will change the world forever!  All three movies are loaded with bonus features, which help make this 3-disc set a very worthwhile purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSUQBYZW3OW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F98FOL8#wasThisHelpful","R3MSUQBYZW3OW3","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's great to have the complete series of ""The Addams Family"" in one box set.  Despite the fact that they're kooky, spooky, and all together ooky, the Addams was a very functional and loving family.  The cast was uniformly superb.  Gomez Addams (John Astin) and his wife Morticia (Carolyn Jones) were passionately in love.  Their displays of affection were somewhat shocking for a 1960's TV series, but are tame by today's standards. Jackie Coogan was a consummate professional as Uncle Fester, infusing his character with a Curly Howard quality.  Ted Cassidy showed a real flair for comedy as Lurch, especially in the episodes ""Lurch Learns To Dance,"" ""Lurch, The Teenage Idol,"" ""Lurch's Little Helper,"" and ""Lurch's Grand Romance.""In addition, the DVD includes hilarious audio commentaries by Cousin Itt and Thing for select scenes, which contain captions for better comprehension.  Speaking of audio commentaries, you haven't lived until you've heard ""The Addams Family"" in French and Spanish!  The one complaint I have is the fact that the episodes are on double-sided discs.  This makes them easier to get scratched or otherwise damaged.  In fact, the first box set I bought included defective DVDs, and had to be exchanged.  Fortunately, all of the discs in the replacement box set played perfectly.  Despite all that, fans of ""The Addams Family"" should not hesitate to buy this box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMQXES15JVMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V3JGIS#wasThisHelpful","RAMQXES15JVMZ","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This triple treat of Ed Wood movies was released by After Hours Cinema.  ""Nympho Cycler"" (1971) is a poor quality print.  Given the source material, that's not surprising.  The Alpha Blue Archives edition starts with Casey Larrain (credited as Lorraine Casey) in a swimming pool, and Ed Wood sitting poolside. Ed is in drag, wearing a blonde wig and green dress. Ed announces that, ""After all, I am your husband,"" taking off his wig and dress, and joining Casey in the pool.  The After Hours Cinema version starts with Ed and Lorraine already in the pool.  Much of Ed and Lorraine's dialogue seems improvised, as they're laughing it up and kissing.  In a later scene, Ed is taking photographs of his wife for a men's magazine. That scene is very reminiscent of the movie ""Pretty Models All In A Row"" (1969). In that movie, Ed played a cross-dressing photographer, while Casey Larrain played one of the models. In this movie, Lorraine gets tired of Ed exploiting her as a model, and pimping her out to his friends.  She hits the road on her motorcycle, and experiences all sorts of sexual hijinks.  After less than an hour, the movie ends, without Ed Wood making a return appearance.  There's very little of the quirky dialogue that Ed Wood was famous for.Alice Friedland stars in ""The Young Marrieds"" (1971).  The movie was written by Ed Wood, was the last film that Ed Wood directed, and has been lost for over forty years. The video quality is fair, especially considering the source material.  It's a standard, hardcore porno movie, with occasional narration.  Alice plays a wife whose husband is not sexually satisfied. They go to a swingers' party with two other couples.  Alice's husband eagerly has sex with a bleached-blonde woman.  Alice is reluctant at first, but soon enough is joining in on the fun.  As the orgy intensifies, the movie ends, clocking in at less than an hour.  Again, there's very little of the quirky dialogue that Ed Wood was famous for.  Despite its flaws, it's always a cause for celebration when a lost Ed Wood film has been found, and released on DVD.  The theatrical trailer for ""The Young Marrieds"" is included as a bonus feature, and is not available in the Alpha Blue Archives edition.  According to the informative liner notes, there is some doubt about Ed Wood's involvement with the adult movie ""Shot On Location,"" which was released in January of 1972.  Its movie-within-a-movie, quirky dialogue, and surprise ending, are in the style of Ed Wood, at the very least.  This After Hours Cinema release is a worthwhile purchase for hard core Ed Wood fans like me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WE50VF13L5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB6OSRW#wasThisHelpful","R38WE50VF13L5G","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 1979 movie was co-written, produced, and directed by Russ Meyer.  Stuart Lancaster, credited as the Man from Small Town U.S.A., is the on-camera narrator of the movie.  Early in the movie, Candy Samples appears briefly as the Very Big Blonde.  Like everything else in this movie, she's larger than life.  Lamar Shedd (Ken Kerr) can't satisfy his wife Lavonia (Kitten Natividad), because he can only climax in an unconventional way.  Lavonia, with the aid of a wig and a Mexican accent, becomes a sexy stripper named Lola Langusta.  Lola proceeds to bed down men with more standard sexual tastes.  Lamar is put through a series of cures, culminating with the laying on of hands by a radio faith-healer named Sister Eufaula Roop, played by the super-stacked Anne Marie (67-25-36).  Near the end of the movie, Uschi Digard has a cameo as SuperSoul.  Russ Meyer himself appears at the end of the film to wrap up the movie.  1972 was a watershed year for adult movies, with the release of ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind The Green Door.""  Even though this was the most graphic of Russ Meyer's movies, it seemed tame by comparison.  At the end of this movie, it says to look for the further adventures of Lola Langusta in ""The Jaws Of Vixen.""  Unfortunately, that movie was never made.  ""Beneath The Valley Of The Ultra-Vixens"" was the last of Russ Meyer's theatrical feature films.  The Russ Meyer ""Pandora Peaks"" documentary was a direct-to-video release in 2001.

"Dan Curtis' production of ""Frankenstein"" was an episode on ""The Wide World Of Mystery"" TV anthology series, and originally aired on January 16, 1973.  In 1985, Elvira hosted a direct-to-video series called ""Thriller Video.""  In addition to episodes of the 1980 ""Hammer House Of Horror"" TV series from England, it also featured Dan Curtis' productions of ""Frankenstein,"" ""Dracula,"" ""The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde,"" ""The Picture Of Dorian Gray,"" and ""Turn Of The Screw.""  This 130-minute production is a low budget, faithful adaptation of the classic Frankenstein story.  Robert Foxworth stars as Dr. Victor Frankenstein, Susan Strasberg plays his love interest Elizabeth Lavenza, and Bo Svenson plays his creation, referred to in the credits as the Giant.  In fact, the good doctor initially calls his creation a giant baby, who has to be taught to walk and talk.  When he first comes to life, Bo looks like a dazed stoner dude who was in a bad car accident, with his face all scarred up.  In addition to looking human, he speaks quite well, which sets him apart from previous Frankenstein creations.In one scene, Bo wants a young boy to keep quiet, so he puts his giant hand over the boy's mouth.  Sadly, the young boy dies as a result.  Later, Bo asks Dr. Frankenstein to create a woman for him.  During the creation process, Dr. Frankenstein gives her too much electricity, intentionally killing her.  Bo swears revenge, and does end up killing Elizabeth.  Near the end, while Dr. Frankenstein is trying to shoot and kill his creation, he falls and impales himself on a metal rod.  As Dr. Frankenstein lies dying, Bo cradles him in his arms.  Crying, Bo expresses remorse for accidentally killing the young boy, and for murdering Elizabeth.  A couple of men keep shooting Bo until he dies, still holding the lifeless Dr. Frankenstein in his arms.  This production of ""Frankenstein"" was well-intentioned but overly long, and boring in spots.  Its bleak tone did not fit all that well with Elvira's humorous remarks and outgoing personality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q868ZF47YUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D8TMCI#wasThisHelpful","R2Q868ZF47YUV","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In this episode, Penny (Kathryn Leigh Scott) is the wealthy, live-in girlfriend of Harry Wells (Simon MacCorkindale).  She is mentally unbalanced, and had been institutionalized.  While Harry is away, Charlie (Stanley Lebor) breaks into their house.  He starts attacking Penny, and she shoots him with a shotgun.  When Harry arrives home and discovers what happened, he doesn't suggest calling the police.  Harry has Penny burn the bed clothes and clean the blood stains from the floor, while he buries Charlie's body in the nearby woods.  Then Harry drives Charlie's car into the lake.  Later, Penny thinks she sees Charlie at a party, and then driving around town.  Penny goes to a fortune teller named Margaret (Mia Nadasi) to help her stop having visions of the dead man.  Margaret can't help her, but suggests contacting Swami Gupta Krishna (Gareth Thomas).  To entice the Swami to come from India to England, Penny gives him $150,000, which the Swami needs to set up shop in England.  Later, Swami Gupta, Margaret the fortune teller, and Penny hold a séance to contact Charlie, while Harry looks on in disbelief.  Charlie's disembodied head appears, declaring that he wants revenge.  Penny admits that she killed Charlie, then runs out of the room.SPOLIER ALERT: A combination of taking too many pills, and having a guilty conscience, causes Penny to take the shotgun and shoot herself.  As Penny's dead body is taken to the hospital, Swami Gupta, Margaret the fortune teller, and happy Harry celebrate with champagne.  It was all a scam they planned to swindle Penny out of $150,000.  No sooner do they take a sip, then the ghost of Penny appears before them, declaring that she wants revenge.  The pile of money on the table catches fire, and burns up.  As Elvira said after the episode ended, she should have waited until they put the money in their pockets, then set it on fire.  In my opinion, this is one of the best episodes in the ""Hammer House Of Horror"" series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GUYY6YMJ0TI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RJAR2A#wasThisHelpful","R2GUYY6YMJ0TI6","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1980, the anthology series ""Hammer House Of Horror"" was broadcast in England. ""The House That Bled To Death"" episode originally aired on October 11, 1980.  In 1985, Elvira hosted a direct-to-video series called ""Thriller Video,"" which features episodes of that series.  In this episode, William Peters (Nicholas Ball), his common-law wife Emma (Rachel Davies), and their daughter Sophia (Emma Ridley), move into an old house that needs a lot of fixing up.  Years before in that same house, a husband poisoned his wife.  He hacked up her dead body with a curved sword, and then buried her under the floorboards.  Almost immediately after they move in, bad things start to happen to the young couple and their daughter.  Their pet cat is found dead, its throat cut by sharp glass on a broken window.  They find a severed hand in the refrigerator.  At Sophia's birthday party, someone gives her a curved sword for a birthday gift.  Later, a water pipe near the ceiling breaks, spewing blood all over the children eating birthday cake and ice cream.SPOILER ALERT: It turns out that Andrew James Powers (Milton Johns), the real estate agent that sold the couple the house, along with William and Emma, caused all of the supposedly paranormal activity that occurred in the house.  A.J. Powers wrote a book called ""The House That Bled To Death,"" and it became a bestseller.  William and Emma get a million dollars for the movie rights, and move to a mansion in California.  Unfortunately for them, their daughter Sophia spoils their happy ending, which I won't spoil by saying how.  Personally, I found this to be one of the weaker episodes in the ""Hammer House Of Horror"" series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ESQW1HM0JR2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GGU3HI#wasThisHelpful","R3ESQW1HM0JR2L","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1980, the anthology series ""Hammer House Of Horror"" was broadcast in England.  The ""Guardian Of The Abyss"" episode originally aired on November 15, 1980.  In 1985, Elvira hosted a direct-to-video series called ""Thriller Video,"" which features episodes of that series.  In this episode, a woman buys a small, antique mirror at an auction.  Her friend Michael Roberts (Ray Lonnen) decides to get it appraised before she sells it.  As he's driving along, he encounters Allison Lussan (Rosalyn Landor), who has just escaped from the Corinson occult society.  They're a cult of devil worshippers who wanted to sacrifice her, as part of a ceremony to summon Corinson, a demonic figure who guards the gates of Hell.  It turns out that the antique mirror is really a scrying glass, which is needed for the summoning ceremony.  Michael takes Allison home, and gets intimately involved with her, which turns out to be a big mistake.  Charles Randolph (John Carson), the cult leader, uses hypnotism, and a form of voodoo, to get Allison back to the cult.  Michael finds out where the cult's headquarters are located, and drives like a maniac to get there.  When he arrives there, the cult members take him instead of Allison, to become the human sacrifice in the summoning ceremony.SPOILER ALERT: The summoning ceremony works, and Michael becomes possessed by the evil spirit of Corinson.  Allison happily stands by his side, as his devilish bride.  As Elvira mentions after the episode is over, what happened to the happy ending?  In this story, evil triumphs over good.

"I only bought this movie because the late, great Ed Wood appears in it.  There's lots of nudity and simulated sex in this softcore movie.  George Stone (Victor Rich) is a middle-aged business executive who goes to swinging parties.  His wife Martha (Karen Johnson) wants George to take her to one of those orgies/parties.  To give you an idea of how good their acting is, this is the only movie that Victor Rich and Karen Johnson ever appeared in.  About half an hour into the film, at the party, an obviously drunk Ed Wood appears in a bedroom with a parrot.  Ed starts taking off his clothes, and starts putting on pantyhose, then a bra.  The movie keeps cutting back and forth between Ed and the party, so the viewer won't have to take in that sight all at once.  At one point, a woman walks in, looks astonished, then walks out.  Later, a man walks in, and poor Ed looks ashamed to be wearing a bra and pantyhose.  The man tells him that it's all right, he looks nice, and to keep putting on women's clothing.  ""I'm game for anything, after all that booze,"" Ed blurts out.  Whatever they paid Ed to appear in this movie wasn't enough.  Looking drunk, disoriented, disheveled, pale and bloated, Ed the transvestite was a very sorry sight to see.  As for Mr. and Mrs. Stone, they learned the error of their ways.  At the end of the movie, they decide to stop going to swinging parties, and start a family.  Thankfully, there was no sequel to ""The Sensuous Wife"" called ""The Sensuous Mother.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278K183H2GF81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6300987701#wasThisHelpful","R278K183H2GF81","A1WLZYEOIL1HLT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WLZYEOIL1HLT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album was released in December of 1967.  It's an album of cover versions, without any original instrumentals written by Bob Bogle, Nokie Edwards, or Don Wilson.  It starts out with the Ventures version of ""What Now My Love,"" which is similar to the version done by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.  ""To Sir, With Love"" and ""Sunny,"" with an organ backing the guitars and drums, are among the better instrumentals.  My favorite songs on the album are the rocking ""Music To Watch Girls By,"" and the funky (by Ventures standards) ""Uptight (Everything's Alright).""  ""Windy,"" a big hit for the Association, is another highlight of this album.  The last song is the Ventures version of the Beatles classic ""Yesterday.""

""Nutty,"" also known as ""Nut Rocker,"" is my favorite instrumental in this album.

"This album was released in January of 1963.  The album starts out strongly, with a great version of the classic instrumental ""Telstar.""  ""Apache"" is one of the best instrumentals the Ventures ever recorded, and would be right at home on any of their many greatest hits collections.  Part of the album has a Latin flavor to it, with the songs ""The Lonely Bull,"" ""Mexico,"" and ""Calcutta.""  In addition to ""Telstar,"" the instrumentals ""Green Onions,"" ""Red River Rock,"" and ""Last Night"" feature an organ.  Obviously, the instrumental ""Let There Be Drums"" features the late, great drummer Mel Taylor at his best.  The eclectic nature of the songs covered, plus the addition of an organ to supplement the guitars and drums, makes this a very versatile Ventures album.

"The album ""Twist With The Ventures"" was released in 1961, the same year that Chubby Checker had a #1 hit with ""The Twist,"" and a #8 hit with ""Let's Twist Again.""  The Ventures' versions of both of those songs appear on this album.  The album starts out strong with the rocking song ""Driving Guitars (Ventures Twist),"" which was written by Bob Bogle, Nokie Edwards, and Don Wilson.  It's one of the best original songs they ever wrote, and rightfully appears on the 29-song ""Walk Don't Run: The Best Of The Ventures"" collection.  In keeping with the twist theme, this album also includes the rocking tunes ""Guitar Twist,"" ""Opus Twist,"" and the classic ""Bumble Bee Twist.""  Starting out with a rocking drum solo, ""Moon Dawg"" would be right at home on a surf instrumental album.  ""Movin' And Groovin',"" written by Duane Eddy and Lee Hazlewood, is another highlight in a solid album that doesn't have a weak tune.  I would never classify the eclectic Ventures as a dance band, even though their next album, released in May of 1962, was ""The Ventures' Twist Party, Vol. 2.""

"Elvis Presley was inducted into the Army and, on September 22, 1958, sailed to Germany. Comprised of previous recordings, ""For LP Fans Only"" was released on February 6, 1959, while Elvis was still serving in the Army.  It included four classic songs that Elvis recorded at Sun Studios in 1954: ""That's All Right,"" ""Mystery Train,"" ""I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone,"" and ""You're A Heartbreaker.""  The song ""I Don't Care If The Sun Don't Shine,"" also recorded at Sun Studios, is included as a bonus track.

The song ""Let Me,"" taken from the 1956 ""Love Me Tender"" EP (Extended Play), is included as a bonus track.  Even though the songs were assembled from various recording sessions over a two-year period, thus combining early Elvis with Elvis in his prime, the resulting album works very well as a whole.

Dave Myers was a multi-instrumentalist who played electric guitar, steel guitar, tenor saxophone, trumpet, and bongos.  Their best known song is the classic ""Moment Of Truth,"" which appears on Rhino's ""Cowabunga! The Surf Box Set.""  Another great instrumental is ""Suferama,"" with the saxophone playing the lead melody.  The surf standard ""Church Key"" begins with a saxophone solo, before launching into the familiar melody.  ""Smokey Stomper"" is a rocked-up version of ""On Top Of Old Smokey"" that's guaranteed to get your toes tapping.  ""Aquavelva"" sounds otherworldly, with an icy reverb lead guitar.  That song would be right at home on ""The Ventures In Space"" album.  ""Surf Breaker"" rocks along like a giant wave crashing on shore, while ""Surfer's Theme"" slows the pace down.

This 32-song collection starts out with the classic hit ""Let's Twist Again"" (#8 in 1961).  Chubby Checker recorded a novelty song in which he imitated Fats Domino, the Coasters, Elvis Presley, and the Chipmunks, singing portions of the song ""Mary Had A Little Lamb."" The single was called ""The Class,"" and it peaked at #38 in 1959.  That song is included in this collection.

I'd like to give a brief description of each song in this excellent album.""Goodnight Irene"" - It's a rocking version of the old standard, with a great Bobby Vee vocal.""Walk Right Back"" - This was a hit song for the Everly Brothers.

Bobby Vee does a rocking vocal that would do Roy proud.""This Is Where Friendship Ends"" - This song was written by Tom Leslie and Bobby Vee.  Some of the melody is reminiscent of ""My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean.""  The Ventures rock out in support of Bobby Vee's vocals.""Honeycomb"" - This was a hit song for Jimmie Rodgers, which Bobby Vee handles well.""Pretty Girls Everywhere"" - This rocking song, with a strong lead vocal by Bobby Vee, sounds like it came from an Elvis Presley movie.""Wild Night"" - This is a rocking Ventures instrumental, written by Bob Bogle, Nokie Edwards, and Don Wilson.""I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter"" - It's a rocking version of another old standard, with another great Bobby Vee vocal.""If I'm Right On Wrong"" - The Ventures rock out on this song, with Bobby Vee doing a Buddy Holly style vocal.

"This 12-song album starts out with the instrumental ""The Brass Are Comin',"" which uncharacteristically features a banjo.  ""Good Morning Mr. Sunshine,"" and ""Robbers And Cops,"" have memorable melodies.  The haunting ballad ""I'll Be Back"" is very moving, and a highlight of the album.  ""Moon River"" starts out with an arrangement that sounds like Nelson Riddle on a Frank Sinatra album, then segues into a classic Tijuana Brass arrangement.  The best song on the album is ""The Maltese Melody.""  It's a catchy, up-tempo tune, and was included in the 1987 collection, ""Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Classics, Volume 1.""  The familiar song ""Sunny"" starts slowly, with a brief Herb Alpert vocal, then segues into a fast instrumental for the rest of the song.  ""I'm An Old Cowhand"" is almost done as a novelty song, with the brass sounding at times like the moo of a cow!  The love song ""You Are My Life,"" which closes out the album, features a vocal by Herb Alpert, backed by more strings than brass.  Overall, this is a pleasant album, but not among Herb Alpert's best.  The album peaked at #30 in Billboard's album chart, and marked the end of an era.  After ""The Brass Are Comin'"" was released, Herb Alpert disbanded the Tijuana Brass.

"Gary Puckett possesses one of the greatest singing voices I've ever heard. Gary Puckett and the Union Gap achieved commercial and critical success with their first three albums, all of which were released in 1968.

"If you stop to think about it, it's pretty amazing that we humans can make meaning out of the collection of sound waves of spoken words we hear and the light of the written characters we see.Just how we create meaning from jumbles of sounds and characters is the focus of this book. The miraculous meaning-making process involves our brains creating embodied simulations--mental representations generated by using our perceptual and motor systems. As the author explains:""Shortly after the sound waves of spoken words hit our ears or the light of written characters hits our eyes, we engage our vision and motor systems to recreate the nonpresent visions and actions that are described...The sights and sounds, the actions, perhaps even the smells and tastes--you bring them to life through simulation. To do this, you pay close attention to the details of grammar and you simulate early and often. These simulations are based specifically on your individual cognitive style and on your personal history of experiences, siphoned through your language and your culture."" (pp. 223, 248)What this means (ha!) is that when we hear or read a sentence like ""The carpenter hammered the nail into the floor"" our brains actually use the same areas it does as if we were actually hammering that nail. (Interestingly, the brain activity is slightly different when that sentence is ""The carpenter put the nail on the floor."") It also means that who we are and what language we speak affect how we make meaning:  for example, hockey players use their premotor cortex to understand language about hockey actions in ways that non-hockey players do not, and Japanese speakers already have expectations about the shape of a mentioned object before they even come to the verb of a sentence. Not surprisingly, we all create slightly different meanings from the words we encounter; but surprisingly, we somehow manage to communicate with each other effectively enough!Without a doubt, the topics of this book are clearly conveyed, well researched, and pretty darn interesting. Be forewarned, however, that it's not a breezy, light read (if that's what you're looking for), and probably not well-suited for a general audience. But, if you are a language-lover/semantic-aficionado/meaning-seeker, you'll likely appreciate the book's effective presentation of the findings and implications of over two-hundred studies on language and meaning making.Whatever the case, after reading the book, you'll likely find new meaning in how you make meaning!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0LI1H7QACT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465028292#wasThisHelpful","RX0LI1H7QACT2","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The mind is a powerful thing. And, in ways that you might not even expect.Chris Berdik's _Mind Over Mind_ reveals the power that our (often hidden) expectations have over our actual experiences. This power goes way beyond the placebo effect. What we imagine will be true can actually effect the brain's neurochemical responses:""The brain has many ways to make good on our expectations, both good and bad. In response to a clinician's promise, the brain releases painkillers as strong as morphine. Anxiety short-circuits anticipation and the athlete's worst fears come true...simply looking powerful drops cortisol and raises testosterone as much as actually being in charge, and sometimes more. Time and again, the effects of expectations and assumptions mimic at least some of the changes triggered by more conventional means."" (pp. 201,180)(Whoa.)So, what can you expect by reading this book? The author shares his expectations:""The research in this book doesn't promise mind control or unlimited success or freedom from struggle and loss. Its greatest value may be to encourage us to stand back and challenge our assumptions from time to time. We might be bold enough to compare that pricey wine we've grown so attached to with a cheaper bottle in a blind taste test. We might question whether we truly are shy, or not great with numbers, or a poor public speaker. Maybe we'll try to walk a little taller or reinterpret our jitters before a test for extra motivation...Hopefully, through all this questioning, we will gradually build up more trust in ourselves...Even if we don't have all the answers, we can be a little less insistent on separating what we imagine and what's real."" (p. 230)This book, no doubt, can change the way you think about your thinking. Expect to be engaged, entertained, and even surprised when reading this book.

"The bad news is that we create much of our own emotional suffering. The good news is that we create much of our own emotional suffering. (That is, we can both giveth and taketh it away!)Phillip Moffitt's _Emotional Clarity to Chaos_ provides a compelling look at how we really do control how much we suffer--or don't. In a nutshell: needless suffering arises from our desire for things to be other than they are; peace of mind results when we can learn to accept things as they are. Describing this shift from emotional chaos to clarity, the author explains that:""This craving to hold on to what you like and to get rid of what you find difficult is both the source of suffering in life and the origin of violence against oneself. By practicing living with things as they are, you will discover that while life may not be less painful, your experience of it is immeasurably better. Also, fully accepting what is true in the moment is the only firm place to begin to make changes in your life."" (pp. 198-199)Similarly (and perhaps counter-intuitively), inner harmony is much more likely when we stop trying to wrestle with our uncomfortable states of mind:""Feelings of inadequacy, vulnerability, longing, or not having enough are an inevitable part of the human experience. You cannot stop them from arising, but you can stop such feelings from controlling your life by changing how you perceive them. If you refuse to identify with these feelings, disown them as being neither you nor yours, thus seeing them simply as emotional states of mind that come and go, you will discover that there is the possibility for some inner harmony even under difficult circumstances.""  (p. 195)Easier said than done, of course. But, this book really does provide a doable approach to learning how to ""live with the difficult."" Key steps include: detangling yourself from the belief that in order to be happy, things have to be a certain way; staying with your experience and not your (mis)-interpretation of it; basing your actions on your intentions and priorities (and not getting derailed by intense emotions and misguided thinking); and allowing yourself to feel loss and pain in order to fully embrace life. The book shows how making the shift from emotional chaos to clarity begins in the mind and ultimately extends to the heart._Emotional Clarity to Chaos_ serves as a strong testament to the insight that we who giveth our own suffering can also taketh it away!

"Think you are aware of your thinking? Think again!Although we may feel like we are conscious drivers of lives, our brains actually have a heavy reliance on the unconscious forces that steer it. The truth is, much of our thinking happens outside of our conscious awareness and control, and our subliminal programming affects all aspects of our lives--from how we perceive the world, self, and others to how we think, feel, behave, and remember.But, we can't fault our brains for this heavy subliminal reliance. If our brains actually took in all of the data we are bombarded with each moment, we'd be overwhelmed and overloaded. As the author of _Subliminal_ explains:""To ensure our smooth functioning in both the physical and the social world, nature has dictated that many processes of perception, memory, attention, learning, and judgment are delegated to brain structures outside conscious awareness...The truth is that our unconscious minds are active, purposeful, and independent. Hidden they may be, but their effects are anything but, for they play a critical role in shaping the way our conscious minds experience and respond to the world...Our subliminal minds take incomplete data, use context or other cues to complete the picture, make educated guesses, and produce a result that is sometimes accurate, sometimes not, but always convincing."" (pp. 18, 29, 152)The reality is that much of what we believe to be true, is actually false. (How's that for a brain challenge?) Our brains are not the computers we assume them to be, but instead creative distorters of reality:""We are not like computers that crunch data in a relatively straightforward manner and calculate results. Instead, our brains are made up of a collection of many modules that work in parallel, with complex interactions, most of which operate outside of our consciousness. As a consequence, the real reasons behind our judgments, feelings, and behaviors can surprise us...Our brains are not simply recording a taste or other experience, they are *creating* it...We believe that when we choose a laptop or a laundry detergent, plan a vacation, pick a stock, take a job, assess a sports car, make a friend, judge a stranger, and even fall in love, we understand the principal factors that influenced us. Very often nothing could be further from the truth. As a result, many of our most basic assumptions about ourselves, and society, are false."" (pp. 22, 25-26)To wrap our brains around the confusing two-tiered brain processes of the conscious and the unconscious, the author presents a great metaphor explaining how subliminal forces result in our brains acting less like truth-seeking scientists and more like conclusion-driven lawyers:""The human mind is designed to be both a scientist and an attorney, both a conscious seeker of objective truth and an unconscious, impassioned advocate for what we *want* to believe. Together these approaches create our worldview...As it turns out, the brain is a decent scientist but an absolutely *outstanding* lawyer. The result is that in the struggle to fashion a coherent, convincing view of ourselves and the rest of the world, it is the impassioned advocate that usually wins over the truth seeker...The unconscious mind is a master at using limited data to construct a version of the world that appears realistic and complete to its partner, the conscious mind."" (pp. 200-201)Appropriately enough, I found this book to be incredibly mind-blowing.  Not only is the content fascinating and engaging, but the author's writing is superb: just like the unconscious mind, he has quite the gift for synthesizing huge amounts of information into accessible and digestible slices. (But, unlike our unconscious minds, he does not distort reality!) Admittedly, I can't quite explain the reasons I chose this book from the many others on the shelf (now I realize there were a slew of subconscious processes that influenced my decision), but I can consciously stand behind my five-star recommendation for reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KC21Z17ZOAOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307472256#wasThisHelpful","R2KC21Z17ZOAOO","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Curious about how the unique emotional landscape of your brain determines who you are and how you live? Open to using the power of your mind to change your brain? Then, Richard Davidson's book _The Emotional Life of Your Brain_ will likely be some seriously satisfying brain food for you.Just as we each have a unique set of fingerprints, we also have a distinct Emotional Style composed of six dimensions. As the author explains:""Each of us is a color-wheel combination of the Resilience, Outlook, Social Intuition, Self-Awareness, Context, and Attention dimensions of Emotional Style, a unique blend that describes how you perceive the world and react to it, how you engage with others, and how you navigate the obstacle course of life...We have the power to live our lives and train our brains in ways that will shift where we fall on each of the six dimension of Emotional Style.""  (p. 225)The book provides a chapter-long self-assessment for determining your particular Emotional Style, but to get an idea where you fall on the spectrum of each of the six dimensions, here are a few questions to consider now (pp. 5-6):1. Resilience (Fast to Recover vs. Slow to Recover):Can you usually shake off setbacks, or do you suffer a meltdown?2. Outlook: (Negative vs. Positive):Do you tend toward cynicism and pessimism, struggling to see anything positive, or do you seldom let emotional clouds darken your sunny outlook on life and maintain a high level of energy and engagement even when things don't go your way?3. Social Intuition (Puzzled vs. Socially Intuitive):Are you puzzled by--even blind to--the outward indications of people's mental and emotional state, or can you read people's body language and tone of voice like a book?4. Self-Awareness (Self-Opaque vs. Self-Aware):Do you act and react without knowing why you do what you do, or are you aware of your own thoughts and feelings and attuned to the messages your body sends you?5. Sensitivity to Context (Tuned-Out vs. Tuned-In):Are you baffled when people tell you that your behavior is inappropriate, or are you able to pick up the conventional rules of social interaction?6. Attention (Unfocused vs. Focused):Do your thoughts flit from the task at hand, or can you screen out emotional and other distractions and stay focused?The premise of the book is that Emotional Style reflects specific neural activity patterns--the product of the brain's underlying connections, circuits, structure/function relationships, and neurochemistry--which can be modified:""Since the brain contains the physical underpinnings of Emotional Style, and since the brain can change in these fundamental ways, Emotional Style can change...Although Emotional Style is ordinarily quite stable over time, it can be altered by serendipitous experiences as well as by conscious, intentional effort at any point in life, through intentional cultivation of specific mental qualities or habits...You can modify your Emotional Style to improve your resilience, social intuition, sensitivity to your own internal emotional and psychological states, coping mechanisms, attention, and sense of well-being...Through mental training you can alter your patterns of brain activity and the very structure of your brain in a way that will change your Emotional Style and improve your life."" (pp. 10-11)The author provides compelling evidence demonstrating the power of the mind to change the brain. For example, he shares results of his own research (involving Buddhist monks meditating in MRI machines!) showing how the practice of mindfulness can actually retrain habits of mind by tapping into the neuroplasticity of the brain's connections, creating new ones, strengthening some old ones, and weakening others. Neuropsychologically speaking, practicing mindfulness-based stress reduction can increase circuit activity in the left prefrontal cortex (associated with a greater sense of well-being and contentment) and decrease amygdala activity (associated with emotional reactivity), allowing for shifts towards the Fast to Recover, Positive, Socially Intuitive, and Focused ends of the emotional spectrums. The book is full of other fascinating examples revealing how the neurological underpinnings of each dimension of Emotional Style determine the emotional life of the brain. In the final part of the book, the author provides specific how-to's for using mental practices and environmental changes to influence the patterns of your brain that underlie your personal Emotional Style.So, if you want to map out your own emotional landscape, and then tap into the power of your mind to change your brain--and ultimately improve your life--the decision to read _The Emotional Life of Your Brain_ is a no-brainer, so to speak.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQGGQWW4RLWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452298881#wasThisHelpful","R1MQGGQWW4RLWR","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you struggle with fears of not being good enough and feeling as if you are not who you ""should"" be, reading Brené Brown's _The Gifts of Imperfection_ may just be the perfect gift to give yourself.The heart-and-soul of Brené's approach to embracing ourselves (imperfections and all!) is the concept of wholehearted living: ""Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough. It's going to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn't change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of loving and belonging."" (p. 1)After looking at the common obstacles that get in the way of wholehearted living (mainly not talking about our all-too-human feelings of shame, fear, and vulnerability and falling prey to the dangerous myths of perfectionism), she presents her 10 Guideposts for living a more authentic life:1. Cultivating authenticity: Letting go of what people think2. Cultivating self-compassion: Letting go of perfectionism3. Cultivating a resilient spirit: Letting go of numbing and powerlessness4. Cultivating gratitude and joy: Letting go of scarcity and fear of the dark5. Cultivating intuition and trusting faith: Letting go of the need for certainty6. Cultivating creativity: Letting go of comparison7. Cultivating play and rest: Letting go of exhaustion as a status symbol and productivity as self-worth8. Cultivating calmness and stillness: Letting go of anxiety as a lifestyle9. Cultivating meaningful work: Letting go of self-doubt and ""supposed to""10. Cultivating laughter, song, and dance: Letting go of being cool and ""always in control""As a therapist helping others authentically embrace who they are (and as a human being who strives to do this daily myself), I highly recommend this book.

"What's the weather like in your brain?As Elaine Fox clearly demonstrates in _Rainy Brain, Sunny Brain_, our emotional climates and forecasts are deeply influenced by the unique neurological wiring of each of our brains:""The roots of our sunny brain are embedded deep in pleasure, the parts of our neural architecture that respond to rewards and the good things in life, while the roots of our rainy brain lie deep among the ancient brain structures that alert us to danger and threat--our fear brain. Tiny variations in how our pleasure brain and our fear brain react and how well this foment is kept under wraps by higher control centers of the brain lead to the emergence, over a lifetime, of a network of connections that make up our rainy brain and our sunny brain."" (p. xii)In others words, it is our unique set of brain circuits make us who we are and influence whether we tend towards a pessimistic or optimistic self- and world-view. Neurologically speaking, it's the interplay between the amygdala (the emotional brain), the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure-seeking brain), and the prefrontal cortex (the control center of the brain), which determines our attitudes and outlooks on life.As who we are is largely determined by our neurons and their connections deep within our brains, changing our mindscape at the neurological level can influence our psychological weather systems:""By changing the way our brain responds to challenges and joys, we can change the way we are...By modifying the checks and balances between our rainy brain and our sunny brain, we will see that we do not need to be resigned to a life of fearful avoidance, but instead we can take steps to change our outlook--and change our life...Practice in seeing or interpreting things in a particular way can lead to fundamental changes in the brain circuits underlying our affective mind...as our brain forms a habit of noticing the positive rather than the negative, the underlying brain circuits will gradually begin to change...By shifting our mindscape--the patterns of biases and distortions unique to us--we are able to shift the way we see the world."" (pp. xiv, 162, 177, 180)The book presents a refreshing approach for achieving a healthy emotional climate:""We need a responsive sunny brain that happily cohabits our mind-space with a healthy rainy brain...Both aspects of our affective mind are influenced by what life throws at us, our genetic makeup, and which genes are turned on and off by the experiences we have. Most importantly, the crucial biases of our quirks of mind that set our affective mind into solid foundations can be sculpted be mental training, whether it is through mindfulness-based techniques, cognitive bias modification techniques, drug treatments, or traditional talking therapies. Our mind is highly plastic, and the affective mind is no exception. While it's not necessarily easy to change, the possibility of shifting our fundamental affective mindset is always there."" (p. 199)The author does an amazing job of making neuroscience approachable, accessible and applicable, and showing how we can optimize the rainy and sunny qualities of our brains to experience the rainbows of our lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAWOZ6ERMH9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465019455#wasThisHelpful","R1SAWOZ6ERMH9V","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In addition to exploring, explaining, and validating the introvert's way (which really is way cool once you can fully appreciate it), it helps introverts ""calibrate our need for solitude with our need for human interaction."" (p. 70) And, to that end, the author offers some great affirmations (pp. 177-179):*Staying home is doing something.*My presence is a gift, not a requirement.*I like who I like.*Listening to bores is not my job.*Managing my energy is a favor to myself and everyone around me.*Saying no can be a kindness.*I can love other people and still not be responsible for their good time.*Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I have nothing to say.*Putting on my dog and pony show is optional.*A ringing phone is not a mandate.*I know what I need better than anyone else.*Other people's desire for me to participate is not more important than my desire not to participate.If you're an introvert, you'll likely feel understood, inspired, and deeply entertained by this book. The book's a breeze to read through--the only challenge might be finding a quiet spot in the noisy world where you can soak it all in.

"What recharges you: solitude or socializing? If you answered the former, you're likely an introvert; the later, an extrovert.In contrast to extroverts who thrive on external stimulation (Big parties! Fast rides! The more the merrier! The busier the better!), introverts buzz from within (endless ideas. complex thinking. intense feelings. deep connections.).For the introvert, Susan Cain's book _Quiet_ inspires endless nods, that's me's and a-ha's; for the extrovert, it provides a glimpse into the rich inner landscape that underlies introverts' more subtle personas. The first part of the book looks at how introverts have often been misunderstood, and how cultural ideals and environments have favored extroversion. The next part of the book presents a fascinating overview of the nature/nurture effects and neurobiology of introversion: The brain wiring of introverts differs from that of extroverts--a less active dopamine pathway helps explain why introverts are less motivated and stimulated by external rewards than extroverts...while at the same time often highly sensitive to and over-stimulated by environmental cues. (No surprise why introverts love alone time!) The final part of the book shows how introverts can love, live, and thrive in a world built for extroverts.A validation-fest for introverts, and a guidebook for those who (try best to) love them, _Quiet_ speaks loudly to the power of introversion!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUKX3HG46EFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307352153#wasThisHelpful","R3RUKX3HG46EFF","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you think about it, the existential realities of life are pretty harsh: life has no inherent meaning, purpose, or order...and the only certainty we can count on is death. It's not hard to see how we need some kind of psychological buffer to soften the existential blows.Enter magical thinking.In the words of author Matthew Hutson:""Magical thinking provides a sense of control. The value of an illusory sense of control is that it reduces anxiety and increases a feeling of agency, which can spur you to seize real control. Second, magical thinking provides meaning. There's meaning as in comprehension--understanding how things happen or how to do things--which allows for control. But there's also meaning as in a sense of purpose--grasping why things happen or why anything is worth doing. This is the stuff that gets you out of bed in the morning and lets you sleep at night... These habits of mind guide us through the world every day. In very basic ways they provide a sense of control, of purpose, of connection, and of meaning, and without them we couldn't function."" (pp. 239, 9)In other words, a spoonful (/neocortex-ful) of magical thinking helps the existential realities go down. And, as Matthew convincingly conveys, we all think magically--whether we believe it or not. He's divided the cerebral magic into seven (lucky number!) different forms: (1) imbuing essences into objects (your kid's blanky, your wedding ring, an autographed book);  (2) psychologically connecting symbols to their real-life counterparts (imagine the difference between throwing darts at a picture of your mother vs. a picture of Hitler); (3) engaging in superstitious rituals and harnessing luck through physical acts (avoiding walking under ladders, knocking on wood, wearing your lucky shirt); (4) believing we can control matter with our minds (prayer, transcendent thinking, sending lucky vibes through your TV as you boisterously cheer on your favorite team during the playoffs);  (5) denying our finiteness (try imagining the absolute abyss of your own death); (6) treating inanimate objects as conscious intentional ones (who hasn't yelled at their rebelliously slow computer or sworn at a traffic light that spitefully turned red?); (7) assigning meaning to random coincidences and natural events (everything happens for a reason, right?). So, even if you don't believe *in* magic, you do think *with* it.Speaking of magic--I experienced this book as being quite magical. From page one, I was under its spell. I found the content so fascinating, the writing so skillful, and the humor so right-up-my-alley (I may have even laughed out loud more than a few times while reading this book). And, the magic of this book continued long after I finished the book: its contents have had some serious staying power and have helped me refine the way I make peace with those existential realities.In the introduction of the book, Matthew shares his intent for writing this book:""I'm dissecting the sacred because the same magical thinking that leads to sentimentality, altruism, and self-efficacy can also lead to vilification, fatalism, irrational exuberance, or even depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis. By tearing down everything holy and pointing out the sand it was built on, I'm hoping we can learn how to build meaning back up in constructive ways. I don't want to eradicate magical thinking. I want to harness it."" (p. 4)In my opinion, he accomplished his mission. Magically so, even.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9FPZ90TO4KS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452298903#wasThisHelpful","R9FPZ90TO4KS8","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What would your life be like if anxiety wasn't calling the shots?What if you could be fully engaged in the present moment and not be stuck in the regrets of the past or swept away with the endless what-if's of the future? Imagine being able to accept the what-is's of the here-and-now, and finally have a life where you're free to do the things that bring you value, purpose, and meaning. What if you allowed yourself to sometimes fail, realizing that your sense of self is not dependent on desired outcomes, but on staying committed to what really matters to you?Kind of a nice concept, huh?Luckily, concept meets reality in Kelly Wilson and Troy Dufrene's _Things Might Go Terribly, Horribly, Wrong_.  Using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), the authors present a unique approach to dealing with anxiety (or any of the other ""problems of living"" we regularly face, for that matter). They explain that: ""Embracing life--all of life--is ultimately more rewarding than trying to weed out those experiences that we would rather avoid. The work we do in ACT is about finding a way to open up, to take it all in, to find the flexibility we need to work around obstacles in the world and inside our own heads that stand between us and what we want."" (p. 150)The ACT approach is (refreshingly) not your typical self-help approach of you-need-to-do-this-in-order-to-get-that. Instead, it's more of a self-determined process where you figure out what's getting in your way and then determine how to stay motivated while working around these life obstacles. This approach is based on the six key processes of ACT (present moment focus, defusion, acceptance, values, commitment, and self-as-context), which the authors present in such a fun and conversational way that you probably won't even realize they're communicating some pretty profound psychological stuff. They show how to use the ACT approach to ""remain connected to what's going on in your life right now, accepting both the sweet and the sad, holding lightly the stories about what's possible while turning your actions towards things that matter to you."" (p. 141)Sure, anxiety is a given. And, very likely things may indeed go terribly, horribly wrong. But, as the authors point out, it is possible to liberate yourself from the debilitating stronghold anxiety has had on your life: ""That anxious thoughts have had a limiting effect on your life for a long time is a fact, fixed in time and unchangeable. Whether they continue to box you in and block you from the things in your life that matter is still very much an open question. If you're the context in which your life unfolds, each new moment is an opportunity to set out on a course bound for richness, meaning, and purpose. Anxiety might lie along the way, but it doesn't need to be an insurmountable hurdle in getting you where you want to go."" (p. 145)So, you can have your anxiety and have your life too.

"Choice is a good thing, right?What says self-determination and autonomy more than our being able to walk into any grocery story and be offered the choice of (note: the following data were dutifully collected by the author during a trip to his local grocery store):  85 different crackers, 285 varieties of cookies (21 of which are chocolate-chip cookies), 13 different sport drinks, 65 box drinks, 75 types of teas and adult drinks, 95 different snack options, 61 varieties of sun protection, 80 different kinds of pain relievers, 40 toothpaste options, 150 lipsticks, 116 types of skin creams, 360 hair care options, 230 types of soup, 275 types of cereal, 22 varieties of frozen waffles, 55 salad bar items...feeling overwhelmed yet? And, that's just (a fraction of) the grocery store!Welcome to the paradox of choice. As the author so aptly summarizes:""When people have no choice, life is almost unbearable. As the number of available choices increases, as it has in our consumer culture, the autonomy, control, and liberation this variety brings are powerful and positive. But as the number of choices keeps growing, negative aspects of having a multitude of options begin to appear. As the number of choices grows further, the negatives escalate until we become overloaded. At this point, choice no longer liberates, but debilitates. It might even be said to tyrannize."" (p. 2)The book offers such a fascinating exploration of the confluence of factors leading to the ""dark side"" of choice:""Clearly, our experience of choice as a burden rather than a privilege is not a simple phenomenon. Rather it is the result of a complex interaction among many psychological processes that permeate our culture, including rising expectations, awareness of opportunity costs, aversion to trade-offs, adaptation, regret, self-blame, the tendency to engage in social comparisons, and maximizing."" (p. 217)But, there is hope! After exploring the factors that lead to choice overwhelm, the author offers steps we can take to help overcome the ""overload of choice"" (pp. 221-235):1. Choose when to choose2. Be a chooser, not a picker3. Satisfice more and maximize less4. Think about the opportunity costs of opportunity costs5. Make your decisions nonreversible6.

"Given the fact that we have to live with ourselves 24/7, it's not too surprising just how important self-compassion is to our quality of life. This gem of a book is certainly a testament to that.In the words of the author:""Self-compassion is a powerful way to achieve emotional well-being and contentment in our lives. By giving ourselves unconditional kindness and comfort while embracing the human experience, difficult as it is, we avoid destructive patterns of fear, negativity, and isolation. At the same time, self-compassion fosters positive mind states such as happiness and optimism. The nurturing quality of self-compassion allows us to flourish, to appreciate the beauty and richness of life, even in hard times."" (pp. 12-13)Still thinking that beating yourself up with self-criticism is more effective than comforting yourself with self-compassion, and that self-compassion is really just a form of self-pity or self-indulgence? Then, just take a look at some of the facts. In comparison to self-critical people, self-compassionate people:* Tend to be less anxious and depressed (p. 110)* Are significantly less likely to suppress unwanted thoughts and emotions (p. 117)* Have better emotional coping skills and are better able to deal with life challenges (p.123 )* Demonstrate less severe symptoms of PTSD (p. 124)* Are more self-accepting regardless of the degree of praise they get receive from others. [Those with high self-esteem (and low self-compassion), on the other hand, only thrive when the reviews are good, and may resort to evasive and counterproductive tactics when there's a possibility of facing any unpleasant truths about themselves.] (p. 155)* Have steadier and more constant feelings of self-worth and have less social comparison and need to retaliate perceived personal slights (p. 156)* Are more likely to have learning rather than performance goals are therefore more willing to take learning risks that foster learning and growth (p. 170)* Tend to be more authentic and autonomous in their lives (p. 173)* Are better able to create close, authentic, and mutually supportive friendships (p. 190)* Are more likely to be emotionally attuned to their children (p. 213)* Have happier and more satisfying romantic relationships (p. 229)* Experience more positive emotions in their lives--such as enthusiasm, interest, inspiration, and excitement (p. 255)* Are much more optimistic and more satisfied with their lives (p. 255)After exploring the three key components of self-compassion (self-kindness, common humanity, and present mindfulness), the author shares ways to gradually develop your ability to be more self-compassionate. But, if you're worried that you'll never be able to replace your self-critic with a more compassionate self, you might take comfort in her (appropriately compassionate) approach:""We don't need to be perfect to feel good about ourselves, and our lives don't need to be any certain way for us to be content. Every one of us has the capacity for resilience, growth, and happiness, simply by relating to our ever-arising experience with both compassion and appreciation. And if you feel you can't change, that it's too hard, that the countervailing forces of our culture are too strong, then have compassion for that feeling and start from there. Each new moment presents an opportunity for a radically different way of being. We can embrace both the joy and the sorrow of being human, and by doing so we can transform our lives."" (p. 283)As a therapist, I've often said that if I had to give one prescription to people, it would be self-compassion. I feel like this book is the metaphorical pill form of that prescription. (The author's poignant, accessible, and compelling writing style makes the dose easy-to-swallow and immediately effective!)  So, not surprisingly, I whole-heartedly recommend this book.It's true that wherever you go, there you are. And, being able to have self-compassion for yourself wherever you're at makes all the difference in life.Open this book, open your heart, open your life. It's the compassionate thing to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E13K84VDNU4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061733512#wasThisHelpful","R3E13K84VDNU4U","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You are the only one with you 24/7. You may need some help to guide you to accurate self-knowledge, but you are the one who ultimately knows what is good for you and what is not."" (pp. 154-155)This respectful tone nicely carries the valuable information and insight offered throughout the book.Her approach to trauma recovery revolves around these eight keys:Key One: Plot your course with mindfulnessKey Two: Begin with your epilogue...you made it!Key Three: Remembering is not requiredKey Four: Stop flashbacksKey Five: Reconcile forgiveness and shame (Forgive your limitations; Share your shame)Key Six: Take smaller steps for bigger leapsKey Seven: Get movingKey Eight: Make lemonadeIn addition to providing a clear approach for trauma recovery, the author also offers valuable advice to therapists for avoiding the most common therapeutic mistakes--and ensuring that the trauma recovery process itself is not traumatic (pp. 158-160):* Give ample time to Phase I (stabilizing) work.* Contain curiosity.* Learn to pare down step size.* Do not bypass current trauma to focus on past trauma.* Do not assume that what was helpful for you will be helpful for your clients.* Do not allow clients to push you to address memories with them prematurely, or to take any other steps you do not believe they (or you) are ready for.* Maintain continuity of care.* Do not forget to take care of yourself.The author shares her hopes for this book:""I have endeavored to fill this book with common sense and demystify the process of trauma recovery. I hope it significantly contributes to your supply of tools and confidence to manage and achieve your healing.""

"Ego. Denial. Fear. Ambition. Accommodation. Patience. Indulgence.Depending on how we use them, these ""big seven"" character traits can be our biggest assets--or our biggest liabilities. In the words of the author: ""The same traits that make you successful can be your downfall. That's the root of most crises and the point of this book."" (p. 9)In each chapter, the author presents how her ""POWER"" approach can be used to keep each of these traits in check: (p. 14):* Pinpoint the core trait: Identify which trait is in play.* Own it: Acknowledge that is can be both good and bad.* Work through it: Process the role it's played in your life.* Explore it: Consider how it could play out in the future.* Rein it in: Establish how to re-achieve balance and control.Exceptionally readable, this book is extremely well-written, organized, and engaging. The information in each chapter is presented as highly relevant crisis prevention topics including: signs suggesting the ego is not in check, common beliefs fueling denial, fear factors and management strategies, formulas for explosive ambition, guidelines for determining when accommodation is appropriate, factors underlying impatience, paths by which excessive indulgence can lead to a crisis, and the elements of an effective apology.Each chapter distills the essentials of managing the seven character traits to hopefully help you avoid crises. But, in the event that a crisis does happen, the author offers her guidelines on navigating it (pp. 255):1. Trust your gut.2. Know the facts--not what you *want* them to be but what they *are.*3. Never assume you know everything.4. The truth always comes out--it's only a question of when.5. Read the climate--know the landscape.6. Know where you want to end up.7.

"I ate this book up.It is, by far, one of the most compelling eating disorder narratives that I have ever read. (And, being an eating disorder therapist, I have read a lot!) An engaging, and seamlessly woven mother-daughter account of battling an eating disorder, the page-turning narratives effectively inform, warn, and inspire others in a similar fight.Both mother and daughter have powerful words that so clearly convey the chaos, confusion, and commitment inherent in eating disorder recovery. I'll let their words speak for themselves with some of the more poignant quotes from the book:---Daughter Taryn in describing her eating disorder: ""A part of me just wanted to be normal again, but another part just didn't want to let go. The bulimia gave me something to be proud of and made me feel better about myself; my tiny body was physical proof of my control and success, and everyone who saw me knew it. It comforted me when I had no one else and soothed my raging anxiety. I couldn't let go yet--maybe just a few more pounds and I would stop."" (pp. 161-162)---Mother Lorri describing her helplessness: ""It's hard to describe the helplessness you feel when you realize you child is in serious trouble and your mission is to do nothing. When your natural impulse screams intervention, and the experts you're paying tell you to take a backseat, it's almost too hard to bear. I began to feel like my legs were cut off as a parent. I couldn't react or discipline as I wanted to because it could impact her negatively during this sensitive time."" (p. 109)---Lorri on the unique torment a mother feels:""So often, parents, and especially mothers, see at least part of their role as the Happy Maker. We kiss the boo-boos; we fix things and make them better. We nurture, comfort, and do what we need to do to make our family happy. We nag, cajole, and encourage our kids to be the best they can be. When your child has an eating disorder, it is a special kind of torment for the mother, who cannot fix this and cannot make her child happy."" (pp. 220-221)---Lorri's learning to let go:""I wanted so much to just fix the problem, but it became excruciatingly frustrating because it wasn't my problem to fix. When I thought about it in those terms, I began to handle it differently. Her road included a giant eating disorder boulder to navigate, and by overcoming it, and figuring it all out, she would grow and enhance herself as a person...My road had a different boulder blocking the way. My boulder was that my beloved daughter had an eating disorder. Because of the challenges that particular obstacle presented me, I learned some of life's biggest lessons. As awful as that time period in my life was, I definitely grew and even gained some wisdom. That was one of the many lessons I eventually absorbed during our terrible eating disorder adventure. It may have been the hard way, but I learned to let go."" (p. 217)---Hard-earned advice to parents from Lorri:""As a parent, you must do the best that you can, find what you feel comfortable doing, and live with it, because you'll never know what magic trick will stop the disorder...In the end, it will be your daughter who decides to recover, or not to recover, for her own reasons."" (p. 219)---Lorri on knowing your limits:""It's important for loved ones to know that there is an absolute limit to what you can do to help. Until the affected person decides she wants to change, that recovery is now her idea; it's just not going to happen. Willing it to change won't make it happen, but you can continue to help and try to guide her toward the light through therapy and love. Until she or he wants it, however, and is willing to be truthful, honest, and hardworking, you can only accomplish so much."" (p. 221)---Lorri's ultimate learning in her daughter's eating disorder recovery: ""I had to let her go. And I had to accept that she has her journey, and I have mine."" (p. 224)Without hesitation, I recommend this book to parents, and anyone else, trying to keep their sanity, strength, and hope in the all-consuming fight against an eating disorder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIAQ34L0AW21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0757305946#wasThisHelpful","R3GIAQ34L0AW21","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A now-classic book, Mary Pipher's _Reviving Ophelia_ strived to convey the struggles of adolescent girls who were coming of age in ""a girl-poisoning culture."" However, 17-year-old Sara Shandler realized the best way to do this would be allow the girls to speak for themselves. Passionately engaged in her mission, Sara collected over 800 contributions from adolescent girls on a variety of topics including depression, eating disorders, substance use, self-harm, sexuality, relationships, religion, and death. Selecting the most poignant of these writings, Sara allowed the original voices of the Ophelias to finally be heard:""_Ophelia Speaks_ is intended to represent both side of our adolescence--our often austere reality as well as our self-affirming laughter. Adolescence has robbed us of some of our youthful giggles, but happiness still remains. Despite our struggles, we have faith in our future...I am hopeful that _Ophelia Speaks_ will raise a consciousness of adolescent girls' struggles."" (p. 280)Although the book was published in 1999, it still speaks quite loudly and continues to raise that consciousness. A great read for adults who want to better understand the inner struggles of adolescent girls--and for adolescent girls who want to know that they are not alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEP05GZ2KD65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060952970#wasThisHelpful","RKEP05GZ2KD65","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What factors make for good therapy? Is it the therapist's training, experience, expertise, and style; the client's circumstances, abilities, personality, and effort; the therapeutic relationship; or perhaps a combination of all of these factors (with a dash or two of luck thrown in there as well)?And, what factors determine whether the therapeutic effects endure once the therapy has ended?Author/psychoanalyst Louis Berger attempts to answer these questions in this book:""While most previous work has been centered on analyst or therapist reports, I will turn this around and devote a great deal of attention to what my former patients have to say about their therapy. Among other things, I was curious to see how their lives had gone after the conclusion of our work together: whether the progress they made endured, regressed, or expanded. I conducted an informal study of over thirty of these patients, asking them to describe what they remembered as being most helpful/therapeutic/curative in our work together...I also asked them to report what was not helpful, what they remembered as nontherapeutic.""(p. 6)I found the book to be an effective mix of first-person reflections from the patients and author, supplemented by the author's account of his own personal and professional development. It reads like a detective story that ultimately uncovers essential clues as to what makes for good therapy:""It is clear that the relationship between the patients and myself was at the heart of these successful outcomes, though it took different forms with each individual. Experiencing my attention and affection, admitting and repairing mistakes, catharsis, insight gained from collaboratively constructed interpretations, self-disclosure, humor, flexible fees, and openness to concomitant forms of treatment, all played their roles.""  (p. 100)The patients' own words also capture the essence of what therapy is all about. Here's an example:""Therapy is a wonderful, flawed, limited, potentially limitless process like life itself...it gives us wonderful tools to glimpse beneath the surface layer of our existence, to pause, to check ourselves, to understand our behavior, to grow from the insight and experience--and repeat them all again, hopefully with more understanding."" (p. 76)The book is a fun and fascinating read, providing perspectives from both sides of the couch. The writing is honest, straight-forward, and non-defensive (sorry, it's hard to take off my own therapist hat it seems), and offers helpful insights for therapy clients as well as all levels of clinicians.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GUUDA16SYGJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1412845750#wasThisHelpful","R3GUUDA16SYGJY","A226MYSFCQE6G6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226MYSFCQE6G6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**** Warnings ****This router is not for the faint of heart. It is a ""professional"" grade router at the price point of consumer grade router. You will have to manage each port and write your own firewall rules.This router does not do WIFI!!! You will need an WIFI access point if you want to replace a typical consumer grade router.This router has 5 ports but you can only make 3 ports act like a switch without some serious route-fu. If you need more switch ports, buy the 3-port Edgerouter Lite and a separate Gigabit Switch.Enough of the warnings... This is a fantastic router. I recently was able to get gigabit internet through my city public utilities. My old NETGEAR R6200 couldn't keep up. I was throttled at about 320Mbps down.

Thirty (!) years later and I work as a software developer at a tech startup where the dress code is ""we'd prefer you to wear clothes."" For the first 20 years of my career, I tended to wear whatever free t-shirts I got at the most recent conference. After a while, I noticed that I gravitated to t-shirts with the American Apparel.

However, as a ""light switch"" this thing is almost unusable. As I described below, it's not really a ""switch"". It looks like a normal rocker switch, but it's not. It's two momentary switches (one on top and one on the bottom). The switches have two modes depending on how long they are pressed. A short press on top restores the lights to the last brightness setting. A long press on top adjusts the brightness up. Conversely, a short press on the bottom turns off the lights and a long press decrease the brightness. Sounds good? It is if you are expecting this light switch to behave completely different from every other light switch you've ever encountered even though the ""user interface"" presents itself the same as every other light switch you've encountered.What typically happens to me, unless I stop myself in mid-light-turning-on, is I press the top of the switch and expect some sort of tactile feedback from the switch or visible feedback from the lights. Instead, I get no tactile feedback and the lights gradually ""fade"" up to the prior brightness. The result is I almost always hold down the switch, which is a ""long press"" and end up resetting the brightness. As soon as I realize that I did this, I let go of the switch which leaves the lights at a less-than-optimal brightness level.And that's what happens when I use the switch. When someone who doesn't expect the odd behavior tries to turn on the lights, they end up assuming the switch is broken.I can't believe I paid this much money for a switch that works worse than a 99-cent toggle.Original Review:I installed this switch in my office because I wanted to be able to control the lighting from my desk. In my office, I have six 9.5W LED fixtures from a local big-box hardware store. At full brightness, the LEDs are a little too bright. And I like to adjust the brightness depending on the time of day.I have two main gripes about the switch:1. It's not really a ""switch"". It's two momentary switches. If you hold down the top, the lights slowly come up in brightness. If you hold down the bottom, the lights slowly decrease in brightness. If you press the top very briefly (like tapping a keyboard key), the lights come on at the prior brightness. If you press the bottom very briefly, the lights turn off. This is great except that if you hold the top down even slightly longer, the switch thinks you are trying to adjust the brightness so you end up either resetting the lights to a very dim setting or you have to continue to hold the switch down to get the lights adjusted right. My wife constantly has trouble with this and keeps reseting my light levels.2. It buzzes. Other people have mentioned this problem. I thought that since I was using six LEDs drawing 57.5 watts, the buzzing wouldn't happen. Nope. It buzzes. It's not loud enough to hear from my desk, so I'll put up with it.I'm not sure if there is a better choice for a Z-Wave compatible dimmer switch. So I'll just live with this for a while...","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAWKJOZIEMQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LQFHN2#wasThisHelpful","R1EAWKJOZIEMQN","A2SL5IW096Z2BL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SL5IW096Z2BL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently put this drive in my desktop PC to replace a OCZ Technology 120GB Agility 3. My ""data"" drive is actually a pair of OCZ Technology 240GB Agility 3 drives in RAID0. Not only is this drive about 2X as fast as the 120GB OCZ, but it's close to 50% faster than the pair of drives in RAID0!The drive is a little thinner than the older OCZ drives so I suspect it fits in lower-profile laptops.

"I used to use a pair of 22"" Dell Monitors with my PC but decided to replace the PC with a 15"" Retina MacBook Pro. Since I prefer a regular keyboard and mouse when I'm working in one spot, I decided to try this notebook arm mount tray.

Once I got everything adjusted, I can drop the laptop, open, into the tray, and use the laptop display plus the other 22"" monitor.

"I got the FiiO E10 USB DAC mostly to keep my headphones at work plugged into the USB hub in my monitor... an ersatz docking station... I have two Dell 24"" monitors that I plug into my Apple MacBook Pro 15.4-Inch. The E10 is plugged into the second monitor USB connector which is daisy-chained off the first monitor which I plug into one USB port on the MacBook. OSX recognizes the E10 right away. Super easy!I did think about getting a simple USB sound card like the Turtle Beach Audio Advantage Amigo II but I liked the volume knob on the E10 and the reviews were pretty stellar. As soon as I hooked it up, I was blown away! I listen through Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones. The part that was most surprising was how quiet the E10 is. I can't hear any noise in the signal. A friend at the office saw it and gave it a try.

I put them in the dishwasher when we are done with them. They don't warp or disfigure from the heat. I use the top shelf and put them between the glasses so they don't get misplaced or full of water. When using them we have to run some hot water over them for a few seconds so we can pull out the pop. This doesn't cause the ice to melt faster it just releases it from the plastic.
