"This thing breaks ALOT!!!!. Normally, i wouldn't knock down too many stars for that, since it's 10 year olds playing on it, but, it's one of their big selling points.....you can dunk on this.These are rather small kids, and after just a few dunks with little to no pulling on the rim, the backboard cracks right up the middle.We are now on our 4th. Since they crack so quickly, within the return period we return it for exchange. I normally wouldn't do that, but I've seen how easily it breaks. So much emphasis on the rim, little emphasis on the backboard.par for the course with SKLZ products. After all of their overpriced training equipment, I'd assume they'd put more effort in to their toys.It's also extremely noisy. I guess that's just a given. I didn't knock a star for that.

"Quite possibly the best glasses I have put on my face.First, I'll just do a Costa overview.....they're the best active, outdoor, watersports sunglasses out there. When they say phrases like ""lens technology"", they mean it. I love another brand too. I won't say their name, but it rhymes with Schmaui Schmims. The Costa blow these out of the water (pun partially intended).These glasses though look amazing and fit so well. They're a very large fit. I have 3 other Costas. The Coba is a very big fit but these fit even large. The thing is, they fit sung on the ears so they stay in place.

"I want to love these, I really do. I agree with most of the 5 star reviews here. What they brag about is accurate. Probably the best sound you're going to get for $25 anywhere. I'd love to take the time to rag on the mass produced sheep-fed marketing of other brands.....I won't say their name but it rhymes with Schmeats and Schmose.....but I digress. I don't know if the wood is a marketing gimmick or if it lends itself to the great sound, but these do sound good. Very full sound for ear buds. Very little noise leak as well. I have no problems with comfort in the ear. They look great as well. The cloth is a nice touch, but that may be where the problem is.  The noise created from the wires is insanely loud. I work at a desk, and do not move a lot. If I move my face just slightly, it sounds like howling wind blowing in to the ear buds. It's the same concept of a string between two dixie cups.  Everything that is great about these is completely lost. I nearly dropped it to one-star, but I thought the other qualities shouldn't give it an F. I also considered a higher rating, thinking ""it's just one problem"". I then realized that one problem makes these almost unbearable to use. It's like having the most amazing sunglasses, with absolute clarity and perfect vision.......buuuuut they keep falling off your face. The product's great qualities are defeated by the one down side.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15T5HGUENPEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C30HUQ2#wasThisHelpful","R15T5HGUENPEJ","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"it takes a lot to get 5 stars for an album. Honestly, just a basic 5-star rating for music is difficult. There is no possible way to be objective.Overall, this album does two things. It reaches for a new sound, and then a few of them focus on the classic style of Zac Brown. These country songs will grow as live songs. There is also a fun song called Mango Tree on here. It is a good mix of island style with Big band. I'm a big fan of this one. I think it shows a good stretch of genre while still ""keeping it real"" (as much as I hate that phrase).  ""heavy is the head"" is a lot of fun. Even without Cornell on lyrics, it absolutely sounds like a remake of old 90's rock songs. It sound like a fun experiment in the studio. Nothing wrong with an artist wanting to try something different after so many years.I have no problems with the reach they are doing for the rock/grunge/alternative style. It is great. I've seen a few people complain that ""some of these songs sound like Kenny Chesney and Jimmy Buffet""......I'm surprised that they're surpised! (See ""toes, island song, where the boat leaves from, etc.). I don't understand how anyone can be shocked at the ""island"" sounds on this album, if they've listened to any other Zac Brown album.Typically I like an album that has a congruent feel to it, but I do enjoy the complexity and variation on this album. Some call it ""confused"". I see what they mean, but I call it potpourri.Now, as you can see, I'm happy with this album. i find it fun....but let's get to this first track, ""Beautiful Drug"". This song is so bad, that when I put this album on my digital devices, I left it off. As far as I'm concerned, it's not part of this album. It is absolute garbage. If you're a teeny bopper, or someone that just like club junk sounds, then this song is for you. The lyrics are sloppy and uninspired, there is massive auto tune, and simple electronic bass drops. This had to be written in studio, with no inspiration other than to have the producer have some fun with some new equipment. It is so bad, that I am nearly convinced that Zac Brown Band did this song sarcastically just to make fun of that genre of ""music"" (yes, I use quotes, because I have a hard time calling that stuff ""music""). I know I referenced music being ""subjective"" earlier, but this track isn't music. I really hope the band comes out and goes ""gotcha"", or at least, ""we just wanted to do something different just for the sake of something different"". I really hope this isn't a song to appeal to the mindless masses, or to get royalties on some tv show or advertisement.""Tomorrow Never Comes"" is very similar as well.  I didn't remove the song like I did ""beautiful drug"", because I do like how it opens, but it mixes in to this club, boy band junk.  You hear it coming too, at the second verse. You hear that basic boring drum beat, then you hear some banjo picking, and you're provided a little hope. After the first chorus though, forget it. It almost gets into this dubstep stuff and becomes a basic stadium chant.  It reminds me of Aviici's ""Wake Me Up"" . This guy with a computer brings in a soulful singer and a great guitarist, drags his mouse around a little and calls it his song. I enjoy  the acoustic version of Tomorrow Never Comes, I think.Overall, it's a great album. I like the variation, thus the name. Remove ""beautiful drug"", and I'd go 4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34P326DKA9K9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCKD3WK#wasThisHelpful","R34P326DKA9K9A","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I could give 5.5 stars I would.......but not for the reason you'd think. Basically, this thing works so good, it didn't fit the nozzle that comes out of the end of my dipstick, but I was still able to make it work with no problems. I'll explain.I have a 1987 or maybe 88 Mercruiser 165, Alpha One, 3.7 liter engine in my boat. Based on the maintenance book from the prior owner, the oil had not been changed since 2005. Based on the oil that came out, that seemed very true :)If you don't understand how this thing works, I'll try to explain. At the end of the hand pump is a screw-on nozzle, much like a female hose end. This screws on to the dip stick. Not all engines are the same, but it appears the Mercruisers and some others are threaded, possibly for this reason??? I don't know for sure....The problem is, there is also a small nozzle that sticks out of the top of those threads, so not only must you thread it around the area where the dip stick is, you must also have this nozzle fit inside the hole inside the pump. That is where my problem came in. The nozzle on the engine was bigger than the hole in the pump.Well, it appears to be brass, so I figured I'd just grind out the hole, make it fit the nozzle and then be able to get it to the threads.After 20 minutes of brass shavings everywhere, I didn't get it exact, and couldn't get it all the way down. I actually only got it on there a few millimeters, but it was on that nozzle so tight, I thought I'd try. It created a perfect vacuum anyway, and extracted the oil. It took very minimal effort, and you could feel the oil come up in to the tube as the pump got a little tighter.I do recommend wearing a glove for one hand, because you should be heating up your engine and oil before doing this....the pump does get hot with that hot oil coming through it.Once you get to the end, the pumping gets much lighter, but I thought I'd keep going. There were only a few drips, but I figured try a few more, and suddenly a much smaller stream comes out again. This tells me this pump really creates a vacuum and digs down deep. I extracted 5 quarts, plus what was in the filter. This only holds 5.5 quarts, so with oil loss, I'm quite sure I got all of it.Pretty impressive for an item that didn't even fit. Once I can fully grind out the hole to the correct size, I'm sure my next oil change will be even easier.Overall, very easy contraption, especially if it fits properly. The pump goes on the engine block where the dip stick is. Attach the included hose to the top of the pump. Put the hose in a bucket and start pumping. The oil flows within just a couple pumps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GW17BOVJOS6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O8F0SU#wasThisHelpful","R2GW17BOVJOS6S","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really don't get all the reviews. I've seen people say this before and I discounted it but ""these reviews have to be fake"".  I have speaker wire from radio shack that are better quality.  Normally, I wouldn't care about quality feel if it didn't impact its designed purpose, but the entire 5 pack had the same sound problem.  Just horrible hums and clicks anytime the wire is slightly bumped.  To check i used old cables of mine and they were perfect.  I also used a neighbor's. No problems. I then took these wires to the neighbor's and the same issues happened.  I guess I'm stuck with them.  They get one more chance at a small venue and then they go in the garbage. They are totally useless for their intended purpose. The fact that it is all 5 means a bad batch or just low quality.

"Let me first state, rating this ladder very difficult. As a multi-position ladder, you really have to rate each position.Most of your 5-star ratings seemed to have come from people who were buying this to be used as every BUT an extension ladder. I bought it so I could have an extension ladder, but have everything else I need as well. The extension ladder is really just a ""by-product"" and I do not believe it was its original intent.I cannot compare the ladder to the other big brands. I hear they are much sturdier as an extension. This one is not sturdy at all. We did not extend it all the way, just so we could test it (thanks to all the great reviews who advised me to test it first). We figured we would try it on grass first, as that provides the best grip. about halfway up the ladder you meet the first hinge. A couple more rungs up is the second ""hinge"", or where the extension portion extends from. These 2 sections tend to give quite a bit of bend or ""play"". If facing the wall, it is VERY sturdy left to right. Back and forth (to and away from wall) it is not. Once you reach the first hinge area, you're maybe 10 feet up in the air. No big worry there, but as you step up one more step, you feel a little more ""free"", and with a bending ladder like that, you do not feel safe, even with someone holding the bottom.For my needs, it really isn't a 5-star item, but I'm not reviewing it from that point of view. I hated docking that much because it is a great ladder. If you're complaining it is too heavy, then stay on the ground, it is not that heavy at all. Stick to kitchen stands made to reach on top of the fridge then. If you have difficulty lifting less than 50 lbs, you should hire someone to do things for you. Docking an item because it weighs precisely a advertised makes no sense.As far as the other positions, it is extremely sturdy and very versatile. The way it folds up is very portable as well. I would say if you weigh less than 200 lbs and feel comfortable at heights even with a little wobble ( I hear people who work building high rises have to deal with swaying and wind, so maybe they're ok), then this is a steal. Not being able to use this as an extension is what killed it for me. If I planned on using the other positions more often, I would definitely keep this thing.I do recommend laying it flat and extending it. The design isn't the same as most extension ladders.As an extension ladder, it is a 2 star item. Mostly for my needs and comfort level. I don't think an extension ladder should move as much as this thing does.For every other position it is a 4.5 star ladder. With that, I had to go with 3 stars, although I was inbetween that and a 4 star overall. The limitations in the extension portion were pretty detrimental.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQF19BRA097D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VYDHU#wasThisHelpful","R3AQF19BRA097D","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing had so many good reviews....not just by consumers, but on most of your major,respected electronics sites.I wanted to like it, and although it would take a lot for me to drop a big bluetooth speaker to 2 stars, this one was actually close. I continue to try out, compare and use these speakers to determine which one I like the most, and this one almost immediately went back in the box.It is loud. Sound carries, but it just not smooth. I have no idea how to explain it. There is no real depth and clarity to the music. Thus far I have used the Bose soundlinks, big jambox, the UE Boom, this boombox, CreativeROAR, and a few other off brands. This one reminded me more of the Big Jambox, just blaring and loud with no finesse. Like I said, it gets loud, and I like its portability. it is like an 80's dual tape deck. The bottom is rubberty and I did like that. No issues with connectvity. But, I'm not spending $200+ for a nice looking bluetooth speaker, I'd really like some effort put in to the sound. I really think I need to try out some of these Sony Models some of you are talking about.  ......After going through all of the trendy brands anyway. So far, out of the trendy models, the Creative ROAR is by far my favorite. This one might be right near the bottom with the Big Jambox.

"UPDATE 3/4/15(original review still down below) - Funny, I don't even recall reviewing this thing when I first got it. I returned it pretty quickly back then. Well, here I am, I bought it again. Why? Because I bought a boat and I don't feel like paying for a new marine radio with bluetooth and this speaker seems good for boating and I can pair it with another UE product, which will be nice while out anchored, floating and relaxing. As I mentioned before, I did like the sound of this speaker, fairly well, just some strange issues going on....but you can read those below in my original post. It seems this new one doesn't really have all of the same issues as I had mentioned in my original review. The sound doesn't seem to ""fade in and out"" as it did before. Still no impressive bass, but that's OK, shouldn't be expected really. Jack Johnson songs don't need a big ""drop"". haha!  It is still very obvious where the sound is coming from, but I think only a couple of higher end speakers really dominate in this aspect.  I am using the app more this time, and I really like those features.Here is why i really wanted to post a review (even though I forgot I already reviewed). I really just wanted to post some of my battery tests for others to check out, and for me to update for you. I also wanted to make sure everyone knows how easily one can take this speaker apart and replace the battery. I know Logitech says you cannot, but they provide ""battery disposal instructions"". It gets put back together just as easily. A replacement battery is easy to find. I really wish I could find a battery with much more capacity for it though.So here is my current battery test:I received the item at a 50% charge. I charged it to 100%. I did not measure how long this took, but it was less than an hour, or at about an hour. I used the stock cable and wall adapter into a standard wall outlet.The speaker is turned up to full volume. My Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet is the music source, also up full volume. I put the music on shuffle, so it has a variety of Live Joe Bonamassa albums, a live AC DC album, Cole Swindell album, live Black Crowes album, Zac Brown, Dave Matthews Band, live Led Zeppelin, live Queen, and some more recent pop music (just so you have an idea of what kind of music was played) I have the equalizer at the ""bass"" setting:- At exactly one hour at full volume, the charge went from 100% to 70%- At exactly 2 hours at full volume, the charge went from 70% to 50%  (even at full volume, this is a little frightening)-At exactly 3 hours at full volume, the charge went from 50% to 30% (clearly, the product only quotes multiple of 10)- within approximately another 40 minutes the battery was completely deadTotal battery life, if wanting full volume = 3.5 to 3.75 hours.We'll have to see what it takes to get this seemingly intentionally misleading ""15 hours of battery life"". Although some people do mention outstanding battery life at more ""bedroom, close range volumes"".  I put it at full blast on purpose obviously. I assumed a 15 hour advertised rating would get at least 6 hours on a charge at full blast. After it charges, I'll test again. For most of you, full volume will not be used often.Now, it's starting to feel like buying a top of the line computer that won't connect to the internet..... Greatly diminishes its value. At least for me. I realize, this is a ""YMMV"" situation, and some people don't require full volume. With it being on a boat, I certainly would. We'll see what happens with 50% and 25% tests coming soon.50% volume tests.  The lowest to highest volume is 15 clicks. So I lowered it 7 clicks. The rest of the set up was the same.Charged to 100%From 8:10 pm to 10:10 pm stayed at 100% charge11:10 pm was at 90%So maybe we do get to this 15 hour mark. 50% is great for a hotel room but not outdoors. I'm curious about how long it will go at 50%.  I'll bump it up a little tomorrow and see how it goes. Then eventually redo full-blast again.A few days later, i tried it at 75%. I knocked the volume down 4 clicks. We got right back up in to battery draining mode. My 50% test ended, because I think it may have lasted over 10 hours at the rate it was running. Once we got to 75% though, the battery started dropping much like it does at 100%.I think the moral of the story is this....if you want to use it indoors, buy it. If you want to use it outdoors or in very large rooms, look in to a Braven.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I won't spend too much time with a really lengthy review. I will just give you what I like what I didn't like and go from there.I like the shape, the build, all that good stuff. It is all very rubbery feeling, and I like that. It is packaged in what is akin to a bank teller tube. It is about as big around as a standard coffee mug and about a foot long. It stands up well on either end, and even lays on the side without rolling around too much. I actually found laying it on its buttons creates a different sound; a bit more depth. It is extremely loud, and has decent bass. Nothing that will hit hard. I have not yet tested about battery life or battery issues.(but see the update above now)Here is what I don't like. I like a smooth depth, that still has a lot of clarity in each instrument playing. This doesn't have that. I noticed several times, it was as if a certain instrument was missing for a second. When turned to full volume, it has a somewhat distorted sound. Almost like a child giving you a raspberry (I really have no way to explain that any better, haha).  I also noticed it was dropping bluetooth signal or something. Suddenly, it started playing from my phone's speaker. That may have been an issue with the phone as well, so no immediate blame there.I did notice my tablet seems to offer much better bluetooth quality sound....which I don't really understand how that is possible except for the built-in equalizer on the tablet vs. the phone.I like to test out the speakers with primarily rocking country music, as that seems to capture a lot of the sound spectrum from highs on the bluegrass style instruments, to the electric solos, and the typically baritone voices. I also like to test how far classical music will travel, and I like to toss on some ""old school"" 90's rap (sheesh, is 90's old school already) as it has a lot of dropping bass. It failed mostly in the dropping bass sounds of the 90's rap. It carries rather well, and is rather loud. As mentioned earlier, it seemed to miss a few instruments with a full country band playing, but it wasn't continuous. One thing I did not like, and I compare this to the Creative ROAR, is I knew precisely where the sound was coming from.  Yes, it was loud, yes it filled the room, but it was obvious it came from one location. The Creative Roar and the Bose soundlink series do seem to win in that fashion. I will say that overall, this is a great portable speaker. Thus far, I would only purchase the Creative ROAR over it. The higher end models, such as the UE boombox, Bose soundlink, Big Jambox aren't my favorites mostly because of personal tastes (the jambox is too ""blaring"", and that deep sound of the BOSE is too ""manufactured"" for my tastes). If this model was a bit cheaper, I think it may have done better, but at $200, I think $50 of it went towards packaging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3YOBNJ367I3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CM0XHOW#wasThisHelpful","R2A3YOBNJ367I3","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"07/29/2014 - We have used the tent once. We had room for a queen and a full air bed. 3 kids, 2 adults and still plenty of room for a cooler and walking around room. It did well, but it only drizzled that trip. We have had the tent set up in the yard the past 2 days for ""testing"" purposes. It has done well so far, except for one thing....the pole snapped on the rainfly awning. It was not that rough of a storm; not much wind but that ""great big ol' fat rain"". Coleman informed me that first, I had to purchase a new pole. I explained I just got this on 06/25/14. He then said that these are not made for inclement weather. I told him, ""I'll pretend you made that up and it is not true at all....you're trying to tell me, a tent, which is designed to protect campers from elements is not designed for inclement weather. Does coleman expect this used on sunny days only?"" he said he was sorry he worded that wrong ""coleman warrant doesn't cover inclement weather"" is what he meant. I told him I was pretty sure that was worse. He agreed to send a new pole kit, but the durability is in question about that pole at least. I do not think the other poles would hold the tent up well on a windy day. So far I'm only docking one star for having to drag customer service through what they SHOULD do, their warranty deficiency, and for lack of sturdiness thus far.I will update as time goes on. I really have a feeling more stars will come off.08/04/2014 update - After we removed the largest red extension pole, which holds up the main dome area, the elastic inside had detached itself. They sell kits for these, but after only a couple of uses and being handled appropriately, this shouldn't be happening. On another note, the tent held up well for 2 days. I make sure to stake things down properly, so that really does help. It rained a little bit, but wasn't too much of a storm and we had a lot of tree coverage, so not a downpour. Either way, everything stayed dry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJ3UA12ZZIU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W7BHJY#wasThisHelpful","R3PJ3UA12ZZIU9","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is really hard to review strings, as these are all personal preference for feel and even tone. Various combinations of guitars to amps, can also be impacted by adding a different string in to the mix. I like these on my les paul. I use the cobalts on the other electrics I have.  I use my les paul for more chord play than scale play, so these do well with that. But, that is just an opinion and is extremely subjective. 5 stars for me, may not be for you.

"Excellent price for such a minor upgrade. I have a couple high end guitars, but I am not a person that prides myself or takes assurance in products just because they're expensive. $$$ doesn't always translate to the best quality, although we're told to think that. So with my lower end guitars I've purchased lately, I put a little handy work in to them, and change a few parts, such as this for $17. These make a massive difference in my Epiphone Jumbo. The clarity, sustain and strength are easily noticeable, even to an amateur ear. These fit very well in the EJ200ce for anyone who may have that guitar and is looking. It has a very tight fit, which is needed, as the bridge plate will start to wear more and more in the holes. Someone complained about them being ""ugly"", but I just can't imagine what type of artistic impression one would try to make with a tiny bridge pin. I've seen the fancy natural bone pins, and I'm not sure you can tell a difference unless you know to look for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYHH0WWBJ1UH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018SWKRO#wasThisHelpful","R1KYHH0WWBJ1UH","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works fine, heats up. One star removed for the simplest thing, and maybe it is too picky; but, there is no light to know if it is on. We bought it and plugged it in, not ready to use it yet, just placing it somewhere. My fiance then goes to move it the next day and it was already hot, meaning it had already been on. Simple fix, if you really want to know if it is on, just cut off the switch and wire in one with a light. No big deal. That alone wouldn't reduce a star, but the color wasn't represented well. Ours is very green. The initial picture had a nice gray look to it. I just looked again and there is a 2nd picture which reveals its ""green-ness"". Again, not a big deal, but add those together, and it is worth a star.

"I really hate when people rate clothes purchased online based on the sizing, but I will say, this shirt was so incredibly slim that I nearly docked a star. If you knew how much I hated when people did that, you'd understand how small this was. But, I digress, and I will rate the shirt. The material is amazing. It feels much like an oxford-style dress shirt, but has a stretchy feel to it. It is really cool. If you order the tall, it is a very long shirt for those of us 6'4"" and above, I'm sure it will suffice. The colors on this shirt are much more ""minty"" and bright than in the picture, which I really liked. So, like I said, if you have prime and have free returns, get a couple sizes when you order, but be prepared for it to be rather slim. I honestly thought when I were to go back and check the tag that it was going to be 2 sizes smaller than I ordered, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this particular shirt I received was just cut wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCG3XS2RBWRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNNYVDS#wasThisHelpful","RSCG3XS2RBWRF","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, this thing seems fairly sturdy to me. Seems like decent quality, and as long as you take care of it, it should last. I bought mine for more of a decorative piece though, and I don't intend to let it sit outside a lot. The grill stays on the patio. With that said, I did buy it because the picture is green. I wanted a green one. I have had Amazon send me 2 now, and they are both black. Amazon has apologized and given me a credit of $10 to my account for the mistake.

"First like my title says, I was shocked at how good this cheap fake leather feels. It stands very sturdy. The added stylus holder is nice. The cut outs are sufficient. The pen is slightly tucked away but not bad. The swivel feature works well and props up nicely.The speaker cut outs do not harm sound.  I am listening on low volume now and going back and forth with no problems.  The button for the swivel is a little loose but I like that.

"What is good about it first....Currently I am typing on it, so it touch response is good. It doesnt mess up the Note touch feature. In contrast though the pen does stick a little more. But like someone else mentioned, you may not like feeling like you are writing on glass to begin with. Personally, I dont like writing on this screen protector. It feels too rubbery to me. I didnt mind writing on the glass. This removes the smoothness for sure.Another good then bad......It offers excellent glare reduction. In contrast though, it does fuzzy up the picture substantially.It is very thick which offers great scratch protection, but again reduces the smoothness when writing.Overall my initial gut feeling was disappointment but I realize its not so much a fault but a preference. The pprotection level and glare reduction is good, I just wish it wasnt so rubbery. I was going to do 4 stars even though I was slightly disappointed, but the fuzziness took away another star.

"First off, I would like to explain that this may be an ongoing review. I just bought this item last night, and being a person who understands electronics, I usually wait for my reviews. This time, I figured I would start the review, and then I can come back and edit. Therefore, you may see some updates or changes below.Second, don't let my initial 4-star rating fool you. I was torn on how to rate this product for the value of what you pay, or vs. other speakers. I decided to put this up against much larger bluetooth speakers, and I think it speaks volumes that a $40 item is 4-stars compared to $150 bluetooth portable speakers.I'm going to start with what most peopls call ""cons"", but I'm just going to note them as minor nuisances-The cord is only about 6 inches long....BUT...its your standard android type charger. Since I'm a Samsung Galaxy boy, myself, I have a ton of these cables. It is currently charging with an old LG cable I found-Some have mentioned a slight hum in the speaker. This is pretty common with most Bluetooth devices. This goes away when you start playing music. There have been some that said, ""once you hear the hum, you always hear the hum"". I purposely turned the music all the way down just to hear the hum. I listened to it at my desk for 5 minutes, and then played music again. I don't notice any hum, and I am TRYING to hear it.  So, although there is, in fact, a hum, I'm not noticing it when in use.-Its not a great bass machine, but again, is this really a con? Do people buy a prius to drag-race? Cannot really hold that against this machine, so again...that is why I said a ""minor nuisance"" (and that is a stretch)-The power switch is on the bottom-There is an extreeeeeemly loud series of beeps every time you turn it on. You know its coming, so you can try to shield it. Its still somewhat annoying, and not good for starting up in quiet places.  There may be a way around this, I just haven not figured it out.-The controls on the speaker itself are a little slow to respond, but honestly, who is going to use this? It is only a minor delay anyway. I just tested them to see what they were. I control everything from my phone.I tried this thing out approximately 10 times in Bed Bath and Beyond. I kept messing with their display and was rather disappointed that I couldn not try my own music on their display. So, that kept me from trying it at first. Plus, I am always concerned that the display model is set up differently and it just won't sound as good at home in larger rooms...which takes me to my pros, and what I love about this (so far)-The sound fills a room. Its not that massive BOSE sound, but its pretty close in how it fills a room. I listen to a lot of 90's acoustic rock and that stuff sounds incredible. Now, if you get to some of the newer club-rap type of music, there is not a lot of power, but it doesn't sound distorted either. Still sounds good, it just is not going to blow your hair back and rattle windows-I had the phone about 15 feet away from the device and it played beautifully. What is funny is Pandora played clearer than my recorded music...here is why that is a pro. Because, I realized a lot of my recorded music is garbage from the internet and typically poor recordings, which leads me to believe that this device really picks out the clarity of songs. Much like a good set of headphones might actually make some of my bad recording actually sound bad because the headphones are so clear.-The construction is very sturdy- (pending a battery test)- any standard charger that comes with most android phones can charge this.-line in that will work with non-USB devices-packaging is actually very nice. I will keep this for storage.If you are skeptical about buying this, just buy it from a place that has easy returns. Thus far, I have no desire to return it. As far as performance goes, it is a solid 5-star product for the price. Again, I gave it four stars only because its slightly not as powerful as some bigger, more expensive speakers. I realize that may not be a fair assessment, but, again, I think it speaks more to the product that I give it 4 stars in comparing it to the larger portable Bluetooth speakers. I think the only way I would have a problem with this speaker in the future, is if for some reason performance decreases, or I find that the battery lasts a very short amount of time.  I will update this, if needed, in the future. If you don't hear from me, that means its still doing well :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGFMKGZGRIOMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R6HUDK#wasThisHelpful","RGFMKGZGRIOMF","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For what these products are designed to do, it doesn't matter if you have the larger hit stick that is much more expensive or this one. They are both for hand-eye coordination, and the added length provides no additional assistance. In contrast, the red/shorter stick actually seems to have an advantage in that it is a bit stiffer and has a more dense feel when you hit it. This is great for younger hitters who are still developing wrist strength, as they have to swing through this with a slight bit of effor more than the larger stick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q61X6FXMR5EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004INP6HC#wasThisHelpful","R1Q61X6FXMR5EH","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Considering I think paying $20-35 for a case is absolute idiocy, this case gets five stars for its price in porportion to its quality.The inner piece is plastic and it comes in two pieces that snap together around the phone. The black part is rubber that covers the two pieces once snapped together. There is a small plastic kick-stand that comes out of the back, but is honestly a little flimsy, so you do have to be careful. Also, its not very wide, so the phone can teeter a little on it.Headphone jacks and the chargers that come with this phone fit perfectly. (Please note: I also have an LG charger that is much fatter on the end and does not fit through the cut-out holes).All of the opening in the case were accurately placed.Overall, the case is very sturdy, and is perfect for what a case needs to do.

"This case has a very interesting look to it and does not add a lot of bulk.Essentially it is a 2 piece item. What you can't see in the picture is the black part is just a rubber case. The white part is a piece of plastic that fits into an area that is molded out within the rubber casing.I actually like the rubber case, and may use it on its own.The Plastic piece has some difficulty fitting properly as it is not as pliable as the rubber part obviously. Some of the molded areas around the charging port and around the earspeaker area can be a litte difficult to fit perfectly when putting them on the phone.The biggest issue I have noticed is the charger.....if the charging wire has a big bulky end, it will NOT fit. I have an old LG wire that has a bulky end and I can't use it on this phone with this case on.Other than that, its a great case for a great price.

Second that cheap sticker isn't even placed properly. It not on evenly. Third its much bigger than shown. That may sound good but if you look it just overlaps on the yard markers. It doesn't center up nicely. Really makes it pathetic and trashy looking. Very little pride went into to ""decorating"" this. The picture online is a horrible misrepresentation of the logo.More bad - the bags aren't that nice red and blue that they picture. Nope. It's khaki and brown. Really goes well with the team colors......all those brown and light brown teams out there. Again, pathetically misrepresented in the picture.Unfortunately I didn't buy this just for a desk top cornhole board....think about it, you're buying it as a decoration. Therefore the construction isn't really important, what it looks like is. And poop colored bags, an uneven sticker, and a sticker overlapping the design of the boards really ruined this for me.Taking more pride in a product would make sense. I'm going to ask for it to be done as represented and if it cannot ill just return it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTH2B8OZZ5LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NHA7OO#wasThisHelpful","RKTH2B8OZZ5LK","A1M7N0QMDDXDZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M7N0QMDDXDZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I shopped for two years before buying this TV.  I have read all of the technical reviews and many of the ""way too technical"" reviews here on Amazon.  When spending this much money on a TV, I found that the things I really wanted to know were pretty basic: Does the unit perform well?  Does the unit look good?  Does the unit have the options that I need?That being said, I can honestly say that the answer to those three questions is: YESThe picture and colors are outstanding.  Breathtaking at times depending on the source being fed to it (Standard Definition, DVD vs BluRay, etc).  You will, in fact, watch older movies and TV that you have seen before and it will be like the first time you've ever seen them.  It's that good.  If you like old black and white in HD you will be blown away (like remastered Twilight Zone episodes)I don't stream things to my TV, but it has all of the streaming options that you could hope for.I don't use over the air or cable with my TV so I cannot attest to the performance with that type of signal... but I have found that anything sent to this TV looks amazing.3D on this TV is better (yes *better*) than the movie theater, and way better than the other LG 3D TV I have.  You can enjoy 3D effects from pretty much any viewing angle (unlike the older passive 3D models where you pretty much had to be right in front of it).  The 2D to 3D conversion works really good too (depending on the source... BluRay quality seems to be the best for conversion)The quality of the picture on this TV can be seen from pretty much any viewing angle.Black is BLACK on this set.  And I mean black as in absolutely no light or bleed-through of other colors.  It is mind blowing.Now for a few bad things: 1.  Hate the way the TV tilts back.  It's horrible.  I like to have my TV's at about 4 feet above the ground which makes viewing in a recliner easier... the tilt is extremely noticeable at this height (but not very noticeable at a lower height) 2.  No really good wall mounting options (especially for tilt and swivel).  3.  The settings for picture, etc for each mode are clunky to get to.  Why doesn't LG just have a ""settings"" button right on the remote?  In other words... adjusting the picture on the fly is kind of a pain.  4.  Text on the screen when hooked up to a PC is horrible (ghosting, pixelated, etc).  I have tried all different settings and can't clear it up.  I use a PC for 90% of my home entertainment system...so this is a problem for me that others might not ever have.  5.  The curve can be distracting.  It is hard to keep myself from looking at the curve when viewing... but the curve definitely helps reduce reflections on the screen.All in all... if those 5 ""bad"" things are all I can find wrong with this set, I believe I have made a good purchase.  I can live with all 5 of them (the worse, to me, being the backward ""tilt"").  I paid 2500$ for mine after waiting for a long time for the price to come down... I just couldn't wait any longer... and you shouldn't either.  If you are all about the home entertainment system, putting this baby at the center of it is something you really should do.  I don't think you will regret it.  I sure don't.  It has really enhanced the home entertainment experience for me, and I believe it will do the same for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OY6169ZWBXH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZER5GS#wasThisHelpful","R3OY6169ZWBXH1","AVP1NL6GYMVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVP1NL6GYMVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a great deal on this from Amazon in one of their sales.  I was skeptical... but now I'm a believer.  Light weight and oh so portable.  No cords to tie you down, no mixing oil and gas.  No mess, no fuss.  (Except for having to charge the battery now and then).This unit comes with two batteries.  I charged both of them fully with the included charger in anticipation of having to switch out batteries right away.  Much to my surprise after one hour of almost constant use I was still on the same battery.  And, it is still going strong.  I found that this unit will bog down a little in taller weeds and grass so I wouldn't recommend it for that.As for the base with the wheels... I did not use it.  It is certainly maneuverable, but it is really light weight plastic and you can see it bend every time you insert and remove the weeder from it (which is *extremely* easy to do).  I am assuming that eventually it would break.  I put the base in the ""nice to have"" but not needed category. On the other hand, if you are elderly or find it hard to hold something like this for any length of time, I can see a real benefit to using the base with the unit.  It adds stability and safety.Assembly is relatively easy and straightforward.  The hardest part to put on is the shield.  It has to snap into place and requires a little strength to do so.  Once you snap that in there is a screw that needs to be inserted to keep it there.  The other part that has to be ""assembled"" is the handle.  That requires a little strength too but most people won't have that much trouble.For the price I got this for I can't complain.  It's so nice to have a quieter (compared to gas!) and more convenient (no cords to drag around and ready to use at a moment's notice) method of trimming around my house and fence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJHN8QZXAZHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH4K548#wasThisHelpful","R2RJHN8QZXAZHR","AVP1NL6GYMVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVP1NL6GYMVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How did I ever live without one of these?  I have spent my life buying those little one gallon sprayers that you are constantly pumping and lugging around with you and refilling and refilling and refilling.This sprayer works great.  And I mean great.  It came with 3 different nozzle designs (one for kind of a mist, one for a wide spray pattern, and one for more of a stream).  The shoulder straps leave something to be desired, but are adequate for the home user (if I was a pro I would want more padding etc).  Being able to just pump the handle a few times and keep on spraying instead of stopping and pumping like a mad man (like with the above mentioned sprayer) is a godsend and allows you to make short work of large spraying projects.  The container has gallon and liter measurements on it so it is super easy to follow the instructions on whatever ingredient you are going to use.My only minor complaint... it is clunky (awkward). The handle on mine does not go to that upper most position as seen in the picture so it gets caught on doorways, etc. when carrying it.  The weight is not distributed evenly throughout the unit when empty so can really feel kind of like it's ""going everywhere"" while carrying it.  (if that makes sense).Other than that complaint the sprayer works like a charm.  A few pumps of the handle and you are spraying like a pro.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G20H25WNB05Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UEMJ3W#wasThisHelpful","R2G20H25WNB05Q","AVP1NL6GYMVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVP1NL6GYMVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why buy a wheelbarrow online?  Ha!  I have small vehicles, and it is pretty much impossible to buy an item like this unless I ask someone with a pickup to help me.  This wheelbarrow will arrive in 3 pieces.  The tub ships as is, the handles come wrapped together and the wheel and hardware come in a box.  It was relatively easy to put together with the included instructions and this seems to be a high quality wheel barrow.  It is a nice medium/large size.  The color is *not* bright red as the picture indicates.  It is more of a tan color.  The wheel is inflatable, and it handles beautifully.  This is a metal wheelbarrow, and in my experience they will last for many many years as long as they are not kept outside.

"I suffer from a rare neurological disorder that affects my central nervous system. It causes so much pain, head to toe but especially in my legs, feet, back, sciatic area...I've been through a lot of muscle creams, salves, lotions... anything to try to get some relief. When I first saw this up for review, I figured, why not? I was skeptical but always hopeful. I figured at least when I review, I don't have to pay full price and the worst that can happen is I'll waste a little time.I was really surprised. The arnica cream helped. It really penetrated and relieved the pressure in my back and sciatic joint. I obviously can't be 'fixed' but any relief I can get is well worth it.Then, the arnica cream became a real saving grace for me a few weeks back. I fell on concrete. My butt took the blunt of my fall and I really fell hard and fast. I had no time to even try to catch myself. I hurt all over and the dogs, who did not intend to cause it, ended up getting me with the linked chain of his tie-out. He didn't like the neighbors puppy running over to me so he chased him... both went around me. Which also meant that the chain not only knocked my legs out from under me, but it also took skin off my ankle and scuffed and heavily bruised my right calf.I used the arnica cream, even though it says for the back.I was in so much pain. I was bruised and swollen.  I rubbed in the creme, except on the open wounds and it helped. I was feeling better and it was helping the bruising. I was surprised. Since my disease,  I bruise real easily and they normally stay forever. But, the creme helped that, too.I spoke with the seller and she explained that the creme is really good for bruising because it draws the bad blood away, allowing the new, oxygenated blood to return to the area.I also learned many other options for the creme that people have reported great results with, like carpal tunnel syndrome. I'm going to have my Mom and Sister try it and see if they can get some relief.I am happy I didn't give up on trying to find help for pain. The arnica creme has been a blessing. I'm very thankful for getting to review it and in exchange for a honest, unbiased review. I'm a fan and, if it works as they say for carpal tunnel syndrome, my Mom, Sister and other sufferers will be just as relieved, I'm sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTTBJF9ZQCAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT5IORS#wasThisHelpful","R1FTTBJF9ZQCAA","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first experience with a Bluetooth transmitter and receiver. I'm not always real savvy on some of the tech items out there these days. I'm sometimes a little behind on times. HaI have come to really like Bluetooth and use it quite often. I love the wireless audio music streaming and that this one is pretty much compatible with any Bluetooth device. You can also use it to transfer music from your device to another, such as your car stereo.I like that it has an internal battery with about 12 hours of use so you don't have to mess with finding a way to plug it in, charge it... and try to keep your other devices charged as well.It connects and pairs quickly to any device.My favorite part is the sound quality. You'll get crystal clear sound without static or other interference.It's nice that it's so compact, too, so it's not in the way. I can take it anywhere and store it anywhere.Very impressive little gadget. It would be hard for me to use anything different since I started with what has to be the best. I cannot imagine anything performing better.I know my Son and some of my family will be trying to talk me out of this but, at least I know that it'll fit inside a Christmas stocking really well.I appreciate the opportunity to review this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair, honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HFKG425XDSNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TZXXY0#wasThisHelpful","R3HFKG425XDSNE","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This light may be compact but don't let it fool you. It is very bright due to the led bulbs and it's perfect for many occasions.If it's a strong work light you need, this will put out enough beam to see whatever you need and it's small enough to maneuver into little places but perfectly fine for larger areas as well.Broke down at night? Turn this to the emergency flasher and people will see it and know there is an issue long before they get close to you. It'd be nice if you're lost in the woods or need located or to show your location for any reason.It also has a handy flashlight for when you need lighting but not an excessive amount. Though it is very bright, it's not as bright as the entire wand being lit up.I love this light. I take it with me when I'm fishing or traveling. You never know when a moment will arise and you'll need the extra light, whether for yourself or someone else.

"These are such cute little teethers. When I saw them available for review, I had to have them. They even match my twin Grandson's nursery. It's in the sailor, sea... kind of theme. I just know the babies will love the colors and textures on these teethers.I like that these are made from FFA approved organic food grade silicone. They're phthalate, PVC and BPA free. I just love that they're machine washable. I like to keep babies and their environment as clean and clear of bacteria and allergens as possible. They come across enough as there is.I really like the size and shapes of the teethers. They are officially known as Orlando the Octopus, Aaron the Anchor and Sally the Seahorse. Cute names but the babies won't remember them.They're made to stimulate and massage the babies' gums while they're teething.  You can use them frozen to make for a harder chew or  leave them out to help with a more gentle bite.We all know the importance of helping baby teeth. It's a very painful experience for them and they don't understand what is happening. It's nice to have a company like Bebe by Me and their team of pediatricians working to ensure we have items available to make teething easier for our little ones.I received this item in exchange for a fair, honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6KDGNWFIT8CN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RYACG0#wasThisHelpful","R6KDGNWFIT8CN","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a cute and innovative bottle holder. It actually makes it easier for baby to hold their bottle because it doesn't have set handles that have to be used. If they can grab hold of it, they can hold it. It's really amazing how it's designed to hold the bottle. Really a great idea that advances babies independence quickly.The bottle holder is made of food-grade silicone. Is BPA, latex, lead and phthalate free so it's safe for baby and has passed FDA certification.The bottle holder is designed to be anti-drop and anti-explosion so no worries if dropped or thrown, it will protect the bottle and keep it in place.This baby bottle holder is recommended for 3 months and up which is perfect for me. I have beautiful, twin Grandsons that were born May 29th, so 3 months old today. Ha!It also means that's a good transitional stage for baby. 3 months seems to be the age where they begin holding their head up, trying to sit up and begin sleeping less because they may miss something.. Ha! It really makes since to have such an innovative item at that stage of babies life.Another thing I like about this bottle holder is that, without the bottle inserted, it can be used as a toy. It's a nice material for chewing of a teething baby. It's not super hard where it would cause pain, nor super soft where it would be ineffective.I'm really liking this bottle holder and plan to purchase a second one so I have one for each twin. The first one was provided at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair, honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQRZKZVU63QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z5QO8EI#wasThisHelpful","R1FQRZKZVU63QB","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge salad eater. Doesn't matter what time of year, I'm always game for a nice fresh cut salad. My favorite salads are late spring and early summer when all the vegetables and fruits are super fresh.My favorite salads to make are an excellent match to the sweet, rich and tangy flavor of this balsamic vinegar. They consist of a mix of lettuces... basically, any lettuce but iceberg. I like to add in fresh strawberries, green and black grapes, sunflower seeds, some type of nut or a combination of nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts...), seeds (sunflower, pumpkin...), fresh black cherry tomatoes, mandarin oranges, black olives, celery, broccoli florets, grilled chicken breast and/or cubed turkey or ham, shredded cheese, sometimes some small cubed cheese. It makes a big, heart, healthy, robust salad that will fill you up and fuel you up.After all that time and effort that is put into this salad, you can't just throw any old dressing on it. You need something that's going to enhance the flavors... make them come to life in your mouth.This balsamic vinegar from Modena, Italy is designed just for this type of salad, with it's combination of flavors and textures. I add in a touch of extra virgin olive oil to thin it out and give it just the right thickness and flavor for my preference. It still leaves texture, robust flavor and pulls every flavor out of the salad and brings to life the taste buds.When this balsamic vinegar was offered at a discount rate in exchange for my fair,, honest and unbiased opinions, I volunteered right away..It's amazing how much flavor they can get into a a bottle of cooked grapes and aged wine vinegar. So simple but yet nowhere near as simple as that sounds.It's recommended for use with not only salads, but meats, fish, fruit, ice cream, cheesecake and drinks. Now, I'm not sure about some of those. I do know that it's full of flavors, the aroma will draw you in and the flavor is one you'll never forget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IF66AXGNW5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PKGYC4#wasThisHelpful","R36IF66AXGNW5W","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cool idea with several benefits. I like that you can snap it to your bra or panties and it is completely concealed from pick pockets, purse grabbers or a fast hand sliding into your purse.I think it's most helpful when you're in crowded area. It gets so congested that, even when you're paying attention, it's not possible to pay enough attention. Our trip to the Bahamas would've been a perfect time for it. You get so distracted by the beauty, the hustle and bustle, crowded streets and shops, your enjoying the surroundings, taking pictures, shopping, talking to people...it really makes it hard to pay attention and, if they grab your purse, you'd never catch them. They would be gone, lost in the crowd in no time.I do find one drawback..that being how to access it. You can't just pull up your shirt or yank your pants down so it'd have to be either just in case money or you'd have to go to the restroom, retrieve money, pay for your things, return to the restroom and put it back.I still find it useful. Most of the time, my boyfriend pays so mine case would beore of emergency funds or for identification in case of a car accident or something.I'm sure, in time, I'll figure out better ways to use and access it.I still think it's useful and a good idea.

"I've wanted one of these for a very long time. My boyfriend travels a lot and has to stay in hotels so I figure... better safe than sorry,  right? One infestation and you're in a lot of trouble. Bye bye mattress and box springs, hello exterminator. Bed bugs are very hard to get rid of, especially without professional help. It's very well known that many infestations begin with a hotel stay and end with a house full of problems.My boyfriend is currently on a job in a small town. The job is about a year long and, being in a small town, he wasn't able to find an available rental. Now, he will have to spend the entire time on that job in a hotel.You can imagine how pleased I was when I saw this available for review at a discounted rate in exchange for a fair, honest and unbiased opinion. He has traveled for years so we're just lucky that, at some point, he didn't find a hotel with bedbugs. He generally stays in the pretty nice but not way expensive hotels but NONE are exempt from infestations.It's also nice that it protects against allergens and other pests. Plus, being waterproof, you don't have to worry about stains.Honestly, I didn't even realize they made the encasement. We've always had just waterproof mattress covers for our mattresses. Of course, to be effective, I guess you'd have to have it encasing the entire mattress.I really like the material for this encasement, too. It's very soft. It doesn't cause the bed to get overly hot like some doeither.I feel much better knowing that this is with him on this job and will be on all his future jobs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18D5IXEASY1D0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125ES8K2#wasThisHelpful","R18D5IXEASY1D0","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my very first duvet cover, although I've looked into buying them so many times, I just wasn't sure if I'd like it. Would it slide, the inside bunch up, have a thick seam or zipper that rubbed and irritated...? So many worries that I would always talk myself out of getting one.I love the color. It's such a pretty green with just a touch of a textured look. I like being able to use this over my old, worn out blankets and comforters instead if spending a fortune to replace them. I simply place the old one, or sometime two, inside this duvet cover, button it up and throw it on the bed.Instantly, the room is transformed into this luxurious and stylish look. It's a nice, warm color. The fabric is so soft and truly feels fantastic against your skin.The buttons are out of the way so there's no scratching or scraping against you.I was simply amazed at the quality of this duvet cover and there's no doubt in my mind that I will purchase more of them.

"Argan Oil is hands down my go to product for anything to do with my hair, skin and nails! Nothing works anywhere close to the healing powers of Argan Oil.I use it on my hair and scalp to add shine, body and make it silky smooth. A few drops and I have the hair and scalp of a child. Clean, clear and pure. It erases any damage from the sun, blow dryer, hair products and any abuses I've put it through. I usually use it several times a week and, at times, every day.It's fantastic on my skin. I do a lot of fishing, gardening and other outdoor activities so my skin gets dry and burned. It takes only minimal amounts to each area to correct the damage. My skin soaks it up and is visibly changed instantly. It helps with my dry nail beds and cuticles by rejuvenating them, softening them quickly.There's never an oily, sticky or any other type of after effects of it's use.

"Nothing is better than a great smelling home. I especially like it if I am outside or gone for a little while and return home to a lovely, clean scent that envelops my home. That's one of the joys of home... a true comfort.The ZAQ diffuser is just perfect for that. It can burn for hours with just water and a few drops of essential oils of your choice. I love light, fresh scents, citrusy scents and sugary sweet scents. I will, at times, purchase blended essential oils that fit a particular mood or holiday or sometimes an ailment. The diffuser will release it in a light mist that is usually barely seen but there's no doubt it's doing it's job.I love how stylish ZAQ diffusers are, too. They come in so many shapes and sizes. No matter your style or personality, you will find a diffuser that's just right for you. This particular diffuser has LED lighting and puts off a beautiful glow. And, in case you're wondering, it is BPA Free so you don't have to worry about any harmful chemicals being released into the air..Then, one of my other favorite features is the auto shutoff. You don't have to worry about leaving and not being able to remember whether you have left it going.

"Finally, a pair of kitchen shears that you can use as kitchen shears! I've had numerous pairs that were barely more than regular scissors and the handles would never last very long before breaking. It's beyond frustrating and a huge waste of money.Checkered Chef's Kitchen Scissors are nothing like any I've ever purchased. FINALLY!I can use them to cut anything. They're highly sharpened stainless steel blades will cut up a fresh fryer chicken in seconds, prepare seafood, even those touch shells on the King Crab legs, we can trim up ribs and cut them down with no problem, trim our steaks, cut through ham bones, cut and chop vegetables like they're bits of paper and then, if I wanted, I could cut up all my Amazon boxes and still have as sharp an edge as when I started. They're fantastic!I love the rubberized handles. I have such small hands so I generally end up with blisters trying to use other shears for cutting. That doesn't happened with Checkered Chef's.You won't believe the measures they've taken to make sure you can thoroughly clean and sanitize these scissors after each use. You must open the scissors completely to their full 90 degrees, at which time they will come completely apart for cleaning.I love that these are even more than fantastic kitchen scissors, they also come with ""bottle opener, fish scaler, knife and screwdriver"". Amazing! I am in awe of these scissors.I really like the color and how shiny the stainless steel is. It matches our kitchen very well and if all this is not enough, they also come with a magnetic sheath. I can put them on the side of the stove or fridge or our outdoor table we use for scaling and cutting up our fish. Anywhere metal.They're just amazing!

"I had never tried bluetooth headphones before these. I know it seems odd. I'm 45 years old, pretty tech savvy but just never tried them. Then, a couple weekends back my Nephew, his Wife, Son and his Mom, my oldest Sister, were here visiting and giving me a hand with a few things (I'm disabled), and he had forgotten his earphones. Fortunately, I had just got this set in to review.I pulled them out and told him, honest as I could, ""I can't figure them out. They look weird and I'm not sure what to do"".They didn't even laugh at me. Seems his wife isn't much of an earphone user so she wasn't real sure either. But, I was totally overlooking the main purpose of the earphones: BLUETOOTH! That's why they looked different and I couldn't figure them out. You don't need all the extra stuff with them. Just the ear pieces and a line to hold them together.Admittedly, I felt a bit stupid but I was so glad he was there to explain it to me. I do a lot of fishing and I wanted them to use at the river. Get in my own zone, me and nature and peaceful song...I probably would've set them aside, frustrated because I can't figure them out. Thing is, I have other bluetooth devices that I use: hands free one that I use voice commands for calls, messages, texting... while I drive. My speakers for shower or gardening. So, why the concept slipped my mind I do not know.Now, I've opened up this whole new world. I couldn't believe the clarity of the music and quality of each beat, the bass... So crisp and clear. I was even impressed that they included some fairly small ends so they fit in my ear comfortably, no slipping or falling out, even with the movement of trout fishing. That's really good and saying a lot. I even love the color.

"I'm quite fond of this set of tongs. Although they're different from most tongs that you see on the market, they're very useful.Admittedly, I don't use the ice tongs much but, when we do family gatherings, they'll really come in handy. Our family is nearly 30, that being just our immediate family so if we have friends and such, too, it's a full house. The ice tongs will come in real handy then.My favorite of the set is probably the pasta tongs. It's so hard to get a set that actually work right. I usually end up with a huge mess because they really don't hold on to pasta very well, especially the spaghetti noodles. These tongs are more versatile than just for pasta. I have used them with vegetables, some meats and other things.The salad tongs are great, too. I hate the two piece sets that you scoop with. They're really not that handy and, as with the pasta tongs, they don't always hold on to things. When I make salads, I love to add fruit, nuts, seeds and various vegetables with a variety of lettuces. These tongs will grab it all and hold it securely until you get it where it's going or if you're just trying to toss it all together. I've also used these for other purposes. As my photos show, I fixed a delicate dish with shrimp, broccoli and seasonings so I need a bit of a toss to it. The salad tongs worked perfectly.The stainless steel tells me that I have a high quality product that will hold up for a long time, all while being quite stylish in our stainless steel kitchen.I'm really thrilled with this set and very grateful to be part of a review group that finds these wonderful sellers who offer up top quality products in exchange for a fair, honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C5JD35EHBGI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ4PZB6#wasThisHelpful","R3C5JD35EHBGI8","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really was impressed by this grinder. For it to be so small, it really does the work of a larger one. I know the burr grinders are always best so I assume that is what has made the difference with this grinder, even though it's small.For years now, my boyfriend and I have purchased green coffee beans from various countries, our favorites mostly in South America. He will roast them to our preferable roast, then we have freshly roasted and ground coffee anytime we want it.Thing is, he travels a lot, sometimes gone for months, a year... It's really nice when he has some of the comforts of home or things that make time away better.He loves his coffee and, lets face it, most hotel coffee isn't that wonderful. He likes to be able to take some of his own roast with him. On long jobs, you don't want a lot of bulky items or tons of extras to travel with.That makes the Blissli grinder even better. You hardly notice you even have it. It's so small he can put it anywhere without it being a hassle. Small comfort of home but it helps him.That makes me happy.

"The key is in the copper. I heard it for years but you think there's no way that copper can make that kind of difference but it surely does.I have a very rare neurological disorder affecting my central nervous system. Causes me a lot of pain, frustration, aggravation, depression...MANY ISSUES.. to say the least.I first decided to try the calf compression sleeves because I have so many issues with my legs. They hurt constantly, the muscles have hypertonia... which basically means that they no longer relax and I've gotten to the point where I will try just about anything to get a moments relief.I will say upfront that I expected issues, not only because of the hypertonia, but because I've also lost flexibility in my ankles. Add to that the fact that my nerves are hypersensitive, I'm constantly in pain, etc...I did, in fact, have issues getting them on. But I had to see the end results. Would it help once I got them on, make it worse... and how long would I need to give it.Once I got them on, got my body settled down, the tremors stopped and could relax... I did notice help in some areas. It wasn't enough that I could keep them on or continue trying to use them. But, with my disease, it was to be expected.But, the great news is, my niece-in-law had started running a few months ago and constantly has shin splints. If you've ever had shin spints, you know they are very painful, uncomfortable and hard to get rid of. Knowing this, I asked if she would like to try the compression sleeves and see if they would relieve her shin splints.She was game for anything, too. She didn't want to give up running but needed some relief. I sent them home with her and she called me 2 days later, thrilled with how they were working. Her shin splints were nearly completely gone and she was feeling so much better. Since then, she's back to normal. Still running 3 and 4 days a week, always using the compression sleeves.

"I'm such a huge fan of these gloves. I no longer get burns and blisters from touching, bumping or grabbing something that's just a little, or sometimes, very HOT!I have most of my family using these gloves. They're loving them, too. They agree with me:  the gloves work better at protecting your hands from the stovetop, oven, grill, smoker... than any oven mitt or pot holder they've ever used.I know when I put them on, I can count on them and trust them to do a fantastic job.I must confess that the pink color was a big draw for me when it came to reviewing these gloves. My oldest Sister is a one year survivor of Breast Cancer so, when she came to visit, I pulled them out while we were fixing lunch for the kids and all. Of course, the pink always comes into the conversation, so I asked how she liked them, how effective they were in keeping the heat away... you know, having her help me review them. Ha! Then I gave them b to her. One more way to show cancer you may be there but we are keeping away the heat.I am very appreciative of this seller making the pink gloves available for review in exchange for a fair, honest and unbiased opinion.Thank you for  ""GOING PINK"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TSVQE6T6VN7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJXH380#wasThisHelpful","R3TSVQE6T6VN7R","A2JF1RJ1694WWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JF1RJ1694WWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Had to upgrade my modem and router to handle the increased speeds that Time Warner has made available to customers. This is connected to the upstairs desktop computer and was very easy to install. The speed went from about 30 MBps to around 100 MBps but that wasn't anywhere near what is available (between 200 to 300 MBps). So, I switched out my router as well and now the speed upstairs is over 200 MBps!!!! I am so happy with this upgrade! Nice sleek design and works beautifully. Couldn't ask for more! I have to add that the ability to switch from 2.4 GHz to 5.0 GHz is fantastic. We use the 2.4 upstairs where the actual router is located and the 5.0 GHz downstairs. This works really well for our needs. Very very happy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPP4H5YI9I7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CEVU#wasThisHelpful","R3UPP4H5YI9I7G","A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cable company upgraded internet speeds but my modem and router were three years old and couldn't handle the new speeds (up to 300 MBps). So, I decided to get this router to replace my 2012 Securifi Almond. This new router has dual band capability and tons of other upgrades. It was very easy to set up and the speed of the desktop computer that it is connected to is amazing (speed went from less than 30 MBps to over 200 MBps). Downstairs for my laptop it is a little different story. I was only less than 2.0 MBps which was RIDICULOUS! So I set up my old Securifi Almond as an extender. Well, with the new router I have the option of choosing three different internet accesses (2.4, 5.0 or the Almond). I tried the speeds on all three and the 5.0G is nearly 80 MBps while the extender is pretty useless (slow slow slow)! It's still not what it is upstairs but I am so much happier with this router and my new modem! Eventually I will figure out how to increase the speed downstairs but it's really a non-issue for now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FK2KIDE4VCKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0V2NQ8#wasThisHelpful","R3FK2KIDE4VCKG","A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are gorgeous logs. Top quality and exactly as described. However, we did not realize that our own fireplace logs are not removable and these logs, as a complete set, did not work for us. Since returning them involved a ridiculously high shipping cost on our end ($80), we decided to keep them. The manufacturer was as helpful as they could be and, to be fair, did offer to forego the 25% restocking fee but not the shipping. We would have had to pay the shipping to us and the return to them which is nearly as much as the entire cost of the logs! That is completely understandable on their part. Anyway, we decided to use a few of the smaller logs to enhance our existing display and we ended up with the look we were going for. So, all in all, it's a win. We did consider buying some individual logs to enhance our display but it would have cost us nearly $100 just for 2-3 logs.

These are PERFECT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23Z41DZMZTHRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N53YT1K#wasThisHelpful","R23Z41DZMZTHRN","A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THANK YOU CAROLINA GIRL! After reading your thorough and wonderful review, I ordered these jeans on your recommendation. They are PERFECT! I followed your advice on color and sizing and, again, THANK YOU! I absolutely love these jeans! They are gorgeous! So stylish, so well made, and spot on! They are so flattering and I love the details of the back pockets (and I usually like my jeans on the plainer side)! The fact that they are pull-ons is amazing because of the detail in the faux fly, the real front pockets, the back pockets (especially placement), the color and the cut. When I put these on, I was absolutely surprised at how perfect they are!I never heard of Jag jeans before but decided that waisted/zippered jeans were becoming too uncomfortable with my almost 62-year old midriff, so I ended up ordering Diane Gilman jeans that are similar to this (HSN)... NO NO NO! They had no details (pockets, fly, etc.) and they stretched at least an entire size after wearing them, plus they were boot leg and I prefer straight leg like the Jag ones. I returned all of them to HSN and went on Amazon to see if there were any alternative styles that are more like real jeans but pull on. And I found JAG and Caroline Girl's review. Five pairs of Jag jeans (3 long leg and 2 capri), I could not be happier! I will be ordering more and will probably never go back to the regular style of jeans with zippers/waistlines! LOVE LOVE LOVE!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TT25HHT8TSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPW8JCO#wasThisHelpful","R35TT25HHT8TSQ","A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carolina Girl did an incredibly informative review on Jag jeans and, as a result, I ended up buying FIVE PAIRS OF THIS BRAND OF JEANS! OMG! I had tried the HSN - DG2 stretch jeans that she just came out with and they are nothing compared to Jag! DG2 stretched while wearing them and lost their shape. Awful and I ended returning them. Based on Carolina Girl's great review of various pairs and the sizing, I ended up buying Peri in a light/worn and another in a darker color, plus the Phoenix style she suggested that I will review on that post as well. I'm between a 10 and 12 (have to lose a few pounds) and 5.6"" so these fit PERFECTLY! No hemming or anything! While they were a little snug to pull up over my hips, once they were up all the way... WOW! You would never ever know these are pull-ons with the pockets and fly details, plus the jean material is spot on! I cannot imagine wearing regular zipper waisted jeans again! I bought two pairs of the capri style (indigo and white) and they are fantastic! I honestly have found the perfect jeans!Now, I am sitting here with a pair on and the waistline is pretty high, and rolls a bit when I sit but that's fine. When I stand up they go back in place. I notice also that they loosen up just a bit from wearing them which is perfect. I like my fit rather snug so having them stretch out just a tiny bit is just fine since it creates the look I am looking for. I am almost 62 years old and do not like ""old lady"" clothes, especially jeans! However, my midriff is a problem and I hate the way regular jeans feel (constricting). If I buy them to fit the waistline, they are too big everywhere else. Additionally, the Jag jeans make your butt look really good and hide any panty lines. These are extremely well made and the fabric on all five pair of jeans is excellent, as well as the detail. I AM BEYOND THRILLED WITH THESE JEANS!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23Z8LE9YBSBWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8CJCKA#wasThisHelpful","R23Z8LE9YBSBWU","A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XQENKF1Z3HMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookWhat Donna Grant has done with this series of series is nothing short of spectacular. She had a concept and allowed it to grow without damaging the original idea. Book 7 in her Dark Kings Series dances the line between touching base with the history of the series and introducing some new concepts (more on that in a later review). And of course she does it brilliantly.Thorn is considered the ""Bad Boy"" of the Dragon Kings. He's spent his entire waking life walking just a wee bit on the wild side. What few know and even fewer remember is that Thorn takes all that intensity into everything he does even his promise to care for humans, especially his promise to care for humans. When that promise was shattered, Thorn felt he betrayed the trust put in him and walled up his emotions. It's taken centuries but one human woman who refuses to fall for the Dark Fae has sent Thorn tumbling and that wall.. yep it came a tumbling down.Lexi watched her best friend leave the bar one night, she was worried and followed her. Only to discover too late that she was dead. That the ""men"" she went with were truly evil and probably not men. It seems Lexi is one of the few who not only sees through the glamour but can fight off the lust that the Dark Fae exude. It makes her an even more tempting morsel but that doesn't faze her, nope, she is determined to avenge her friend and takes it upon herself to fight the Dark... not that she has a clue what they are. One dark night, the Dark turned on her and if not for an incredibly sexy man.. she'd be dead. Forced to accept his help, Lexi has to learn the hard way that he is way more than just the sexy hunk next door.Passion Ignites, moves the battle between the Dark Fae and the Dragons into full scale. Lines have been crossed and the Kings are in for the battle to end all battles. Choices have to made and bonds are tested.Con.. Now here's a character that still stumps me. What's his secret? What's he up to? Can he be so lost in being THE Dragon King that he has forgotten to bend? Will winning the war mean loosing Con? Just a thoughtRhi.. Now Rhi has some serious issues to deal with. Her darkness is growing but so is her light. Can she continue walking the tightrope or must she finally make a choice. Will her Dragon King ever step up and be the lover she needs and deserves? I am starting to really dislike this particular Dragon King, not that I have any idea who it is. I know it's not Con, good lord it better not be Con that would be horrid at this point. I do hope it's a King we've at least heard of before.. I mean we have to be able to love to hate him or something. Also, the fact that as much as Rhi is fighting her inner demons, she knows that the light Fae MUST step into the battle. Their world is also at risk.Ulric... Come on who doesn't love this guy? Seriously? I think he's one of the best written characters out there. He is alone has been for so very long, wants his revenge but I think he wants his ""family"" back more. Sure he's angry, justifiably so but I think when push comes to shove he's going to be the one thing that turns the battle for the Dark Kings.. again, just my opinion..There is more.. oh so much more, this book was stuffed with nuances and foreshadowing.. hints of new characters as well as things to come. I wait for each of these books with an almost child like intensity.. I really want to discover what comes next.Just a great series.. and Passion Ignites totally set my world aflame!ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Passion Ignites, provided by netgalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HIO9EBAUUF9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250071941#wasThisHelpful","R2HIO9EBAUUF9D","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookOver the Years we have watched Jacquelyn Frank craft a wonderful world of Demons and Vampires, Lycanthropes and Mistrals, Wraiths and Bodywalkers. Twelve Species of supernatural beings that had been at times at war, at times at peace. For the past few generations due to a curse before their memory, the twelve beings had been divided. Unaware that the others even existed. Six and Six.. They were the Nightwalkers. Finally they have all found a way to be together, to bring an end to the curse, all because of one man, once an enemy..Kaman is a political refuge. Once second only to the ruler of the Templars (the evil bodywalkers) a division of the bodywalkers that believed it was their right to take over another's body and rule it. He has released an evil god that wants to destroy them all. Finally he has come to his senses. He knows the Templars' way is wrong and he has promised to serve the politics as best he can. Trusted? No way, but he has to try.Genevive is a pariah amongst the wraiths, she is an abomination, half human and half wraith. Because of her humanity she has failed in being a wraith, she is abhorred, an embarrassment to her family. All she wants, really wants is to find a place where she can belong. When the powerful bodywalker, Kaman, finds her she is thrilled to have a purpose. To bring the wraiths into the battle on the side of the Nightwalkers. A purpose and worth.. finally. Only the further along she gets with Kaman, the more she realizes that it's not just a purpose and worth she is looking for, she dreams of the man.Kaman and Genvieve together are working on uniting the Nightwalkers, bringing them all together is the only way to beat Atep. Only the wraiths at best are sneaky at worst, they are minions of Atep. Can they convince the wraiths to commit? Can they convince the Nightwalkers to believe? They both are fighting their own personal demons and have discovered that together they might actually succeed.Ms. Frank, kind of threw in the kitchen sink on this book. I enjoyed it but I felt like she just wanted to get it all done. Like ok, I ran out of ideas but I really, really need to end this series.. That being said, it detracted from a really good storyline. Kaman's redemption has been an ongoing thing in the past few books and to find him in a place where he can actually be in love? To accept that he is loved? It's truly wonderful only those moments were stolen with the jumble of other information that was thrown in.There are species of Nightwalkers that we hadn't really even met yet and they came, then left for whatever reason. They fought in the great battle but I got the feeling that they were superfluous.. They had to be there to go with the over all arc but pffft... Now I could be wrong and Ms. Frank may be back with more Nightwalker stories, I hope so, but if not.. the arc itself has been finished. The Nightwalkers, reunited, more or less.. and the most recent great evil has been defeated.

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookDianne Duvall literally leaped unto my reading radar a few years ago. Since then I have loved her Immortal Guardians Series. I have coveted each and every book and have anxiously awaited the next. I received this book for review last summer, because of all the upheaval in my life.. I wasn't able to do it justice with a review until now.Now, I am going to RAVE.. This might just be my favorite book of this series to date. It has all the action of the first books with some of the mystery and a new truce of sorts with humans.. sorta.. then there is the interference of those who should know better.Teased enough??? Yeah, that's all the teasers you are gonna get from me. *grins*Ethan has spent the last 100 years fighting Vampires and being in ""love"" with another Immortal. Only she's fallen in love with someone else and now Ethan is feeling just a bit out of the loop. He isn't sure what to do with himself, well except fight those darn vamps.. Until one night he ends up in a clearing with a bunch of vamps and a crazy woman. Ok, so she's not crazy but she is just a little unusual.. and gorgeous. At least to Ethan.Heather Lane has psychic abilities. She knows things, she dreams them, she reads people. She is sensitive enough that she prefers living alone, in the woods. Fortunately for her, her father has enough pull to get her a job as a federal agent with great ""instincts"". No one really knows what she does or how she does it. For the last few months, she has been dreaming about a battle not far from her house, when she found the clearing she just knew she had to investigate. So one night she goes and it happens only she doesn't wake up this time, this time it's real. And the hunky hero who comes to the rescue... yeah he's real too.Just fabulous!!! Dianne brings these two together with passion and fury. And it never stops. I really did love it. Of course she never stops with just a simple romance and Shadows Strike is no different. She offers twists and turns that delight. Creating two characters that belong together, even almost accept that fact but the battle wages and they must find love within the war. Trying to figure out who they can trust and who they can't.Just a great book..

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyLet me start by saying I just adore this series. Shana Galen writes of love and redemption and not necessarily in that order. The Rogue You Know is Book Two in her Covenant Garden Series and she's talking about more than the pleasure gardens. She is writing about one of the seediest parts of London.The Rogue in this instance is a man half in love with his childhood best friend. His best friend who turned out to be a missing lady.. when she gets her true life back and finds real, deep abiding love of her own (Marlowe from Earls Just Want to Have Fun). With Marlowe gone, Gideon finds himself at loose ends. Having made an enemy of the crime boss he needs an out. So he figures one last heist, if it's a big one, can buy his way out. He can become a different man. A man with a future. He doesn't expect his life to become complicated by a woman so far above him he couldn't even dream of touching her hem.. let alone her heart.Lady Susanna Derring is perfect.. to her mind perfectly boring. She's spent her life glittering in the ton, restricted by it's rules. Now she wants out. It's too much. Her family too demanding, her life too constricting. What she doesn't dream of, what she can't even begin to imagine is a life on the run with a criminal.This book was fun, intense and just excellent. Ms. Galen keeps us on our toes as these two are on the run. Never quite knowing who to trust or where to turn.

And since he is known for doing his duty, he knows he needs a wife. A perfectly proper, boring wife.. what he doesn't need is a woman known as the black widow. Young and beautiful and oh so mysterious.Jessie Kelham is too beautiful for her own good. She has been battered and betrayed, she has been tossed aside and run away.. Her life has been one crazy case of abuse after another. She thought she had finally found peace at the hands of an older husband who doted on her and their daughter, but his death brings back those who want to destroy her. She knows she needs a new husband, one she can control and one above reproach. What she doesn't need is the doctor who treated her when she ran from her first husband, her battered broken body leaving her almost unrecognizable.. But the heart wants what the heart wants.. and Jessie's heart wants Daniel.This was a subtle romance.

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyOnce upon a time... Seriously discovering Jess Michaels for me was like discovering a fantasy, a fairytale, ok a slightly erotic and oh so sexy one but the woman is gold. I first discovered her when she began writing about Those Notorious Flynns, a family that was true to who they are even when it became the main strain of a ducal family. Living always on the edge of ""polite"" society. They were happy. But fortune changes and suddenly they ARE polite society. Each of them found their loves and were very aware that true love doesn't always come in an expected manner.Now Ms. Michaels has moved on the Those oh so Wicked Woodleys.. The first book, A Marquis for Mary, married the Flynns to the Woodleys in a very definite manner. Forbidden is the story of a love that shouldn't be but can't be ignored.Jude Samson might be the grandson of a titled lord but he's just a lowly clerk. He has spent years as the secretary/estate manager for the Woodley Family. He has watched the younger siblings grow up and has become friends with the Marquis. They think of him as part of the family but he considers himself the hired help. It would be ok if he wasn't madly in love with the youngest sister, Audrey. He thinks he's beneath her and refuses to accept that there might just be a way for them. Until life offers up an opportunity that even he can't ignore.Lady Audrey is the youngest of a powerful clan. She has watched her family be destroyed first by the conniving first wife of her beloved eldest brother and then when her sister marries an unsavory sort and refuses to come home. Even when her life is obviously harsh. Audrey knows what bad choices in a marriage can do to a person and she knows, Jude will never marry her. But she's willing to ""learn"" what she can from him. To learn what it's like to be loved by a man she loves before having to face her family duty.In today's modern world such choices are unfathomable but Ms. Michaels makes Jude and Audrey's story into the love story it is, not just star crossed lovers but two people, individuals with dreams and goals of their own. And baggage, yep there are secrets that must be shared before there can ever be a Happily Ever After.Audrey and Jude are a push and pull couple without the angst and woe is me attitude that can happen in such a book. That's because Ms. Michaels has a deft hand with character development and it becomes a joy to watch them unravel the gordian knot that is their life.A true pleasure to read..ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Forbidden, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LAGQKK5XIY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515095460#wasThisHelpful","R19LAGQKK5XIY3","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookOne thing Joni Hahn does well is write a wonderful story. Agent N6: Dylan is book 6 in her D.I.R.E Series and it fulfills the promise of it's predecessors.The D.I.R.E Series began as a three book trilogy but it has taken on a life of it's own. And what a wonderful life.. It's part fantasy, part sci-fi and ALL action. The characters have dreams that contradict what they know is right. They have moral dilemmas and they have to accept that sometimes one has to take a leap of faith. In their case, those leaps can extend to the paste..Obviously by the name, this is Dylan's story. Dylan is a bit insecure and seriously doesn't believe he deserves a chance but the powers that be at D.I.R.E disagree.. Dylan is a bit different from the rest if D.I.R.E since he once was forced to work for Cyrus and now that he's free. He has one goal, to take him down or die trying. Seeing his chance with Cyrus' sexy New scientist, Dylan kidnaps her, sure she's as evil as the man she works for. But the more he gets to know her, the more he wants to be wrong.Geneticist, Teagan Hamilton wants nothing more than a healthy baby, trapped with a genetic disease she know if she can't figure out how to alter the DNA sequence, any child she has will be doomed to her half life. Accepting a job with Cyrus means she has access to state of the art labs and a chance. What she doesn't realize us that she just may have sold her soul to the devil.Getting kidnapped and landing in the muddle of the D.I.R.E. compound turns out to be the best thing that could possibly happen to her. Discovering that monsters really do exist and her boss is one of them was a hard pill to swallow. But falling in love with her kidnapper screams Stockholm Syndrome. It takes a trip to the past to help Reagan really adjust her priorities... but can she live with her choices?I just loved this story. It's fun, sexy and Dunbar. 's. Hahn never looses to focus on the fact that while there are many sci-fi aspects to her books, in the end it's all about the people.Totally another hit!ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Agent N6: Dylan, provided by the author for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E7FLX7XR2X1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSC94QQ#wasThisHelpful","R2E7FLX7XR2X1H","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasySon of No One is Book 25 in this near legendary series. But it's more than that it's book 3 in Ms. Kenyon's Lords of Avalon Series. One that intrigued me from the very beginning. A book that has been promised for quite some time but Sherrie found a way to combine her Lords of Avalon AND her Dark Hunters, YAY!! So didn't see that one coming.Josette Landry can't exactly be called the girl next door. She's something of a bad luck charlie and she's one of ""those"" deveraux.. except they are all gorgeous and classy and sure of themselves. Josette is so desperate for work (and self esteem) that she takes a job as a photographer for some cook ghost hunters. Only when one of the portraits swoops her into it, she realizes that maybe her friends and family aren't that crazy after all. And what she finds behind the picture is a man worth saving.Cadegan is trapped in a world where he must do good. He's angry, bitter and just wants to be free. When sexy Josette appears in his world he does all he can to return her to hers only he wants to go as well. Anything to get out of dodge. And to stay near a woman who dares him to risk his heart again.There are those who are confused about this book. Who are wondering what the heck? What they haven't realized (I'm sure they have by now) what they hadn't realized is that this book brings us some of the great heroes and villains from Ms. Kenyon's Lords of Avalon Series. It's something of a transitionary book and those are always questioned. People want to understand. What they fail to understand is that sometimes, it takes time. Time to fully integrate the book into the over all arc.I enjoyed this book BECAUSE of it's Avalon connection, the same thing that has so many confused. It might not have been her best in the series, not every book can be, but it was fun.If you're a DH lover and haven't yet read this book, do so. It will matter eventually.Shauni","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36ERTW8A2K3LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IM0I598#wasThisHelpful","R36ERTW8A2K3LB","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyEver wonder why a dragon is hanging out at Sanctuary? Yeah me too and in book 25 of her famed Dark Hunter Series, Sherilyn Kenyon tells us why.Back in New Orleans life is looking good. Fang and Aimee are about to become parents, Sanctuary has been rebuilt and the world seems slightly normal. You know normal for a group of Weres, Dark Hunters, gods and demons.. but then an enemy appears that none of them have ever seen before. A tribe of Arcadian AMAZONS, can it get any more interesting? Seems they are looking for Max. Max? The Dragon who hangs out in the attic? That Max?Max isn't just a dragon, he's THE dragon. The first dragon were, he should be royalty, instead he's considered the one Dragon everyone seems to want to kill. Well, he's Max to most people and The Dragonbane in legend only. He's perfectly happy hanging out in the Petier's attic. Helping out when needed but for the most part minding his own business. But when his mate appears, the mate who all but killed him several centuries (ok millennium) agp, Max finds himself drawn into her battles. It's either that or die.Seraphina was mated to an amazing man. A man who put her first, who cared for her, who gave up his ways for her. Only problem is, he's a Dragon. An animal first and foremost. And her first loyalty is to her tribe, the tribe that kills dragons. So Max comes second, every single time. With and act of betrayal so deep even Seraphina knows it's wrong, she looses him. Unknowingly she has lost her HEART and the father of her unborn children. But now? Those very children's lives are in danger and Seraphina finds that she has to betray him one more time. Only she won't. Not this time.Yes there were untold betrayals but they were not those deep, horrid ones we found in Archeron and Styxx. Max was betrayed by love and has to find a way to forgive and it's a story told beautifully as only Sherrie can do.What we have is a merging of story lines. Son of No One brought us the long awaited next book in Ms. Kenyon's Lords of Avalon Series, combining the two series but Dragonbane tells us what's going on. Ancient enemies start working together and the Hunters, all of them, have to band together. Only the Weres are still in fighting working harder on trying to destroy each other than the true enemy. Once again, it's the ""human"" aspect of the Weres that show the true evil. They spout self righteous vitriol but do their damnedest to destroy what should be honored.What can I say? Another most excellent book by the amazing Sherrilyn Kenyon.Shauni","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QU34MPH9SHA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250029945#wasThisHelpful","R3QU34MPH9SHA4","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookI can't remember when I fell in love with Erin Kellison's books. I just know that I have. But even I was surprised to fall in love with Tempted by Fire. I have been so immersed in her Reveler Series of late that I forgot that she writes other books.Tempted by Fire is book one in Ms. Kellison's Dragons of Bloodfire series and wow, what a book it is. It was intense, emotional, exciting, romantic and absolutely fabulous. I loved everything about it!Emerson Clark is bloodkin, whatever that means. She was raised in the foster system, the human foster system, and considers herself fully human. She really doesn't even believe in dragons. She just heard a distant relative say she was a dragon when she was very young and figured what the heck and put that on her SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATIONS. Oh man, she had no idea how her life would change. But it's been years and she is so fed up with the bloodkin and she is so quitting this job. Right after this last assignment.Dragon shifter Thane Ealdian is at the end of his cycle, he is ever closer to changing to dragon for the last time. Only the unsolved mystery of what happened to his wife and son has kept him alive. Now, finally, the bodies have been found and he refuses to allow his enemies of old claim them as his. He has demanded a mediator and is not so patiently waiting for him. Only the him turns out to be the oh so sexy Emerson Clark and well sparks are flying. Suddenly, Thane has a whole new lease on life. Now he just needs to convince her that yes dragons do EXIST and yes you are one. See, easy peasy..This was so much more than a boy meets girl story. Emerson has to discover her entire life. Who she is, what's her heritage and how she fits in. And Thane? Well he has his own surprises to deal with. Seems an old enemy might be innocent, maybe.. and old friend might be.. *grins* might be.. Nothing is as it seems and everywhere they turn is betrayal of belief at the very least. The only person they can rely on is Emerson's foster brother a wolf who's extremely unhappy with his pack and Thane's BEST FRIEND/servant...Just a wonderful story...

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookI am the first to say that Mary Morgan's, Order of the Dragon Knights Series is steeped in legend, has grand sweeping landscapes and epic lovestories.. It is a fantastic series that combines some of Scotland's known legends with sheer fantasy. It has time travel and Druids, Dashing Heroes in need of redemption and strong Heroines willing to believe in the impossible.The first two books Dragon Kinght's Sword and Dragon Knight's Medallion are beyond spectacular but book three, Dragon Knight's Axe was a bit of a miss. Don't get me wrong it was a very good book but it lacked the power of mythos.The legend continues and this time it's Alastair MacKay who is destined to find redemption in the arms of his destined mate, a woman from the future. Only this time there's a twist.. no I'm not telling you *grins*Fiona OQuinlan is a modern woman with her head in the past. Translating ancient texts is her greatest pleasure and she often gets lost in the wonder of it all. When a ""friend and co-worker"" steals her work and claims she hasn't done a thing, Fiona is tossed from her latest assignment and at a bit of a loss of what to do. Fortunately a temporary position on another dig came up and from there Fiona is literally transported to the past. Right into a slave auction. Only to be saved by a big ""beast"" of a man and feeling like she's gone from the fire to pan..Alastair MacKay has turned his life on his family and heritage. He's convinced that he has nothing to offer mankind and his legacy is nothing but a lost dream. He's a man of the earth but to further punish himself he forces himself to make his life at sea. When on land he's there for the shortest period possible. But one such stop changes the course of his life.Alastair is never quite sure of why he saved Fiona from the slave mart, he just knew he had to. He tried to turn away from her but there was something constantly pulling at him. And when he tried to return her to her family both of them were in for the surprise of a lifetime, or two!Watching Alastair and Fiona run as fast as they can away from each other only to keep finding the other in the same place was rather fun. While this was an emotional push and pull I wanted more Druids and Dragons.. And I am thinking I am being a bit rough because as I write this review I realize that there was so much going on behind the scenes. That the Druid dynamics are much subtler I have to rethink my initial claim on this book. It isn't as action packed as the first two, it's subtler, it's sneakier. And yet the relationship between Alastair and Fiona was strong and true.I loved that while Fiona fit perfectly in the past, she was always a modern woman with a mind of her own and Alastair had to prove himself to her not the other way around.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Dragon Knight's Axe, provided by the author for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23J5TB9AIDX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1509202005#wasThisHelpful","R23J5TB9AIDX7","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookDark Night is book two in Caris Roane's Amulet Series. In this series, Caris tips her hat to erotica and I promise, sex plays a huge part. It's important to understand that it is used as part of the story not GRATUITOUSLY but it's still used, a lot.Dark Night is a bit longer than Wicked Night and tells us a bit more about the Amulets and how they were created and how they can be used. It's also longer so there is room for more story telling.Master Vampire Eligio is pretty much on the prowl and rather horny. You would think any female would do but nope, he wants the witch Sol-Brenna but she's been keeping him at arm's length. But she just purchased and amulet on the black market and that's a big no-no. Eligio is willing to TRADE justice for sex all he has to do is get her to agree.Sol-Brenna is a powerful witch with a long family history. Her family is actually the one who crafted the amulet originally centuries ago. When she finds it for sale she knows it needs to be taken off the market. It's too dangerous. It is a healing amulet but the right witch can bathe it in her potions and turn it into a killing one. Her intentions are good but that darn vamp is on her trail and wants to barter. Sol-Brenna doesn't want a relationship with another Vampire but when these two get together things combust.. and no one is saying no.While this book has more to it than Wicked Night it still lacks Caris' usual deft hand. There is just not enough story well the story is there it's just missing something.As you know, I adore Caris Roane and while I am harsh on this particular series, it might just be that it's not my cup of tea. I seriously suggest you take the time to check it out because no matter my thoughts, there is no getting around the fact that Caris knows how to tell a story.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Dark Night, provided by the author for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVN3V0TEX0K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0GPEEE#wasThisHelpful","R2FVN3V0TEX0K0","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookPrimal Heat is Book 6 in A.C. Arthur's, The Shadow Shifters Series. I enjoyed it but felt like I was missing way too much. I am going to say right off the top, this book is really not a stand alone. Yes, you can read it as such, I did. Yes, it was good but it could have been great and I think, had I read books 1-5 first, I would have called this great.The Shadow Shifters have been in hiding for centuries but have recently come out of the shadows. They have lived by their rules but now have to live by a world that still isn't quite sure what to make of them. They have been targeted, there are those who would refuse to accept them as human but the Shifters want to SURVIVE in today's world.It's not bad enough that they have issues with the world at large, they have inner species politics as well. Rome is the leader of the Shadow Shifters in the US, a powerful shifter who is committed to saving his people.. Under him is a large contingency of officers and soldiers..Eli Preston is one of those soldiers. High ranking and loyal to the bone his past has lead him to believe that he will die young and without a mate. So when sexy Nivea becomes his trainee and partner he does everything he can to put her off.Nivea comes from a family that refuses to accept that they are shifters. Powerful people who have pushed her out on questionable circumstances. All she wants to do is serve her people at any cost. At any cost that is until she discovers her feeling for the aloof but gorgeous Eli.Eli was a bit of a jerk, so involved in what was best for him (and of course he was wrong) he pushed Nivea away on a regular basis. I would have smacked him upside the head and looked elsewhere. Oh wait she couldn't because he was her destined mate. Yeah why do characters have to put up with that crap?The overall arc of saving the Shadow Shifters was compelling, brutal and was what really sold this story. Which would have been great had I read the other books because as I said earlier, without that information I often felt lost and confused.All in all it was a good book, not a great romance, and really too much work. I might keep reading this series, maybe catch up on previous books, to see if that makes a difference. It's worth not shutting it down over one book.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Take Me, provided by netgalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20F7JSQZ2FUB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042933#wasThisHelpful","R20F7JSQZ2FUB2","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasySometimes if you are very very lucky you find this amazing gem of a book. Livia Blackburne's Daughter of Dusk is just that type of book. It is book two in her Midnight Thief Novels really really well worth the read. Yep, this is me gushing!Daughter of Dusk is most definitely a second book in the series, I don't suggest reading it as a stand alone. I did and totally enjoyed it but I knew all along that there was so much I was missing. Because of this it took me a while to actually get into the book and I often considered just not finishing it. Which would have been a shame because once I was able to completely immerse myself, I fell in love.This is one of those YA books that transcends age. It's fantasy at it's best. I would certainly rate this right along Cinda Williams Chima's, Seven Realms Series.. It has that wonderful ability to make the reader forget just what age the characters are. These are individuals written with depth of character, personality and incredible nuances.Daughter of Dusk begins with it's heroine Kyra, an orphan, having been raised in the streets until she is discovered by the head of the Assassins Guild. She has been scouted and they want her.. for a while that was wonderful but she discovers that she wants more. She also discovers that she is half of another species, for lack of better description a large cat species, but she doesn't want to be part of them and has been allowed to join the palace guards. That's your back story...The book begins with Kyra being allowed to be part of the guard but not really. More like a scout, they use her for her talents but will never allow her to belong. Again she's okay with that for a while, until she discovers that the leading council is so filled with rot that they need to be overthrown. Her boss, a decent enough man and member of the council, is trying to begin change from the inside but in the mean while people are dying and the elite are just that.. above the rules.Kyra also realizes that with the way things stand she can never be more than friends with the man she is falling in love with. He has been demoted from being a knight and now works with the guard. His demotion came because he dared to act on his convictions (again in book 1). But he is still a lord's son and there is no way they can ever be together...And if that's not enough..Kyra is slowly, very slowly beginning to accept what she is and realizes that she wants answers. Her questions lead to some pretty interesting discoveries. But because she is all areas she is uniquely positioned to bring them all together. A battle is coming and the City/State of Forge is on the line. Hard to believe that it's all in the hands of one outcast and her group of friends.JUST FABULOUS!!! I would seriously consider this a MUST READ book! And if you love YA or better yet are YA, then this book is for you!ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Daughter of Dusk, provided by netgalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q10FSTINMDD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484722086#wasThisHelpful","R3Q10FSTINMDD5","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyIn the 30th book of her Amazing Breeds Series, Lora Leigh shows us how it's done.How does a series keep going? Well you have to create interesting characters, strong heroes and then match them with the perfect heroine (or the other way around as the case may be). Then you have to have an ultimate evil and wrap that around an intriguing plot.There is even more than that, you have to keep the readers interested so you can't keep it the same. In Ms. Leigh's case she has several sub plots and mini arcs going on. Bengal's Quest ends this latest mini arc.. Maybe.. I mean Ms. Leigh could totally change things up and well there is still Judd's story so maybe not. But I am getting ahead of myself here..Four children raised in labs, two human girls too sick to survive without medical help and two Bengal Breeds. They formed a unit and survived inspite of the world around them. Then one girl was ""healed"" and sent home and things started changing. One Breed escaped and one remained behind to protect the last girl.. Only they were scheduled to be terminated and those two escaped, meeting up with the third girl and disappearing off the face of the earth. The last Bengal Boy tried to help them escape but was wounded and forced by those that love him to accept a transfusion only it changed him, way too young.It's been years and that lost Bengal Boy is a man bent on vengeance he wants his life back and his only goal is to kill those who forced this feral heat on him. Only it's not a feral heat, it's a mating heat, something no young child should have to endure..Cat was born a human, but was genetically altered into a Breed in an effort to save her from a childhood illness. For years she posed as Claire Martinez, hiding from the Genetic Council and the Breed who swore to kill her. Claires Native American spirit and family kept Cat safe until Claires father attacked her, revealing he is part of the Council. Now she has exposed herself as Cat, a Bengal Breed.Gideon has protected Cat since the moment she was placed in his arms as an infant, he was only a child himself but she mattered. Only tragedy hit and he lost his focus for a while, but Cat is back no longer hiding who she was and Gideon is now known as Graeme.. Maybe, just maybe they can finally have that life they deserve.Ok, this entire concept was a bit hokey for me. I enjoyed the characters and their finding their way back to each other but I did get lost at times with the Cat/Claire aspect. I understood it, it just detracted from the story a bit. Ok for me, a lot.I think this time Jonas came across as too much of a jerk and he left me cold. I have always liked Jonas but this time.. not so much.Even saying that, I enjoyed this book and it was well worth the read.Shauni","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UQ2Y5D3MB0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425265463#wasThisHelpful","R7UQ2Y5D3MB0B","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookExposing the Heiress just proves the case that if it walks like an author and talks like an author.then it's an author. Written by Jenifer Apodaca AKA Jennifer Lyon, author of my very beloved Wing Slayer Hunters, it explodes from the pages from the very beginning.Book three of her once a marine series it soars in it's very own way.Alyssa Brooks was the beloved daughter of a Hollywood icon, as a teenager she was driving the car that skid from the road and killed her mother. Living with the guilt she has done everything possible to be the brand of the family business. Helping her stepfather every way she could. Only when she finds out that her fiance is actually in cahoots with said stepfather, that it was all a scam she was infuriated and broke of the engagement. Only her fiance was more evil than she ever dreamed and he threatened the child she had given up for adoption. The child she loved so dearly that she wanted only for him to have a normal life. Either marry him or the child is in danger.. yeah right. Alyssa might feel guilty but she's not stupid. Turning to the Once a Marine Agency and asking for the one man she knows she can trust, Hunter Reece.Hunter Reece was raised in an artistic, peace loving family but no matter their personal beliefs each person was encouraged to follow his/her own path. Hunter's path led to the marines, where he became a decorated sniper. Only he got too good at it and realized that each kill was taking parts of his soul and it was time to get out or loose what little was left. Hampered by nightmares he sculpts for therapy but he makes his living at Once a Marine, an elite bodyguard service. When he is called in to guard former family friend Alyssa Brooks he is conflicted, furious that she turned her back on his family, worried about the threats against her and the worst part? He wants her..The thing about military suspense is it's a very ""in"" sub genre. It is easy to get lost among the others, fortunately for us Jennifer knows how to tell a story. It doesn't matter if it's PNR (Wing Slayer Hunters), Erotica (Plus One) or Military Suspense, it's not the genre it's the story. And what a story this was.Intense emotions flow between the pages of Exposing the Heiress. Watching Alyssa shed her guilt and become the woman her mother would have wanted her to be was a joy. Watching her fall in love with a strong man instead of allowing a weak one (her step father) to manipulate her or an evil one (her fiance) to try and control her was amazing. Watching Hunter walk through his nightmares into the light was equally stunning. Touching, intense, poignant and totally beautiful.What this book really shares is that you don't need gimics to tell a beautiful story you just need talent.. .Great Book.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Exposing the Heiress, provided by netgalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROE5MCATFBSWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM591MC#wasThisHelpful","ROE5MCATFBSWK","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyThe Earl Claims a Bride is book two in Amelia Grey's Heirs Club of Scoundrels Trilogy. It's simple, sweet and a traditional regency.

She fell in love with a soldier years ago and has promised herself to him. But when the Prince himself declares that she should marry Harrison Thornwick, the most recent Earl of Thornwick, it's kind of hard to resist. But she does... until she discovers that Harrison is a man worth getting to know and the man she loved might not be anything more than a childish dream.Harrison Thornwick was perfectly happy being the 4th son and totally unlikely to ever be the Earl but when his father, then brothers die he discovers he's up. Grieving for his family he is willing to muddle through but the Prince has plans for him. The Prince himself has declared that Harrison marry Miss Angelina Rule, a woman who defies all the rules.. Smitten but cautious, Harrison has to decide just what is important to him and how he is going to define his life.This was not a radical regency romance, it's a story about choices, about duty and honor, family and finally Love. Ms. Grey weaves a tale that brings these two together, creates a world where they belong and yet both still find themselves on the outside looking in. Never quite knowing their place until they are thrust into it.I enjoyed this book it tells a nice story but it lacked a depth and passion that a powerful romance can have. It's ok, this is a strong, sturdy romance that keeps readers coming back for more.I certainly recommend it.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of The Earl Claims a Bride, provided by netgalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33EQQJ9UU0ZW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S53XD1M#wasThisHelpful","R33EQQJ9UU0ZW6","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyA Lady's Guide to Skirting Scandal is a nice little place saver in Kelly Bowen's, Lords of Worth Series.. a sweet little novella that is designed to keep you reading, good news. It works.It's a story about getting a second chance, about finding redemption and maybe love.We first met Lady Viola Hextall in A Good Rogue is Hard to Find and she wasn't all that nice. Sure she was the sweet younger sister but this was a girl on a mission. Her mission? To land a Duke, no matter the consequences. She even tried to compromise her brother's best friend. A man who has been a friend to her as well for years. She didn't care, she wants that title. Well big brother has had enough and sends her off to America for a visit. Well chaperoned but still on her own. A bit of isolation might do her some good.Nathaniel Shaw wants to explore the interior of America. Since he is a doctor he is paying his way over by acting as ship's doctor. While on board he strikes up a rather interesting friendship with the ship's spoiled miss. Only he discovers that she is more than just a spoiled miss. She has a brain and amazingly enough wants to use it. Nathaniel is the type of man who finds a strong woman with a brain incredibly attractive, so of course this new and improved Viola is something special.Sure Viola is a self centered brat but she is kept that way by her family and the chaperons that were forced on her?? I would have pushed them overboard right off the bat. Her brother approved shipboard reading material but the women who were in charge of her tossed them all overboard. This aggravated me so much I almost couldn't finish.. BUT Viola came into her own.. and that was revenge enough.A short novella designed to keep our attention.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of A Lady's Guide to Skirting Scandal, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RVLE3WA78W14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J4H45Y#wasThisHelpful","R3RVLE3WA78W14","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyOne of the things I really enjoy about Harlequin is that they insist on sweet, charming stories. Oh sure they have different sub genres but in the end they are Harlequin and their brand always promises something heartwarming.Catherine Mann has written her Diamonds in the Rough Series and it fits Harlequin's demands. It is charming, sweet and heartwarming It's also sexy, sensual and at times sizzling.. Guess it's not your mama's Harlequin anymore.Jewelry designer Amie McNair was raised by her grandparents. Sure her parents were around but they were of the trust fund baby type and pretty much had their kids, expected them to be their little showcases or ignored them. Amie wanted more and has become a top notch jewelry designer for the family company. But her cousin stepped down as CEO and her grandmother appointed an outsider and Amie is so not thrilled about it. She's so stressed about the whole thing she has a sexy wallbanger in the coat closet.. bad enough but then she discovers he's the new CEO..OOOOPS..Preston Armstrong was looking forward to the chance at starting over and when he meets the eyes of a gorgeous woman his world literally stops turning. An amazing sexual experience makes him hope maybe there is something more. Only to discover that she's the granddaughter of the owners and she wants nothing more from him. How can he make her understand that while they can never have forever (he doesn't do forever) they can have something special right now.When granny sends Amie on a week's trip with Preston, representing the new brand to the business world. Amie knows it's a test, learn to work with Preston or consider getting a new job. Only it's about more than just working with Preston.. That one night had consequences and Amie has to figure out how to tell him.See traditional yet sizzling.. Ms. Mann has a knack. This is not a new trope, it's certainly not a new story. But Ms. Mann makes it fresh and exciting. She brings chemistry to her characters and as a reader I was invested in their relationship. Which means this book worked..ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Pregnant by the Cowboy CEO, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ILB54VVDATJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFSL7H4#wasThisHelpful","R1ILB54VVDATJG","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyI know, I have become a bit obsessed with Bull Rider Stories.. Especially Harlequin's. I just can't help myself they have become a bit of a guilty pleasure. And Cathy McDavid gives us a little gem in The Bull Rider's Son.Cassidy Beckett has dealt with a lot in this lifetime. Her parents fought constantly about his drinking and an accident caused the final split. Of course Cassidy was in the accident and insisted that her mom choose.. Him or her.. Ridden by guilt she has spent a lifetime pushing people away. So when she becomes a single parent and she and the father split she never told him. But things are changing. Her father has returned sober and the man she really loves is back. Nope not the father of her son, the uncle...Shane Westcott has recently discovered he was a father. After years on the Bull Rider Circuit he has had to give it up due to injury. Seems his ex has finally decided that he is grown up enough to know he has a daughter. Now his entire life has been about being the best Dad he can. Only his new job brings him close to Cassidy Beckett.. the girl he adored.. Only she has a son and he reminds her of someone. When he discovers who, let's just say he's a bit peeved for his brother. Seeing a parallel between their livesCathy McDavid writes a complicated story one that depends a lot on love and forgiveness. It's sometimes not that sweet Harlequin romance we are used to and that's ok because it's very emotionally packed.It also addresses an issue that is often ignored in this world. Father's Rights. You see Cassidy's point and understand her fears but you know she's wrong. She's struggling to keep her world straight and everything keeps tilting. Just like real life. Only the harder Cassidy holds on the faster things seem to slip away..This was very well written and while sometimes uncomfortable (I am a single mother after all) it is also a strong modern romance.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of The Bull Rider's Son, provided by netgalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YRC6JEX6M61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFQTNC2#wasThisHelpful","R9YRC6JEX6M61","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyThank you Mary Wine for returning us to an excellent medieval world. As a fan of medieval romance I thrive on books from that era. Unfortunately it's not an in genre right now and the publishers aren't pushing it. So it takes guts to listen to your characters and write the story that needs to be written.. And Mary Wine does it so very well.A Sword for His Lady is book 1 in Ms. Wine's Courtly Love Series so I am thrilled to say that there will be at least one more book after this that takes place in this genre.. YAY!!!Isabel of Camoys is a woman of her time. She was married young for land and station and it was a horrible marriage. Again, typical of their time. But she's widowed now and holding the keep she earned. But again, she is a woman and that means her keep will never really be her own. It seems her husband's family wants it back but even more importantly the king wants her married with a strong husband so he basically gave her and her home away in marriage. So, Isabel has a choice.. marry the king's choice or marry back into the family that she loathes.. seems a no brainer to me. But Isabel really wants to be free that is until she actually meets the man the king has chosen for her.Ramon de Segrave is the kings man, through and through. So when the king tells him he isn't going on the next crusade, instead he is to be landed and married, Ramon accepts, begrudgingly, but he accepts. Upon finding a home filled with loyalty, laughter and love, Ramon is intrigued. When he discovers that the woman of the keep has run the estate for years and it's healthy financially he is amazed. Upon meeting Isabel he is smitten. Now all he needs to do is convince her that he's the perfect man for her.This book was just swoonworthy.. Ramon is truly a knight in shining armor just what a fair maiden dreams of. But he's also earthy and intelligent and well worth falling for.One of the truly excellent things about this book was the fact that Isabel truly was a woman of her time. What most of us never realize is that the woman of the keep was so much more than the arm candy that she has been portrayed as. A well trained young woman of nobility from that time had to run entire businesses.. the farming, the tanning, the payroll, the servants, the infirmary, the... get the picture. She wasn't expected to be the ""little woman"" she was expected to run the estate and make her husband's life run as smoothly as possible. And when he was away on crusade or during some other battle, she was his voice. The middle ages in some ways were way more progressive than any of us realize.. Mary Wine brings so much of that to life in A Sword for His Lady because she also realized that while the woman did all of the work, the man really was needed for his strength and sword arm. Without a strong defense a keep could fall to political enemies or barbarians or... anyone who wanted it.Ms. Wine also did not make King Richard the Lion Hearted a sympathetic character. She made him the ""rock star"" that he was. A man with huge charisma and little love for his country. This was the man who is still revered in England yet managed to bankrupt his country and spent little of the eleven years that he was king actually in England..While doing all of this, Ms. Wine tells a beautiful romance. A Sword for His Lady is the kind of book that I used to adore. A fabulous historical novel laced with fact and fiction while telling a beautiful, sexy love story. So again, Thank You Ms. Wine.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of A Sword For His Lady, provided by netgalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CLK9GTAKIVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFZ0BYQ#wasThisHelpful","R13CLK9GTAKIVF","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyDo Not Forsake Me is a welcome sequel to a much loved romance. In the early 90's Roseanne Bittner wrote an epic fantasy, Desperate Hearts. It was a sweeping saga and affected readers deeply. I did not read it in the 90's so my wait for a sequel was much shorter but no less exciting..Do Not Forsake Me follows the Jake and Miranda Harkner as they serve out Jake's sentence. Jake has been released from prison and exonerated for his most famous crime, the one he never did. But he did commit crimes and he needed to make amends to society. So he has been sentenced to become a federal marshal in Oklahoma Territory. A place so wild and savage that no law man wants the job. The idea was to send in a man who lived the life to help clean it up.Jake has taken this job to heart but he wants a life of peace, he's always wanted a life of peace. So he has petitioned to have his sentence suspended, he just needs to get through the next few months while waiting for an answer.. Life should be easy, right?Yeah.. the Harkners do not lead a simple life, try as they might. Miranda is faced with an illness that could take her life and Jake would never survive that. And his enemies have plans of revenge all their own.This book was much less sweeping as it was pretty much contained to one year's time but that did not distract from the depth of emotion Ms. Bittner plays with. Reading Do Not Forsake Me was like sitting in a warm embrace. Yes, there were troubles but the love that radiates from Jake and Miranda is a beautiful thing. But they are not perfect and their family does suffer from Jake's mistakes.Ms. Bittner deals with love and forgiveness beautifully. She shows again and again that true strength is not about the physical but comes from within and her heroines are the strongest women I have ever read. They are survivors, not just of life but with love.This book can easily be read as a stand alone but if you chose to do so, you are missing out on a beautiful story that brings you and the Harkners to this point in their lives..I heartily suggest you read Outlaw Hearts, then Do Not Forsake Me and when it comes out LOVE'S SWEET REVENGE which will be the third book in this amazing saga..This series is what romance books are all about and Do Not Forsake Me lives up to it's predecessor, showing both new readers and those who read this years ago, Roseanne Bittner just gets romance.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Do Not Forsake Me, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQAPISX56FS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG8TG9E#wasThisHelpful","ROQAPISX56FS9","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In her 16th Heart of the Wolf Series Book, Ms. Spear returns to the her Seal Team, to the last of the unmarrieds..Lori Greypaw is one of the last wolves standing.. The pack had been decimated years before and what was left has moved on. But a small amount remain (a very small amount). Lori is pretty much the acting Alpha because the man who should be Alpha, the man she has loved forever, refuses to stay home and accept the job. But her Grandma has something up her sleeve and the charity auction plays a huge part.Paul Cunningham has managed to avoid his responsibilities for years. He doesn't want to be the pack Alpha, he doesn't feel he deserves it. But when he comes home between missions, he is conned into a bachelor auction and won by Lori Greypaw's granny. Only she isn't trying to match them up. Nope she wants Paul to do some fixing up at her cabin. Hmmmmmm sure Lori is going to help but it seems she really does just want him to work on the cabin.. Man is she slick...Paul and Lori discover that sure they had childish feelings for each other but these days their hearts are more mature and what they are finding together is worth fighting for. Of course there are some issues that must first be resolved.. And some thugs from a neighboring pack seem to have less than honorable intentions but Paul and Lori have begun to discover something worth fighting for.Ms. Spear writes her Heart of a Wolf Series in a meandering style. Sometimes the books are connected and sometimes they skip to another pack only vaguely attached. But it doesn't matter what or who she writes about she tells stories that have a rich and full history. Her packs are connected if for no other reason than because they really all are intertwined.I enjoy this series and always look forward to reading what Ms. Spears decides to share with us.

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyIt's hard to believe that How to Marry a Royal Highlander is book four (and two novellas) in Vanessa Kelly's Renegade Royals Series but amazingly enough it is.We have wandered through three of their lives and watched them find love and now it's time for Alasdair Gilbride's story. A man who was fortunate to have a real father love and raise him and to be the heir to the Scottish Earldom. He's done his duty, he's served the crown and now it's time to return home. To the grandfather he adored, the father he loved and respected and to the betrothed he never wanted. He was so against the betrothal that he ran away at 16 and went to war, among other things Now it's time to face the piper.. only now it's a 100 times worse because he not only doesn't want his betrothed he does want his best friend (and cousin's) sister in law..Eden Whitney, the favored twin, the adored twin, the twin who could do no wrong totally blew it.. One little escapade too many and suddenly she is persona non gratis. Not wanted, scandalous with no friends. She is being forced to head for Scotland and lay low for a while. Only her mother has plans to match make her with the sexy heir who is giving them a place to hide. Except of course Eden doesn't want to go to Scotland, it's barbarous, and away from society and of course the one man she wants but can't control is going to be her host. She doesn't want to fall for him but what's a girl to do?Now they only have to figure out how he can ever get out of his betrothal, appease his family and be together.Oh yes, another hit by Ms. Kelly! I enjoy this series immensely, partially because she dared to deal with a subject that is usually ignored. Yes every man over the age of 10 it seems slept around but no one ever really addresses the consequences. At least not from the consequences point of view. These are living breathing men and I am sure women who have to suffer for their parents actions and Ms Kelly makes them real. She makes them heroes, individuals to be admired.In Highlander, she also deals with family dynamics from the other side of the family. Where power and greed and maybe just a wee bit of insanity are gaining control and two people who might find happiness are being kept apart.She's just awesome and each book is a treat, Highlander offers us yet another chance to enjoy her wit and style, her dynamics and destines of those who some might not consider important.My opinion?

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyA Duke but No Gentleman by Alexandra Hawkins is not your mother's regency romance. It is dark, it is edgy and it borders on extreme behavior. For most of the book I waffled on whether or not I even liked it.There's edgy and then there's Ms. Hawkin's Duke..""The Duke of Blackbern and the Marquess Norgrave have always had the wildest of friendships. Best friends growing up, they bask in the pleasures the rich, opulent world that London has to offer, consuming drink and women at their leisure.""Lady Imogen Sunter, the innocent daughter of a Duke who pretty much has the world at her feet. Her father wants her married and is willing to allow so much before making the decision for her. No more flitting, it's time to get serious. But when she lands in the middle of a bet between two of the Ton's nastiest rakes Imogen finds herself in an entirely different world.The Duke of Blackbern is not a nice man. It's not that he's a boys will be boys kind of guy.. or sowing his wild oats.. nope he's almost well for lack of better word, bad.. Yet when he meets pretty Lady Imogen, something inside of him starts to crumble and he realizes that maybe just maybe there is something more. Only his best friend seems to want her too and the bet is on.The edge in this book was gritty but even more it was borderline mean. I wasn't sure if either the Duke or the Marquess could be redeemed and I certainly didn't feel there was a better man. At least initially.As I read this book, I would get angry, become determined to put it down, to turn down the review, then I would read just a bit more and the story would get to me. Then it would begin all over again. The characters written in this book were certainly three steps forward, two steps back kind of characters. You think Imogen is a bit too naive, too trusty. That the Duke is a Cad at the very best ant the Marquess? Well you wonder just how deep his darkness goes.And redemption? Yeah, you have to wonder if there is any for any of them and them POW.. Ms. Hawkins makes it darker but somehow wonderful.This is not a feel good book, it's not an easy read but it is a very good book.

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookWOW!!!I don't even know how to write this review! There is so much going on in Part Four of the Soul Scorched Serial that I am at a loss. What can I say and what would be spoilers???So, I will say this was THE BEST part 4 in ANY of Donna Grant's books. Once it becomes the entire Soul Scorched Book, it might just be the BEST of the Dark Kings Series.. I won't say it is the best because there is more to come. I will say it could be the best so far! And we all know that is saying a lot!!There are betrayals galore. I will say that.. and those making the betrayals are a total surprise.Darcy has been making choices based on erroneous facts and the Kings? Well they don't get the facts either.Things look like they might be starting to make sense and then Donna tilts the playing board. I am back to not having a clue as to who is good and who is bad. Well the Dark are bad, aren't they?This was one of those man how can this book be over books... Totally delightful!!I don't want to wait until November for the next Dragon King Book...

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookI know I have reviewed the serial books for this book but I wanted to just do a review of the entire book..Let me say this, without a doubt this is THE BEST book that Donna Grant has written. Her Dark Kings are heating up and I am not sure just who is truly trustworthy.Darcy Allen is just your everyday druid, from Skye, a faction that actually spells itself so that they not preform any magic that is evil. If you preform evil magic, you loose yours. Pretty harsh. But Darcy has worked with Ulrik and helped him.. and she still has her magic. Hmmmm, what does that say about Ulrik? But there is more going on than releasing Ulrik's magic. It's been three years and suddenly the Dark is after her. She's no longer safe at her home and she needs all the help she can get. Fortunately for Darcy.. she has this super gorgeous dragon on hand.Warrick has always been fascinated with humans. He couldn't even hate them when they were destroying the dragons. He is amazed by their brilliance and stupidity. But he's rather awkward when it comes to actually communicating, with anyone, so he has remained a dragon apart. Now Con has sent him to watch the Druid who is helping Ulrik. Warrick figures piece of cake, he can watch her and she'll never know he's there. Perfect plan until he sees the Dark that are beginning to surround her. Now he needs to be up close and personal and once he gets to know her, that personal part is beyond his control.Darcy and Warrick dance a slow waltz as they come together. There are trusts that need to be formed. Beliefs that need to be addressed and lines that need to be crossed. But somehow they know, that together they can conquer anything!Con is off on secret liaisons... when he's not trying to punish Darcy for her choices. And in his fear for the dragons, history might just repeat itself. Not good.Rhi is fighting a constant battle against the Dark within. Will she remain in the light? Or will her love for her Dragon finally destroy her? She has made some pretty serious self discoveries but more importantly some pretty accurate statements against the status quo..Ulrik... I still wonder about him. Even after his actions in Soul Scorched. Is he truly evil? There are those that say he is but I still wonder.Just a wonderful book!

A short story just giving us a tease.Mastyr Vampire Zephyr is committed to two things, fighting wraith pairs (a particularly nasty group of enemies) and taking care of Alesia. If he had his way Alesia would be on permanent lock down and his forever. Only Alesia is way more independent than that.Alesia watched her mother become captured by the Wraith and forced to become part of a wraith pair. Since then, Alesia has become a staunch advocate for rehab not death on all wraith pairings. I don't know if the wraiths can be rehabbed but their bond pair? Those are mostly innocents that didn't choose this life. If Alesia had her way she would see all of them saved. Only her opinions have cost her Zephyr, the man she loves..But one night when they are attacked both of them realize that there is where more to the two of them than opposing points of view. It finally comes down to just what is more important? And what are they willing to do for love?Now this is Caris taking strides in her unique brand of Vampires. These men and women show a depth of character that showcases Caris' talent.

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookA short review for a very short story..Caris Roane is one of my favorite authors and she has a way of writing Vampires that could make even the most ardent vampire hater fall in love..""Wicked Night is part of the Amulet Trilogy, three shorter novellas set in the world of the amulet in which Master Vampires protect and use powerful amulets to keep their tribes safe.""What this trilogy offers is sex.. pure and simple. While it has a secondary storyline this book explores the steamier side of Vampirism. We all know that even from the beginning of the Vampire genre, they were sexy, beyond sexy (I still melt when I watch Dracula with Frank Langella). Usually Caris uses sex as part of the story.. but this time, the sex really is the story.I was not prepared for this and at times it was a bit off putting. To me, this was not one of Caris' best works. It wasn't the sex it was the lack of story and the stilted dialog. But once I got past that.. I was able to enjoy this book for what it was.

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookWhen I finished book 1 of Rebecca Zanetti's BRAND NEW Realm Enforcers Series, I sighed and said.. What a Wild Ride! Now I know that's not exactly the title of this book.. but it conjured up some pretty exciting thoughts. And once I began to ponder it, I realized, yep it truly was rather Wicked!I will say, I seriously LOVE Rebecca Zanetti.. I was a bit peeved with her because all of her series are ending.. but honestly, this my friends was a treat! It's a spin off from her Dark Protectors Series and she does a fabulous job of keeping them separate and yet combing them.. *grins* confused? Don't be, Wicked Ride is it's own entity with it's own villain but we do get to see the Kayrs, at least Dage and a few others..Alexandra Monzelle is a no nonsense cop with something of a chip on her shoulder. Raised by an arrogant ass of a drug dealing father until he was finally arrested when she was 12. All she's wanted to do since then was make the world a little better place by getting rid of the creeps like him. Life is going according to plan when a new drug hits the streets and a new face shows up at the same time. Sure he's a suspect but really, what a face!!Kellach Dunne is an enforcer for the Coven of Nine and he's been sent to Seattle to try and figure out who exactly is distributing this new drug. A Drug that can kill a witch, and they're supposed to be all but immortal. He and his brothers have managed to infiltrate a local motorcycle ""club"" (yes there really is a difference between club and gang). The ""club"" that is at the bottom of the drug distribution pile.. But it's a place to start. Kell and his brothers are slowly making progress but this gorgeous cop is ruining his concentration. A woman he can't get out of his mind and can not be his mate as she's not an enhanced human... or is she???These two sizzle! And watching Lex try and trust Kell is a work of art. Honestly would you truly believe a pretty face if he's a known affiliate of an established crooked organization? Or could you trust your heart? Or maybe you would waffle a bit..While Ms. Zanetti is building a whole new world she doesn't leave out some of our favorites. We see, Dage and Garret and Logan have active roles. She hasn't forgotten those we love.. just lets the simmer a bit while some new characters create an entirely new story.Evil abounds and we are never really sure who the bad guys are.. Oh sure we have inklings.. then Ms. Zanetti smacks that one down and brings them back.. evil wench!I am truly looking forward to more of this series.. When's the next book coming out???ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Wicked Ride, provided by netgalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGH001NE6L22B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR7I2#wasThisHelpful","RGH001NE6L22B","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyWhat Jude Deveraux does better than just about anyone is make the average person seem larger than life. No matter the time span, he characters from the outside looking in seem pretty much a person of their times. Yet once she opens them up and shares them with us, they are super heroes.. they have depth and passion, they overcome obstacles, they are sometimes downtrodden but never down for the count. They are resilient, compassionate and in the end strong. Because of this ability Ms. Deveraux has, I have been a huge fan for years (even decades).The only thing better than a Jude Deveraux book is a Jude Deveraux book about the Montgomerys and the Taggerts. Seriously, I am so in love with these characters. Ever after is book three in her Nantucket Brides Trilogy and yes, it has plenty of both the Montgomerys and the Taggerts.. YAY!!Hallie Hartley was the Cinderella daughter, forced to give up first her childhood, then her college education and finally her adult life in caring for a manipulative step mother and her indulgent, self centered Step Sister. With the death of their parents, Hallie is forced to be the sole caregiver and responsible adult and yet still managed to struggle on. Tolerant and forgiving. That is until she walks in on said step sister trying to steal her inheritance. For some reason, Hallie has finally had enough and is determined to maybe this time, have a life of her own.James Taggert (yes one of those Taggerts) has had a rough few years. The sole survivor from an attack in Iraq, he suffers from severe PTSD and to top it all off, his brother convinced him to go skiing where he suffered a serious knee injury. He needs something to help him, both with his physical therapy and also his life. A nice quiet retreat on Nantucket seems nice. But when his Physical Therapist shows up he is hit with instant desire.. and the more he gets to know her, the more in love he falls. Now if he can just convince her that she's not a stand in for the woman he thought was going to show up (said step sister)Once again Ms. Deveraux wows. The ever insane interactions between the Taggerts and the Montgomerys makes me want to become a member of either family or run screaming for the hills if I ever met them.. usually at the same time. It's always fun to watch them overwhelm fresh blood. It takes a strong character to rise above the strong personalities of even the weakest Montgomery or Taggert. It has to be difficult to create such depth of character.But as great as James and Hallie are.. they are not without flaws. Hallie is so conditioned to be the doormat it takes some skilled manipulating to get her to wake up. To get her to acknowledge that maybe she needs to stand up for herself. The other side of that coin is, it would be easy to turn her into a shrew bent on revenge but that's not how Ms. Deveraux rolls, instead she imbibes Hallie with the strength of character to become who she was meant to be.Now James? He has to face some reality as well.. he has PTSD and it's scary but you don't just get over it. You need to be able to lean on those who can help you. You can't let fear control your life..Another great thing Ms. Deveraux does?? She takes a character that is written as the villain or villainess.. and shows us the other side of the coin. Things are rarely what we think they are. And in Ever After she does this with such aplomb that once again I was lost in love.Just a great book.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Ever After, provided by netgalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T56XKTN2MON2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6V1VH0#wasThisHelpful","R1T56XKTN2MON2","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookIn Part 3 of her Soul Scorched Serial, Donna Grant ups the heat. They may be worlds apart in who and what they are but together, it's a sensual fire!Darcy and Warrick are under seige and Thorn helps as he can but the Dark Fae threat is growing larger. Something has to be done and the decision to go to Dreagan has been made. Only Warrick worries, Darcy has become way to important to him and he doesn't want Con going all Alpha Dragon on her.The threat of Con is intense but first they must escape the Dark.. With the help of some unexpected allies (yeah you are so not gonna believe this) Darcy, Warrick and Thorn attempt their escape.Book 3 may be about escaping the Dark but it also focuses on Darcy and Warrick's relationship. Can I just say smokin???? Yeah these two connect very well.The Dark may want the Dark Kings divided but the question remains will they succeed? And what is Con hiding? There are secrets in his past that he needs to let the Kings know about. At least I think so.. I mean it could just be he boinked a seal while in dragon form.. I know ewwwww. But my point being Donna is hinting and teasing and I want to know now!!But that's not how Donna tells a story, the wench. Nope she slowly and by slowly I mean molasses looks like light speed compared to Donna's torturous speed. Anyway she slowly builds her case for both Con and Ulrik.My opinion? The Dark Kings will never be whole until Con and Ulrik set aside their anger and renew their friendship.

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookWhen Katie Reus started her Deadly Ops Series, there was one character that immediately captured my attention. I just knew he had more to tell us and I am thrilled to see that in book 3 of the series, Ms. Reus obviously had plans in the works all along. And she didn't insist on making us wait. So thank you!!Shattered Duty is one of those books that makes you just grateful to have those you love around you. It's also a fast paced, intense ride of a book.Special Agent Selene Wolfe has had an intense childhood. The death of her parents checked her world. Then she was held hostage and saved by an amazing man who changed her life. From there she went to work with the NSA both on the computer and in the field. But she's always remembered the man who saved her. Years later, when she's on an assignment she's stunned to run into that man. Only this time he's a widower on a vengeance stalk. Selene needs to know if she can play a part in his life.Special Agent Levi Lazaro gave everything for his career, including his wife. Knowing his wife and child died has all but destroyed him. For two years he has been playing the shady character doing all he can to find the man who killed her and more importantly, the man who called the shot.. Now that he's so close he's appalled to realize that he has taken his eye off the goal and has finds himself falling for the agent that has been sent in to do a similar job... Guilt and lust combine to create a combustible event.Watching Levi and Selene fall together was a delight. Levi has a past that is hard to forget and even harder to accept. He adored his wife and never really got why she was killed (and tortured) she wasn't on any assignment that he knew of and when the agency didn't do enough, Levi was lost. Yet Selene has been bringing him out of his personal deep freeze.Emotions reign and yet the action thrives as well. The desire to complete their mission, save the scientist and bring down the villain. Ms. Reus has a gift when it comes to infiltrate the underbelly of society. Her characters are three dimensional scary.. just fabulous!Once again Katie Reus delivers!!Shauni","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z0IR6PG1CBOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451419235#wasThisHelpful","R2Z0IR6PG1CBOS","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cora Seton returns with her long awaited (not that long but it feels like I have been waiting forever) conclusion to her Heroes of Chance Creek Series.We've watched each of the Hall brothers fall victim to Aunt Heloise's grand plan to get them all married off until there was only one man standing, Colt. And his road is the rockiest..Heather Ward was the High School sweetheart of Austin Hall.. wait? Austin?? But she knew he wasn't the one for her. It seems she was in love with Colt. Enough to secretly date him once she broke off with Austin. Until one night, finally in the back seat of her mother's car... what a night. She finally had Colt Hall, conceived her son and oh yeah... his father died of an brain aneurysm. When Colt left, Heather was devastated but she raised her son with love and got on with her life. Except the Halls are back in Chance Creek and Colt will be returning soon himself. Maybe even with a bride.. what is she willing to risk to have Colt back in her life?Colt Hall has dealt with the guilt of his father's death since the day it happened. He knew falling for Austin's girl wasn't the brightest thing but he loved her with all of his 16 year old heart. On his way out to meet her, he passed his father with a smile and a wave and a refusal to stop and listen.. when he found out that his father died that same night. His life changed in so many ways. Walking out on Heather was the first thing, then his life in the air force wasn't some behind the scenes job, he was in on every dangerous mission he could sign up for. But his mission has changed. Now he needs to marry to help his brothers save the ranch. He even has someone picked out but Helena Warner has captured his attention, even before he figured out that it was Heather.So how do you tell a man he has a son? I don't know how I would deal with something like that but Heather has to. And that's not even the hardest part. Once they get past all of the heartache and past hurts they still have to deal with Aunt Heloise and Colt's faux fiance who didn't get the message.In a tangled web reminiscent of the Importance of Ernest, Ms Seton allows her characters to further complicate their lives by fake engagements and almost weddings. Will one of them speak up? Or will the fate of the ranch hang on whether Colt can marry the wrong woman?This was a really good book. I was seriously made at the Hall boys because they put the ranch before Colt's happiness. Yes the ranch is important but shouldn't Colt be more so?

While she is deemed ""America's Sweetheart"" she finally has a chance to bust out of that image and do a film that could literally make or break her. Only while doing research, her assistant went missing and Avery is unsure what to do. No one believes her. So she heads to Aegis Security and discovers way more than a lost friend. It seems the only man who ever broke her heart will be her partner in this investigation. An investigation where they will have to go undercover at a swingers club.. Is Avery that good of an actress? Is anyone?Cade Blackwell, did the right thing. Or at least he thought he did. He walked away from the woman he loved, left her to return to her life and maybe make something of herself. What he didn't realize was that he walked away from his heart and nothing would ever really be the same. Now he has a chance to either end it finally or rebuild what they had. Either way this is way more than just a job.Swingers Club in the Caribbean no less, guess Club Med got bored.. Avery and Cade are a mix and match couple if ever there was one. They have chemistry up the whoo ha but Ms. Naughton does not rely on sex. Pretty funny cuz she could have but nope. She works the emotions in and tears down walls.

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyEvery now and then you run across a really fun series and for some reason for me, it usually has something to do with cowboys. Vicki Lewis Thompson has written an entire world for Harlequin Blaze, that I was disturbingly unaware of. She wrote this awesome series about the Chance family of Wyoming.. but that wasn't enough.. when she was finished telling their stories she discovered an entire new connection. The Thunder Mountan Brotherhood.This series isn't about a typical family, nope it's about two people who couldn't have a family and proceeded to create their own.. saving countless boys from the foster system. Now they need those boys to come home and help save the ranch..Thunderstruck is book two in the series and it tells the story of one of the original boys, Damon Harrison.Damon loves his foster family, he even became blood brothers with two of his foster brothers. They are the ones who stuck by him. Who gave him a chance at normalcy but he can't let anyone else in. He can't even manage to live a stationary life. He flips houses for a living and while that's a rather good income he also lives in the houses as he flips them.. then when he's done, he packs up and moves on. But even Damon knows family, real family comes first so when his foster parents ask him to come build a new cabin for them, he's happy to oblige and fortunately, he has Phil on hand to help him out. What a savior this guy is turning out to be.. *grins*Philomena ""Phil"" Turner only child of a construction worker has worked sites as long a she can remember. She's good at her craft and happy to be helping out at Thunder Mountain. Only she's sure she's being set up by the family. If only she wasn't enjoying the emails and texts so much it might not be a bad thing when Damon discovers that ""Phil"" is really Philomena..It's fun to watch misconceptions fall. What Ms. Lewis does in Thunderstruck is subtle but very real. She has a female in a decidedly male career and without preaching or aggressive behavior she makes the hero see that yes, women can do a ""mans"" job. And Damon becomes very adamant in his pride of Phil's work.That was the easy part, getting Damon to accept love was way harder. He has let his childhood rule him for a very long time, maybe forgetting the unconditional love he received during his teen years.This is a feel good romance and a sweet story.

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyWar destroys. Sure we romanticize it, we make it about honor or duty or even a cause but in the end, no matter who wins, everyone looses. Erica Ridley is writing a wonderful story about the consequences of war in her Dukes of War Series. She tells about life long friends who have all suffered the consequences. One was forced to stay behind and manage his affairs but watched as his friends left boys and came back men with troubles and struggles they have to overcome. One went away a dashing heir and returned and impoverished Earl (The Earl's Defiant Wallflower), One left all daring and dashing and came home lost in his mind with a severe case of PTSD not that anyone knew it by that name at the time (The Captain's Bluestocking Mistress). Two left darlings of the ton, twins, halves of one whole but only one came home. And he came home after not just loosing his twin but part of his leg.. And that's where our story begins.Actually, The Major's Faux Fiancee begins at the wedding of Jane and Grace and Oliver from The Earl's Defiant Wallflower. It runs parallel The Captain's Bluestocking Mistress and we don't see a lot of either couple. Just enough to prove that these men are first and foremost friends.Miss Daphne Vaughan, was pretty much the little girl ignored. Always trying to get her father's love or at least attention she has created an entire network of individuals devoted to her causes. Of course she never really says she's Ms. Daphne Vaughan.. she might be a Mr. Smith or Jones or Pembroke.. the names don't matter, the gender does. But Daphne works to make a difference not a name. But the death of her father puts her in a bind.. her new guardian wants her married off and out of his hair. Promising her a life in Bedlam if she doesn't marry immediately. Desperate Daphne, contacts the one person who has always been her hero, Major Bartholomew Blackpool. Only he's not the same boy she adored as a child, he's not even the same man who left for war. This man is cold, brittle and broken. But he is still her hero.Major Bartholomew Blackpool's greatest crime, he lived. Suffering from severe survivor's guilt Tolly, lives with loss. Total and complete loss. Not just of his leg, but his brother. Wallowing in self pity and pride (an interesting combination) he refuses to go about the ton to see them laugh at him, but he pushes himself so that he might function without aide. Even going so far as to get a new type of prosthetic.. no peg leg for him, his ankle actually bends. Refusing to leave the house at any cost, until the receives a desperate plea from Daphne.. She needs a hero and he's the only one she knows. A lifetime of concern and care can not be abolished and Tolly answers Daphne's plea. He thinks he's going to save her instead she becomes his salvation.Once again Ms. Ridley addresses another fact of war. Men don't come home heroes from way, they come home broken.. Not all wounds can be seen but they are there. Tolly came home with both types of wounds. An obvious one and a deeper, darker one and Ms. Ridley did not make light of it. He was a wounded warrior as there have been wounded warriors throughout history. Only Tolly gets a chance to rebuild his life and eventually he grabs it.Daphne on the other hand, she fights a different battle. A battle the neglected child has fought for eternity.. the fight to be seen, to be acknowledged. To make a difference. To not be invisible. And while fighting her battle she has her own demons to slay.This could have been a sweet, simple book. On the outset it is as is the entire series but in reality it's about surviving war and accepting that yes war destroys but you get to choose if you rebuild and flourish.Tolly and Daphne were wonderful as they learn to lean on the other. As they discover that their burdens are lightened when shared and as they discover that love, real love accepts..Just a fabulous book.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of The Major's Faux Fiancee, provided by netgalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243P9HYHL44PF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U68EKWA#wasThisHelpful","R243P9HYHL44PF","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyOutlaw Hearts was first released in the early 1990's and I am sorry to say that I missed it. Rosanne Bittner writes what can only be called an epic saga. A story that spans a lifetime and tells of two totally mismatched individuals who fell in love, then walked through fire to remain together.It was an emotional journey through the lives of Jake and Miranda Hayes. Not the kind of romance I usually read and I will admit when I first opened it up I couldn't get into it, I set it aside and waited.. and waited.. I kept looking at it on my kindle, then skipping over it for something else. I even met Ms. Bittner at RT and told her I would be reviewing it but still I waited.. Then when I finally sat down to read it, I couldn't put it down.Outlaw Hearts is what true romance should be. These two didn't have it easy but they fought to be together. Forever meant something.. Ok, Miranda ""Randy"" Had to sometimes mentally smack Jake upside the head because he was afraid of ruining her life.. but I digress.Miranda Hayes was a simple widow, getting ready to sell her ranch and head for Nevada to find her brother, when misfortune hit. A known killer/rapist/robber was in town, standing right in front of her. Startled she shot him. I don't think anyone was more surprised than Miranda, well maybe Jake. Somehow he escaped town and found a nice little place to hide out in before he bled to death. Yeah it was Miranda's place and this poor woman felt so guilty she nursed him back to health. Slowly learning just who the man was inside.Jake Harkner was a truly bad man. He ran guns for the confederacy, guns he stole from the Union, which often ended up with someone dead. After the war he rustled, robbed and yes killed a few people. But the worst thing ever said about him was he murdered his father. He was most certainly the hardened criminal he was reported to be. Until he found himself nursed back to health by the woman who shot him. How insane is that?? Forced to remain with a woman of true spirit and compassion Jake found himself opening up. We discover that maybe he wasn't such a horrible man.. not misunderstood but lost. Pushed in a direction at a young age, he had no clue how to get out.When Miranda left for Nevada Jake knew she needed him and found a way to be by her side.. Life's trials were not easy for these two. Miranda was definitely the stronger of the two characters. Jake was hard and embittered but Randy had a belief in them that could not be shaken. And believe me there was plenty that could have shaken things too far..Ms. Bittner writes such rage and passion into this book that it comes alive. I understood Jake's fears, his anger and his desire to make a better life for him and Miranda and their children. I was brokenhearted when his past kept coming back and ruined what he had built. And I cheered when they once again triumphed.This is a long book but it seemed too short when I had read the final word.A True gift to the romance world. Do Not Forsake Me, A Sequel is coming out July 7, 2015 and I find myself already screaming because it's not here yet. Because believe me when I tell you, Romance doesn't get any better than this!ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Outlaw Hearts, provided by netgalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHBHTE9P8IOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG8TGCG#wasThisHelpful","RWHBHTE9P8IOD","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookDianne Duvall takes us on an epic adventure through King Richard's England. Caught up with all the mysteries and superstitions telling a tale of secret passions that defy all, be they friend or foe, serf or king. A love story that rises from what could be to what is..When little more than a child, Alyssa donned her grandmother's robes and became the ""wisewoman"" for Lord Dillon. At 16 she was strong enough to hide a burgeoning love and step into shoes that should have been to great to fill. Ever looking for ways to keep Dillon safe, Allysa has closed herself off to all others. Allowing the suspicion and scorn to reign supreme. Always afraid of allowing others to see her true self. Until tragedy struck and Allysa's healing of Dillon all be destroyed them both.Lord Dillon, Earl of Wescott has known the wisewoman his entire life. She served his father and grandfather and he is more than a little confused as to why he is so drawn to her. His trust in her is without a doubt but the connection that grows daily between them? That's another story. For seven years she has been at his side, his anchor in so many ways. But an ambush leaving him near death teaches him just how loyal she has been to him and what he almost lost.This was more than a medieval romance this story had power.. The power to draw me in, to reveal the gifts given and to want to hold tight to the loyalties shown. While prejudice and superstition ran rampant in this book, they should have this was the 12th century after all, the power of love and loyalty managed to conquer even that.One thing I really appreciated was the fact that while Dianne made several of the priests corrupt and evil, lost to superstition and greed, she didn't make all priests out to be so. She carefully crafted what I would consider accurate portrayals of the clergy at that time, or anytime really, some good, some bad.. some men of their times and some able to look beyond the obvious.The one thing I was disappointed in was the fact that the Immortal Guardians, Seth and Roland were very minor characters. I wanted them to be huge players, to explain more of the what ifs? But I think Dianne has other plans and their importance may show as the series grows. But really that is such a minor thing and if that's all I didn't like? Well that means there were pages and pages and pages of things I loved!A Sweeping Saga like story setting the groundwork for the wonders of the Gifted Ones. Alyssa's brother and sister are sure to play a large part in future books as should Dillon's brother Robert.. Of course I don't really know how the mind of Dianne Duvall works but I am excited to see what will happen next.This story might be just another day in the mind of Dianne Duvall.. but it was a delight to me!

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyNever Resist a Rake is book two in Mia Marlowe's Sommerfield Park Series. A Light hearted romp across regency England and it's strict rules.If you are looking for a fun romance, this is it, if you are one of those who refuse to accept anachronisms and demand ""pure"" regency, look elsewhere. Like I said fun not Dostoyevsky (I would have said Shakespeare but he used anachronisms all over the place and over half of his stuff was just insane...)Rebecca Kearsey might be the daughter of a Viscount but she's living just above the poverty line and relies on family and friends. What she is, is respectable and a good companion.. but when she's kidnapped and used as the ransom in a boxing match... her reputation could be perfectly shot. Fortunately for her there is some decency left in the world, yes even in the slums at a fight..John Fitzhugh Barrett was tossed aside by his legitimate family, raised just short of poverty and always aware that he was the bastard child. Until.. it seems that the marriage between his mother and father was never annulled and now the world knows. But John? He's not what you call an acceptable aristocrat. When he discovered the news he refused to go to the family seat, I mean seriously they are just going to accept him? He is more than legitimate he's the heir.. replacing the man who was raised to be said heir. So he wanders into town and is treated with contempt.. Causing him to fall in with some rather shady ""friends"".. which was what he was doing at that fight. Fortunately, he's a decent man and refuses to see Rebecca suffer..That's the beginning of the story. It seems he's built a reputation and his family really does want to help him over his hurdles and asks Rebecca to smooth out his rough edges, help him find a ""proper"" bride. Hard to do when you are falling in love.This was a sweet story but not all consuming. It really isn't even remarkably memorable. It was nice. Middle of the road and kinda fun. Again, not Dostoyevsky but admit it.. when was the last time you read Dostoyevsky?Was it perfect? No it had flaws all over it.. but it flowed well and had a catching hero and heroine. Enjoyable.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Never Resist A Rake, provided by netgalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZOD5R4FIEEVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149260271X#wasThisHelpful","R1ZOD5R4FIEEVT","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookWelcome to the Twelve Kingdoms.. The Talon of the Hawk is book three and if I read it right the last book in this trilogy. BUT according to Author Jeffe Kennedy, there will be at least two more books.. *Doing the Happy Dance* Now I have time to go back and read books one and two.The Twelve Kingdoms have been united by finesse, brute strength and magic but the power that holds the throne has become corrupt (if he wasn't always) and the Kingdoms are shattering. Two of his daughters have fled and are immersed in their own challenges. But Ursula, the heir, has remained at his side. steadfast and true. True to the Throne and the King. Suffering neglect, abuse and worst of all in her opinion, distrust. Yet Ursula stands and takes it.

To let the shackles of false duty fall and rise as the true heir and eventual Queen of the Twelve Kingdoms.And while she feels she must go it alone, she has the heart of a powerful soldier.

I absolutely adored this book!What I didn't Like: It's written in 1st person. I allowed that to momentarily throw me off. I opened up saw it was written in first person and put it aside. I wouldn't have re opened it had I not committed to review it for Netgalley. I did put it off as long as possible. But seriously, I read one sentence saw the 1st person, which is usually so hard for me to get into and stopped. *hangs head in shame* DO. NOT. LET. THIS. STOP. YOU.What I LOVED..The rest of the book!! LOL.. Honestly. Flawlessly written characters with faults and flaws having to learn to rise above them before entering greatness. A lush sensual world slowly dying from the corruption of the magic. True evil, with rather gruesome skills and a petty tyrant who bullies the world into believing he deserves to be king..It really doesn't get better than this. Jeffe Kennedy belongs up there with Anne Bishop and CL Wilson for writing these intriguing characters and wonderful story. Fantasy truly at it's best!In case you missed it, I seriously recommend this book.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of The Talon of the Hawk, provided by netgalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P87J5LC8VSNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758294476#wasThisHelpful","R2P87J5LC8VSNR","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookAnd I thought this series was good before The Sandman!The Sandman is book 7 in Erin Kellison's Reveler Series and it brought me to my knees!!Intense, exciting, powerful! and so much more, Ms. Kellison just keeps getting better and better! For those of you who haven't been following the Reveler Series, I suggest you start. It's not quite a series and not quite a serial it's a bit of each. Each book is a short novella that tells a part of the story and could in theory be read as a stand alone. Only don't! The complete series is an overall arc that keeps twisting and turning. Bringing your nightmares to life.In a world where one can ""lucid"" dream, where it's""safe"" to wander into the dreamscape reality has come crashing in. There are those who want to control dreamscape, who want to escape your nightmares and live in reality. Corruption has destroyed any chance of ""safe"" and now a select few are fighting to survive the war between dreams and reality.Darkness abides as the Sandman Rises. The darkest demon from anyone's nightmare's. A being set on feeding off all of the dreams in dreamscape and there are those who chose to help it. There are living entities who were born to walk between dreams and waking life. Just as with humans, some are good and some are evil. Each has to decide for themselves if they will serve the Sandman, a being that is essentially their god, or if they will fight with the humans. And even if they stand with the humans, the run the risk of being destroyed by those same individuals.Maize City is under attack, Maisie has been forced to make alliances and allow those that survived the flight from the blackmarket to work in her city. And even then there is someone who can control dreams, a demon, a walking nightmare, who wants to control the city. And Maisie discovers that even she may not be strong enough to hold it.Sera has returned to the waking world to help Steve but finds her own battles to fight. Harlen and Rook are forced to wake to help in any way they can. And Jordan? Well everyone thinks she might just be crazy..And Steve? He faces the darkest battle of all.The sacrifices made by these individuals might never be known and yet they fight on. They fight for the right to survive.Honestly, I was consumed by this book..

"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookIn this fun little anthology, authors, Lora Leigh, Larelin McGee, Shiloh Walker and Kate Douglas, give us a bit of sensual delight. Each story tells it's own tale and brings us closer to characters that we might just want to read more about.Erins Kiss by Lora Leigh:What a delightful story. Ex Marine wait is that the right term? Former Marine Turk (is that a great name or what) leaped at the chance to join a covert organization that works behind the scenes to save the world. But it's been 10 years of rage and revenge and his personal walls are crumbling. What is it about sexy Erin that captures his attention and makes him dream of more?Erin has been sent undercover to spy on the spies.. and she's actually on the same team. Step daughter to their boss. She's only been there three months but she's learned one thing, Turk is the man for her. Can she get him to lower his walls and take a chance on her?It's hard enough having a romance with someone you work with, even someone who is fighting the connection but add in super spy and people out there with a grudge and life just gets crazy. For such a short story this packed a powerful punch and left me wanting more.misTaken by Laurelin McGee:A sweet and simple story about a woman discovering her sexuality.Jaylene Kim is strong, independent and a total feminist but like many feminists today her attitude is based on what she's been told. Learning that sexual submission does not make you weak or an anti feminist was a hard lesson but fortunately for Jay, she has sexy neighbor Noah to help her along the way.Noah is strong, determined and oh so sexy. He's also Jay's new neighbor. While his brain is what initially attracts Jay *smirk* his body isn't far behind. And his strong sense of self works high on her list. He's a nice guy, who runs, likes books and is interesting. Oh and he's a sexual dominant who writes erotica...This one was fun but sometimes seemed to drag on. Trying to fit an entire story in this short story made it seemed forced and lacking chemistry at times.. if I were reviewing this alone, it would rate probably a 2.5Burn for Me by Shiloh Walker:This was a poignant story about letting go of the past and living for the future. For forgiving and accepting. For learning how to live and love. It was sad yes but it also made me cheer a bit when the Hero finally grew up and accepted that bad things happen in life and sometimes they couldn't be explained.Growing up in a small town has to be a unique experience. Both Ali and Tate did so and both of their lives are pretty much fodder for the gossip mill. Ali had a pretty decent life but got pregnant and married her HS boyfriend.. Two kids later and she left him in the dust. For the past three years she's had a Friends with benefits relationship with Tate.. only it's not enough. She loves him but she needs all of him not just the parts he is willing to give her.Tate's world fell apart one night when he was 14. After a brutal fight (verbal) between his parents his mom walked out and was never seen again. Tate always blamed his father, even to the point of believing he murdered her. He's never really been able to accept that life isn't always that cut and dried. He's also never been able to completely love again, or trust in any relationship. But his refusal to let the past go is destroying what he could have with Ali. Now Tate needs to decide, a tortured past or a future worth living?Shiloh Walker wrote a beautiful Short Story. It wasn't action packed but it was emotion packed. It was a story the resonates and makes you believe that if you let it, love really will conquer all.Tangled by Kate Douglas:In Tangled Kate Douglas takes us to the vineyards. Ann aging father, caught in the beginning stages of alzheimer's looses the family vineyard. Now Cassie is working for the man who purchased her heritage. A nice man, a good man but not her father. After hiring a manager for the Vineyards he is off.Nate is the perfect man. Charming, sexy, interested in the Vineyards (good thing since he's managing it) and falling fast for Cassie.Ms. Douglas is known for her steamy sexy shifter books but Tangled is more of a romance, a love story. Two people who fall for each other and manage to create a life on the ashes of Cassie's family's dreams.An excellent secondary story when Col Mac's past comes to find him. Not only did he own the vineyard but he worked amongst the nation's leaders and knew too many secrets. And someone wanted those secrets destroyed..There was a lot packed into this story and it was well written. Not rushed or over manipulated.Four good stories working between 2.5 stars and 3.5 so I give this book a solid 3 star ratingShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Hot Alphas, provided by netgalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQ8FOCQHL08O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250066883#wasThisHelpful","R2YQ8FOCQHL08O","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyIt seems like forever ago when I picked up my first book by Thea Harrison. That of course was Dragon Bound and I have loved the Elder Races ever since. I don't think there has been a book I didn't enjoy but there were a few I absolutely adored.. Surprisingly enough the Vampires have come on strong in this series.. From the oh so campy, Serpent's Kiss, to the sexy and suave Xavier in Night's Honor. But Midnight's Kiss was a treat and a half.If you go all the way back to Serpen't Kiss where we first met Julian he was not a sympathetic character. He was strong, arrogant, and obnoxious, in short a Roman Gladiator turned general.. After years of serving Carling, his sire, he finds himself in a position of considering ending her.. But that was then.Now Julian is the leader of the vamps.. and under attack. He has his council but they are more of an annoyance, yapping at his heels. And at least one of them has openly declared war. First poisoning Xavier and now, kidnapping the woman he loves/loved/loves... And his reaction is when I began to fall in love...A man who has been betrayed by the woman who held his heart isn't the best person to go to for a ransom and yet Julian not only accepted the call but paid the ransom, himself. Knowing he would probably not get out of there alive he needed to make sure Melly survived.. Once he sacrificed himself he knew that his enemies would not keep their word, so his goal? His only goal? Save Melly.Melisande is the daughter of the Light Fae Queen and heir to the throne. She has loved Julian for years and still wonders why he turned away from her. The world sees a frivolous twit but Melly has spine and character and some serious skills. While Julian is determined to ""save"" Melly, Melly is quite capable of saving herself. But once Julian places his life on the line for her, she is bound and determined to return the favor.While the battle was raging, Julian and Melly had to fight their way through Feral Vamps, Hidden Tunnels and a batshit crazy evil vampiress.. AND try to decide if what they had was worth fighting for. Of course figuring out how it all fell apart and who betrayed them, played a huge part. Politics aside, Julian and Melly were meant for each other.Then there was the way Julian handled the traitors.. when he faced the council and declared their sentence, he was wicked awesome!!Why I liked this book... Let me count the ways.. ok, not because it wasn't any specific thing it was the feel. The essence of the book. It reminded me in strange ways of Pia and Dragos when they first met.. and no there is no definite explanation. I just got that vibe. Had I not read a single Elder Races book previously, I would have fallen in love with this series after reading Midnight's Kiss. I can't say that about any of the other books.What I didn't like? No Dragos, Pia or Peanut.. *sobs* I can't help it I love Dragos. While he wasn't in the book his presence was felt and I am hoping the next book will bring us closer to them... But face it, if I had my way all of the books would be about Dragos and Pia and then look at all the marvelous books we would have missed.I do wonder how this book will fit into the over all arc. Night's Honor and Midnight's Kiss are a definite duology with Serpent's Kiss being something of a prequel.. But neither quite fit into the overall arc.. at least I don't think so but who knows what's coming next? Or how Ms. Harrison plans to wrap them all together.In Short an excellent journey into the Elder Races.Shauni","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12T9EADSS5QFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425274381#wasThisHelpful","R12T9EADSS5QFE","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyCat's Lair reminds me of Burning Wild, it has that dark essence to it. Since Burning Wild was probably my favorite of the Leopard Series, I am good with the comparison. The thing with Feehan is she writes each book with a style that displays the characters rather than the series. There sometimes feels like a lack of continuity between the books but the stories themselves work for the individual characters. And Ridley Cromer/Eli Perez is all dark and dominant so this book seethes.. It pulses with a dark desire and sexual intensity but it also plays to the heart. Eli is less broody than Jake from Burning Wild but he has that same power.. so the sex scenes are just as steamy *grins* I still can't look at a desk without thinking of Jake and Emma *blushes*Cat Benoit is something of a wiz kid, raised in a strange sort of innocence in the house of a crime lord, Cat was refused education, friends or any sort of independence. But she wasn't stupid and eventually found a means of escape. Living completely under the radar, Cat has managed to find a minimum of a life. She has self educated herself, learned self defense and has a good job. And now she's found a friend in Ridley Cromer, a nice guy who treats her like a lady but makes her heart go pitty pat. Only Ridley is not who she thinks he is.Ridley Cromer/Eli Perez is a cat with the DEA. He and his team have been working to bring down Cat's former ""guardian"" for years. When Ridley manages to work his way into Cat's inner circle he thinks he may finally find a way to get the job done. Only the DEA has other plans and take Cat into custody.. Breaking Ridley's cover and the true man, Eli Perez emerges. Eli isn't calm, sweet or remotely zen like. He has dark passions and his leopard lives a little too close to the surface. But he's also the man for Cat, now he just needs to re earn her trust.And that's where the true story begins.Eli and Cat live on a ranch right next door to the Banconnis so we get to see them as well as Jacob and Elijah. That's always fun.The fight or flight options of this book are rather excellent. Cat wants flight but Eli knows that eventually they must fight for her to be truly free. Intense emotions are sprung from Cat's growth as a woman and eventually a leopard.I think this might be one of Ms. Feehan's better books.Shauni","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21D23FA7SXW45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=051515556X#wasThisHelpful","R21D23FA7SXW45","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyIt's a dark time in Joanna Shupe's latest book The Lady Hellion, book three in her Wicked Deception Series. Life may be cushy for the rich and famous, aka the ton, but the poor are barely getting by. And life fore women is even worse. Their choices are very limited with prostitution being one of the few ""career"" choices left to them and while the job is not ideal, some really do have it worse than others.In the Lady Hellion we get to watch what Lady Sophie Barnes try her best to make the world a better place by helping those women who really need her.Sophie is a genteel lady, one whose prospects at one time were legion but she has refused man after man as she grows closer and closer to being on the shelf. Why shouldn't she? She has been in love with one man for years, the man who broke her heart. But her father is making noises about securing her a betrothal and Sophie just wants to help those women in need. It doesn't matter if her heart goes pitty pat every time she is near Damien Beecham, Viscount Quint, no matter how much Sophie wants him, he doesn't want her.Damien Beecham, Viscount Quint is a little on the odd side. As a matter of fact he just knows he is going slowly insane. Genetics declare it and Damien has decided that he is going to close himself off from his closest friends and let nature take it's course. Sadly (or happily as the case may be) for Damien, nature has a name and it's Sophie. The one woman Damien has always wanted but never allowed himself to dream of. When Sophie comes barging back into his life, Damien has to decide just what it is he is willing to fight for or better yet, to live for.I just love Joanna Shupe. Her books have enticed and entranced me. Each one building off the other to create a definite picture of a world divided by money. And those few who dare to cross the lines. Each of her female characters are strong yet believable. Each of them have dared to dream and Sophie's dream is the most daring of them all. She wants to help people.. *gasp*.Inner struggles almost tear Sophie and Damien apart. Accepting just who and what the other is creates a relationship that can bear the test of time. A relationship to be dreamed of.One of the things that makes this book special is the unique dichotomy of it. Sure it is written about Regency England but you can easily see it happening today. An historical book that can double as a contemporary.I loved The Lady Hellion and it's well worth the readShauniThis review is based on the ARC of The Lady Hellion, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOBAXMWCF5X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR6AG#wasThisHelpful","R2NOBAXMWCF5X5","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and Fantasy""Ella Quinns bachelors do as they like and take what they want. But when the objects of their desire are bold, beautiful women, the rules of the game always seem to change""A Kiss for Lady Mary is book Book #7 of The Marriage Game Series by Ella Quinn.. Each book tells a story of men who have ""sowed"" their wild oats and are at the age where it's time to settle down. Not that they think they are ready but... What makes this series stand out from others of the same ilk, aside from the strong writing.. is the uniqueness of each book. Where the basic style of the writer doesn't change the way the stories are told does. These are not carbon copy heroes and heroines, nope these are individuals, with their own foibles and flaws.The Marriage game tells the story of Christopher ""Kit"" Featherton and Lady Mary Tolliver two perfectly nice people. Seriously, nice people.. smack em in the face cuz they are just too nice, people.. One would think such a book would be boring, in someone else's hands they probably would be. But their very niceness is what drives the tension between the two of them.. seriously. It made me laugh on a regular basis.But just because these two perfectly nice people are trying to figure out a romance, it doesn't mean that the world around them is equally nice..It seems that Lady Mary has something of a stalker. Since the death of her parents, her cousin has decided that he deserves her inheritance.. so he is going to marry her. No matter what. Compromise, kidnap, pick a reprehensible means and he has tried it. This has caused Mary no end of trouble and has put her life on hold.Kit Featherton is the man all the matrons go to when their daughters need someone to stand up with. No wallflowers exist around him, he is always ready to set a girl's mind at ease. But he's never really had to actually court a woman of his desire. He has one.. just isn't sure how, well even to find her right now.Now Kit and Mary would be perfectly happy to find each other but both are so dang proper that things always seem to get muddled.. Never Fear! The matchmaking grandmas are here! And boy do they have a plan.. to match Kit and Mary, to solve Mary's stalker problem and to get Kit to enjoy his estate that he never really goes to...Now for the fun part! LOL..Watching Kit and Mary muddle through a courtship. Kit wants Mary, he has for a few years. Only he wants to court her properly, even if she is pretty much compromised and has to marry him. Mary wants to be courted, to be swept off her feet.. They want the same thing, they really do but neither is going to do a darn thing about it!This was a solid, fun book! I don't think it's the best in the series but it holds it's place. We see several of the previous characters from The Marriage Game Series and everyone has an opinion. I had to laugh, This could actually happen, two people perfect for each other and yet neither ready to take the first step, make the first move..The only thing I didn't like? There were too many secondary couples, not the gang from the series, new individuals, that had relationship conflicts. It seems like Ms. Quinn didn't trust her H/H to drive this book. I liked the other stories but would have preferred that they had their own as opposed to being a part of this book.And the stalker resolution was rather anti climactic.. No, not gonna tell just voicing my thoughts.Like I said, a good solid book.. for me it manages to slip into that four star category..ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of A Kiss for Lady Mary, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNWVXEO23E7AK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR7KA#wasThisHelpful","RNWVXEO23E7AK","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookThe Queen of Western Romance, Linda Lael Miller has returned to Bliss county for book three of her Women of Bliss County Series.Three best friends who made a pact. To take the chance of finding love seriously, to be there for each other as they find their happily ever after and to support them in their struggles.It's Bex's turn but Hadleigh (the Marriage Pact) and Melody (The Marriage Charm) might have had things a little easier. The men they had loved in some for or other all of their lives had returned. All four had grown up and discovered that the love they were looking for was right in front of their faces. But Bex? The boy she had loved most of her life, Melody's Older Brother, had died while on active duty. Bex believes in love, she wants to find love again but she's afraid. Afraid to take that chance again. Does she really dare to believe that it's worth the risk? But when her friends try and subtly matchmake, just wanting her to be happy, Bex is put on the spot. Too bad she's crazy about newcomer Tate Calder.Tate Calder is a single dad.. that pretty much defines him. A widower who adores his sons and wants to give him that special security that only a small town can do. He has picked Bliss County and settled in nicely. But his friends want him to be even happier and are encouraging a relationship between Bex and him. It doesn't hurt that his boys adore her.. and so it seems does he.Once again Ms. Miller writes about the intricacies of small towns and those who live there. Family and friends over lap but family plays a huge part. A neglected nephew, two small boys who are looking for a mother, rescue dogs and a whole lot of fun. She makes not only the characters seem romantic but the town itself has the air of romance surrounding it.I truly enjoy the way Ms. Miller tells a story. And while The Marriage Season it the last of this particular trilogy, there are more stories to tell about Bliss County. I do feel that this was the best book of the series.. and I seriously recommend it.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of The Marriage Season,, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DFS808ZVBG19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXMLHWY#wasThisHelpful","R2DFS808ZVBG19","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookAlexandra Ivy totally and completely captured my heart with this book.  This series is the PNR world at it's best. Sure it is originally about vampires and yes they are real bloodsucking vampires. They were sired and all that but Ms. Ivy did offer a bit of a twist (whew.. I would hate to have to admit to just loving a true vampire series. *grins*).Now on to the book..Battles have been fought, enemies have been destroyed but the world is still in peril, seems there is always one more villain to do away with and this time? No one sees it coming.Fallon is the last unmarried daughter of the king of the Fae.. oh not the fae that interacts with the world, nope the oh so pompous fae that have removed themselves from those who are ""beneath"" them, basically everyone. Fallon is destined to marry her handsome prince and live boringly ever after. Just another female in his harem, a wife to be sure but when all is said and done, just another female. Fallon dreams of more and has worked hard on her scrying. Although it has been done in secret she has a remarkable talent and could possibly be one of the best ever. When she suddenly finds herself alone with an oh so handsome vampire, in a cave she doesn't recognize, Fallon is to say the least confused.. but what the heck, did I mention oh so handsome? But seriously, she has been recruited to work with Cyn to discover what is happening to the council...Cyn, the vampire clan chief of Ireland likes the good life. Likes his comforts, all of them. He is the king of sensuality in all things and his hedonistic life is legendary. BUT he also believes in loyalty and in helping the weak grow strong. Having been adopted by a fae couple when he was first sired, he also respects other races. So when he was on a mission to help a friend with his lady, Cyn is also kidnapped he might have been understanding.. nah, he is a vampire.. you don't force them to do anything.. You ask, nicely.. But Cyn isn't that upset to be tucked together with the oh so luscious Fallon.. Things are about to get interesting.The world is at risk and lives are going to change but Cyn and Fallon have found more than just a cause, they have found each other and the discovery that together they are something magical is a beautiful possibility.Alexandra Ivy writes pure magic. These two didn't actually clash, there wasn't sound and fury, just two people forced to work together, two people that discover that real love exists and maybe just maybe they can have it. And that's when the fireworks start.The fight against evil on the other hand is gently woven in.. it's an insidious enemy and Ms. Ivy slowly unveils just what is happening. Slowly, slithering it's secrets into the story. (Yeah I know I just love alteration way too much) In this book, the relationship is front and center and the enemy is kept on the back burner.. until the music rises, the story peaks and the crescendo crashes in!Just a wonderful book!!ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of When Darkness Ends, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYHXWMS2KV0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420125176#wasThisHelpful","R1VYHXWMS2KV0W","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyElizabeth Hoyt's Maiden Lane Series is one of those I can never say enough about. It's dark, it's edgy, it's based in Georgian England... What the Maiden Lane Series offers that so many others don't is depth of character or rather depth of community.. no maybe depth of individuality or maybe all three. I jest.. but I really don't. Elizabeth does such a phenomenal job of bringing poverty to light, to making those that struggle part of the same world the haves reside in.In Elizabeth's books it's not always the Haves and the Have nots. Rather it's the what could bes..Lady Phoebe Batten should be considered one lucky girl. She's bright, she's pretty and she's the sister of a Duke. She should have the world at her feet. Only she is also blind. Her world has slowly disappeared over the years until finally the light has completely deserted her. Because she is such a beloved sister, Phoebe's brother has begun to smother her. Containing her naturally exuberant spirit with all the things she can't do. It seems breathing might just be on that list. And worst of all, he's given her a bodyguard in the form of Captain Trevillion. How terrible is that, she must constantly be dragging him from pillar to post.Captain James Trevillion was forced to leave his home behind and reinvent himself. Over the years he has risen to lead men. But one risky move, in a fight of good vs evil and James was wounded and lost his career. Lucky for him he was offered a job caring for Duke of Wakefield's sister. Rather caring for her safety and security. James only wishes he could care or her person. Seems he has been falling in love with her from the first moment they met. Now he is living some sort of self induced life of torture as he spends day after day with her only to know she's not for him.. Or is she?An attempt on Phoebe's life has James and Phoebe running to the ends of the earth (or at least England) only to discover their heart's desire. Forced to recognize that there is way more to the other person than they even remotely knew, James and Phoebe learn that there is more to life than duty and title. The question is are they able to reach for it and once they do, will they hold on?This book was just a tad different from all of the rest of the Maiden Lane books. It has this blue collar feel to it. Because Ms. Hoyt offers us a slightly different feel to the story we are offered a rich banquet of possibilities. *sigh* She is just so wonderful.Pride forever holds us captive and James had to learn to let it go. To not allow it to run anymore of his life, but he wasn't the only one who had to learn. And Elizabeth offers each lesson wonderfully.I can not say enough about this series. What I can say is that Ms. Hoyt is offering us another Gem in her Maiden Lane Series.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Dearest Rogue, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25M99NS2DUEZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455586358#wasThisHelpful","R25M99NS2DUEZB","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookThe 1001 Dark Nights Series offers a unique opportunity for authors to showcase a favorite series, share their secrets and seduce the readers. Each book is connected only by the fact that the author has written a novella and considers it a story that Scheherazade might have told (I don't know that but it sounds right since this series is loosely based on the Arabian Nights). But for me, these tales are ones that could be told in the darkest nights, whispers of romance and desire, Masters and Monsters, Decadence and Dragons, Dreams and Desires.Today's whisper that roared is another by Lexi Blake. Ms. Blake takes us back to the members of Sanctum and her Masters and Mercenaries Series. Masters and Mercenaries is an erotic, BDSM Series but as the series develops it's less obvious in it's BDSM. Oh it's there, we are aware of it but often it's just background information. The stories themselves drive the books.. It's a sensual tease.Adored is a novella that runs parallel to the main story arc. It is more focused on the club or rather the members of the club rather than the employees of the McKay-Taggart Security Services. Pretty much all of the novellas are based around the club rather than the company.. but they do connect.Laurel Daley by nature is a people pleaser.. she can't help it it's who she is but as her brother opens up about his lifestyle, Laurel also realizes that she's a submissive and wants to learn more about it. She also dreams of calling her pain in the ass, arrogant, afraid of change boss her Master. Only he's pushing her away as hard as he can. When she finally has a chance to connect with him, she is devastated when he once again pushes her away. Only this time, a baby is involved.Mitch Bradford is a wounded man. A harsh childhood, two broken marriages and finally he's given up on love. He knows that sweet Laurel is attracted to him and he really really returns the attraction but he feels she deserves better than a broken man ten years her senior. But when they finally have sex and he pushes her away, poor Mitch is all but lost. Discovering she is pregnant brings her back into his life and maybe, just maybe Mitch will get it right.*SIGH* this was one of those books. The ones you roll your eyes at, cheer for the heroine, yell at the hero, laugh at the secondary characters... It's fun, it's sexy and it's pretty much right on target. Mitch is in his late 30's (39) and feels like a two time looser, Laurel is in her late 20's and doesn't see being twice divorced as a detriment.. Now that is a true generational fact..But there is so much more in this book. Mitch has reasons for his fear of change and he has to face them if he ever wants a life with Laurel..And well, I wanted to smack Laurel's family. Honestly close or not I would be smacking any member of my family that invaded my life the way they did hers. But it was real, emotional and believable.The secondary story was intense in and of itself but it also worked wonderfully to bring these two together.Another great job by Ms. Blake.Shauni","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHP6URTX2AKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194088733X#wasThisHelpful","R2LHP6URTX2AKK","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookFor those of you who aren't aware, I am a huge Katie Reus fan.. And by huge, I mean.. well you get it. I thought I had read at least something from every series she had written, if not everything. But when Netgalley put out Protective Instinct I learned that I was wrong. I had missed an entire series! (No worries, I am currently correcting that mistake). Protective Instinct is book 5.5 in her Moon Shifters Series and it certainly got my attention.Protective Instinct isn't about the drama of high adventure, it's about facing your fears, trusting your mate and learning how to lean on another person. Oh and it's about letting go of the past and embracing love. Seems hardly like a shifter book at all. Guess even shifters have emotional issues.. *grins*Teresa Cordona has had some series pack problems over the past few months. She has watched all the males in her family die, she's been poisoned lost some cousins and still tried to be the anchor her sisters need. What she didn't expect was that she would fall for the sexy new packmate, Ryan. He's all she could dream of in a mate but he has issues of his own and is trying to wait.. to be sure she is ready for love. That she understands what she is getting into. It's getting to be a bit tiresome for Teresa and she needs some serious space. Too bad an old family enemy has her sites set on Teresa and privacy is just not happening.Ryan is an empath shifter. That means he can ""accidentally"" bond with another wolf. Dooming her to a lifetime of something just short of imprisonment. Bonding isn't like mating, bonding is for life and bonding with the wrong wolf can be sheer hell. Just ask his parents. So really can you blame a guy for wanting to make sure his mate understands that there is no going back? Now if Teresa would just be a little patient. Oh and if those damn vamps would leave her alone..This was a great little novella. A wonderful love story with enough action to keep it interesting but not to interfere with the real story. The revenge issue kept the novella part of the series and held on to an overall arc so it played a part but it's real purpose was to give Ryan and Teresa something to force them to work together.. and baby it worked.Katie Reus writes emotional intensity brilliantly, whether it's about shifters or vamps or heroes with special talents.. or even just regular humans.. She understands what drives them and propels it onto the page. Protective Instinct just proves her talent.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Protective Instinct, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EM690K64UJZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194244706X#wasThisHelpful","R3EM690K64UJZA","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookKatie Reus is at it again! Retribution stands alone and has to be one of her very best books! I will admit to hoping that this book turns into another one of her fabulous series because it certainly left me wanting more!Nika Brennan was hiding in a closet as a vicious monster killed her parents. At the age of 5 she was fortunate to have her older sister, Alena age 10, to protect her. It's been 20 years and the sisters are finally getting their revenge. Only their revenge has a price.. Can Nika and Alena walk away from what could very well be their own personal HEA?Declan Gallagher has a gift, as most of his family does, his gift is to dream walk. He can slip into people's minds, especially their dreams, and discover their, thoughts, their hopes, their deepest secrets, with no one the wiser. Except this time? Declan is dream walking with the luscious Nika Brennan and she is not only aware of his presence she remembers it all. Creating a connection that tempts him to share his desires.. And when they meet? It's combustible. But how can a relationship built on lies survive?This book was just soooo good! Ms. Reus outdoes herself this time. While both Alena and Nika want revenge they have to decide just how far they are willing to go and just what they are willing to sacrifice. Loyalties are tested and love is on the line.While we know the enemy the tension in this book doesn't come from the suspense it comes directly from the relationships. Can you build something precious when you are working opposite ends? Can lies be converted and a foundation of trust be built? Difficult questions...I honestly can not say enough about this gift Ms. Reus gives us. And I seriously hope to see more of the Gallagher family..

"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyWhat a total delight.. or was it? Kelly Bowen really delivered an amazing book. Something I surely didn't see coming. A Good Rogue is Hard to Find is book two in her Lords of Worth Series and I found myself totally captivated.Ms. Bowen pulled a complete and total sleight of hand on us and instead of a light hearted romp through regency England, we are delivered a daring report of acceptance, desire, revenge (the good kind?) and yes redemption. And all I can say is wow!!Miss Jenna Hughes is on a mission. Years after watching her fiance loose everything, leaving her pregnant and alone, Jenna has finally found a way to help others in the same situation. After all even the upper class should have to pay their bills. You don't get to blather on about honor then leave the tradesman with nothing. Finally, she's in a position to help and has some pretty interesting partners, a former thief, a bookmaker and a dowager duchess. Things are running oh so smooth, that is until the Duke decides to move in to help his mother get her life straighened out.William Somerhall, Duke of Worth has it pretty good. He gets to remain emotionally distant from the world, ignore a rather harsh and abusive childhood and focus his life and his honor on the racing world. He firmly believes that what is left of English Honor is at the racetrack (seriously? Even I know that has never been the case). What he doesn't need is his scatterbrained mother causing scandal.. The woman keeps chickens for pets for pete's sake. Finally forced to accept that his mother needs his help, William moves in and discovers an entirely new world that he was never aware of.This book was brilliant, initially I laughed, hard. The interaction between the characters all determined to keep Worth ignorant of what they were really doing was truly fabulous. There aren't enough superlatives for me to use when describing this wonderfully, confusing dialog.. But it's when we are slowly shown what's behind door number 2 that the book gets really good.We read about Regency England with all of it's glitz and glamour but there was a certain seediness about it as well. Ms. Bowen shares that seediness, that lack of honor, that edginess that is way more realistic than the glitz an glamour. Or maybe, sadly it isn't. There will always be the haves and the have nots.. just sometimes we need a real hero/heroine. And in A Good Rogue is Hard to Find, we get just that.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of A Good Rogue Is Hard to Find, provided by netgalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQCH2DBJOSY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEMMSK2#wasThisHelpful","R3QQCH2DBJOSY9","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Tea and BookThere is nothing so dark as a soul without light. A man so deep into despair that he no longer even dreams of the light. A man who could be good or could be evil, either or neither. Just a man who lives withing the depths of despair.Jackie Ashenden writes a wonderful tale of such a man in book two of her Nine Circles Series, Make you Mine. This story has power, it has depth and it has redemption... what more could we ask for? A sexy Hero? A smoldering Heroine? A despot of a villain??? We don't have to ask, Ms. Ashenden gives it all to us.Alex St. James is the Playboy's Playboy.. he doesn't take anything seriously. Or so it seems. He has spent his entire life focusing on escaping a brutal betrayal. Once the family's goldenchild but he walked away from all he loved at the age of 16. He walked away in shame and tried his utmost to put it all behind him. He even created the Nine Circles Clubs so he would have a place to hide, a place where his friends could hide. But things you hide in the dark have a way to coming out and Alex's past has come slamming into his present. Now he must face the darkness, alone. But he has one bright light to take with him, his ""bodyguard"" Katya. A sensual woman who hides her own darkness..Katya found her mother dead in a pool of water and blood when she was just a child. Raised by her father to be strong, to be tough and to never be weak she held true to his values. That is until he betrayed her and everything he claimed to believe in. Leaving the Russian army, Katya has become one of the best bodyguards in the business. Aloof but professional but even Katya can't resist the pull of Alex St. James. And when he demands she accompany him on his darkest mission, Katya finds herself truly understanding what she must do to save this man.Complex characters and intense interactions drive this story and oh wow, does it pull you in. At first, it seemed a bit slow but Ms. Ashenden built a wonderful story word, by word. Each layer of the story slowly revealed until we the readers can not help but be lost in the story.This is not some sweet romance.. nope it's dark, it's deadly and it's full of sensual promise.Check it out because I promise you will be enthralled.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Make You Mine, provided by netgalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HA4VFAZC4CB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OO3CJQM#wasThisHelpful","R1HA4VFAZC4CB9","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally Reviewed For: Bodice Rippers, Femme Fatales and FantasyIt's time to go back to the beginning. For those of you who are Murray Family Fans, Highland Destiny is Book One in the Series. Hannah Howell is offering us a wonderful peak into the past.It's been a while since I read the entire Murray Family Series and at first I wasn't aware that this book was a re release. But the further I got into the book the more familiar it looked. So it was a serious case of using the same material more than once or I had already read it. Fortunately for all of us Hannah Howell fans, I had already read it. BUT, the first time I read the Murrays, I read them out of order and reading Highland Destiny made me want to read the entire series again. I will admit, I am liking it much better this time around (and I really enjoyed it the last time) mostly because reading it in order just makes the books flow.Maldie Kirkcaldy was raised by an angry bitter woman who wanted nothing more than to destroy the man who seduced her, got her with child, waited to see what gender it was and then left. On her mother's deathbed she promised to kill that man, her father, for her mother. To get her revenge. And after months of traveling on her own on foot, she is almost there But she realizes she might need some help. And help miraculously appeared in the form of Balfour Murray. A man who had his own fight against the man who fathered Maldie. Only the more time she spent with Balfour, the more her goals changed. Now she wants to figure out how she can keep Balfour as well as kill her father.Balfour Murray is young, good looking and Laird of his small clan. When a neighboring laird kidnaps his young brother, wanting to claim him as his own, Balfour takes immediate action. Only to fail. On his return to his own home, to regroup and maybe make some better plans, pretty Maldie Kirkcaldy shows up out of nowhere. Offering her medical assistance to any of their wounded, especially his very wounded brother. Openly suspicious Balfour still accepts her offer and slowly falls under her spell even when maybe he shouldn't.This was just a good book. A wonderful introduction into what we now know is a 20 book series. Reading it made me fall in love with the Murrays all over again. One of the things that I enjoyed was the innocence for lack of a better word of the time. Yes there were fueds and battles, betrayal and greed but the fact that it's not unbelievable that Balfour was able to just accept Maldie after meeting her on the road. Of course you have to wonder if a woman of that era would actually have been able to walk for months on her own.. But then you remember that she is portrayed as someone of the lower class, the unnoticed. Whether she was or not is an entirely different story.Another fun fact about this book is the fact that the villain is an over the top sleezebucket and yet again, perfectly believable.Feuding and passion.. just what we think of when we want to read an highland historical yet Ms. Howell brings all that passion right there into the room with you (fortunately the feuding is a little farther away). She makes you want to be a part of the majesty (forget the struggles and disease and...). She just makes you yearn.A really wonderful readShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Highland Destiny, provided by netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LHYXK9NN53W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420122355#wasThisHelpful","R22LHYXK9NN53W","A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A young woman's hard-won future with her new husband is threatened by an enemy from her past.All of the characters we've come to love from The Grayson Trilogy are back as author Georgia Rose sets them off on new paths and also resolves longstanding mysteries. Rose gives us a meaty plot set firmly in Emma's point of view, which allows us to experience events as if we're there living through them. Departing from past installments, though, THICKER THAN WATER features a secondary POV, one which pops up at the most unexpected times and offers a tantalizing hint of rough waters ahead for our friends at the manor. I love how ambiguous this personality is at first. There's a darkness surrounding him, sure, but his intentions are not quite clear. When he does step into the light, not only does the game between Emma and her enemies turn on its head, but a slew of questions dangling from the previous novels are suddenly answered. Yet even these filled-in blanks don't lead to closure for Emma. Instead they free a deluge of pent-up emotions that are almost as big an obstacle to her happiness as the gang of Russian criminals out to kill her.The other side of the close focus on Emma's POV is that we can get caught up in her day-to-day activities to the point that the pacing of the narrative slows. I think it took a little too long for the suspense/danger element of this episode to come into play, but in return we do get plenty of deep character development. Plot vs. character is always a difficult battle. Throughout The Grayson Trilogy  Georgia Rose shows a knack for this balancing act.THICKER THAN WATER delivers the romance, suspense and, especially, the final satisfaction readers of this series pine for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I94OZJHZ3D5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014YQI22S#wasThisHelpful","R2I94OZJHZ3D5E","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A dying woman's obsession with her childhood ""friend"" follows her into an uneasy afterlife.Disclaimer: This isn't an easy book to review properly without spoiling. The story really needs to be experienced firsthand for the biggest impact, so forgive me for any vagueness here.HAUNTED HOUSE...HAUNTED LIFE starts out as a darkly funny drama, and the main character, Jeanne, seems like a long-suffering wife and mother yearning for one last contact with the only friend she's ever had. Things quickly turn on their head, however, and we learn that ""Anna Maria"" isn't quite who--or what--we think. Nor will Jeanne's search for her be as simple or straight forward as we expect. Instead we watch in stunned horror as the woman we've been rooting for with the batty husband and disappointing kids slowly twists into someone else altogether as her obsession ratchets higher and higher.At the same time as Jeanne struggles toward her goal, there's a secondary family tale going on. This one centers on parental love and the lengths some will go to in order to make amends to those most important to them. I love how, in a way, misguided, tragic Jeanne provides the opportunity for another remorseful soul, to find his way to reconciliation and peace.This is a funny, sad, moving book that I'll remember for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBH8RGDAM595/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014U9T1VK#wasThisHelpful","R3CBH8RGDAM595","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is nothing predictable about this collection of strange tales.The stories in THIRTEEN: A COLLECTION OF ODD TALES run the gamut from speculative fiction with a scientific edge to Gothic fiction to darkly humorous detective fiction. Nor are Spicer's characters any easier to pin down. They live in ambiguity and don't behave or react in the ways we might expect, like the loving mother in ""Angels"" whose grief leads her to the unthinkable, or the young lover in ""The Visit"" who, on a weekend holiday with a fascinating woman, somehow dreams every moment of their getaway before it happens.A couple of the stories go past ""odd"" into truly dark places. ""Night Caller"" had me checking that my windows and doors were locked tight. I couldn't stop squirming as I read ""Flashforward"". I kept hoping that somehow a last-minute miracle would reverse what we know from page one can never be undone.Taken as a whole, the tone of the collection is meditative, exploratory. It's almost as if Spicer set each story loose in its own glassed-in habitat and stepped back to see what would happen. What results is a wonderfully imaginative collection that never quite shows you its true face.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIFL667EMDK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125K8K3G#wasThisHelpful","R3GIFL667EMDK1","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A photographer forced to make her living as a member of the paparazzi unexpectedly finds herself on the other side of the camera lens and facing the sort of exposure that could ruin her career and her new relationship with a famous actor.Danica Bennett has had a rough life. She gets her love of photography from her mom, who raised her alone and now suffers early-onset Alzheimer's. Paying for her mother's care is one of the main reasons Danica continues working in a profession that undermines her moral and artistic ideals. The one person who might have been able to give her a hand up in Hollywood, an actress cousin, doesn't want to know her. At least not until Danica falls into a role on a hot new situation comedy and becomes a popular up-and-coming actress in her own right.Of course, if Danica's past publicly exposing fellow celebrities peccadilloes gets out--she's toast. Not that she's so in love with acting. But she may very well be in love with her handsome co-star Eliot Lane. There's a lot of excitement and tension as Danica's plan to silence the one person who knows her secret backfires and puts her into the power of someone even more vindictive and volatile.MAMARAZZI is funny, fast-paced, and full of twists. I didn't predict the resolution, but even though it was unexpected, it made perfect sense. My only issue with the book is that I found Eliot's character a bit underutilized. He's a great guy, but we needed more of him. He kind of fades into the background for the middle of the book, but he is pivotal to the ending.Even so, if you enjoy well-plotted, clean contemporary romances, you'll enjoy this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUBQ4JWBQTPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116CIWLO#wasThisHelpful","R1EUBQ4JWBQTPB","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received and ARC of this book for an honest review.A young woman moves to London after her mother's death and is swept into the arms of a movie star who is more than he seems.I've read all of the Cauld Ane books. It's a great series and BOUND BY LIGHT has one of the most endearing heroines. Sydney is likable and vulnerable. She has everything anyone could want on a material level, but she'd give it all away to have her mother back.Movie star (and Cauld Ane) Thane Allen is strong and protective without being overbearing. Though Sydney might disagree! She balks at his attempts to keep her safe from a stalker who turns out be far more dangerous and unhinged than anyone expected.I figured out WHO the villain was early on. So did Sydney, even if she didn't understand that she knew. The WHY behind it all did come as a surprise. Let's just say that at its core this book is about the mother-child bond--at its best and at its worst.The binding scene between Thane and Sydney could have been more sensual. I'm not saying Jackson should have been more graphic in her depiction of their coming together. I do think it was noticeably underwritten. Sex aside, it would have been nice to know more about what Thane and Sydney were feeling and thinking at this pivotal moment.Also, the pacing between the 50% and 80% points lags a little as we follow Thane and Sydney from home visit to home visit to home visit. It is nice to catch up with the previous Cauld Ane couples, but all the relatives and their wonderful estates do begin to blur together.The climax makes up for the travel section. The villain is SCARY and it's heartbreaking when Sydney learns that her childhood memories are not the whole truth. I can't say more without spoiling the story.BOUND BY LIGHT is romantic and suspenseful. Five stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWJFR8RQLCBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVN70UO#wasThisHelpful","RQWJFR8RQLCBC","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A woman's cancer diagnosis leads her to transform her comfortable but unfulfilled life.Ariana Logan appears to have it all. She's beautiful, well off, and is the majority owner of the most successful real estate firm in town. She also lost her mother and her older sister to breast cancer. So when she's diagnosed with the disease, it doesn't come as a surprise to her. It is, however, the catalyst for a complete reevaluation of her marriage and work life.Ingram is careful to make Ariana's transformation from privileged doormat to self-directed independent woman gradual and believable. Ariana's support system...her grandmother, her best friend...play key roles in encouraging her to change and then supporting her fledgling attempts. Also believable is the rapid-fire attraction between Ariana and tattoo artist Blaine Bennett.Blaine's love-at-first-sight reaction works because Ingram delays his and Ariana's meeting and then uses geographical separation (and a carefully plotted misunderstanding) to put the brakes on the developing relationship. This flies in the face of conventional romance fiction, where the hero and heroine are never separated for very long. It succeeds here thanks to the rich backstories Ingram provides each character. They have genuine work lives and genuine romantic pasts. This makes for more complicated characters and a richer plot.The setting (British Columbia) provides another enjoyable dimension to the story. Ariana has a strong sensitivity to place. She appreciates the beauties of her quaint town and that is part of what makes her profession (and her success at it) seem so believable. Also, the scenes at the seaside resort where she hides away to heal and, later, reconnects with Blaine are among the best in the book.If I have one complaint, it's how Ingram handles Blaine's interactions with certain supporting characters. There's a degree of conversation rehashing that becomes noticeable and weighs down an otherwise well-paced narrative. Also, Ariana's husband and mother-in-law come off as a bit over the top in their behavior and attitudes. Ingram adds more complexity to Jeremy by the end of the book, but his character doesn't ring as true as the others in the cast.On the whole, FOREVER CHANGED is a well developed story told with emotion and sensitivity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MUID850X47Q4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QFWB7K#wasThisHelpful","R1MUID850X47Q4","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young woman whose marriage has hit a rough patch returns to her hometown and helps local authorities investigate a series of unexpected deaths.Fiona Quinn manages to pack a lot of story into this novella without making the pacing feel rushed. Kate Hamilton, forced to leave her home in Boston due to her soldier husband's PTSD, returns to the small Virginia town where she grew up at around the same time as her ornery Uncle Owen dies of what seems like a heart attack. Kate is there to work as a CSI intern with the local police department. Tim Gibbons, her supervisor, also happens to be her first love. He's now married with children, but he's still obviously attracted to her. Their history and a tangled situation with a neighbor interested in opening a lucrative mining operation mean that Kate is stepping into a snake pit of conflict and competing agendas. It's against this chaotic background that she discovers suspicious connections between several recent deaths--including her Uncle Owen's.Scarborough is depicted with such detail that I felt I could locate the place on a map. All the quaint beauties of small-town life bump up against the seething resentments and never-ending feuds that often infect such insular places. The town is populated with a nice mix of expected southern characters--the rich girl whose sparkling life isn't what it seems, the bigger-than-life politician who may or may not be for sale, the blustering high school bully who grew into a threatening schemer, the local busybody who spreads venomous rumors as unfounded as they are damaging.Though readers will be familiar with all of these ""types,"" Quinn makes each one interesting and a bit more complicated than they might appear.The romantic tension between Kate and Tim is perfectly balanced. We sense that there is something there, but this potential for sparks doesn't undermine our belief in Kate's feelings for or loyalty to Ryan, her troubled husband. Kate and Tim's backstory feeds a lot of present tension. It would have been a little more exciting if we got to meet Tim's insecure wife. She makes a brief appearance and is referred to, but that's about it.I'm on the fence about Quinn's ending. I don't want to spoil it for you. I'll just say that I expected Kate to be the one who unveiled the killer. She closes on the How and the Why of the killings. The Who is discovered and neutralized by the least likely character in the book. Looking back, this is a clever move, as (along with Kate) we are forced to completely reevaluate our alliances.  At the time I first read it, though, I felt a little cheated.The discomfort was momentary.MINE is a well-paced mystery packed with character and suspense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L03WU5TI63JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4UAB8K#wasThisHelpful","R3L03WU5TI63JZ","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An overweight school teacher spends her Christmas holidays in Spain where she meets a mysterious man and an even more mysterious fate.As this paranormal story is quite short, there isn't too much I can say without spoiling it for you. June is a teacher with no social life to speak of. Fed up with being taken for granted by her slimmer sisters and needy mother, she takes off for Spain in a kind of glorious rebellion. The tiny village is just what she wanted, and she settles in for what she expects will be a relaxing and uneventful stay. Then, while losing track of time during an evening walk, she meets a gentlemen whose courtly behavior and obvious interest in her raises the possibility of romance. But this Don Juan is much more than he seems.Twist's writing is solid. In roughly 36 pages, she manages to make June believable and likable, and she does a wonderful job with her settings. Both June's life in England and her time in Spain seemed real to me. Twist's pacing is perfect. There's just enough suspense to keep you turning the pages until that shocking final image hits you in the gut.Though this is the first story in a series, I wouldn't call the ending a cliffhanger. The kindle version I read included the opening of the next story. The transition between the first and second installments is smooth, and the timeline is maintained, which helps keep you oriented.MANTEQUERO is a short, entertaining horror story that leaves you eager for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30HR63CPKRY4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHIRA0U#wasThisHelpful","R30HR63CPKRY4F","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young doctoral student recovering from setbacks in her career and love life is pursued by a werewolf who resents that she's his natural mate.This story is the third entry in J.S. Scott's Changeling Encounters paranormal series. It's the most developed of the three. Both Faith and Gavin have back stories weighing on them. The romance isn't simply a matter of the werewolf convincing the human that they are meant to be. Gavin thought he'd found his mate once before and it ended in heartache. So he hates romance and he hates Christmas.Faith's last lover stabbed her in the back by stealing her research and using it to get the job she wanted. Her feelings--anger, pain, distrust--are realistic. Unfortunately, Scott undermined my suspension of disbelief by not filling the situation in better. First of all, there's no explanation of how Faith's research was stolen. Every PhD student has an adviser and a committee overseeing their work from well before the research begins. Perhaps an adviser could steal research. But another student? Also, this ""job"" Faith lost out on is never specified. PhD students don't compete for ""jobs.""  They battle for prestigious research fellowships, grants, and university teaching positions. This may seem like I'm quibbling, but we're supposed to believe this bright young woman with an advanced education is now scratching to survive. So the reason behind her problem needs to be convincing.A good book, but a bit more research would have turned this four-star short into a five star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EITODPLVY5NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANX5ZPO#wasThisHelpful","R2EITODPLVY5NG","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young illustrator picking up the pieces of her life after a time of tragedy takes home a stray puppy only to discover he's a werewolf.This is the second story in J.S. Scott's Changeling Encounters paranormal series. I was glad to find it much better developed than MATE OF THE WEREWOLF. There's tension from the first page as Rafe Lancaster, stays outside too long in his wolf form, is on the run from hunters. He makes himself as small as possible and hides. Zoey Hall discovers him during a walk in the woods. The tension escalates as readers wait for her to figure out what she's brought home.The romance develops nicely. There's more of an arc to the relationship than in Scott's first story. Still, by not delving deeper into Zoey's past, the author misses an excellent opportunity to build the character.THE DANGERS OF ADOPTING A WEREWOLF has a great premise and is an overall quick, fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IK85G5IKTNTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085BLGUY#wasThisHelpful","R2IK85G5IKTNTP","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The future of a veterinarian's wildlife sanctuary is at stake when her biggest donor, a changeling-werewolf, tries to convince her that she's his destined mate.This story has a great premise and the bones of some interesting characters. Problem is that the author doesn't take the time to develop either. The Amazon listing says it's 39 pages, but the font has to be twice the standard 12-point, taking the length down to about 19 pages. Maybe. But 19 pages could be enough if Scott gave us a little more depth. Even a short story needs a little meat...a respectable beginning, middle and end. There's no middle to this one. We never really know what billionaire Noah does that makes him so wealthy. Nor do we get to spend time watching Grace work either as a vet or at her sanctuary. The relationship develops through phone conversations that we never get to hear.What we do get is a couple of hot sex sessions and a lot of telling versus showing.I will say that the other two stories in the Changeling Encounters series are more developed, so maybe Scott was finding her footing here. Both THE DANGERS OF ADOPTING A WEREWOLF and ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS A WEREWOLF are worth a look. I hope Scott goes back and reworks this one, because the idea has plenty of potential.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GE9DQ3XVJKCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00817F90U#wasThisHelpful","R1GE9DQ3XVJKCD","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A pop star fights her feelings for her bodyguard as she struggles to break free from her overbearing manager/mother and evade a disturbed ex.Abby Murphy spent her whole childhood building what is now a stellar performing career. She seems to have it all--money, fame, and a sexy guitarist boyfriend. As FINDING US opens, we learn that public appearances are often illusions. Abby's mother Vivian not only runs her career, she dictates Abby's life. This includes pressuring her to stay with an abusive boyfriend for contractual and publicity reasons. Abby's only support comes from her assistant/best friend Sophie and her bodyguard Danny Nucci. These two become pivotal to Abby's emotional and physical well being when her ex's pressure to reconcile turns into a nightmarish case of stalking and her mother refuses to take the threat seriously.Presley does a wonderful job of taking Abby from a smothered, somewhat naive ""asset"" to a mature, self-directed adult. It isn't a quick or easy path. Abby doesn't suddenly wake up prepared to take on her iron-willed (and iron-hearted) mother. At first, Abby she'd much rather give in and keep life quiet. It might have been an option if ex-boyfriend Sean was simply annoying or even annoying and unfaithful. I could definitely see Abby choosing to play a part to shut her mother up. But Sean can't hide his violent and obsessive nature. Fear forces Abby to take a stand. It's only later, when she has a taste of independence (painful as it is at first), does Abby continue standing up for herself by choice.Danny Nucci provides a safe haven for Abby. At first it's an emotional haven. He takes her fears seriously, encourages her to fight, and isn't afraid to get in Vivian's face when Abby isn't strong or confident enough to take the woman on. Later, after Abby barely escapes being kidnapped by Sean, the safe haven is literal. The scenes that take place in Danny's Lake George hideaway are some of the best in the book.The romance between Abby and Danny develops slowly. We readers are privy to how they both feel, but the obstacles standing in the way of them expressing themselves and, later, acting on their feelings are real. Often in this type of romance, the suspense wavers (or pauses) as the characters' relationship blooms. Not the case here. Suspense permeates every chapter.Presley also does a great job making Abby's superstar life seem realistic. The opulence is tempered with enough gritty reality so that we don't mistake this for a celebrity fairy tale.There are a couple bumps in the characterization. I think Vivian is a bit over-the-top. Presley tries to humanize her by seeding in details of her tough past and the demons that drive her to behave the way she does. But it's too little too late with this one. More subtlety early on would have enriched the character and added to the Vivian-Abby dynamics. It also would have made Abby's conflict about breaking away even more pointed. The only other issue I had was with Abby's tendency to keep important developments, mostly about Sean, away from Danny. The first time, she does it out of concern for Danny's career. After that, when she knows how high the stakes are, it seems silly to hide calls and threats.FINDING US is true romantic suspense. If this is Presley's debut novel, I can't wait to see what her future work will bring. I predict a lot of good reading ahead!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZ2QOS214SZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012933PHK#wasThisHelpful","RAZ2QOS214SZG","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* Author provided a copy of the book for review.A silly love game played by three witch sisters goes too far, threatening their relationship and their lives.The dynamics between the Knoah triplets are complex and layered. Their parents are divorced, and their father is a workaholic/control freak. Kristen is desperate to impress him through her grades and her plans to become a business whiz. Her sisters don't offer much solace. They act more like twins, with Brittany taking the lead in most matters.The simmering rivalry between ""perfect"" Kristen and ""edgy"" Brittany is what leads to big trouble. Each is determined to win this year's game--basically bewitching a boy and having him do her bidding. Brittany challenges Kristen to ""Crush"" Zack, THE most menacing boy in school. What they don't know is that Zack isn't what he appears, he's onto their game, and he plans to teach Kristen a lesson.Problem is that Zack has a secret of his own. Can't say more without spoiling the plot, but Zack's got serious family issues and a dangerous blind spot.Kristen and Zack's relationship develops at a nice, suspense-filled pace. He really puts her through the wringer. To the point where I would have paid Brittany her winnings and cut my losses. Yet the couple does stumble (grumpily) into a romance, only to find their futures and lives on the line.As much as I enjoyed the book, there were some rough spots for me. The whole idea that being accused of witchcraft will immediately strip a witch of her powers doesn't work on a logical level. Basically anybody can strip a witch of her power at any time. It's too big of a weakness. Why bother fearing a witch or her power?Discontinuity in the action also posed a problem. Some of the most dramatic episodes are never fully developed. Instead, Blake jumps ahead and we find out the results/consequences in hindsight. For example, Kristen's social downfall happens largely off stage. Even the final climax suffers from this. Lots of the battle is summarized. We're not given enough detail to pull us in.Still, CRUSHED is full of romance and chills. And since I got teary watching Kristen's struggles, it earned its five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28B54C6CVNHW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y777UFU#wasThisHelpful","R28B54C6CVNHW5","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Author provided a copy of the book for review.A beautiful young widow suspected of murdering her elderly husband is forced by the King of England into marriage to a hot-blooded knight determined to discover the truth.Alden starts this medieval romance with a bang. Sir Marcus Blackwell has ordered his second in command to drag Lady Ann down to their wedding naked if he has to. She isn't quite naked when Thomas D'Agostine accomplished his mission, but she is bound, bruised, and wearing underclothes that leave little to the imagination. She's also not the hag, Marcus expected.Marcus is also something of a surprise to Lady Ann. Having been brutalized by her first husband, who died under bloody and unexplained circumstances, she expects a sadistic monster who will likely have her hanged as soon as the wedding is consummated. Even if he doesn't, she figures he'll just take her land and breed her for heirs like some sow. The nickname that followed him home from the crusades--The Beast of Thornhill--doesn't help.Getting past these initial mistaken impressions of one another is a huge endeavor, and it's not even the biggest obstacle they face. England in 1276 is a lethal environment. There's a church infested with evil men hungry for two things: gold and witches to burn. For Lady Ann the former is likely to lead to the latter. When the local bishop isn't causing trouble, there's Ann's half-witted sheep-stealing neighbor eager to align himself with Marcus's villainous father. And to top it all off, every time Marcus uncovers one of his complicated wife's secrets, there are two or three more to contend with. And that's not counting the Venetian glassblower.The period details are well chosen to immerse us in the setting without burying us there. Marcus and Ann share enough genuine chemistry to make up for the overwrought fits of temper they each indulge in now and again. Lady Ann is vulnerable, frightened and yet has an iron core. Sir Marcus is a generally honorable guy in search of a little peace and domesticity after years of bloodletting on foreign battlefields. We want them to trust each other, and it kills us that every step forward on that score is followed by two steps back. But that's what keeps us turning the pages.I did find a couple of rough transitions. Most are minor. One was majorly irritating. On one of the occasions when Marcus is following Ann to learn more about her wicked ways, they end up at a mysterious cottage. Then the scene is over and we don't find out until later that he witnessed her in an amazing knife fighting training session with another woman. We should have BEEN there, seeing it with him. Not listening to him confront her about it later. Sure, we get some good details, but it's all second hand.There's a lot of physical violence toward Lady Ann. When it's a villain knocking her around, I can accept it as part of the story. That behavior from Sir Marcus and Thomas D'Agostine, even if Ann's being difficult, made me think less of them. Yes, it was a brutal time period.  But both men should have been above such reactions. I think true chivalry would've demanded it, even if it took every ounce of control in the men's bodies. In my experience, a hero with hand problems only works in those mega-long bodice rippers, where the reformed hero has enough time to erase our memory of the creep. My opinion of Marcus managed to survive. But Thomas left me annoyed and wishing the Turks had succeeded in gutting him.On the whole, though, if you like passionate, emotionally charged historical romance, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR KNIGHT is the book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114JZ9DE00E9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRNKOOU#wasThisHelpful","R114JZ9DE00E9M","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* Author provided a copy of the book for review.A troubled young man forced to take part in a family vacation meets a young woman with a secret of her own.Lucassen does a good job building the mystery surrounding both Dan and Lynn. Dan's issue, while hard on him, is nowhere near as devastating as Lynne's. Yet his behavior is so much more self-destructive than hers. He can be incredibly unpleasant. It's irritating in a way, but when we do find out what Lynne is hiding, the revelation is all the more powerful because she's been so thoughtful and reserved throughout. It also shocks Dan out of his self-indulgence and forces him to put someone else's well being ahead of his own regrets and resentments.There's good character development. The author does a great job portraying  wounded people and struggling with huge obstacles. The romantic tension is generally strong, and  sex scenes are tasteful and fitted to the plot.The pacing is a bit slow at the start, but it does allow us a chance to know the characters. I wish I had as good a sense of the setting. Both the island resort and the scenes back in the Netherlands seemed rather undefined. Lucassen, a unique new voice in New Adult fiction, could have done more here to make the novel a bit more DUTCH.I also found the English translation problematic in places. Overall the errors are small and amusing. Two of them, though, interfered with the plot. First, the younger children Lynn is responsible for are referred to as ""toddlers."" Yet we know by how these characters speak and act that they have to be at least four and probably five or six. Since this age group becomes important to the action, an accurate understanding of what the author means is important. Also, Lynn's position at the resort is ""animator."" Call someone an ""animator"" in English, and we assume they draw cartoons for a living. ""Livley"" or ""Energetic"" has become a secondary definition of the word not often used in contemporary fiction. I don't intend to be picky, but the word is used a dozen times or more, and it distracted me each time, especially at the beginning when I was trying to understand who Lynn was and what she was doing at the resort.As a whole, HEAT offers a rich, emotionally intense reading experience. I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWPZWEMWKBL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WXI5E3K#wasThisHelpful","R1EWPZWEMWKBL9","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* Author provided a copy of the book for review.Three stories starring a genteel tomcat and his kangaroo best friend.Oliver has a distinct voice and a rather urbane outlook on life for a cat living in the Australian outback. In ""Who Am I?"", he's hit on the head and loses his memory. He wanders around asking every creature he meets if they know him. One animal in particular tries to use Oliver's injury to get himself a free lunch...Oliver!In ""Up a Tree"", Oliver explores a tall tree and meets a variety of animals. Not all are thrilled with his dropping by without an invitation. The whimsical beings at the very top came as a surprise. Their little dance made me smile. Each story usually has a fun little twist at the end. Either an unexpected turn of events or an amusing play on words.""Moon Crystal"" has Oliver and jumpy traveling to the moon to recover some special crystals that are essential to the well being of mankind. How they get there had me shaking my head. No rockets or launch pads for Oliver!I read the kindle version on an older e-reader with a black and white display, so I didn't get the full effect of the many illustrations. However, the drawings complemented the story and punched up the humor. I imagine the full-color versions must be even better, especially judging from the cover image on Amazon.OLIVER AND JUMPY will delight young children and early readers. They'll get a lot of laughs out of Oliver's lively personality and poor sensible Jumpy's attempts to rein him in before his enthusiasm and curiosity go too far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFG69Y65QAK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMKWMD0#wasThisHelpful","R2YFG69Y65QAK8","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A young tiger shifter escapes from a Lithuanian brothel only to risk her hard-won freedom (and her life) when she returns to put an end to the operation.I received a print copy of the first book in this series, BLOOD FEST: CHASING DESTINY, from the author and loved it so much I immediately downloaded CURSING FATE and read it straight through the night. Almost everything works in this book. From page one, we care intensely about Tabby and the three youngsters she takes with her when she breaks out of sexual bondage and travels across Europe to the safety of England. She heads there because it's the home of her only living relative. Chase Alcott--now Fernwood--is the heroine of CHASING DESTINY.Before she can meet Chase, Tabby must face the leader of the local Weretiger pride. Drake Gatos and Gray, his second in command, were in book one, and it's great to see them play a more central part in the action. The romantic tension between Tabby and Drake is palpable. The erotic aspect builds more slowly. This is good call by author Pepper O'Neal, as it aligns with the horrific nature of Tabby's background. Total trust between the pair takes even more work. Tabby has a plan to destroy the brothel once and for all, and she knows overprotective (and kind of overbearing) Drake will try to leave her out of the mission.Drake is a little thick-headed about things. For me, the only rough spot in the book was watching his missteps with Tabby. I know it was all in the service of telling an exciting story. But he's such a dolt at one point, that it wasn't only Gray who wanted to beat the stuffing out him.It's a testament to O'Neal's skill at creating believable characters that the INSANE secret plan Tabby and Chase come up to destroy the brothel seems reasonable. Of course, the operation doesn't go quite as they imagined, which means lots of action and suspense for readers. It also provides a chance to meet up with Danyer, head of the Los Angeles pride. He's a favorite of mine from book one, and I hope he eventually gets to star in a Blood Fest book.The climax is a nail biter. Even better, we're left with a brand new mystery. Why does Echo, one of the female weres Tabby saved, beg the others not to contact her family now that she's free?Book three, where are you?????","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFXILHI6FUNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006HKHXBG#wasThisHelpful","R2LFXILHI6FUNY","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the death of a family friend leads journalist Lukas Novak to investigate a cluster of strange deaths in a nursing home, he uncovers a diabolical scheme with roots deep in the past.This is a prequel to MATCH GAMES, a full length Lukas Novak mystery. That book kept me on my toes from first page to last. THE LAST COVERT has the same complex characterization and an equally intricate plot. We get to meet Lukas in a dark hour. His marriage is over and his wife is bent on alienating him from his children and ruining him financially. Poor guy can't take a breath without fear that something negative will be reported back to her attorney and used to bankrupt him. To be fair, Lukas has spent his whole marriage hiding the fortune he inherited from his famous brother, a rock star whose recordings still bring in a tidy sum long after his unhappy death.The point here is that Lukas is in a fragile frame of mind as the book opens during the funeral of a close friend. This emotional vulnerability clouds his judgement as he investigates the events surrounding the man's death and the surprising beneficiaries of his will. I don't want to tell too much. I'll just say Lukas isn't prepared for the extent of the conspiracy he's stumbled upon. Nor is he aware how deep in the past the seeds of the crime are buried. The villain behind it all isn't just some murdering con man out to get his hands on the victims' worldly goods. There's a deep pathology involved. A terrible history that will repeat and repeat unless Lukas can put a stop to it. And it's not clear that he'll be able to do that.It's amazing to me how much character and suspense Schirmer packs into this relatively short work. Yet the pacing is right on. There's no sense that she's cramming in plot points or forcing the action.THE LAST CONVERT is a gritty and action-packed  thriller that will keep your heart pounding until the very end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTL1IDMNV84YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IYL1JA#wasThisHelpful","RTL1IDMNV84YQ","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When journalist Pat Wyatt and her werewolf lover flee Louisiana to escape her otherworldly ex husband, they never expect to face an even more dangerous foe.Sexy and sarcastic Pat is back in all her bad-tempered splendor in this follow up to GRAVEYARD SHIFTS. As the book opens, her new life in bayou country isn't going as planned. Her obsessive ex has a long reach, and he's basically left Mike-the-werewolf without the proverbial pot to you-know-what in and also without the means to earn money for another. Meanwhile, Pat's new boss is a misogynistic pain in the neck, who nevertheless begins to pursue her in a most unprofessional manner.It turns out that Pat has more to worry about than a complicated love life. Seems someone's out to kill her. Her ex is at the top of her suspect list, but things aren't what they appear, and Pat must face the hard truth that some battles must be fought even if they are unwinnable.It was great meeting up with the characters from the first book. Laura Del adds to what we know about them...or shows us how we didn't know them at all. New flaws and new strengths make for plenty of exciting conflict. Pat is tested on so many levels, it's hard to bear at times. You just feel so bad for the girl. I do wish the identity of the main villain was kept a mystery for a little longer. I think this would have made the book even scarier. The climax manages to tie up enough of the plot to be satisfying, while still leaving plenty to look forward to in the next installment.I enjoyed DUELING MOONS. It's a perfect mix of laughs, chills and tears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO4BK0WLJ6Z4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZFSS14#wasThisHelpful","RO4BK0WLJ6Z4E","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A family torn apart by a road accident learns that this life is not the end.Lindy is a happy-go-lucky kid raised by her widowed father after her mother dies in a car accident on the night of her birth. Through the years, Lindy has felt a close connection to her mother, as if the woman is close by. This link between worlds becomes crucial when an innocent party game unleashes an evil entity bent on destroying Lindy. Is a mother's love strong enough to reach beyond the veil separating life and death?This story surprised me. It began as a sweet, sad tale of a young mother taken too soon, and her child's efforts to maintain some kind of contact with her. I was unprepared for the dark turn the plot takes at about the 50% mark. Things get scary. Winn never gives the evil spirit stalking Lindy a name or a history, but she doesn't have to. He's the embodiment of every closet, under-the-bed, shadowy corner monster that's ever terrified us.I love that Winn puts her character into real danger, and it's never a given that Lindy will survive. The girl's terror brought tears to my eyes. I finished the book early in the morning and felt unsettled as I shut my bedroom light. Definitely glad I had my dogs in bed with me!Another nice aspect of COLLISIONS is the depiction of a close father-daughter relationship. Too often these days parents are made out to be villains or at least obstacles to a teen's happiness. Lindy has another healthy friendship on her side...Carly is a true pal, who doesn't hesitate to put herself into danger to fix a problem she helped cause.Finally, just when you think all will be normal, there's a little tease at the end that hint...maybe not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39H8PTXDFLL4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE7W6BK#wasThisHelpful","R39H8PTXDFLL4D","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nursing a passion for his best friend's girl, Reckless Beat drummer Sean Taiden needs a distraction and makes a play for a choreographer, but Melody Jenkins has secrets of her own.It sure is nice to be back with the Reckless Beat gang. In SULTRY GROOVE, we're still dealing with the aftermath of the Mason-Sydney-Sean scandal explored in UNDESIRED LUST. Sean, odd man out now that Sydney and Mason have found each other, is in a bad frame of mind. He harbors lingering feelings for Sydney and a general envy of the romantic relationships his bandmates now enjoy. This is coupled with a growing dissatisfaction with his lack of professional and public recognition. He's the least popular guy in the band, but he also does very little to put himself out there and gain public attention. This is about to change. Sean will have a star turn--literally--in the band's latest music video.Melody Jenkins is the choreographer hired to craft a special dance number. A year ago, she was at the top of her career, a sought-after professional working with some of the biggest names in the music industry. That all changed one afternoon (can't go into detail or it'll ruin the suspense). Melody is not the dancer she once was...or at least that's what she believes. This epic change also transformed her personal life, turning a once confident and sexually adventurous woman into a virtual hermit.When Sean starts his brash campaign to seduce Melody, she's conflicted. She knows he's a player. The old Melody wouldn't care, since she was an even bigger player her. This Melody, though, is unsure of herself and afraid to get hurt.SULTRY GROOVE is a sensual book. Summers puts Sean and Melody through a lot of angst and soul searching. Melody has it harder than Sean. His biggest issue is deciding what he really wants out of life...especially when increasing public notice proves to be more annoying than it is exciting. Melody's problem runs deeper, though I think it gets dragged out a bit too far. Still, the feelings are genuine and there's no quick or easy resolution. I like that Melody isn't ""fixed"" by the end.Of course, one of the best parts of a Reckless Beat book is catching up with all the characters from earlier installments. Ryan's marital problems, a subplot throughout the series, come to a head and the fallout causes a shocking upset in band dynamics. This is good for us readers...I figure Ryan and Leah's story is in the works. Can't wait!UNDESIRED LUST is still my favorite book in the series, but SULTRY GROOVE is a lot of fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU0VAYOCJRBO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US8A64E#wasThisHelpful","RU0VAYOCJRBO8","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A short, beautifully illustrated introduction to China for young readers.This book attempt to give children a brief, flavorful introduction to the geography and culture of China. Each two-page section takes on a specific aspect of the nation...geography, history, food...and included boxed text and a lavish illustration. The text presents Chinese terms along with a bracketed phonetic pronunciation. By the end of the book, the reader has a nice handful of useful Chinese vocabulary words and phrases.I did find the text a bit cramped and the text boxes dark, especially in contrast to the light, bright and generously proportioned illustrations. I read the book on a new tablet with back lighting and I had to almost squint to make out some of the text. Part of the issue is likely the black font is enclosed in a burnt orange text box. A paler color would've worked better. And taking the font up even one or two points would have made a big difference.Overall a fun and informative book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUFCCYBGP39U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7FR4V6#wasThisHelpful","R3RUFCCYBGP39U","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* Author provided an advanced reading copy in return for a fair and honest reviewA young artist is rescued from public humiliation by a handsome stranger and becomes embroiled in a dangerous family feud.I love Julie Johnson's books. Her amazing SAY THE WORD remains one of my favorite reads in recent memory. ERASING FAITH and LIKE GRAVITY are close runners up. So when I got the opportunity to get an early look at Julie's latest, I couldn't get to my Kindle fast enough!Gemma Summers is not good with relationships. As the book opens, she is in the midst of her first ""real"" relationship and it's pretty gloomy. Ralph is rude, crude and cold. The situation implodes at the fateful basketball game Gemma's gone out of her way to get tickets for. When the kiss-cam falls on them, Ralph blows her off in favor of a cell phone conversation. She's saved by Chase Croft, who doesn't mind kissing her one bit.Thus begins an attraction that neither Chase nor Gemma is prepared for.For Gemma the issue is one of low-to-no self-confidence, especially once she finds out who Chase is. She's sure there's no way this rich, successful, sought-after Adonis could be interested in her. Chase's hesitancy is more complicated. He's got family trouble and he doesn't want to drag Gemma into it.There's a lot of romantic tension in this book and, as the pair come together, it transforms into suspense as ""will they or won't they"" becomes a question of Gemma's survival. Johnson does a good job slowly building the drama. The readers, like Gemma, don't realize how truly dangerous the situation has gotten until there's no way out.What helps is that there are multiple villains, and they each have specific motives for wanting to hurt Gemma. How Johnson ends up linking all of these motives is pretty clever and leads to unexpected twists. At the same time, Gemma's personal history provides another layer of complication. At the same time as she's trying to stay safe, her whole understanding of her parents is rocked.Gemma isn't alone in her struggles. Johnson has given her a great support system. Chrissy, Mark, and Shelby provide lots of comic relief and added interest. Phoebe and Knox are two other side characters I would have loved to see more of. Fingers crossed that we'll get a follow-up to NOT YOU IT'S ME.My only quibble with the book is how well off most of the characters are--whether they know it or not. Not only does all this wealth undermine the realism of the story, it makes things a little too easy for everyone. They have so many resources to call upon. That said, the ending puts Gemma to the test. I wasn't so sure how she'd survive that climactic scene.NOT YOU IT'S ME is a deftly plotted novel with a cute beginning that leaves readers delightfully unprepared for the suspenseful ride that's in store for them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US08L33GYD4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE34OQE#wasThisHelpful","R1US08L33GYD4S","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received this product in exchange for an honest reviewI take fish oil as part of a supplement regimen recommended by my physician's assistant. She suggested using it in conjunction with Niacin to promote cardiovascular health. I normally get my supplements at Wal-Mart or the grocery store, and I was interested to see if a ""premium"" product would deliver results that justified paying a bit more.Took a while to get to the product because I was in the middle of a bottle of my regular brand and you just can't leave these supplements sitting around in an open container. From what I've read (and my research is admittedly limited) fish oil can go rancid and become toxic. I was eventually able to start the product.It's hard to evaluate something that is meant to work over a long time horizon. I've been taking the product for about five weeks. I can't say that there's a sudden spring in my step or anything, but there are no unpleasant fish odors, tastes, or burps. It didn't bother my stomach, which is sensitive enough that I live on probiotics. One benefit I found is that these 1400 mg softgels are much smaller than the 1000 mg ones I usually take. I don't feel as if I'm taking a horse pill every morning.It's not easy assigning a star rating to this kind of product...If you have the budget for a premium fish oil supplement, this is seems to be a good one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WBENNRV9VE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R56IX6A#wasThisHelpful","R30WBENNRV9VE6","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anthropologist and author Mary Catherine Bateson (daughter of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson) wrote that ""we are not what we know but what we are willing to learn."" I don't think I had a concrete example of this philosophy--that the most important thing one can learn is HOW to learn--until I read 50 SHADES OF GRADES, Andrew Nixon's account of how a late-blooming kid whose schoolwork was mediocre at best ended up not only earning a Doctorate degree in education, but built a life within and beyond academia.This son of Eastern European immigrants starts his story in steel-milling Pittsburgh and recounts how a series of apparent accidents led him to a top private university in Utah and a career in teaching that spanned several states and every grade level from elementary through university. He accomplished all of this while working various demanding side jobs. Fair warning, Nixon's idea of a ""sideline"" is often a hilarious understatement. Decades working in the livery business? Starting his own hugely successful company providing promotional products to the advertising industry? Designing the programs for whole new schools? His sidelines exhausted me just reading about them.Don't let Nixon's light, happy-go-lucky tone and humorous style fool you. There's a keen intelligence at work here. I go so far to say that very little of what he presents as ""accidental"" is actually happenstance. Nixon may not have been a natural-born genius, but his sharp observational skills and an almost superhuman work ethic carried him way further than even the straightest of straight-A students. There's a special power that comes with true self-knowledge and the ability to not only see opportunities but CREATE them.Nixon's story isn't all rainbows and birdsong. At times, his dedication to work and to his own continued improvement strained his personal relationships. There are several instances in his professional life where his good intentions and honest efforts bumped up against immovable obstacles--big egos and big bureaucracies are often allergic to innovation. What I love is how Nixon never accepts the limits set by others. And when the naysayers get him mad enough...well...he'll build his own path right around them. Failures become stepping stones. The Cowboy Christmas debacle comes to mind. A business reversal that would have sent most of us running from entrepreneurship with our tails between our legs was a mere detour for Nixon and Promotions By Pat, the company he built with his wife.In short, FIFTY SHADES OF GRADES is an entertaining memoir about a lousy student who nevertheless learns how to learn and has some amazing life experiences in the process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZTP05950DIDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989085406#wasThisHelpful","R1ZTP05950DIDY","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She's funny and annoying. Her talkativeness can grate a little, but she'd be the first to tell you that she knows this and can't help it. Mack isn't my favorite Dog of Fire...That's still Ace from book 3...but he's appealing. His dialog and insights about women, and Darien specifically, can be a little too on the nose. I never quite forgot that this is a man being written by a woman.I prefer a longer build up in my romances. A little more push and pull at the start. But there's plenty of chemistry between Mack and Darien. And let's not forget Barney. This a-dog-able canine get lots of screen time, including some really dramatic scenes. We also get to catch up with some of our favorite characters from both the Dogs of Fire and the Guardian series, including tantalizing hints about who the next DoF book might center on. I'm betting on Kim and Knight.At first ROAD TO PASSION seemed to have little conflict to hang the plot on. Mack's a player. Darien's an innocent. A divide but not a huge one. Especially considering the problems faced by some of the other couples in this series. But Davenport pulls a big one over on us. The danger sneaks up so slowly, it catches you when you least expect it. The climax is a heart stopper.

"A troubled young woman returns to the seaside village of her childhood determined to discover the truth behind her aunt's shocking death.WITCH BAY captured my imagination on so many levels. The setting is beautifully rendered--a small village on the rocky coast of Wales. The atmosphere is heavy with dread from page one. It brought to mind the work of Daphne du Maurier. Especially her wonderful JAMAICA INN.The characters are varied and quirky. You don't know who to trust. I didn't even fully trust Bethan. She's an odd sort of heroine. Vulnerable but prickly. Earnest but perhaps not completely reliable. A woman of good intentions but questionable judgement. Gwyn, the local police officer, is just as layered. At first glance he seems the quintessential small village Bobby, but his easy-going demeanor masks a keen mind and powerful instincts. The sparks between Gwyn and Bethan take a little time to ignite, mostly because neither one seems to know what to make of the other.The sense of time in the first few chapters is a little disorienting. At points Bethan's childhood reflections get mixed up with her feelings about the present. It took me a little while to figure out how long her aunt's been dead and when the last time Bethan saw her. Also, the book takes place in the mid 1980s, though you don't learn this until chapter four. At first the author's decision to set the book when she did seemed odd, but it makes sense once we discover details of the crime at the center of the mystery. I can't go into specifics without spoiling the story, except to say that the plot likely would not have worked after the formation of the EU.The mystery itself isn't particularly complex. There are plenty of clues as to who is behind it, though one of the baddies did come as a major surprise. The fun is trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together. The item discovered under the floorboards, the local construction project that seems to have gone on forever, the seemingly random individuals who've gone missing over the past few years. The plotting is excellent, especially at the climax. I had no idea how Bethan was going to get out of the fix the villains had put her in.I do wish that Crompton had been a bit more generous with her denouement. Another three to five pages would have been enough. Allow us the pleasure of seeing what became of some of the other characters involved that exciting final battle.Overall, I had a good time with WITCH BAY. Crompton does a wonderful job mixing romance, suspense, and a good dose of humor. It's a fascinating little world she's created, and I enjoyed spending time there. I can definitely see myself giving this book a second read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TDMQDYEI0F6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJ2PIRY#wasThisHelpful","R2TDMQDYEI0F6K","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young woman receives a manuscript left to her by her great-grandfather that changes how she understands herself and the world.This unique literary novel is half warm family tale and half philosophical/spiritual meditation. When Ellen Marie takes her husband and baby daughter to visit her great-grandmother in South Florida, she has no idea of the treasure that's been kept for her. She was only five when she visited Papa and Nana in their Port Ludlow, WA condo, and never had the chance to return. Thus, her Papa didn't get the opportunity to pass along the life lessons he wanted her to have. But Ian Barrett MacLogan doesn't let a little thing like chronological time get in the way of such an important matter. He wrote a journal that covers a two-week vacation that he imagined would have happened when Ellen was twelve or so. During this imagined trip, he details all of their adventures and the words of wisdom he and his beloved wife shared with her.""Well, remember, Nana and I promised some time back to talk with you only about truth and not about facts.""The plot itself alternates smoothly between grown up Ellen's visit with Nana in Florida and this imagined visit to Port Ludlow. Both realities are filled with wonderful characters and finely wrought scenic descriptions that helped shape and advance the story. Through out the book, I felt as if I were right there. This grounding of the senses kept me tethered through the more abstract and esoteric discussions of the nature of the soul and its place both in creation and as co-creator of its own experience.McLendon has a warm, rich writing style that is full of humor. His characters are people you feel you know...or wish you knew. I felt a special affinity to Cy, Nana's elderly neighbor. He's a holocaust survivor, whose own experiences of the non-material kind leave him in need of daily assurance that he is, indeed, still among the living. Cy's wonderful mix of sprightly energy and human vulnerability made for some of the most memorable scenes, especially during the book's rather ""electrifying"" climax.PAPA'S GIFT made me laugh, cry, and wonder. It also left me remembering Papa's words of encouragement to Ellie about the time and pacing of her spiritual growth, an insight that I find myself repeating throughout the day: ""There is no deadline. There is no hurry. There is no rush hour in eternity.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RLI41ONXCS4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJ5CN12#wasThisHelpful","R1RLI41ONXCS4Q","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young werewolf who's spent her life in foster care finds her dream of being part of a real family threatened by a decades-long pack war.Giselle's had a tough childhood full of displacement and rejection. She's about given up hope that any of her foster placements will turn into a forever family. So when she ends up at Martina Hernandez's house, where her ""condition"" isn't a cause for immediate removal, she should be over the moon. Turns out being part of a pack requires a degree of commitment and submission (to the alpha) that she's not sure she's made for. Then she finds out that her new foster mom may not be all she seems. There's an ongoing pack war and it isn't clear which side is at fault. Giselle needs to discover the truth before she commits to her new life.Kadie Salidas does a good job giving us a layered heroine whose strengths and flaws vie for control of her better nature. As much as Giselle yearns to be part of something bigger than herself, experience has taught her that it's a mistake to rely on others. At times it's as if she looking for a reason to reject her new pack. Her relationship with her foster sisters is refreshingly normal--friends one minute, bickering the next. We learn no more about Taylor or Di's origins that we do about Giselle's. Taylor also seems to have some history with Damian, a witch. It becomes obvious that she cares for him, though his attention is fixed on Giselle, who is herself obsessing over the standoffish Asher.Asher isn't just cold...he's outright offensive. Over the course of the story, we see his mask slip a little, but not enough to really grasp what's going on inside until near the end. Even with his problems, Asher seems a better match for Giselle than Damian does. I never came to see Damian as more than ""friend"" material, though I do like that Giselle shows such dignity and self-confidence in the end. I get the sense that there's more to all of these kids than we're seeing, and that there are some interesting dynamics ready to be explored in a sequel.Unlike the relationships, the mystery behind the pack war is fully unraveled. And Giselle nearly gets herself killed in the process. I don't know how comfortable I am with that final attack on her. It's so brutal and yet taken as no big deal and maybe even acceptable by the rest of the characters. Apparently werewolf packs have rather idiosyncratic ideas of right and wrong and what constitutes reasonable punishment for the crime of trespass. I get the whole ""animal"" law thing, but it seems to overpower the humanity of some of the characters, which can make it hard to fully sympathize with them even when they might otherwise deserve sympathy. As a result, although I enjoyed reading about these wolves, I had no urge to imagine myself in the story...which is usually my favorite part of reading fiction.Overall, I'd say the world Salidas has created is exciting and full of potential. I hope we get to spend more time with her werewolves, witches, and...the as-yet-unmet (in this book, anyway) ...vampires.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EA2LGUHW1NA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8W68Z4#wasThisHelpful","R3EA2LGUHW1NA8","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* A copy of this book was provided by the author in return for an honest review.A memoir of the author's experience during a summer she spent working at a Sacramento boardinghouse during WW II.Eleven-year-old Eileen lies about her age to get a job as a maid/cook at Mrs. Mumford's boarding house. The war has made domestic help scarce due to better paying work in the munitions industry. Mumford also lost her Japanese gardener, who was forced to move with his parents into an internment camp. The moral conflict these camps pose is a running theme through the book...especially as Eileen's mother is of German descent and fears it's only a matter of time before the government rounds them up as well.BOARDINGHOUSE STEW is an appropriate title. Not only does it highlight one of the book's running joke--Eileen's unique wartime kitchen concoctions, many of which are inedible--but also the wonderful mix of personalities brought together under Mrs. Mumford's roof. These men and women run the gamut from a love-sick doctor, to a tough-as-nails lady welder, to a fellow whose profession remains a mystery...which must mean there's something shady going on.Eileen is a lovable kid. Rebellious, hardworking, loyal...but still just a kid caught up in an extraordinary time in history. The author does a great job bringing the era to life through concrete details: victory gardens, radio shows, blackout curtains, ration books. There's also a nice mix of humor and drama. I especially enjoyed the specter of the late Mr. Mumford, whose portrait and reserved place at the dining table were both ever present.Smith originally wrote this as a stage play, but she successfully adapts it to standard narrative from. The end scenes retain a slight ""staged"" feeling...in particular the Doc/Patsy wrap up. Luckily, we're so happy to see that resolved, it doesn't detract from what's come before.I happily recommend BOARDINGHOUSE STEW for its detailed setting, rich characterizations, and the entertaining window it provides into a pivotal time in American life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GU6W9VYB8WWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RQOOJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2GU6W9VYB8WWW","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"** Author provided an ARC of this book in return for an honest review.A young woman struggles with her sexuality while fearing she was a disappointment to her recently deceased parents.We met Delilah Armstrong in the first Harborside Nights novel--CATCHING CASSIDY. The hero in that book was Wyatt Armstrong, Delilah's his twin. On the night of their college graduation, their parents died in a car accident. Delilah and Wyatt moved back to Harborside, a Massachusetts beach community, to take over their parent's bar & grill. Two months on, Delilah has started to settle into her new professional role helping to run the business, but her personal life is in turmoil. Her grief over her parents' death is compounded because of the shock she gave them when she came out to them that fateful night. Deep down she believes she may have caused the accident.At the same time, Delilah struggles with growing feelings for her best friend Ashley. She's afraid to act on them. First, because she isn't sure Ashley would welcome them. Second, because she isn't sure SHE herself will enjoy being intimate with a woman. Third, even if it turns out to be a resounding YES to the first and the second questions, she's terrified of people around her finding out her secret. It's this final issue--Delilah's reluctance to go public when she and Ashley become an item--that proves the biggest obstacle to their relationship. Ashley was someone's dirty little secret once before and ended up with a broken heart. She's not willing to go through that again. Only, because of her feelings for Delilah, that's exactly where she's headed.Melissa Foster presents Delilah's struggle with honesty and sensitivity. At times this teeters a bit over the edge. We spend A LOT of time in Delilah's head. All that internal angst slows the pacing at times, especially toward the end, when Delilah returns to her childhood home in Connecticut to clear out her parents' belongings. I also found the resolution to her conflict over her parents a bit too convenient. I think Foster may have succumbed to the path of least resistance here in the interest of providing her character with complete closure. I would've preferred more ambiguity---allowing Delilah to CHOOSE to move on in strength, even with lingering doubts about her parents real feelings.Still, DISCOVERING DELILAH is a touching romance that balances the spark between the couple with plenty of character development. There's a nice supporting cast and, as always in a Melissa Foster novel, the setting is beautifully rendered.A highly satisfying reading experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FDRI0Q4YV52K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX90BDI#wasThisHelpful","R2FDRI0Q4YV52K","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A short story focused on the development of secondary characters Saint and Jeanette in Riley's Taking the Fall series.Saint and Jeanette added a lot to the first three volumes of the Taking the Fall series, so I was glad to hear the author had penned an installment that delved into their relationship. We get a new perspective on both characters. Saint is still lovable, but his submissive behavior in this installment made me a little queasy at times. I know he was just giving Jeanette the control she craved after escaping her ex, but even there the logic was wobbly. We learn that most of the horrible things her ex did was to OTHER women before and after Jeanette. He was controlling, sure, but there was only one real episode of violence and it led to Jeanette running away.Some of the problems with the plot may have to do with so much story being squished into so few pages. It felt rushed. It didn't help that the epilogue (as unnecessary here as it was in the earlier parts) steals space from the main narrative.This fourth volume didn't deliver what I was hoping for based on the first three.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VTXVDSXYA0SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWVMQYC#wasThisHelpful","R3VTXVDSXYA0SI","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They're all single, flirting with thirty, and their busy professional lives mean that they keep in contact via email. Mark convinces Renee to jump into online dating with him, though he doesn't even dip his toe in the water until near the end of the book.

Normally this is a fiction no-no, but Becker's epistolary novel for a new millennium is funny and moving. Each character's distinct voice and personality carry the narrative.The only place I feel the story fell short was the rock star subplot. It stretched my suspension of disbelief a bit too far.

"Artists and professionals don't have to choose between their integrity and making a living.In this article, Marc Zegans offers a thoughtful approach to facing market realities while maintaining artistic/professional ideals. Since it is relatively short, I can't go into as much depth as I normally might or readers could be tempted to take the summary in place of the article. That would be a shame. Zegans sets out a clever program for using one's core beliefs to both create their best work and reach those who will be most receptive to that work.Zegans' process of intentional practice manages to meld intuition with practical method. The bridge between art and audience is a series of diagnostic questions that keep the artist in tune with the message/intention his art conveys and aware of those who share the intention and are therefore the ""natural"" audience for that message in the form of a book, painting, or music CD. Further, readers learn how even their natural audience is made up of distinct types of individuals. Zegans calls them champions, collectors, and visitors. Understanding the differences between these ""fans"" helps the artist further hone and direct her message.I will say that the language Zegans employs is a bit more formal and academic than some artists might be used to. Artists and professionals are so used to getting marketing tips in bite-sized, bullet-pointed blog posts and newsletter features where they can scan the sentences in bold type and glean the major points in a minute or two. This article requires close reading and focused attention. Further, putting the advice it offers into practice is an ongoing process. So, it's good that the article is short--since you'll likely have to come back to it multiple times as you fine tune your audience-finding efforts.A somewhat demanding but valuable primer for artists and professionals preparing to face the marketplace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGD8RCJ9TH12U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MQANA6#wasThisHelpful","RGD8RCJ9TH12U","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young criminal justice student working her way through school as an exotic dancer finds romance and danger when she becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer.Alaina Colby has worked hard to distance herself from her family and their criminal activity. It's been a struggle to put herself through college, especially when she's also responsible for her younger brother whose drug addiction has already landed him in a heap of legal trouble. Now she's nearing graduation and an end to her days wasting her dancing talent swinging topless around a stripper pole.Only the universe has decided that it's not playing nice.Fellow strippers keep turning up dead behind the club where Alaina works. Not just dead. Chewed to pieces. Law enforcement is sniffing around. What's worse, Alaina's brother, who once dated the latest victim, has gone AWOL. Clearly, she needs to find out what she can about the killings...if only to protect what's left of her family.JUMPING THE LINE grabbed me from page one. Alaina is an intriguing character. She's had a rotten life and has thrown up some thick walls. Yet her soft heart and...well...innocence shine through her gritty exterior. Her big dream is to make ""Jump the Line"" audition video for the Rockettes, though she knows a physical handicap has put professional dancing out of her reach. It's such a childlike ambition, like the short girl entering the modeling competition or the kid with two left feet trying out for cheerleading. It makes her lovable and vulnerable. The sort of person who ignores her own well-honed instincts when the odd behavior of a friend sets off warning bells.Detective Aidan Hawks certainly appreciates Alaina's finer points. Another engaging character, Aidan talks like the worst sort of man-whore, yet he generally behaves like the gentleman his mom and two fathers (long story) would wish him to be. Aidan is determined to catch the killer. At first it's a professional thing. Then he becomes convinced it's a race to save Alaina. He has plenty of obstacles. This murderer is clever and closer to the action than anyone realizes. Aidan also has trouble within his own ranks. His chief can't stand him. And his attractive new partner is after his collar--and his body.There's considerable violence in this book. The killer's victims go through hell. So do Aidan and Alaina. By the climactic final showdown, both of them are at their physical and emotional breaking points. But there's also forgiveness and the chance to heal old wounds. Light to balance dark. Sanity to balance madness.McFarland uses an alternating first-person point of view that could have resulted in a disjointed narrative. However, though the POV shifts, it is always tightly controlled. We get a peek at how Alaina, Aidan, and the killer's minds work without becoming muddled or learning so much about what's going on that the story is spoiled. In fact, ""delayed discovery"" is used to keep the characters on the go and us readers frantically turning the pages. We may know more than any single character, but it's exquisite torture as we wait for one of the gang to discover an important point or for a meeting/confrontation that we know is coming.JUMP THE LINE is chilling and fun and left me checking and rechecking that my door was locked.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JTNPL0IH5K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YB2O5CW#wasThisHelpful","R25JTNPL0IH5K2","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:24 Mins Pack and Pride test their physical and spiritual boundaries in preparation for a final battle that will shape the future for both shifters and humans.LEGACIES is the fourth book in the Bonds of Blood & Spirit saga. This series is a great mix of character and suspense. The books do need to be read in order--each one digs deeper into Kelly & Dorchak's unique fictional universe and into the characters as their knowledge of themselves and bonds with one another are constantly tested and transformed.By the time we get to LEGACIES, the bad guys (who've dogged our heroes from book to book to book) have assembled an evil alliance that seems impossible to defeat. At the same time, Regina, Harry, Cole and the rest of the Pack are still reeling from the events in book three (RECLAMATIONS). Now the packmates must face personal fears, petty jealousies, and desires they'd rather keep buried. Things are changing. Each shifter needs to learn where they fit. IF they fit. On the surface it's the worst possible time to deal with interpersonal drama. The shifters know this. They understand that there's a clock ticking over their heads and when it strikes the hour, all hell will break loose.As it turns out, it's the personal stuff that provides the key for the Pack to survive the upcoming battle.The end? It's satisfying. Overwhelming. Exhausting. All major questions are answered, but enough tantalizing threads remain to lead us forward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4RQZB56M0S7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989902013#wasThisHelpful","R4RQZB56M0S7N","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Regina Capalini and her growing crew of shifters interfere in an ancient rite and set off a series of events that will alter the direction of pack life forever.Cats and dogs. Or in this case wolves and lions. Different species with different habits. So what happens when the alpha of a wolf shifter pack vows to protect the offspring of a Lion shifter? Trouble. Lots of trouble.RECLAMATIONS, book three of the Bonds of Blood & Spirit saga, is all about family. The families we're born into, and the ones we create for ourselves. Over the course of this installment, the authors take us deeper into the lives of Regina, Harry, Cole and the rest of the pack as they re-evaluate entrenched beliefs and long-held prejudices. As always, the stakes are huge--life, love, and the future of an entire lineage is at risk.I was thrilled to revisit my favorite character--Collette--and watch her free herself from a bloody and tragic past and rejoin the world. If that seems a little like a plot spoiler, don't worry, because it's a much more interesting world thanks to Collette's presence and influence. There are also some wonderful new faces. Jon and Drew are honorable and compassionate and protective. They're also heirs to a once shining tradition that has deteriorated into nothing more than a front for abuse and perversion of the darkest kind. Two young men caught between what is expected and what is right--the choice they make on one fateful night transforms both Pack and Pride.At the same time, Regina faces her own conflict when an exciting new life change for her and Harry is shadowed by the most profound loss they've faced so far.One of the best things about this series is it's wonderful mix of rich characterization and heart-pumping action. RECLAMATIONS delivers plenty of plot twists. The villains are relentless in their assault on the Pack. Beyond that, this is a universe where the best of intentions can go terribly wrong, and  no one is quite what they seem. Their desires and motives are as changeable as their physical forms and sometimes turn even the good guys into their own worst enemies.RECLAMATIONS isn't a cliffhanger in the same was as UNCIVIL WARS, but there are plenty of open questions at the end to make you anxious for the next book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FH6I7LF4M3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989902005#wasThisHelpful","R36FH6I7LF4M3B","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may not be happily ever for wolf shifter Regina Capalini and her motley crew of supernaturals when a surprise double wedding sets the stage for a double kidnapping that opens wounds from a 140-year-old conflict.Sheesh! It can be rough reviewing books in a saga like Bonds of Blood & Spirit. Even that log line above treads dangerously close to spoiler land. You really need to read the books in order starting with LOYALTIES, where authors Wendi Kelly and Deborah Dorchak introduce us to a world that exists alongside our own--a world full of animal shifters, vampires, and the awakened humans who (if they survive long enough) love them.UNCIVIL WARS picks up about six months after the conclusion of LOYALTIES. Regina, Harry, and Diego have barely come to grips with their brand new pack (and related extended family), when Cole, being the delightful-but-rash pain in the neck (hint hint) that he is, decides to take their respective relationships to a new level. The above-mentioned double wedding brings the gang to a hotel in Coastal Maine run by the foundation Diego and his lifemate began nearly a century and a half before. Things go wrong almost at once, starting with poor Diego who comes face to face with his own tragic past. Her name is Collette and she's a wonder from the second she takes the stage. By the end of the book she's my favorite character. Maybe of any paranormal book I've read.UNCIVIL WARS brings us other new friends. There's Selene, the daughter of the pack's number one enemy, a corrupt-to-the-core US Senator.Jake, a Zen-type from Sedona, AZ, who is as gifted with his sword as any shifter is with claws...though signs are that he may soon have both at his disposal.And weapons will be needed.A double kidnapping is only the first move in a nasty plot that has enemies closing in on the Pack from all sides. Things get personal as Diego's sad history asserts its power over his tenuous present and he learns that even the best intentions may go awry if you don't take into account the feelings of the others involved. The intrepid alpha finds himself at odds with those closet to him and facing questions about his fitness to lead. This leaves Regina torn between her loyalty to Diego and her responsibility to her pack. Not easy for a girl who has only just learned that there is such a thing as trust and love.The action reaches a climax in a park in Massachusetts aptly named ""Purgatory."" Here we meet a new kind of villain. The Talutha are the stuff nightmares are made of.  Hard to describe them without ruining the fun, but this is how I personally picture them: Ever see the movie GREMLINS? Well, envision the critters after they've been in contact with water or exposed to sunlight or fed after midnight. Only BIG and MEAN and EVIL. And they smell of rotten oranges.The final battle is desperate and violent. Characters we love have to channel their darker sides to survive. It's not pretty or neat. In fact, the book ends in a massive cliffhanger. I normally hate cliffhangers. But, remember, Bonds of Blood & Spirit is not a series of linked standalone novels. So in a sense it's one REALLY long book...the story of a bunch of odd ball supernaturals who find each other and, through test after test, grow into something special and completely new. The cliffhanger here is no big deal, because by the time you've read that far, you cannot stop if you wanted to.I read through the night and until my eyelids were glued shut.That must tell you something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5TUHIZ9FZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1WRP3Q#wasThisHelpful","R2S5TUHIZ9FZ9","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon her aunt's death, a young woman learns information about her own troubled past that changes the course of her life.It's almost impossible to talk about CHERGUI'S CHILD without revealing pivotal details, but I'll try. Olivia, the heroine, is a complex character. Life has been a struggle for her on many levels. As the book opens she seems confident and capable, but we learn bit by bit that her appearance of control masks deep psychological wounds and an ongoing struggle to maintain a normal life. Her efforts are hampered by her overbearing, intrusive mother. Matters are forced to a head when Olivia's aunt's death leads to a huge revelation centered on what appears at first to be a simple failed romance but, as we learn through flashbacks, is actually much more. Olivia has a choice--she can go on with her rather empty life or act upon what she's learned and possibly reclaim something precious. She decides to act and in the process transforms her life and that of several others.CHERGUI'S CHILD is an emotionally rich story full of complex characters and unexpected plot twists. Riddell excels at two things in particular--a evoking a wonderful sense of place and populating it with fascinating individuals. The people we meet here aren't necessarily likable, there's too much infidelity for my taste, but they are REAL. That's important. You pay attention to Riddell's characters. You want to understand them.I would have preferred a more linear narrative. The flashbacks are well done, but I don't think they were necessary and found them a drag on the story's forward momentum. I was so invested in Olivia's quest, I didn't care to be interrupted and dragged back in time five years. Also the plot turns on three separate letters. Here I may be tiptoeing too close to spoiler-land, so feel free to skip to the next paragraph. The first one, written by Olivia's aunt, initiates the main conflict. The second one (written by her ex lover) is fairly benign and offers Olivia some sense of closure. The third (also by the ex-lover) seems too convenient and ends up letting the air out of what should have been the most suspenseful event in the book, the one that decides whether or not Olivia will be granted what she's fought so hard for. The ending is still satisfying, but that third letter robs it of some of its power.CHERGUI'S CHILD is a powerful exploration of how the past and the stories we tell ourselves about that past both shape our present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332NBZZ6XI36P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTE9XWE#wasThisHelpful","R332NBZZ6XI36P","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Advanced reading copy provided by the author in return for an honest review.A troubled young man seeks work in the oilfields of northern Canada and in the process finds himself.Ty is a college student with an overworked mother and an absent (and hard-drinking) father. He's not a bad kid, but he's impulsive and teetering on the edge of his own drinking problem. This is made worse when his girlfriend breaks his heart. Ty suffers a downward spiral that results in his being asked to leave his university. He heads north to the oil fields in hopes of making enough money to continue his education once he's allowed back into school.This book wasn't an easy read for me, which is strange considering the high quality of the writing. There is plenty of attention paid to setting and character development. The world Yeomans creates feels real. All the grime and grit of life in the oil fields and the small, rough towns that go along with them is powerfully evoked. That said, RETURN TO KAITLIN didn't capture my imagination. It didn't carry me away.I had trouble connecting with Ty. The fact that he's been wounded, first by his father's abandonment of the family, then by his girlfriend, certainly justifies some of his melancholy. Problem is that we meet him in the midst of his crisis, and there's not enough sweetness/vulnerability early on to balance out all the resentment and anger. I just didn't like the guy. This made it hard to hang on through the twists and turns of his journey to self-awareness.Another problem was the novel's pacing. SLOW. There is so much description about the trip north (I should say ""trips""--Ty doesn't get to Kaitlin right away) and then his daily round that it weighs down the narrative and obscures the arc of the story. I caught myself skimming long paragraphs of exposition and struggling to figure out which episodes and character interactions were significant and which were merely minor interludes.Overall, RETURN TO KAITLIN didn't give me the reading experience I was looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5ANYI0YJOBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=096932197X#wasThisHelpful","R2V5ANYI0YJOBY","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An orphan has no idea what she's gotten herself into when she agrees to marry a reclusive bachelor sight unseen.OWNING THE BEAST is a retelling of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but the plot is somewhat more complex than the classic story. Annabella (Belle) Blanca is alone in the world. She thinks she's signing on for an arranged marriage when she's unwittingly fallen into high-class prostitution. Griffen Stone is a beast in more than looks. He's truly unpleasant at first. He thinks Belle's his latest order from an obliging madam. Then he thinks her arrival was a mix-up. It isn't. There's a villain in the background who made sure Belle was sent there.It took me a while to warm up to Griffen. This dude does not like women. It's clearly a ""reject them before they reject me"" situation. His eventual attitude adjustment is a tad too abrupt. I would have preferred a more gradual softening. Still, he's a sexy thing. Very snarly and masterful.The story logic is rough in spots. Mostly when it comes to the villain and his motives. We come to understand what this bad guy wants, but there's no credible reason for him to think that Belle in particular would be a good way to get to Griffen. There's some sense that Belle reminds him of someone he cared for (can't say more or I'll spoil the story). And, sure, she's not his standard tart. But every tart starts somewhere, right? That she might provide a way to hurt Griffen isn't made plausible enough for me. Despite this, the climax is full of suspense and had me biting my nails.If you can set your brain's logic meter on ""pause"" for the duration, you'll enjoy this erotic take of the classic fairy tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKDBTR0WW9Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S77LYBC#wasThisHelpful","RBKDBTR0WW9Z1","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A sexy older bachelor give into his longstanding attraction for his closest friend's daughter.I've read most of Alexa Riley's books. This one was a bit flimsy compared to the others. I think it was her first, which might explain why it doesn't quite match the others in character development and plot complexity.Haley and William are both likable characters, and they share a spark, especially in the erotic scenes.I found the story arc way off. There's no time given to character development. Even a short piece like this can offer a little something in terms of character.  The potential is there, but the final result is rushed. Also, William's initial overtures are creepy and a non-sexy kind of predatory. Haley has some promise at first, but she gets too baby-talky. It edged past role playing and became off putting. She seems dopey rather than innocent and sheltered.It's a quick read with some good moments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZ0R2SG09N3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU6MZWE#wasThisHelpful","R1RZ0R2SG09N3V","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A witch discovers that she's something more when she learns she's the fated mate of the local alpha wolf shifter.I didn't expect this book to be as scary as it was. There's way more going on here than a shifter romance. It takes on the concept of evil in a very direct and graphic way--not simply as the background for a love story.Cinder, the heroine, is Wiccan. There's a lot of that culture involved in the story. It adds even more texture to the book.AWAKEN THE WOLF is the ninth book in an on-going series. It stands alone without a problem. But there are a lot of characters and many different sub-groups within the greater supernatural community. Many of them are so interesting that you'd like to follow their stories at some point.Cinder is a well-wrought character. She's strong willed and independent...and completely clueless about the degree of danger she's in. Adam Beaumont is a fun hero. He's so shocked that Cinder isn't falling all over herself with joy when she learns she's his mate. Dealing with a witch is new to him. It throws him off balance, and that's fun to watch.The scenes where Cinder is held by the enemy wolves are just terrifying. They are really bad news. And it's even worse when you take into account Cinder's relationship to one of the key members. Talk about creepy!Excellent book. On my re-read list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHTSBMCQ7ASS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQNZ0JQ#wasThisHelpful","R1MHTSBMCQ7ASS","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A woman on the run from her rich, abusive ex-fiance hides in rural Montana where she falls in with a clan of smoke-jumping werebears.Kim Fox packs a lot of character, action, and plot twists into this relatively short book.The characters are so likable. Alexi is sassy and vulnerable. Ellis is just teddy bear sweet...until Alexi is threatened. Then he goes all ""wild kingdom"" on the villains. There's a nice mix of warm humor and action here. The tension escalates nicely to a surprise ending with a twist concerning the bad guy that you don't see coming.Fox's villains are SCARY. So often in these types of romances there's a big build-up about the bad guy and, when he arrives on scene, it's a disappointment. He's beaten too easily. Not this time around. Poor Alexi and Ellis need all the help they can get to escape her ex.The setting here was also well done. There are some wonderful descriptions of the Montana landscape. It helps draw you into the world of the book.SMOKE JUMPERS WEREBEAR merits five-plus stars. Definitely worth a re-read, too.

Others short and sharp. There's a wonderful use of rhyme and strong rhythms.

They read well on the page, but they really shine when read aloud. So much musicality.The video includes me reading ""Monster's Lullaby"", ""Heart Attack"", and ""Going Home.""Whether the poems are supernatural in nature, humorous, or serious they all dig past the niceties and reveal the irony at the heart of human life--we are so afraid of death, yet we waste life.Great collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTL1FVVIPDKCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XM0WO36#wasThisHelpful","RTL1FVVIPDKCD","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nurse burned by love is caught in a blizzard and rescued by a marriage-minded wolf shifter.This is Marie Mason's third short novel starring the McCall brothers--billionaire wolf shifters looking for their fated mates.Katie travels up to a mountain retreat that her new boyfriend--who turned out to be a no-good cheat--booked for their romantic getaway. She doesn't want the trip to go to waste. A blizzard hits as she arrives. The key given to her doesn't work. As she tries to find a way inside, she falls and knocks herself out.Logan McCall heads up to his luxurious mountain hideaway to check on it. The snow is no big deal to him. But it is to the half-frozen person he finds on his property. He takes her inside and it isn't long before his nose tells him that this isn't just any would-be intruder---this is the woman he's been waiting for, the one he's nearly given up on ever finding.We know what happens from here. And that's fine. I pick these books up because I want a particular type of romance with just enough steam to carry me along to the HEA. What I liked about the two previous books in this series is that they gave me what I expected and still managed to be fresh and interesting.SAVED BY THE WOLF doesn't have the degree of chemistry between hero and heroine that the first two books provide. Logan is kind of a one-note character. He knows what he wants and he's gonna get it, even if it means breaking down the walls Katie has built around her recently bruised heart. But he doesn't have his brothers' charisma. Maybe it's the setting...It's a bit cushy compared to being trapped in a high-rise office or a no-star motel. It needed stronger characters to carry it. Katie has a bit more spark than Logan, but her insecurities get tedious after a while.There are also some noticeable errors in this book. Normally a few typos don't bother me. Or even a bigger boo boo--like calling Logan by his brother's name. Not a huge deal if the rest of the story crackles. But this one, though it has some steamy moments, doesn't quite make it.The best part for me was when Katie sees the cabin she was supposed to stay in. Things get interesting as the reader wonders whether she really will make a serious attempt to tough it out in such a hovel. But Mason lets her off too easy. I think that's the problem with the whole book, the characters have it too easy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC0XPKIAJFIVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XGE83I8#wasThisHelpful","RC0XPKIAJFIVM","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carter seeks to once and for all end the threat posed by Layla's father, who destroyed his family and stole eight years of his life.Things start off in a bad way. Layla and Jeanette are fighting for their lives. Things could go either way for them, and it isn't clear that Carter and Saint will arrive in time.Even when the immediate danger is past, Carter can't let down his guard. He's right to be worried. Betrayal strikes in an unexpected form...though I have to say that I had my doubts about this particular character from the start. Nothing definite, no huge hints, but just an inkling that there was more going on under this person's interest in Layla's well-being.The main characters are still great. Carter is as intense as ever, but Layla is learning how to live with his overbearing nature. She has her ways of getting around his general inflexibility. I like Saint and Jeanette more and more with each volume and am glad to hear that there will be a fourth installment that focuses on them.I do think the pacing is off as this volume heads toward its conclusion. The traitor is unveiled and overcome too easily. The tension picks up again during the final showdown with Layla's father. But then there's a completely overblown epilogue that travels decades into the future. Not only is it fairly banal after what we've endured with these characters, it kind of spoils the anticipation for the Saint/Jeanette story.Overall, though, it's a satisfying end to the serial. And readers can't complain that anything was left unresolved or that they wish they new what happened in the future. All threads are tied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTIS5EOF9II8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X68HDRQ#wasThisHelpful","RTIS5EOF9II8E","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carter struggles to protect Layla as her psycho father closes in.Carter has a lot of damage control to do to salvage his relationship with Layla. At the same time, tt's a game of cat and mouse as Carter, with the help of his friend Saint, tries to settle his score with Layla's father and at the same time keep her safe. The stakes are higher now for the couple (can't elaborate without spoiling). But their enemy has plans of his own and he needs Layla to realize them.We meet Layla's nightmare parents. I think Riley goes a little over the top here. What is it in romantic suspense these days that parents can't just be bad, but instead must be truly twisted? It's getting a little old for those of us who real lots of books in this genre. She should've dialed this down a bit. Maybe at least made the mother less vicious.Despite the melodramatic characterizations, the writing is good and there's plenty of suspense. The climax is a whopper. I had no idea how Layla and Jeanette were going to get out of it. But they do (or it seems that way at the point the story pauses) and through their own efforts, too. I liked that.

"A woman on the run from her criminal father is tracked down by her former bodyguard, the man who stole and then broke her heart.Vol. 1 of this serial starts with a bang. The heroine, who's still a teen, visits prison to see the man she loves...who is four years into an eight-year sentence for a crime we don't yet know the details of. Carter tells her to go away and never come back. She's devastated and vows that she's finished with him, her family, and the life she's been living.Fast-forward four years. Layla has a new life with only one friend, a sex-pot named Jeanette who is in many ways as secretive as Layla. She's just started casually dating a nice but bland guy and is yearning for excitement. She gets this in spades when she discovers that Carter has found her and has had a friend watching her for some time.This first installment is mostly about Carter and Layla finding each other again and working out some of the misunderstandings left over from when he killed someone to save her life. The plot isn't perfectly logical. The time line is complicated and you have to wonder why Layla waited as long as she did to run away from her family--especially after her father arranged for her to nearly be beaten to death.Nevertheless, Carter and Layla are both interesting characters. He's a little too alpha for me. Protective and vengeful is okay, but he's too controlling. Layla is put off by it at first. But in the end she accepts that he's worried for her safety since there's a good chance her father is close to finding her. Turns out Carter's fear is justified.Jeanette and Saint (Carter's friend) add a humorous touch to story.I dislike serials as rule. But this one is well-written and offers a nice mix of romance and suspense. There's a cliffhanger, but it isn't gratuitous or melodramatic.

"A witch trying to gather the ingredients for a spell that will stop her psychotic ex-husband is shipwrecked with a grumpy bear shifter.Mystic Harbor is home to all sorts of supernatural creatures. They don't all get along. These prejudices come into play when Vivian, a witch, asks Laurence, a bear shifter who's only recently moved to town, too take her to a nearby island so that she can collect leaves from a rare tree. She needs them to get rid of her ex, an evil warlock who wants Vivian's earth powers to enhance his blood magic. The spell involves summoning a demon, so Vivian is taking a big risk performing it. It will likely cause her long-term harm. But she doesn't see another way out.Laurence blames witches for the death of his mother and wants nothing to do with Vivian. Wehn she does him a good turn, he only agrees to take her to the island to repay the debt. Well, for reasons that you'll have to read the book to find out, they end up stranded. A simmering attraction boils over and... But is attraction enough to survive native prejudice? Especially when Laurence learns of Vivian's intention to send her ex to hell?I enjoyed watching Vivian and Laurence's Hate-Lust-Hate-Love relationship. Grove does a good job building their relationship. It isn't love at first sight. Or second sight. Or even third. I wasn't sure the couple would work things out at all. Mostly this was due to Laurence being so hostile to Vivian for so much of the book. I probably would have toned him down just a little.Things get scary when Vivian's ex arrives on the scene. It's nice to see a light romance with a credible threat that isn't just a plot device to get the couple together. The book's climax is exciting and really keeps you hanging for a while.Overall, I enjoyed UNBEARABLY STRANDED and am looking forward to reading more stories set in Mystic Harbor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J74JS6ECMYSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB9AMJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3J74JS6ECMYSN","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wolf shifter with a chip on her shoulder moves from Chicago to Philadelphia to work under a new alpha and her life is forever changed.Regina Capalini has had it rough her whole life. Her Chicago pack isn't paradise, but it's all she knows--until she's dismissed and sent to work for Diego, a gruff Creole alpha with a surprisingly soft heart. They don't get off to a great start thanks to Regina's bad attitude, but it's not like she has much choice. If this doesn't work out, she's on her own. And wolf shifters do not do well on their own. So Regina settles in to make the best of things. She even hooks up with an hot guy. Things get a little overheated on Regina and Cole's first night together, leaving her with a connection she never bargained for. If this isn't bad enough, Cole's best friend Harry is the man she's been fantasizing about ever since the god-awful Philly traffic threw them together...literally.A little awkward? Well, that's just the beginning. This potential love triangle turns into a desperate race to save a friend from certain death. Or worse.Together, authors Kelly and Dorchak create a cast of unique characters, each one a believable mix of strengths and weaknesses. The heroes made me want to hit them at times. And the villains are so bad I didn't just want them to get what they deserved, I wanted it to hurt.Oh, there's plenty of pain in these pages. Physical and emotional. The authors are hard on their characters. Regina, Cole, Harry, Diego and the others find their deepest wounds exposed, their understanding of the world and their places in it shattered, and their relationships (old and new) tested to the point that you can't see how some bonds will survive. There are scenes that were hard for me as a reader to bear. But the light, engaging writing style drew me in and held me as the plot turns grew sharper and the stakes rose higher.I think what I loved most about LOYALTIES was watching a collection of lonely and somewhat lost spirits find each other and connect and grow into something bigger than any of them were on their own.

"In Post-WW II San Francisco, wounded servicemen struggle to heal their physical and emotional scars and find comfort in an often unkind world.There is a standard (and rather annoying) convention that ""historical fiction"" refers to narratives set before 1900. That might have worked fine in 1940 or 1960 or even 1990. Today, though, this rule of thumb is more suffocating than useful. POET'S CAN'T SING is set in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. Firmly set in its period, it captures the flavor of that particular moment--a time when public pride over a hard-won victory too often overshadowed the personal suffering of those who made this victory possible.Earl, Brooks, and Ivory have all been left shattered by their war experience. They cross paths at a veterans' hospital run by corrupt administrator Victor Mann and his psychotic orderly, Elroy. As Mann pretends not to notice, Elroy uses intimidation, blackmail, and violence to control the patients and staff. The only individuals not under his thumb are Nurse Stella Tate and Henry Akita, a Japanese-American former army medic, now an orderly. Despite Elroy's menacing presence, Stella and Henry are determined to do what they can for the men under their care. They use Earl's and Brooks's musical talents to get these two blind men to both reengage with the world and to help other patients.The author's writing is top notch. He moves seamlessly from point-of-view to point-of-view and from past to present. We get to know his characters in all their messy humanity. Smith does a great job showing us the profound sadness that lives in the gap between what these men intended to be and what life and the war has made of them. We watch as they struggle to get better and be better in spite of their own self-destructive tendencies and the cruelty and incompetence of those around them.There's a good dose of humor to balance out the darker scenes. Which is good, because Elroy is like a cancer that spreads from chapter to chapter. I don't know that I could have dealt with him all the way to the end if not for Earl and Brooks's amusing interaction. As for the resolution, things take an interesting turn for the main characters after their time at the hospital. Yet the question of whether such damaged souls as Earl, Brooks, and Ivory can ever learn to live with their scars and build decent, worthwhile lives is left open.POETS CAN'T SING is an absorbing and emotional work of literary-historical fiction.** received a copy of the book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKZP0X5TTHUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9187751909#wasThisHelpful","R2YKZP0X5TTHUW","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* Product sample provided for reviewThis lavender oil is probably the most potent that I've ever used. I could smell it before I opened the shipping box...which was nice. It made my living room smell great. The oil itself has a clear, sharp, true lavender scent. The dropper is built into the cap. This makes it a lot easier to control the amount you use either in the bath or added to a base oil or Epsom salts.The product is concentrated enough that one drop can scent a good 2 cups of Epsom salts. One or two drops right into the bathtub scents you AND everything in room. I didn't try it in a carrier oil...but I think you'd have to take your time and continually test the mixture w/ each added drop to be sure you don't end up with something too strong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9K7WMNHNWF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGXCMGK#wasThisHelpful","R3M9K7WMNHNWF6","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a free sample of this product in return for an honest reviewFirst of all, the lavender is so potent that I could smell it even as I opened the shipping box. Just gorgeous. Sitting on my table unopened, it scented my whole living room. Not in an overwhelming way. It's a fresh and pleasant scent. I like to squeeze a few drops into hot bathwater.Rosehip oil is completely new to me. Rather than mixing the lavender into it, I tried it on its own to learn a little about it. I love how quickly it is absorbed and that it doesn't leave any residue at all. I tried it on some seriously dry and flaky skin and saw immediate improvement. This was before bed, and thanks to the lack of residue, I didn't have to run to wash my hands or worry about getting oil smears all over my bedding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFRVA0I9UXOGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH1D90E#wasThisHelpful","RFRVA0I9UXOGM","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* product received for free in return for an honest reviewI've had friends who've lost laptops to overheating. Not fun. So, though I'm no technology connoisseur, I was glad to get the chance to try out this IBSound Laptop cooler. Right away, I liked how compact and lightweight it is. No problem fitting into the standard laptop bag. The height is adjustable...you can use it flat or on its little feet. And there are cool-looking lights when its operating, so you know it's on. Which is good, because it is pretty quiet. The four fans provide good air flow.I think the best feature is that it has TWO USB ports. No more losing a port to the fan and then having only one available for another use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R71SCLXNI111/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSBA9ME#wasThisHelpful","R2R71SCLXNI111","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the early days of a Zombie plague, a young man attempts to rescue a woman trapped in the penthouse of a luxury resort.I loved Kylie Scott's FLESH and SKIN. This short story takes place in the same fictional universe, but at a distant location. There's a good concept here. Natalie is trapped on an upper floor, and the only other survivor at the resort is a young university student named Angus, who finally decides to mount a rescue. Unfortunately, the premise never really moves past a basic Cougar-College guy erotic encounter.Yeah, the length imposes limits on character development and plot complications. But twenty-five pages is more than enough space to provide a satisfying story. While Kylie gives us quality writing, two interesting characters, and a single compelling problem--get Natalie out--the narrative completely hijacked by the sexual content. It kills the tension. How can the situation be all that dangerous if these two are more interested getting OFF than in getting OUT?If the author had held back a little, left the character with some sexual longing but out of the penthouse, and therefore with a chance to satisfy that longing, it would have worked much better.ROOM WITH A VIEW is a good prologue or teaser for a longer piece. But it doesn't stand up on its own feet even as a short story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHIEB1OSZC02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFN7U4Q#wasThisHelpful","R3VHIEB1OSZC02","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young singer and a rock star brought together by their difficult backgrounds struggle to make their relationship work while living in the public eye.I loved THE STAGE, where we meet Mia and Kolton and get an inside peek at reality television competition shows. Well the competition is now over and the couple is free to be together. Only Kolton's complicated past threatens to tear them apart before they even have a chance to get started. The trouble starts almost immediately after the events of THE STAGE and it haunts the pair over a period of months, time that includes a long stretch when Mia is away on tour.Most of the drama centers around a decision Kolton makes under harrowing circumstances. It happens in the first chapter, but Mia (and we readers) don't find out ALL the facts until near the end of the book. On one hand, it's great that the author sticks so close to Mia's point-of-view. We really share her confusion, pain and anger as things with Kolton deteriorate and she is helpless to do anything about it. On the other hand, the build up to the big reveal leads to big expectations. Frankly, the ""secret"" isn't all that startling. If I were Mia, I'd be livid about being put through the wringer for it.How harsh a wringer?In the course of Kolton's mania to protect his secret, Mia is made into a scapegoat over and over again. The poor girl asks him reasonable questions and is treated as if she's betraying him. It's a pattern that repeats with his bodyguard and even, in a way, with the fans that attack Mia at the mall. To show you how out of hand it gets, at one point Mia is put in the wrong for defending herself in a physical attack. Sure everyone concedes that the other girl started it, but there's this weird attitude towards Mia that SHE is causing trouble for everyone...especially poor, stressed out Kolton. Somehow, she's always at fault for something, or in need of some kind of ""lesson"" in order to fully understand fame or where Kolton's coming from. It's frustrating, and it make me like Kolton much less than I did at the end of THE STAGE.One has to wonder why with her looks and talent, Mia puts up with this crap treatment.Though the form wasn't always to my taste, there's plenty of angst and emotion in this book. Also the erotic elements are really well done. With so much sex in fiction these days, it's rare to run into a fresh treatment of it. Without going into R-rated detail, let's just say that Kolton is the guru of the full-body orgasm.To be honest, I prefer THE STAGE to THE TOUR, but this follow-up is still a strong book that deserves its five-star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R99PP4Z7KZB3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDBT36Q#wasThisHelpful","R99PP4Z7KZB3D","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A librarian who has spent the first few months of a Zombie Apocalypse hiding in a school is traded to a stranger for supplies.This is book two in Kylie Scott's Flesh series. It takes place at the same time as FLESH and characters from that book reappear in this one.Roslyn Stewart is one of eight people holed up in a boarding school. She hasn't even seen a zombie, but she has other troubles. The school's slimy head master wants to sleep with her and his toadies are pressuring her to give in. Well, she won't. As the book opens, the head master leads the vote to trade her to some guy in order to replenish their dwindling supplies.We met Nick, a former soldier, in FLESH when he was expelled from Blackstone after a failed attempt to infiltrate the compound to kidnap women. Nick was a part of this scheme by default. He didn't plan it or intend to carry through with it, but he kept this to himself to avoid being turned on by his mates and so had no way to defend himself when they were all caught. He's been on his own a while now and wants company. He'd been watching Roslyn for a while before presenting himself at the school gate with his van of goods.Nick and Roslyn are both strong willed and determined to succeed at their conflicting plans. He's going to make her enjoying being with him. She's going to get away. Her attempts to escape are sloppy and nearly get her killed. They also compromise the relatively cozy living situation Nick has labored to create for her.Having been so sheltered at the school, Roslyn isn't prepared for life on the run from Zombies. But she's tougher than either she or Nick realize and it's great to watch her growing independence...and Nick's difficulties accepting just how competent she is. He's a rough-edged sort of gentleman, bordering on chauvinistic. Though he doesn't intend anything but the best. Every choice he makes is focused on Roslyn's well being--but that isn't always the safest course.Kylie Scott has a talent creating layered characters whose good intentions take them close enough to hell to singe their eyelashes.It was fun to see Nick and Roslyn's story converge with that of Ali, Daniel and Finn from FLESH. And we meet up with Captain Sean Manning again. He is wonderful and I hope that Kyle Scott makes use of the ambiguity she creates around his ultimate fate, because he'd be a great lead in another book.The pacing in SKIN flags a bit near the middle, right before Nick and Roslyn must flee their cabin. But it picks up again in a big way and there's a lot of action and suspense.Great follow up to FLESH.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBD9PMVU03BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ABSR3EM#wasThisHelpful","R3PBD9PMVU03BD","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young singer left to raise her kid sister after their parents' death finds her place in a television singing competition compromised when one of the superstar judges fails to hide his attraction to her.Mia is immediately likable. She's put everything she has into giving her sister a good life. But she's running out of money and so jumps at the chance to audition for a new talent competition. Mia has a clear, strong point of view, and Shelby Rebecca does a great job showing us her hopes, fears and confusion as this journey she sets out on takes a turn for the surreal.Kolton Royce is a complicated character. As the book opens, his immediate interest in Mia's well being seems odd and then, well, it borders on creepy. Mostly because he refuses to explain himself. As the story continues and we learn why Kolton feels so drawn to Mia, his intensity makes sense.There's a wonderful dynamic in this book between the reader and each of the lead characters. Mia has such a compelling voice that when she's confused, we're confused. When she feels smothered, we feel smothered. As she comes to understand Kolton, we feel more comfortable with him.The reader's relationship with Kolton is more complicated. He's incredibly secretive. And even when he tries to communicate, he's not all that great at it. He's had a rough life and his experiences have silenced him--music is his only means of true expression. Mia doesn't always get this, and her not getting it kind of floors him, because he thinks he's being so direct...that everything important is right there in the lyrics he texts her.  For me, it's how these two get past their own baggage and learn to ""hear"" each other that is the real story and what makes THE STAGE something more than just another rock-themed romance novel.In short, with all the realistic details Shelby Rebecca gives us about reality television competitions, there's enough drama, glitz and glam here to satisfy rock romance lovers, but there's also plenty more to think about and enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FV4GWSC6SIV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDZFR3Q#wasThisHelpful","R3FV4GWSC6SIV2","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the months following a plague that leaves Australia teeming with zombies, a woman struggles to survive and negotiate her attraction to two very different men.This book offers a wonderful blend of horror and romance. When the book opens, Ali has been living in an attic for three weeks. The suburban world she knows has disintegrated into a lawless wasteland. It's a survival-of-the-fittest reality where zombies are only marginally more dangerous than roving gangs of bent on murder and rape.Ali ventures out of her hideaway searching for food and that's when she runs into Daniel, who has a devil of a time convincing her that he's no threat. His warmth and humor shine from the moment we meet him. Snippy and short tempered, Ali takes longer to appreciate his appeal. But they do finally join up and flee into the back country, which is where they meet Finn, who tracks them for some time before making his presence known.Finn is a former law enforcement officer. We get to witness his stellar fighting skills on several occasions. But he's also seriously scarred from some of the events he witnessed when the plague first started. His brash and arrogant attitude is a nice foil for Daniel's more easy going ways.What develops between these three isn't your average ""torn between two lovers"" situation. There's attraction and desire, sure. But it's also a matter of practicality. The chances of long-term survival in this insane new reality are slim under the best of circumstances. If you're fortunate enough to fall in with people you can trust, you don't discard them easily. You find yourself making accommodations that you never might have considered under normal circumstances. Scott does a good job showing the reservations and ambivalence of the characters as they try to come to some workable solution to their relationship issues.There is a lot of sex in the book. It's emotionally as well as physically intense. And yet it fits this situation Scott has created, where you don't know if you'll be alive when dawn breaks, so barriers come down quickly, and there's not a lot of time for considering consequences.The chapters at the Blackstone compound move too fast. The jarring pace is at odds with the first 2/3 of the book and siphons off some of the tension. And the role the former army soldiers play near the end, while hinted at earlier, still seems to come out of nowhere.Overall, though, FLESH is sexy, scary fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R308PRSONN7H3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADG6UMS#wasThisHelpful","R308PRSONN7H3J","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A musician in an up-and-coming rock band falls for a disowned heiress.Cameron Knight is a real good-time-guy. As the book opens, hes kind of cocky. When he tries his smooth skills on Lily Tennison, in charge of guest relations at a tony hotel, she puts him in his place. But then she succumbs a little quickly for my taste. Luckily theres enough to her character to redeem this. Lily has an interesting back story. Her mother hates that she wants to be an artist. The woman is a nightmare. Lilys father doesnt stick up for his daughter until the end. I like that Lily works so hard to stand on her own feet. She has more depth than Cameron. Hes funny and likable, but hes doesnt have much substance to him.Some of the issues I had with Cameron may have to do with the pacing of the book. It moves very quickly. On one hand, its nice that the action keeps us interested. On the other, the pacing makes it hard to build a relationship with the characters.I think the book needed to be twenty pages longer. The length really becomes an issue as we get to the end and are introduced to numerous characters who will likely star in future installments of the series. There are so many of them introduced in so few pages, that I found it hard to keep track of them. Just as I should have getting a satisfying wrap up of Lily and Camerons romance, I became buried under all these new people and their relationships to one another.In short, Id say Jayne Frost tried a little too hard to make GONE FOR YOU the start of the Sixth Street Band series. All the set up for future books undermined the strength of this one as a standalone.Still, GONE FOR YOU is a light, fun story. It left me interested enough to read more about the Sixth Street Band.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37X0OE57ASI67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6U8CLS#wasThisHelpful","R37X0OE57ASI67","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A rock guitarist sleeps with the one woman who is off limits--his best friend's young sister-in-law--and is in a world of trouble when she gets pregnant.This is the book that caught my attention and made me aware of the Stage Dive series (and author Kylie Scott). I don't read books out of order, so I had to delay indulging in this one until I caught up. Ironically, it's turned out my third favorite out of the four books. It's good. But LEAD and, especially, PLAY are even better. It's in PLAY that we first meet Lizzie Rollins. Her older sister Anne is paid to be drummer Mal Ericson's fake girlfriend and mayhem ensues.Now Anne and Mal are happily together and the proud pet-parents of a maniac puppy named Killer. They are also overprotective of Lizzie, who Anne practically raised since childhood. Anne is aware of Lizzie's crush on Ben. Knowing his love of the wild rocker lifestyle, she's done everything she can to steer her sister clear of him. But Lizzie is infatuated and has secretly chased Ben since back in book two. He's kept her at a distance, but things go haywire at Mal and Anne's Vegas wedding.Lizzie is prepared to accept the consequences of her irresponsible behavior...and accept them basically alone. But Ben, who is having a tough time dealing with Mal's anger at him, is determined to be supportive. Since Lizzie did all the chasing, the outcome for her and Ben isn't as sure a thing as it was for the other couples. Ben is attracted to her, but he loves the rocker lifestyle, whereas the other guys had all had about enough by the time their love interests came along. I think this adds a fresh dose of realism to what is in some ways a kind of ""Rocker Fairy Tale"" series.The band is on tour during this book. They move from hotel to hotel, which I didn't enjoy as much as the books set in Portland. However, the nomadic aspect did underscore the challenges of being in a relationship with a musician. I love how Lizzie balks at the way Ben tries to shove her into a neat little Baby Mamma compartment. She's not having it.There's a lot of up and down in Ben and Lizzie's relationship. And it doesn't help when his sister Martha comes back into the picture. Martha caused all sorts of trouble for Dave and Evelyn back in LICK (book 1) and she's as bitter as ever. She's sure Lizzie is after Ben's money.Over the course of the tour we meet another band, one member in particular takes a liking to Lizzie. I get the sense that this guy is going to feature in a future Kylie Scott book. I hope so.The end of DEEP is also the end of the Stage Dive series, so the epilogue is fabulous and completely satisfying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRGTN8OSCKL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCX1RJE#wasThisHelpful","R3GRGTN8OSCKL2","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young woman hired to babysit a rock star in recovery for drug and alcohol addiction finds herself emotionally involved.At the start of the Stage Dive series, lead singer Jimmy Ferris is a villain. He's mean and disloyal. We've gotten hints that he's having issues with his drug-addicted mother extorting money out of him. In spite of running off all of the recovery companions that his record label hires for him, he's working hard to stay away from things that trigger downward spirals--drugs, alcohol, women. But the recent death of his fellow band member Mal's mother, who was a surrogate mom to Jimmy and his brother, has shaken him.Lena Morrissey is Jimmy's newest recovery companion. She's not crazy about the job, but it pays really well and she needs something to keep her mind off the fact that her fiance dumped her for her sister. Lena Steels herself against both Jimmy's bad attitude and his charm. They develop a weird and highly amusing co-dependency, which becomes an issue when Lena finds she's fallen for him. She tries to quit, but he's not having it.From the start there's a nice spark between Jimmy and Lena. He's got a lot of baggage. There's a lot of ""he wants her, he doesn't want her.""  Yet, when she questions their relationship, his reaction is brutal. Since he's already the hardest band member to like, this nastiness is hard to stomach. I found myself pitying Lena for running after him and moaning over him. I think the author need to give us just a little more evidence to support Jimmy's unexpected appearance at Lena's sister's wedding.The other band members are there to stick their noses in and nudge the pair together. And, as usual in a Kylie Scott novel, there's a lot of humor to get you through the angst.LEAD is a story about a man learning to negotiate emotions he's always avoided and a woman who's had her heart stomped on one too many times.  It puts readers through hell, but the end makes the journey worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIZJEFF6APMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILYTJS6#wasThisHelpful","R2OIZJEFF6APMG","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Anne Rollins's roommate bails and leaves her broke and about to lose her apartment, she agrees to a job pretending to be a rock star's girlfriend.I loved Mal Ericson in LICK, the first book in the Stage Dive series. He was funny and affectionate and, well, just a little insane. Here we get all this good stuff as well as a peek into the man behind the mayhem. Anne isn't a starry-eyed heroine. Nor is she jaded and broken. She's a young woman who's faced hard knocks in her life and dealt with them in a level-headed and responsible manner. Her devotion to her sister solidified my affection for her. I also like that she's so normal in appearance. It gets dull always reading about gorgeous women and the gorgeous men who love them.I don't know how much I buy that Mal needs a ""good girl"" on his arm to rescue his image, but the story is engrossing enough that I'm willing to go with it. And it turns out that Mal is facing an overwhelming crisis. His refusal to talk about it causes much of the trouble in his relationship with Anne. He makes some dumb moves that cause her pain. Seeing as Mal's the nicest of his whole band, this behavior seems out of character and confusing--until we learn what it is he's hiding.The city of Portland is well depicted and adds a lot of texture to the novel. It's also fun meet back up with all the characters we fell for in LICK. The ongoing relationships between the band members, their girls, and assorted side characters draw you in.Lots of angst and tears in this one, but it's also incredibly funny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOTDU7IB56DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H0V069M#wasThisHelpful","R1VOTDU7IB56DF","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During a trip to Vegas to celebrate her 21st birthday, a young woman wakes up married to a rock star.Evelyn Thomas is generally a ""good"" girl. She has serious professional plans to become an architect and a strong need to live up to her father's exacting standards. Too bad those standards are blown to pieces on her birthday trip when she gets so drunk she marries some guy she just met and then blacks out. Sure, the trip to Vegas was supposed to be a little racy, but this changes Evelyn's life. Turns out the guy she married is a world famous rock guitarist.David Ferris is as surprised as Evelyn by the whirlwind nature of their relationship, but he's also really annoyed when she doesn't remember it the next morning. Then, when she assures him they can just get a quiet annulment, he's more than annoyed. But what can he do? Unfortunately, by the time her return flight touches down in Portland, Oregon, it seems everyone knows what happened. David wants her to come to LA to work out legal details. She thinks this is unnecessary until she experiences the full might of the paparazzi.Turns out fleeing to David's LA mansion is no escape at all.  Scott does a good job depicting the world of the rich and infamous. Evelyn finds herself surrounded by sharks. David's manager Adrian is probably the biggest. It's hard to watch how poorly he treats Evelyn...and harder to watch David standing back while it happens. Same goes for his personal assistant Martha. I can't say too much about her without spoiling major plot points. Suffice it to say that David is kind of unlikable at times. He annoyed me enough that I took away a star.Evelyn is sympathetic. I also loved Mal, the band's drummer. He's warm and funny. From the moment he meets Evelyn, he takes a brotherly interest in her, even giving her the nickname ""Child Bride.""  Mal also functions as an intermediary for the couple. He keeps Evelyn calm in the midst of L.A. craziness and arranges for her and David to have the space and privacy they need to connect as people. Unfortunately, David's secretiveness and defensiveness undermines the progress they make as a couple.There's enough chemistry between Evelyn and David to make the pairing realistic. Also, David's back story is compelling. It explains some of his less than stellar behavior, though it doesn't excuse it.Kylie Scott is an Australian author and there are times when this slips out in her word choice and in the cadence of the character dialog. While it didn't ruin the story for me, it did distract me at times.Overall, though, LICK is a fun and sexy start to the Stage Dive series. Scott gives us an interesting mix of personalities, and I'd like to see how things develop for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5T8UF4SC41S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GL3XJFS#wasThisHelpful","R1N5T8UF4SC41S","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A woman stranded on Chicago highway during a blizzard is rescued by a soldier who's also a wolf shifter.This is Marie Mason's second BBW shifter romance starring the highly eligible McCall brothers. Hunter McCall is basically married to the military, which is a problem when he encounters his fated mate on a snowy highway. Julie Monroe is on her way to a friend's wedding. Her romantic history is nothing to write home about, so she's not quite ready for her attraction to Hunter.The setting and situation are well set out with good development for a relatively short book. The lonely, frozen roads and the motel full of stranded travelers add a lot of texture and interest to the story. The characters have a great chemistry, plenty of push-pull as they battle each other and their own inner doubts.Hunter can get a little arrogant. And man-whorish. I'm not crazy about how dismissive he is of the women he's been with or of those who show attraction to him, like the clerk at the airport rental car counter. It borders on unkindness. I know he's alpha and all that, but he still needs to be likable. He kind of plays with Julie at first. The guy's more than willing to screw her, but he's not going to ""claim"" her, though he knows she's his fated mate. He tells himself that he's the one who'll suffer...the mating thing has effectively put other women off limits...but that she'll be able to go on and live a normal, worry-free life without him. Her feelings about this plan of his are of no interest.Of course this all comes back to bite him. The damage is done, heart-wise, for both of them. No going back. It's kind of fun to watch the pair of them come to terms with this. I also love the epilogue. We get a tantalizing peek at the future--and the next book in the series.RESCUED BY THE WOLF is a fun, sexy romance with plenty of plot and character development.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JIG2LHAGLAYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJ1Q6Z2#wasThisHelpful","R2JIG2LHAGLAYW","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A pair of cats must make some adjustments when a fox begins visiting their East London garden.In this early-grade chapter book, Tabby Cat and Black Cat are not quite in agreement about what to do when Maggie the Fox begins visiting. It's bad enough that she's intruded upon their garden, but then she comes inside the house and makes an awful mess. Black Cat is ready for war. Tabby isn't so sure and thinks they can all come to an arrangement acceptable to all sides. Territorial rivalries turn into serious business when Maggie becomes ill and the cats struggle to arrange help for her.I love how each of the animal characters has a distinctive voice and personality. There are many funny parts. My favorite is when Maggie discovers the humans' socks. I do wish the humans themselves were brought in just little more prominently. It's never explained how/why they begin leaving food out for Maggie.Overall, though, this is a charming story with beautiful illustrations. It manages to entertain as it instructs readers about the nature and habits of urban foxes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18632UFTWPTEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGZFSKK#wasThisHelpful","R18632UFTWPTEN","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Secret government agent Michael Prentiss faces his most personal mission yet, when his lover is vanishes while infiltrating a terrorist cell.Having read all of the previous Michael Prentiss adventures, I know full well that Andrew French is hard on his characters. He puts them through hell, brings them face to face with the worse humanity has to offer, including the darkest parts of themselves. AT ALL COSTS has that same raw honesty. Our heroes are older now, and they're getting tired. It's crossroads time for Michael especially. His double life has hardened. Sometimes he's not sure there's a way back to any kind of normalcy.Luckily Angela Lane crashed into his life. Her work is dangerous, too, but she and Michael have connected on the deepest level and this keeps him from tipping into the abyss. They are ready to build a life together, excited by the changes ahead of them. Only Angela has one last mission--infiltrate the terrorist cell of IRA heavy weight Declan McLaughlin, whose plans for bombing the London Underground promise massive casualties. Declan isn't quite as outlandishly psychotic as some of French's villains (one Cillian Rainey comes to mind), but he's in the grips of a deadly political fervor and has absolutely no conscience. Unfortunately for Angela, he's also damn clever.Michael has a slim chance of recovering Angela alive. He has nothing on his side but the loyalty and friendship of fellow operative Richard Jordan and their former commanding officer, Colonel Mabbitt. As usual, these two are all-in, even though it's likely they'll die in the attempt. Their experience and skill comes in handy as Michael struggles to balance his raging fear for Angela with the calm resolve necessary to get her back.The action takes us all the way to terrorist training camps of Libya and back to London. It's a physically punishing ordeal for all involved. There's resolution but no true triumph, as he and Angela suffer heartbreaking loss.An excellent adventure with twist after twist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5YGMDYF2AI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXN1T0U#wasThisHelpful","RB5YGMDYF2AI8","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A sexy Black Ops professional comes to the aid of a kidnapped woman.Levi Komakov doesn't realize what he's getting himself into when he's charged with rescuing Anderson ""Andi"" Merrit from what appears at first glance is a kidnapping for cash or influence. Most likely the latter since her father is a heavy hitter for a crime family. Without spoiling the plot, let me say that the truth is far more twisted. Someone close to Andi has betrayed her and set her up for a life of servitude and abuse.Is it any wonder then that Andi is a bit uncooperative when Levi first appears on the scene? From her point of view, this man may be someone just as dangerous as her captors, someone who wants her for his own ends. So, I can forgive her for making her rescue far more dangerous and complicated than it needs to be.  Still, there are points in the novel, usually when the situation is most grim, that her temperamental displays grated on me. On the other hand it was a pleasure to watch her gradual transformation from victim into hero.Andi's growth is in large part due to Levi taking her seriously and not underestimating the danger she's in or the power of the people who are after her. Though he falls a little too hard too fast...and then constantly second guesses himself...he's a good alpha with a nice balance of sensitivity and strength.  He and Andi share plenty of chemistry.For a romance novel, the plotting is ambitious. Locations range from rural Washington state to the D.C. area to the Middle East. Every time I thought I knew where the story was heading, O'Neal threw in a twist. In particular, the Mission Impossible action at a foreign embassy was a nail biter. I held my breath the whole time.Just when I thought things couldn't get any more dramatic for this pair, the author throws a huge curve. Again, I don't want to spoil the book for readers. Let's just say that, along with Andi, we are taken into a world that few westerners get to see. Levi and his Special Ops buddies have a hell of job with this one. Andi, too, is pushed to her absolute limit physically and emotionally.I always begin a book with optimism...I assume I'll enjoy the ride. Well, I liked this one way more than even I expected. It's an exciting blend of romance, action and suspense. I'm going to go back now and read the first one in the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6AOYN7896FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAN3B98#wasThisHelpful","R3G6AOYN7896FZ","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Work as necessity.Work as vocation.Work as expression of our deepest selves.In a series of lyrical essays, author Nancy J. Nordenson explores the nature of work as a place of intersection between the practical and the spiritual. She does this in language so gorgeous, its tempting to linger over each image and turn of phrase. Luckily the subject matter pulls the reader through.Work in Nordensons view, is a mutable concept, a series of competing imperatives that exert a constant push-pull between the life we want and the one we end up with. Responsibility vs. freedom. The individual vs. the collective. Creativity vs. practicality. Theres no escape from this whirl of duality, only an ever-shifting accommodation. So much of the meaning of what we do is in the DOING, the figuring things out, the balancing of our needs and our desires.Nordenson grounds her spiritual and philosophical exploration firmly in the practical using stories from her own work life and that of her husbandthe ups and the downsto demonstrate that one still must make a life even as they are making do, and how so much of our day-to-day contentment is a matter of knowing what is in our control and what it not. Negotiating where we can. Accepting what cannot be negotiated. Sometimes acceptance might mean getting on with an imperfect situation, or it might mean cutting our losses.On a personal level, the concept that most resonated for me was that when it comes to human effort value and compensation often have very little to do with one another. This is a pretty radical assertion in a culture that places so much emphasis the bottom line and too readily confuses a persons worth with their annual income even as the notion job security goes the way of the dinosaurs.Finding Livelihood argues that weand our workare so much more than the amount of our pay check.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPA0DGXDVIIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNHI2VO#wasThisHelpful","RDPA0DGXDVIIB","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fifth entry in an anthology photo series. Short fiction, memoir and poetry on an autumn theme.The work in this thin volume is highly personal and touches upon family, nature, good times and bad. There's a nice variety of approaches to the theme. There were a couple of real standouts. ""A Prepper's Dream"" by Mary Garica is a short mystery with paranormal elements, ""The Autumn Dance"" by Casey Fry is an odd, sad story that left me with many questions. And  the poem ""Joy of Family"" offers snapshots from a large family gathering celebrating longstanding relationships and new arrivals.Autumn is my favorite season and this anthology captures its spirit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULRTDI2LRL4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500850209#wasThisHelpful","RULRTDI2LRL4V","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first in a series of novellas re-imagining the events in Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICELet me say from the outset that Jane Austen purists might not be thrilled with this one. It offers a unique variation on the classic novel: what if the Bennet girls' worst fear was realized and their father died. This is exactly what happens at the time of Jane's illness and stay at Netherfield Park. Mr. Collins indeed takes possession of Longbourne and much unhappiness ensues...but also some unexpected good fortune.I think West gets a little obscure with some of her Regency-era idioms. And the switcheroo she pulls with Bingley--gives him more backbone early on and then cools his ardor markedly. Will he and Jane find their happily ever after? Eventually. Maybe. That's another thing I didn't realize when I downloaded the book--it isn't a standalone novella in a series of linked novellas.  It's the first episode in a true serial. These days most writers make this explicit in the book description in the form of a clear disclaimer. It avoids misunderstanding and reader disappointment.Despite the fact that I don't care for serials, the story (or the portion included here) is fun and well written. Lydia's worse than in the original. But Mary is much better, which is nice. I've always liked Mary. Mr. Darcy isn't quite as forbidding. Not sure how I feel about that, but I did enjoy getting to know West's version. The plot is intricate given the length and well paced. There's plenty of tension.Overall, an intelligent and creative riff on an old  favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW3G1I8P24P29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0TSS6C#wasThisHelpful","RW3G1I8P24P29","A27C2IXNS65V64","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27C2IXNS65V64?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love K&N products.  I first found out about K&N products through my car geek friends.  They all use K&N on their cars and highly recommend it.  I bought this because I've been using K&N products for a while now and haven't been disappointed.  If you're curious about it, I would recommend watching a YouTube video or going to your local auto parts store to see their little demo of how it compares to regular air filters.  I think it can be pricey compared to your standard air filter, but since this thing is washable, it's totally worth the money because you'll your money's worth in 2 uses.  Great product.  It fits my vehicle perfect.  This is a total DIY type of thing and even those who have never looked at a car engine before can easily figure it out.

"I bought this because I really needed a sewing project and the things I saw online looked either too hard or wasn't inspiring enough.  This book has really super cute projects in it.  The projects though, aren't as ""easy"" as the book makes it seem.  I think that compared to other sewing books I own, other authors would rate this book's ""very easy"" projects as ""easy"" - ""medium"" difficulty.  I am a beginner at sewing and these projects definitely require a little bit of skill.  For example, that little purple jellyfish purse that is on the cover is labeled as ""experienced beginner"" difficulty level.  In my opinion, it is probably more like ""advanced"" level.  It requires a lot more detail than your typical purse.  There are a ton of great projects in here and I would recommend it for people of all skill levels (but have had at least 10 projects under their belt).

"Neat toothbrush.  It's not fancy but the handle is a little bit larger than other toothbrushes and the bristles seem to feel better on my teeth.  Maybe it's the firmness of the bristles?  I generally get soft bristles.  I don't know if the thing actually prevents bacterial build up but it at least feels good when I brush my teeth with it.  My only complaint really is the handle.  It's good for people with larger hands but I would prefer if they could round it a little bit more.  It's kind of an odd feeling gripping on to a squarish handle.  On the plus side, it doesn't roll over when I put the thing down.  The anti-bacterial properties of this thing is supposed to last up to 3 months but my dentist suggests changing toothbrushes every month.

The other neat thing is that it comes with a hook to hang from somewhere though I think that it's probably just as easy to place down on something.  It has a good battery life and will last for your entire party (or at least most of it).

It has a lot of potential because it can measure distance, calculate totals, and measures by pythatgorean, area/volume measuring.  These are all really handy functions to have when working on home improvement projects.  It's fairly straightforward to use and has a lot of potential.  My favorite part is that you can measure the distance based on different areas of the meter.  That is, if you happen to have the unit on the wall where the end/bottom of the unit is against it and need to know the distance including the meter, you can switch the mode to have it include the units of the meter itself.  It's similar to a measuring tape.  I like that it has a backlight so you can really see the numbers in darker areas.  My only and primary issue with this device is that I currently haven't been able to figure out how to calibrate it.  Straight out of the box, this unit comes fairly inaccurate.  You'd want exact measurements and being even a fraction of an inch off can cause problems.  There are instructions in the manual on how to do this but I haven't figured out how to accomplish the calibration.  The instructions seem pretty clear but I just can't get my meter to get into that mode.  I even asked 2 friends (one is an engineer) and neither could figure it out.  I'm giving it 3 stars instead of less stars because I am going to assume this is user error.  I will update this review if I ever figure it out but as of right now, this thing is off by 40%.

"These headphones are pretty cool.  I like that they come with a mic so you can talk on the phone with them.  The sound quality of these reminds me of my school library headphones.  They're very straightforward and have no frills.  So if you're not big on ridiculous sound extremes (like a ton of bass), then these would be good.  The headphones themselves come in a nice carrying case to protect them.  I've found that there's also a little bit of room in the center to put a few things in which is handy.  There is a slight smell to the material of the case and the headphones themselves.  It's stronger on the case than the headphones so I suspect that it just transferred over.  When I wear the headphones, I don't notice the smell so much.  As far as fit goes, these will go down far enough and expand wide enough for those with larger noggins.

"These are great lights.  I did install them on my fence because I wanted to light up the dark area on the side of my house.  They're bright enough to allow me to walk safely at night without tripping over the dogs' toys and random messy yard stuff.  There were a few overcast days where I live and the lights either held the charge from the sunny days or was able to charge even though it was overcast.  The lights are small and attractive.  It doesn't stick out like a sore thumb in the yard.  In the photo, from the manufacturer, I thought it looked like there was metal inside like a car light.  But it's actually just the reflection of the plastic.  It's black plastic on the inside.  I think that if they put a piece of metal inside, it can make it brighter.  I might try to open it up and redo it myself.  But as is, it's plenty bright enough for my needs.  I received this product free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

"These are great!  I have these over my garage side door and it provides light for me when I'm taking out the trash.  They provide bright light for a decent radius and the solar aspect of it helps me save money on energy.

"These stainless steel measuring spoons are of surprisingly good quality.  I was expecting them to be really lightweight like my Kitchenaid ones but they're actually heavier than those!  I was very surprised.  It's weighted like my restaurant quality measuring bowls.  This is really great.  I prefer these over my Kitchenaid measuring spoons because it's thicker and stronger (not that I am measuring anything that requires strength in a measuring spoon).  I just feel as if it's going to last me a long time.  I've ran it through the dishwasher a few times so far and there's no rust or damage to them.  They didn't warp either.  I really do like these a lot.  The other great thing about these is that it comes with 6 spoons instead of 4 like my Kitchenaid ones.  That means there's less scoops and less math involved.

"This is a nice toddler leash.  The color is really cute for either a boy or a girl because it's just a solid, primary red.  The material is soft and padded but not overly thick.  It has this mesh-like/textured material on the inside which helps the breathability.  The handle is actually firm.  I was expecting it to be foam inside but it's probably metal.  The leash is lightweight as is the handle so there's no concern about weight.  The buckles are perfectly good and will likely withstand a lot of pulling.  My guys haven't broken it yet.  The only thing I would like for them to do different with this leash is if they used a double stitch instead of a single stitch.  I feel as if it could unravel after some time.  The straps for the handle is just made of one piece of material without padding.  That is fine since it doesn't touch the child.  I do think they could make it stronger with a different material or if it was double stitched.  But... for a small child, it shouldn't be a problem.  It would make this product even better than it already is.  Overall, it's perfectly good for a small child.  I received this product free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

"These are surprisingly good!  I have had rain ponchos plenty but this one is actually heavier and made of thicker material than my other ones.  The other ones I've had were similar to a plastic bag.  These are closer to a shower curtain.  I like that it fits me and has room for movement.  I actually do ride my bike for commuting and I tried it out to see if it was too long or too short.  It is neither so I'm glad for that.  The other nice thing about this is that it's great for windy situations (like a ball game or something).  It blocks out wind so you're not freezing your rear off outdoors.

"This is a fun keyboard stickers set.  It applies easily and the instructions are very straightforward.  I was able to apply it to my keyboard without too many bubbles.  I was able to peel and reapply the pieces that did have bubbles in them.  These stickers don't damage your keyboard because they're made of vinyl and can be removed easily without leaving residue.  I don't know why they call it ""silicone"".  It's similar to the vinyl paper I use for my Silhouette Cameo machine.  The colors look exactly like the photo (I got the outerspace one).  The only thing that I'm on the fence about is that it makes the keys more scratchy because they're obviously not going to be quite as smooth around the edges as the keyboard without stickers.

"So... I'm on the fence about these things.  I really am.  In the pack of 5 that I received, only 4 of them worked.  No big deal since I got them free or at a discount in exchange for a review.  I turned them on (the ones that worked) and they give off plenty of light for my purposes (which is a car trunk).  I installed all of them on my friend's junker car (she really needs to get a new car... Anyway...) because she doesn't have a trunk light.  I put all four of them in a row and the adhesive didn't seem to be sticky enough for that (it's an uneven surface).  i went ahead and used some Glue Dots for extra security.  So with all four of them turned on, her trunk had pretty decent light.  I was able to see around the car trunk with one light but it wasn't as nice as having them all turned on obviously.  The lights feel fairly cheaply made.  Frankly, I expect to find this sort of thing at the dollar store.  I was careful to twist the back off carefully so I didn't break them.  I can see someone breaking them by accident because s/he failed to read the instructions in the product description.  They should include the same instructions in the box.  My complaint is that it's really difficult to install the batteries and near impossible to remove them once they're in.  I had to actually use a flat screwdriver to pry them out.  I couldn't use my fingers to get them out at all.  The reason I had to remove the batteries is because I had a battery drawer of mixed (some dead) batteries.  Anyway, they're easy to use.  You just push on the plastic dome to turn it off and on.  My biggest gripe is really that the batter installation shouldn't be so challenging.  Other than that, they're fine for what they are.  They even survived a few car rides so far.  I will update my review if the lights die shortly.  I received this product free or at discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

I know that this thing is labeled as a Men's item, but I don't see why women can't wear it.  Maybe there are just less women mountain bikers so they are trying to advertise to the majority.  Either way, this is a really nice bracelet.  I like the material that it is made out of because it doesn't look cheap.  I hate cheap looking jewelry.

"This is a neat boot organizer for several reasons.  I like that it helps my boots from looking wrinkly and worn.  It also helps breathability so that my boots don't stink from using them all the time.  This is great for not only womens' boots, but any kind of boot.  I would recommend it for snowy or rainy places.  The product is easy to assemble and takes only 2 steps to complete.  You basically slide the boot holder part onto a rod and then put the ends of the rod on.  Done.  Because it's made of plastic (other than the rod), it's pretty much waterproof.  That's why I think it's great for winter boot storage.  The base is also wide enough that it won't tip over with heavier boots.  The spacers/boot holders are movable so you can change them depending on boot width.  This is overall a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who owns tall boots.

"The opening of These Broken Stars I loved wholeheartedly. The whole Titanic in space thing was done perfectly, so well, in fact, that I really dont know why its not been done before (that I know of). The Icarus, a giant luxury spaceship with a name that suggests a desire to triumph over nature, is home to Lilac LaRoux, matches the Titanic quite well. The spoiled heiress Lilac LaRoux and the rest of the creme de la creme dine in style, mocking the lower-born who share the ship with them. Gowns and social class and money are whats important to them. Against all odds, Lilac and Tarver Merendson, a decorated soldier, flirt one night at a party, to which he was invited solely because of his war hero status. Then she shoots him down, because men who flirt with her are in danger of reassignment to a dangerous post thanks to her father, the richest man in the universe.This parts actually quite brief. The Icarus lives up to its name, shocked from hyperdrive and then falling to a nearby planet. Unlike the Titanic, only one escape pod gets away from the ship, the one bearing Tarver and Lilac, conveniently enough. The bulk of These Broken Stars is actually just these two trying to survive in adverse conditions. Their survival is made especially difficult by Lilacs privileged upbringing. Again, I think Kaufman and Spooner do a good job with this, making Lilac enough of a brat to be believable, but showing how strong she is at heart. She grows a lot in the course of a couple of weeks.Though kept simmering on the back burner for most of the book, the central core of the novel is the romance between Tarver and Lilac. Theyre sweet together and I think its great that they are in effect equal partners, both coming to the relationship with different skills and a mutual respect. Tarver doesnt do much of the macho man stuff after he gets to know her better, which is refreshing. Still, I didnt get the feels from them at all, largely, I imagine, due to the fact that I found their voices pretty indistinguishable and kept having to remind myself which character I was reading. Without an emotional bond to them, I could appreciate the romance, but not FEEL it.As far as the twisty bits go, Im not really sure what to make of where the plot goes. The whole chilling whispers part seemed to add a lot of convenience that I didnt really care for much. Where it had been a dark story of survival, These Broken Stars twisted to become something else. Plus, I really hate the fake out trope, which the plot depended on. Though I can't say WHAT happened, I can say it was confusing and a total cop out.Though that came out rather negative, I do think theres more good than bad in here, particularly for readers that arent like me. I will be anticipating the next book in the series, and Im rather thankful that its about new characters, rather than these two. Its like a fresh roll of the dice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBC0XSQO8KJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423171020#wasThisHelpful","R3RBC0XSQO8KJS","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was in elementary school, I distinctly remember how popular Jon Scieszka's The Stinky Cheese Man: And Other Fairly Stupid Tales was. Managing to get a hold of it at the school library was pretty much impossible, because everyone wanted to read it. I can easily imagine Fairy Tale Comics being similarly popular with the intended audience. The stories are light-hearted and funny, though with just enough of the cruelty of the original tales to delight kids, because, let's be honest, children do tend to like watching people get hurt.Most of the stories featured in Fairy Tale Comics were familiar to me and will be to other adult readers as well, being the most popular of the Grimms' tales. However, Duffy also included a handful of tales from other sources, ones I've never encountered myself. This blend of the familiar and the new will be enchanting for kids and parents alike. Younger readers enjoy familiarity, and it helps make reading a bit easier if you know the story already. In fact, Duffy clearly had this in mind when he put the anthology together, because the first five stories are all Grimms' tales, allowing the reader to get comfortable before springing something that might be new.In most anthologies, there tend to be a few real clunkers, but all of the stories in Fairy Tale Comics were really fun reads. Sure, I had my personal favorites, but none of them were horribly boring or with artwork so annoying I couldn't deal. The stories I enjoyed the most were ""The Prince and the Tortoise"" by Ramona Fradon and Chris Duffy, ""Rapunzel"" by Raina Telgemeier, and ""Give Me the Shudders"" by David Mazzuchelli. Two of them were entirely new to me, and Rapunzel had a nice twist to the ending that I rather enjoyed.As is the case in ""Rapunzel,"" several of the tales feature clever little changes. These obviously will not stand out to those who are not well-versed in the tales, but I picked up on a few and they were all great improvements. Obviously much of the gore has been cut, but there are intentional revisions, most of which increase the role of the female characters in the fairy tales. In ""Puss in Boots,"" the reader learns right at the end that Puss is in fact a female cat. Similarly, the lumberjack in ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is a woman, rather than a man. These are small changes, but they're excellently done, adding agency and strength to female characters.Fairy Tale Comics will be enjoyed by both parents and children, or adults like me who do not get tired of clever retellings of fairy tales. Each tale is humorous and quick for younger readers, but with subtle jokes to delight maturer readers. A great readalike for Jon Scieszka's fairy tale retellings or fractured fairy tales, like those included in Rocky & Bullwinkle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16KXU39LWBBOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596438231#wasThisHelpful","R16KXU39LWBBOH","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I consider Brandon Sanderson one of my very favorite authors. Anything he writes automatically goes on my wishlist, and I've enjoyed every book of his I've read. With Steelheart, however, there was a time where I wasn't even sure if I would be able to rate this book three stars at the end. This book doesn't live up to the other Sanderson novels I've read, the first in three other series (The Stormlight Archive, Alcatraz, and Mistborn). Of course, I'm sure different sorts of readers may like this one better, but I'm left rather disappointed, probably due to my exceedingly high expectations.As ever, where Brandon Sanderson shines is in the world building. Sanderson has a real knack for creating unique worlds that run on different principles, following that logic through. This world, while not as disparate as his epic fantasies, compels the imagination. Superhero stories have always held a fascination for me, and, with the Epics, Sanderson has done something wholly new, to my experience anyway, with that concept. The Epics are villains, every last one of them, proving the old adage that absolute power corrupts absolutely.That premise may suggest to you, and rightly so, that Steelheart gets rather dark. This is not a world of brave, unparalleled heroism, of good triumphing over evil. Even the good guys have dark secrets and motivations. Take, for example, the main character, David. He's a fairly average teen, except for that whole thing where he's dedicated his life to avenging his father, with the single-minded devotion of Inigo Montoya.Steelheart, the titular villain, rules over a Newcago, a Chicago made of steel where the sun literally doesn't shine. Steelheart and his cronies, including Nightwielder who blocks the sun from the city, keep systems going and food available to the people, in exchange for utter domination. Epics, these super-powered individuals, can do anything to any person without recrimination; the government of the US limps along in some areas of the Fractured States, but the Epics truly have free reign. It's a horrific picture, rather like humanity has begun involving and Magneto's crew have subjugated everyone, and there are no X-Men.Sanderson also proves himself a skilled plotter once again. In every novel, Sanderson always manages to surprise me with something, if not with an actual twist then with exactly how something worked, even if I had it generally figured out. That always makes his books that extra bit of exciting to read.However, the character-building in Steelheart really left me wanting so much more. In his other novels, I've found his characters almost immediately compelling, not just the main characters, but the supporting ones as well. With Steelheart, I didn't much care for a single character. The Reckoners, a team of humans killing Epics to prove it can be done and that fighting back is possible, should be a quirky bunch with all the personality of the crew of the Firefly. Sadly, though they're quirky, none of them really coalesced into feeling real and their witty banter was seriously lacking.Many of the problems lie in the narrator, David. He alternates between an encyclopedic knowledge of weaponry and Epics and mindless devotion to his cause of killing Steelheart and drooling over Megan. He instaloves all over the place on this girl because she's super hot and can fight. Wow, what a solid foundation for a relationship. As far as I can tell, Sanderson's pushing this ship, but he's got a lot of work to do to make that happen, because they have no chemistry: David's a kid with pathetic puppy love and Megan's...I don't really know.Anyway, David. Not only do I not found David to be a particularly interesting character, his narration is frequently annoying. Idiosyncracies help build realistic characters, but, in this case, I feel like David was given one idiosyncracy and sent on his way like the work was done. That idiosyncracy: making really ridiculous metaphors constantly, like:""He had a smile like a parrotfish, which I've always assumed look like parrots, though I've never actually seen either.""What incredibly useful narration there, David! You have just managed to tell the reader nothing on several levels. Congratulations! There are many such instances, and it's made into a running gag throughout the book, but it's one that failed to make me laugh; the only response it provoked from me was eye-rolling. I can imagine this working from a character who isn't otherwise so deadly serious, but it didn't fit the rest of David's characterization.Then there's the Southern Scot, who embodies every stereotype of American Southerners and the Scottish, down to a monologue on the bagpipes that is TOTALLY plot-relevant (SARCASM). This guy, Cody, threw me out of the book every time he referred to individuals as ""y'all"" and groups as ""all y'all."" I've been informed that some southerners do use ""y'all"" this way, but it makes my eye twitch because ""y'all"" is an abbreviation of ""YOU ALL."" IT IS PLURAL. Also, why is this necessary? As with David's quirk, I feel like the weaknesses of the characterization are largely shortcuts taken to add humor to the novel and make them seem more real and quirky. Sadly, this backfired big time.Though this is thus far my least favorite of Sanderson's works, he can still world build like few other authors. The Reckoners series will be a good choice for fans of supervillains and world building. More character-focused readers, like myself, may struggle with this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNV74NTATY7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743564#wasThisHelpful","RZNV74NTATY7E","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In general, mysteries are one of the few genres that fail to interest me. Just like crime dramas, I generally find them really repetitive, and there's often not enough character development to really get me engaged in the story. I do, however, make an exception for stories about psychopaths, and Find Me by Romily Bernard turned out to be just the sort of incredibly creeptastic mystery that I enjoy.The overall plot and tone of Find Me heavily recalls the first season of Veronica Mars, which really isn't a bad thing, since that's one of my favorite mystery programs. Wick Tate, daughter of a criminal father, the sort of man whose behavior drove her mother to suicide, finally has a comfortable home with Bren and Todd, who are fostering Wick and her younger sister Lily. However, a cop named Carson keeps coming around, probably onto Wick's recreational activities, which include computer hacking, a skill she learned from her sketchy upbringing among criminals. Then someone leaves a notebook belonging to a dead girl, Tessa Waye, on her doorstep with a note reading only ""Find Me.""Wick's narrative voice is dark, mistrustful, and blackly comic. Bernard convincingly portrays Wick as a girl who has been dumped on by life enough times that she knows to be ready for anything and trusts almost no one. She can count the number of people she trusts on one hand. Wick is strong, clever, and backed into a corner. Her bitterness may be hard for some readers to relate to, but her core of sadness, particularly with the way the suicide of Tessa, a girl she used to be friends with a long time ago, and the way it stirs up memories of her mothers death. There's a very emotionally powerful scene where Wick tells off a girl for her judgment of Tessa's choice to end her life.The mystery element does have a lot of commonalities with the first season-long arc of Veronica Mars. A popular girl dead, with few leads but a secret boyfriend. These commonalities didn't really detract from the excitement of the plot, but I did note them. The ending really did creep me out and, though I wasn't all that surprised by who the killer was, it was still utterly terrifying.One thing did really bother me about Find Me, and that's Griff, Wick's love interest. Though they've known each other for three years, it's in a very basic ""we have classes together"" way. They're not friends, really. On the day when Wick hears of Tessa's suicide, she goes home sick, and Griff texts her to see if she's okay, having had her number from when they worked on a class project together. Up to that point, I thought he was a nice, sweet guy. Then, that night, he scares the bejeebus out of her when he climbs a tree outside her window because she didn't respond to the text. WARNING: CREEPER ALERT. Then, later, she asks him for help with something and he offers to do so if she'll kiss him. WARNING: NOT CUTE; SKETCHY. Later, he breaks into her room and leaves a drawing for her, since, again, she ignored texts. WARNING: RUN FOR THE HILLS. He's also way too grabby and bossy. Wick recognizes and even calls him out on his stalkerish behavior, but is okay with it because it's him. No. No. No. No.The other issue is that a lot of plot lines still seem up in the air at the end. The mystery's resolved, but Wick's family drama is not. Based on the ending, it seems that at least one more book is in the works about Wick Tate, though I can't find anything to confirm that. Plot lines left dangling isn't an issue if this is a series, but certainly is if this is a standalone.All in all, Find Me is a highly entertaining, heart-pumping mystery. Fans of Veronica Mars might especially enjoy Bernard's debut. If there does in fact turn out to be a sequel, I'll definitely be reading it for Wick's delightful narrative voice, but hoping the romance goes somewhere less unsettling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Z0IV3AQ6BHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062229036#wasThisHelpful","R4Z0IV3AQ6BHR","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dark Unwinding enchanted and delighted me, so, upon the news that there would in fact be a sequel, I was thrilled, even though such surprise sequels generally result in angry Twitter rants. Of course, sequels to books that were closed enough that you didn't know there would be one can be a tricky business. Though I didn't enjoy A Spark Unseen as much as its predecessor, I'm still happy to have read it and would, if a third pops up, read that one too without a doubt.In The Dark Unwinding, I fell in love with the characters that call Stranwyne Keep home, and they are just as wonderful in A Spark Unseen. Katherine Tulman very much takes center stage this time, because Lane's missing and Uncle Tully is incapacitated because reasons for much of the book. Though I did miss them, Katherine is a magnificent heroine. She's incredibly strong emotionally and intellectually, and I completely love her for the way she stands up to people. Also, she may be the inheritor of an estate, but she doesn't think herself better than anyone else because of an accident of birth and fortune. At one point, her maid, Mary, rings a bell for her to come and she does, shocking a visitor, but that's the sort of person Katherine is.One of the highlights of A Spark Unseen turns out to be Mrs. Hardcastle. Initially, she's this nosy, untrustworthy busybody. Over the course of the book, though, she begins showing hidden depths. I mention this fairly minor character to highlight an aspect of Cameron's characterization that I love: people are not dismissed as stereotypes. Uncle Tully could have been dismissed, as he is by many, as a nutcase, but he's respected and loved by the people of Stranwyne Keep. He's brilliant if you stand by to see that, and I like the way Cameron gives depth even to more minor characters.Now, I do warn that a very minor spoiler is ahead, so you can duck out now if you wish. One of the big plot points is that Lane, Katherine's love interest, has been gone for a year and a half, and is now presumed dead. Katherine heads to Paris to search for him, and, inevitably finds him. A heroine finding her love interest alive in this sort of book is to me not a spoiler, but whatever. Anyway, my very favorite part of the book is when Katherine takes Lane to task for not contacting her and for trying to push her away for her own good. She monologues at him for a couple of pages, and it is a thing of beauty. More heroines need to act this way when their boys start making decisions for them. You tell him, girl!However, much as I love the characters, I did struggle a bit with A Spark Unseen. I feel like the plot of The Dark Unwinding was more character-focused with an almost magical realism feel to Uncle Tully's toys. A Spark Unseen goes much more heavy on the historical and the political. Sadly, I'm not as interested in the political machinations as I am in the interactions of the colorful cast. For readers who are more plot-focused, I'm sure A Spark Unseen will be your favorite of the two novels. There are also some intriguing twists for those who like those best.Though not my favorite of the series, A Spark Unseen does contain the magic that made The Dark Unwinding a favorite. As ever, I eagerly anticipate whatever Sharon Cameron writes next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18IZTNXVGCO3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545328136#wasThisHelpful","R18IZTNXVGCO3Q","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trish Doller's debut novel wasn't one that I ordinarily would have picked out or been particularly interested in, but the reviews convinced me to give Something Like Normal a try. That was a wonderful bookish decision, because, though the topic itself didn't appeal to me, Doller still managed to lure me into the book, a hold that didn't release until the last page. In fact, the main character wasn't someone I could relate to in the slightest, and the kind of person I would ordinarily loathe, but Doller made me care for him. This is I think the biggest strength of her writing, one she brings to bear in Where the Stars Still Shine as Well. Doller's sophomore novel does not disappoint, covering similarly gritty subjects in an emotional and frank way.As with Doller's first novel, her sophomore effort once again centers around a main character very much unlike myself. Callie has lived the life of a migrant, following her itchy-footed mother from place to place. They barely have enough to make ends meet, often skipping town on overdue rent checks. Since childhood, Callie's life has always been this way, and she's not been to school since kindergarten. Her only education comes from books, scavenged from sales or libraries; reading is one of her only joys. Abused by one of her mother's boyfriends, Callie's view of sex and herself has been warped. She feels dirty, tainted, and throws herself into meaningless sexual encounters almost to prove her own opinion of herself. In pretty much every way, Callie's life has been entirely unlike mine, and her decisions are ones that I would never personally make. And yet Doller works her author magic, making me feel for this girl and empathize with her in a way I ordinarily would not be able to do. Doller brings Callie to life and puts the reader into her mind so solidly that her flawed mental processes make sense.When her mother is arrested, Callie's world upends. Suddenly, her mother, her only family and sole companion for the last twelve years, is out of her life, and she's to live with her father and his new family. Feeling oddly uprooted, Callie really has a chance to lay down roots for the first time, to make friends and have a family. Callie evolves slowly and believably. Even though her new family supports her and the community accepts her, the patterns of the previous decade are hard to break, and she continually makes decisions that push people away or that she knows to be unwise, like her hook ups with the hottest guy in town, Alex Kostas. As the book progresses, what I found most touching and powerful in Callie's narration was the way it really opened up, the tone becoming cheerful and childlike as she feels settled and safe enough to really let go for the first time in years.The familial relationships form the backbone of Where the Stars Still Shine. Though largely absent during the novel, Callie's mother holds powerful sway over her. Even as the lies she's been told surface, Callie cannot sever the ties to her mother, who was her whole world for so long. The power parents have over the emotions of their children is horrifying. Meanwhile, Callie's father, Greg, is incredibly sweet but also awkward, trying to find the young child he lost in this distant seventeen-year-old. Basically Greg wins for planning to build Callie a library. Even Greg's wife, who in many novels would be a villain, has a back story and depth to her, and helps Callie progress.For the first time ever, Callie has the chance to make real friends. Initially, I was not a huge fan of Kat, Callie's cousin, who barges into her life and claims best friend status. Kat comes across as pushy and selfish, forcing Callie into a set up with Connor, who really isn't Callie's type. Kat annoyed me and didn't seem to be helping Callie much either. Towards the end of the book, though, Kat almost made me cry with her thoughtfulness, hidden under her rambunctious exterior. Though not a kindred spirit perhaps, she's just the kind of person needed to help pull Callie out of her shell, emotional, open with her feelings, and understanding.Where the Stars Still Shine does get fairly steamy, but not to a level that I find in any way inappropriate for a YA novel. Alex Kostas totally fooled me. I thought there was nothing to him but a guy looking to get laid, but he's actually got his own reasons for being where he is. Actually, all people do, and that's an easy thing to forget. I judged Alex off of that first moment he appeared, and that wasn't all there was to him. I really like the way Doller handles the relationship between Callie and Alex. It hit just the right note and differed from so many YA romances.Just last week, I visited Florida, and my friend, Kara, pointed out a heavily Greek neighborhood as she drove past while taking me to the airport. She even told me she'd bought her bath sponge there, which I thought was a really odd comment. Like, big whoop, it's a sponge. However, I'm so glad she pointed these things out to me, because Where the Stars Still Shine takes place in Florida in a predominantly Greek community. Callie works in a shop that sells sponges to tourists and Kostas works on a sponging boat. The setting is a delight, the Greek characters shining with the same sort of close-knit community that I loved so much in My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Perhaps my favorite thing about Where the Stars Still Shine, though, is that Doller doesn't wrap everything up in a neat, shiny bow. Callie's come a long way by the end, and so have some of the other characters, but there are still a lot of issues lingering. Though the ending is fairly happy, it's not a happily ever after and it's most definitely bittersweet. Real life doesn't tend to get to complete perfection, and ending realistic fiction that way often seems misleading to me. Doller's ending both satisfies and leaves room for a future with problems and changes.Much as I loved Something Like Normal, I may even have loved Where the Stars Still Shine even more. Either way, Doller has cemented herself as one of the finest contemporary YA novelists. Her novels draw the reader in and help create empathy for people in situations that might be radically different from one's own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZS65QU3IOSV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161963144X#wasThisHelpful","R2ZS65QU3IOSV4","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my experience, YA novels written by romance novelists generally go one of two ways: awesomely or atrociously. Now, this may not be the case for most, but, personally, I go to a romance novel and a YA novel for totally different reasons, and I don't want a romance novel from my YA; romance can (perhaps should) be a part of that, but there should be more going on than that. Thankfully, Sherry Thomas has written an absolutely amazing YA novel, bursting with fabulous characters, action, delightful writing, and a swoon-worthy romance.Where do I even begin with what I loved when there is so much? Okay, let's start at the beginning, where we meet our stubborn, hard-working, thoughtful heroine Iolanthe. She's practicing hard to do the lighting at a wedding ceremony with her elemental magic, all to protect the job of her guardian, though he's done little to deserve it. Then in he comes, ranting and raving and reminding me of Haymitch (his name is Haywood - coincidence?). He tells her not to perform at the wedding and ruins her light elixir. Consulting a magic text, she learns a thunderbolt (or more accurately lighting bolt) can save her elixir, so she discovers some powers she never knew she had just like that. No big deal. This alerts everyone, both good and bad, to the fact that she is a seriously kick butt elemental mage, and they all want her for something.Enter Titus: spoiled Prince or hope of the Domain. Because of a prophecy, he knows that he needs this elemental mage to help him save everyone from the tyrannical, apparently immortal ruler of Antlantis. Titus believes in the prophecy and will risk everything, including both of their lives to fulfill it. Though he's very goal-oriented, I took to Titus immediately with his spell-casting and his weird hobby of reading ladies' magazines because he finds them comforting.Now we're getting to the really good part, namely the one where one of my favorite tropes comes in, and this really isn't a spoiler I promise, since you will guess it in the tiny prologue. Basically, to hide out from the super terrifying bad guy, Iolanthe has to go undercover at a boys' school, because Titus, misguided, assumed the mage of prophecy would be a guy, so he had a male's disguise ready. Oops. Lucky for him, Iolanthe is brilliant and totally rocks at gender bending. Why do I love this so much? Because reasons. That may have to do with the fact that there's always an adorable lgbt subtext. Like, yeah, Titus is straight, but he's totally not bothered by all the rumors that he and his friend Fairfax are actually gay lovers, which is a quality I find charming in a guy. Also, it means the heroine isn't super gorgeous all the time or fretting over her looks, and he likes her none the less for that.Okay, so, obviously, there's a romance here, and obviously I love it. They have a total hate to love thing going, which is my favorite. They also, true to that romantic arc at it's best, excel at bantering with one another. Thomas really makes you feel the chemistry between them, and I was essentially trying to reach into the book and make them kiss all the way through. Even better, the romance doesn't follow traditional lines, Iolanthe generally being the aggressor physically and Titus the more emotionally committed. In fact, Titus totally spends a lot of time daydreaming and doing the fantasy novel equivalent of doodling her name on his notebooks, and my goodness but it's precious. Oh, and, even better, he doesn't mind letting her save him sometimes.Leaving the romance behind, I also want to praise Sherry Thomas for how powerful women are in The Burning Sky. On both the side of good and of evil, in the past and in the present, women have achieved both high rank and high power. So often, it's just the heroine who really takes a strong female role, the better to stand out, but the Inquisitor, Helgira, and even Lady Callista are certainly to be feared and admired, in their ways. For once, this is a fantasy world in which everything isn't intensely patriarchal, even more rare in a historically-based fantasy.My only quibbles lie in the world building, which is a bit of a pop culture hodge-podge. While this didn't detract from my enjoyment one bit, it's a bit to process and might annoy other readers with similarities to other works. For example, I was strongly reminded of Avatar: The Last Airbender, Howl's Moving Castle, and Stardust (one of the cutest scenes of that movie - and maybe book, but I don't remember - gender swapped). On top of that, I found the interweaving of our culture's fairy tales into this fantasy world rather puzzling. I guess this must be an alternate universe then? I'm not quite sure, which is sort of my point. There's a lot happening and it's all fun, but I'm left feeling a bit shaky.The Burning Sky kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. If you enjoy the fantasy works of Maria V. Snyder or Kristin Cashore, odds are you will appreciate Sherry Thomas' YA debut. The sequel cannot come quickly enough. In fact, I loved the romance and themes in here so much, I may even try her romance novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SHSQ3ZKF12AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062207296#wasThisHelpful","R3SHSQ3ZKF12AV","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year, I was really blown away by Jay Kristoff's debut, Stormdancer. Though this often isn't the case, I'm actually more impressed with the sequel. This does seem to have been a trend lately, and I do hope it continues, especially if the book world is going to continue to be overrun with series. But I digress. Kinslayer is darker, creepier, and more intense than its predecessor. If you're one of those people who thinks characters meeting gruesome ends is a necessity in epic works, get excited, because Jay Kristoff has a real flair for murdering his characters in nasty ways.The one weakness Stormdancer had, if it can be counted as one, for me was that it had that typical fantasy slowness at the beginning. Building a world takes time, and characterization took a back seat while that happened. In Kinslayer, the world's already built, so the action kicks off right from the start. Of course, Kristoff does lull you into a nice little unsuspecting place by not doing anything particularly cruel in the first half, and then he pounces on your heart and tears it to shreds. But we'll come back to that.In the opening, we spend some time with Yukiko and Buruu, who remains magnificent. Yukiko on the other hand, well, girl's not doing so hot. The Kenning has really amped up, and is inducing serious headaches and bleeds out of facial orifices. To silence the voices, she's got a drinking problem. Also, Yukiko's fiercely angry and desirous of vengeance, because, well, she was scorned and apparently that guy still has ways to mess with her. Basically, Yukiko's not heroic. She's not a role model. She's not particularly likable. While this will no doubt be tough for a lot of readers to fathom, I thought it was a nice change of pace from more saintly heroines. Kristoff's world is one where even the good guys have a lot of the dark side in them.Introducing new characters can be tricky, and often backfires. In such large casts, it's hard enough to keep everyone straight, though, thankfully, there's a handy dandy guide at the opening of the novel that lists the pertinent cast members, which totally saved me. Actually, in this case, I love the new additions to the cast. Hana is probably my second favorite human character. She's on the lowest rung of society, fit, literally, only to carry excrement, which she does in the palace. One-eyed and spat upon, she still dreams and dares, having joined the rebellion. I also love her brother Yoshi and his boyfriend Jurou. The healthiest relationship (which may not be that healthy, but let's remember how Jay Kristoff hates happiness) is a gay one, which gives me joy. Momentarily. Until Kristoff stomps on that joy.Kristoff is also doing some interesting things evolving the characters we knew from the first book. The character arcs are really impressive. Kin shows signs of doing something intense in book three, which could be for good or for ill and the fact that I have to wait forever to find out is frustrating. Aisha has a part to play, and it is intense. My new favorite (human) character, though, is Michi, who we didn't really get to see in action, and, oh man, is it a thing of beauty. She's way more lethal than Yukiko, who, let's face it, mostly has animals do the work for her. Again, I like that, though Yukiko's the figurehead, she's really not any sort of savior; other people are doing the bulk of the work. Of course, one of my favorite animal characters bit the dust. THANKS FOR THAT SCARRING PAIN, JAY.The plot of Kinslayer moves a bit slowly, but if you wait for it there's some crazy stuff going down. Some things caught me entirely off guard, and now I just have to wait and find out what happens. There's a bit of a second book element in that most of the happenings here are clearly moving the players into place for the epic, bloody showdown to come. Still, I don't feel like Kristoff was just biding his time and I was never bored, so I really don't mind that. Some of Yukiko's journey does seem a bit out of place, but I suspect that something that happened there will become absolutely crucial, so, again, really not an issue for me.Kinslayer is intense and heart-punching. Are you ready? Probably not. Will you venture into the storm anyway? I think you should.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R206N30YPRZ1I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250001412#wasThisHelpful","R206N30YPRZ1I0","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just the other day on Twitter, I mentioned the fact that I couldn't really think of any YA heroines whose high school experience in any way recalled my own, and along comes This Song Will Save Your Life. For this reason, This Song was a really personal read for me, one that I found immensely moving, comforting, and beautiful. As a teenager, I wish Leila Sales' book had already been out, because it would have immensely helped and comforted my teenage self.In the opening chapter of This Song Will Save Your Life, the reader meets Elise Dembowski, an incredibly unhappy but brilliant girl. Elise does not struggle academically and has a loving family; her divorced parents have worked out a great system, and do the best they can for her. However, Elise has never fit in with the other kids at school, and she's sick of being friendless and lonely. Being a girl who generally can accomplish anything she sets her mind to, she spends the whole summer learning how to be cool and just like the other kids. However, the first day of sophomore year does not go as planned and Elise decides to skip the second half of the day and commit suicide, all hope lost. And, I promise, this really is all in the first chapter.Now, this may seem melodramatic to you, but all of this resonated with me so incredibly strongly. I see so much of myself in Elise Dembowski: her bitterness and desperation, her thoughts that maybe it won't be better and that it would be best to end it all. In my case, I never seriously contemplated suicide, but I did think about it, imagining everyone fraught with guilt and sadness that they never appreciated me in life. Like Elise, I really didn't have friends and could not understand why everyone was either antagonistic to me or completely ignored me. In her, I see what I also later learned about myself: the fact that part of the reason people avoided me was my own attitude, one I hardly realized I had. Though I was not actively bullied like Elise (at least in high school), everything she felt and experienced was so close to my own life in that period.From there, Elise's experience no longer mirrors my own, but continues to be emotionally resonant and touching. This Song Will Save Your Life really is a story of a girl finding herself and discovering her passions. She's learning to accept who she is and how much happier life is when you stop judging yourself by the rules of society, and do and be what makes you happy. Accepting society's definition of yourself is so easy to do; learning to reject this is a crucial life lesson. I myself learned that in college and I have been so much more satisfied with life since, because I could finally quit chasing after things I don't actually want just because society says I should want them.Unlike so much YA fiction, This Song Will Save Your Life focuses much more on family and friendship than on romance. I love Elise's family so much. Sales depicts a healthy example of both divorce and remarriage. Both her single father and her mother, remarried with two more children, love her and take good care of her. Elise's family situation is healthy, and, even when Elise misbehaves, they support her and really do encourage her in her pursuits. Even Elise's little siblings are adorable, and her relations with her younger sister Alex broke my heart.With regards to friendship, Sales presents a realistic portrayal of high school dynamics. There's the stereotypical mean girl and brutish jocks, as well as the outcasts. However, Sales goes beyond the stereotypes and shows the ways that people can surprise you if you let them. Again, Elise's journey highlights the way that she pushes people away without realizing she's doing so, all the time desperately wishing for someone to like her.Finally, the romance, which me being the person I am, I can't not talk about. Elise differs so greatly from the average YA heroine. There's not an instaloving bone in her body. She clearly distinguishes between lust and love. When a guy does something questionable, she will call him on it, being the forthright person she is. For once, I understand the motivations and logic of a YA heroine in her reactions with guys. All I'll say is that the romance was handled perfectly, precisely the way I hoped, and entirely in an atypical way for young adult novels.This Song Will Save Your Life is a book that I could see saving lives. I sincerely hope that young people who are friendless and desperate, who do not understand why no one likes them, find this book and know that they're not alone. It will get better, maybe not as soon as it did for Elise, but, out there in the world, there are kindred spirits and, if you hold on, you'll find them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8OOO92291UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374351384#wasThisHelpful","R3V8OOO92291UB","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some authors who write in such a way that I'm mentally swept off my feet, in love from the first words. Rainbow Rowell officially joins this short list, now that I've loved both of her books that I've read. Her books speak to me in a way that very few do, to a degree it's a rare to find. Rowell's books make me feel a little bit less alone, a little bit more understand, and point out truths I've often thought or even discussed with friends but not seen in fiction. I can tell you right now that I will be sitting on Attachments (not literally) for as long as I can hold out, because then I know that there won't be ANY MORE Rowell for who knows how long. That's how much I love her writing.Fangirl took me about half a month to read, which, if you know how much I read, is sort of insane, especially for a book I love so much. However, I was determined to read this sooner, but my review schedule is not forgiving of dalliances with books not on the schedule, so I read a chapter here and a chapter there as I was able. This can be a bit of an onus for a book to bear, though, because it gives me time to forget everything, and can make connection emotionally more difficult since you're not as thoroughly immersed. With Fangirl, though, the moment I started reading, even if it had been days since I got to read any, I was immediately back in Cath's world. Within a paragraph or two, the world around me dissipated and I was completely absorbed and dialed in.Because this is such a highly anticipated title, a lot of bloggers have been getting early starts. Thus, though I avoid actual reviews until I've read the book, I've seen some tweets and statuses. Though Fangirl is nigh perfection for me, personally, I know other sorts of readers (as in those that do not have a brain that functions like mine) have had trouble relating to Cath. Certainly, Cath is a very different sort of heroine from the norm. She's introverted to the point of being almost a hermit, preferring to live her life almost entirely in a fictional world. Social anxiety plague her to the degree that she actively avoids making friends and refuses to go to the dining hall because she's afraid of embarrassing her self by doing something wrong. When things get heavy, Cath will just shut down and make really bad choices, like not turning in a final project because she couldn't figure out what to do. Cath is also angry, at her mom, at Wren, and at herself. I can definitely see where her decisions wouldn't register with more socially competent readers.While I am not precisely like Cath, I'm close enough that I get her. I could have been very much like her, minus the fan fiction stardom. See, in some ways, Cath's downfall was her happy high school experience: built-in best friend in her twin sister Wren, popularity that comes with hanging out with Wren, and comfortable boyfriend Abel. On arriving at the University of Nebraska for her freshman year of college, Wren's safe, familiar little world falls apart. Wren, who refused to room with Cath, wants little to nothing to do with her twin sister, desperate to forge her own identity. Abel dumps her for a girl who a) actually likes him in a romantic way and b) got a higher score on the ACT. Her grumpy roommate Reagan, with omnipresent boyfriend Levi, stress her out further. Wren parties for all she's worth to make new friends; Cath avoids people more than ever. With Cath's personality, suddenly losing your safety net in a new experience like this would result in such a response in a lot of cases. For me, I was so unhappy and friendless for most of high school that I started college fired with determination to become an extrovert; it didn't work, but it did get me through the first weeks.What Cath fears more than anything is being bad at something, and here is where I understand this girl so much it hurts. She resists new experiences because she doesn't want to make a fool out of herself. This is behind her trepidation to go eat in the dining hall, where she could go the wrong way in line or sit at the wrong table. This is also why she just doesn't do her final fiction writing project: she fears she doesn't have the talent to write her own world, and prefers the safety of her fan fiction. With romance, too, she goes very slow on the physical side of the relationship for fear of doing the wrong thing. With all of these, the more time that passes, the more difficult that goal becomes to accomplish.The romance is important, and I'll talk about that later, but I love that falling in love isn't the only thing to help bring her out of her shell. Forging a relationship with her roommate, Reagan, is her first true step out of her comfort zone. Sick of watching Cath subsist on protein bars, Reagan forces her to go to the dining hall, and this becomes a routine. There, they bond by people-watching other students, making up ridiculous stories about them. Though Reagan and Cath have little in common, they're able to find ways to connect, and, if Cath can handle the intimidating Reagan, that's a big step. Plus, bonding through stories and jokes like this is exactly what Cath does with her family; the way to get through Cath's heart is through fiction of one kind or another.Family issues are key here, too, though they are not tied up in a tidy little bow. Cath and Wren have a loving father, who's raised them as a single parent since their mom walked out when they were kids. Though their father, Art, takes good care of them, he has manic depression, and needs a lot of looking after himself, as he will not take his meds, since they interfere with his creativity, necessary to his job in advertising. Art always gave them pretty free rein, trusting them to be responsible and to keep him in check. The twins going to college changes the family dynamics, which is painful, but ultimately better for everyone. On top of that, their mother wants to talk to them, but Cath wants no part of the woman who abandoned her.Then there's the romance, and, my goodness is it swoony. I won't tell you who the guy is, because it's better to let things evolve in front of your eyes. However, I will say that Rowell gets the speed of emotions just right in Fangirl, both friendship and relationships. Once something starts, it moves with the speed of a man-eating hare. Relationships of all sorts build so quickly in college. Since you're with everyone from morning until night, there's so much more time for feelings to build, because you're all crammed together in dorms. As a kid, you lack transportation or have a curfew in the summer, and other times half your day is school. As an adult, most of your time is spent at work, so there's less time for socialization. College is friendship in romance in hyperdrive.The romance in Fangirl is a slow burn that comes almost out of nowhere oh so perfectly. Rowell hurt my heart a few times along the way, but she made it all work so well. In a lot of ways, this guy is not my ideal love interest, and I wouldn't want him for myself (several of his qualities are dealbreakers for me personally), but I love him SO HARD for Cath. Who knows if they'll last forever, but he's just what she needs right now.Much as my heart wants to give Fangirl every single star in the heavens, there was one thing I didn't completely love. While I did love the fan fiction angle, I also found one element puzzling. Cath is writing an immensely popular slash fan fiction about Simon Snow, a wizard, and his nemesis, Baz. The Simon Snow series is an obvious stand-in for Harry Potter, which I'm totally cool with. What threw me for a real loop was a casual reference to HP within Fangirl. Why would both exist? This really does not make sense to me. If HP exists in this world, why draw up an imitation to reference? I suspect it has something to do with the amount of fan fiction included and copyright, but why not just leave HP out entirely? In this world, Simon Snow probably wouldn't be that popular if Harry already existed, because it had been done. If Simon came first, then what sort of commentary is that on Rowling? Logic fail aside, I also was not nearly engaged in Cath's fan fiction, so I was generally just waiting for those bits to be over. I do really like the role it played and her life, and the discussions of fan fiction versus original fiction, but the story itself was of somewhat limited interest.I will read absolutely anything Rainbow Rowell writes. Though I've only read two of her books, she's near the top of my favorite authors list. Fangirl has realistic characters and is jam-packed with feels. Also, if you've been searching for books authentically about what it feels like to be in college, you want this book. I recommend Fangirl as highly as I possibly can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMI5DEYAVX3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030951#wasThisHelpful","ROMI5DEYAVX3G","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review will be spoiler-free for the series.Today I shall exhort you to begin reading Gina Damico's Croak series, assuming you haven't already. If you stop by here often, then you probably know that I'm pretty stingy with my 5 star ratings, giving them out only in cases where a book has made me an emotional mess, sucked me in so much I forget the real world, AND been, from my limited perspective, unimpeachable in quality. Most series go out with more of a whimper than a bang, but, in this case, the finale is the strongest book in the series, which is why I am going to fangirl as hard as I can, and encourage all of you with good senses of humor to read this as soon as possible.From Croak onward, Gina Damico has excelled at humor and narrative voice. She writes a mixture of black comedy and straight up silliness that I find positively enchanting. The sort of people who enjoy television shows like Dead Like Me and Pushing Daisies simply MUST read this series. Her style has a really unique flair. She chooses really weird terms or phrasing at times, but somehow they're completely perfect for the moment. A good example is her creativity in coming up with swear words. Ordinarily, I find invented swear words in novels irritating, rather than amusing or clever, but Damico's are perfection and likely to enter my actual vocabulary. Here are some examples: ""everdeathing"" and several I cannot share because of Amazon's filter. While probably not to everyone's tastes, if such things make you giggle, it's a sign that Damico's writing is meant for you.However, there's more than just humor in this series. Though Croak is, so far as my memory can recall, largely a darkly comic fluffy book, with a bit of intensity right at the end, both Scorch and Rogue have far more serious moments. In Scorch, they weren't quite as well balanced and that ended up being my least favorite in the series. By Rogue, Damico's got it down, handling serious moments with proper seriousness, making me want to cry, and then lightening the mood on the next page so that I'm grinning like an idiot. It's a bit of an emotional roller coaster, with much of the comedy being of the sort to help keep them moving in the face of overwhelming odds.The characters all sparkle with wit, vivacity and uniqueness. I love each and every one of them, basically, though Mort is my special favorite and going on my book boyfriend list. Gina Damico writes banter between characters like no one else. All of the grim reapers in their little group make fun of one another constantly, but there is real love underneath that, so completely evident through it all. Even better, Damico doesn't neglect the supporting cast at all. In fact, by book three, there almost isn't a supporting cast because they're all so important to the plot and accomplishing what must be done. There's an ending for all of the characters you've come to love, whether happy or sad, and it's not just about Lex and Driggs, who I do ship something fierce by the way.Since I'm not going to delve into any spoilers for the series, I'll keep this high level and relatively brief (for me anyway). The last thing I need to say is that Damico has guts. She steps outside of traditional YA lines and takes big risks. The stakes are high and she kills a lot of characters, with rather a Whedonesque flair. She gets the utmost respect from me for that. The series also abounds with twists, some of which I called and some which totally blindsided me, all combining to make a wholly engrossing and emotional reading experience.Gina Damico's Croak series is officially ranked among my favorite books ever, and rereads in the future will be essential. As of this writing, Damico has another book deal for a book called Hellhole about a devil, and I'm already wondering who I have to do what to in order to be able to read that ASAP. So, friends, if you have a similar taste in humor, then you want this in your life. Trust me. If you don't trust me, why are you here?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QDZ2PKHESELI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544108841#wasThisHelpful","R1QDZ2PKHESELI","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Code Name Verity is one of those rare books that awed both critics and actual readers. Initially, I almost DNFed Code Name Verity, but I ended up being seriously impressed with both Wein's writing and her gumption. At the same time, though, Code Name Verity never really got me right in the feels, the way it did so many other people. Thus, though I suspect it may not be a popular opinion, I love Rose Under Fire more than Code Name Verity. Once again, Wein's story is incredibly dark and daring, and with a powerful narrative voice.As Rose Under Fire began, I really wasn't sure how I felt about Rose Justice. She's very different from Julie and Maddie, the heroines of Code Name Verity. Rose lacks their seriousness and their cleverness; she's not stupid, but she's a good deal more innocent and has seen less of life's dangers. Thus far, she's been sheltered and pampered, and, like many Americans setting off for the front, she sees the war as something romantic and anticipates performing heroic actions. She desperately hopes to be allowed to fly to France, stifling under the few jobs that American female civilian pilots are allowed to perform in the war effort.Rose's narration fits her perfectly. Her sentences are long and push forward with excitement, as though venturing out in search of something exciting and wonderful. There's a perkiness to her in the beginning, a freshness, as well as a flair for the poetic, coming through in metaphors and unique word choices. As Rose's story darkens, the brightness and naivete seeps out of her narration, leaving her the same Rose, but weighted down by all that she has experienced.Wein looks at World War II through a female lens, which is part of what makes these two books disparate from the mass of WWII fiction out there. The youth of the characters also distinguishes this series from the rest, particularly given the unflinching treatment Wein gives the dark subject matter. Wein does not shy away from the atrocities committed, and in Rose Under Fire she focuses on the concentration camps, particularly Ravensbrck.Last year, I read a nonfiction novel about a train full of women sent to Auschwitz called A Train in Winter. As I read Rose's account of her time in Ravensbrck, I could not help compare this fictional experience with what I learned in A Train in Winter. That book puts forward the theory that the women were better able to survive in Auschwitz because of the way they all supported one another throughout the whole experience, putting the survival of the group over that of individuals, and creating a real family with their fellow prisoners. This same sort of spirit appears in Rose Under Fire, as Rose bonds with her bunk mates, the Rabbits. So many women survive Ravensbrck that might not have because of the way they all worked together and helped buoy one another's spirits. Those that did not survive will be remembered, their names memorized for posterity, and justice searched out in their honor.The most heartrending aspect of Rose Under Fire is the accounting of the Rabbits, the women who make themselves into a protective family for Rose. These ""rabbits"" were medical test subjects. They were shot with bullets, given gangrene, amputated, and had bones removed from their legs so doctors could test cures for soldiers on the front. What these women went through is unbelievably horrific, but they are still such powerfully strong characters, such fighters, so desperate to live or at least get their story out. While the characters are fictional, real women went through these sorts of experiments and these tears that are slipping out of my eyes as I type (yes, this book did manage to make me cry) are for them. Wein's Afterword, in which she explains why she wrote this book, really drives the whole point of the book home.Much as I loved this book, I was not a fan of Rose's poetry. Though I did quite enjoy Edna St. Vincent Millay's excerpts and the reference to Emily Dickinson in one of Rose's poems, I did not get Rose's. Most of them felt like prose chopped up into shorter lines to me. However, I will be the first to admit that I do not really get poetry. My heart and mind like prose. As such, I found myself generally skimming through her poems, since even reading them aloud didn't make them work for me, a technique that often helps me find the rhythm in the poetry and comprehend its beauty.Rarely do books evoke so much of an emotional response from me, so suffice it to say that Rose Under Fire has every bit of the powerful emotional punch of Code Name Verity. I wouldn't really say that one or the other is a better book, but likely one will resonate more with each reader. I highly encourage readers to try these beautiful, emotional, historically resonant novels. Also, please note that while these are fabulous books for teen readers, they have wonderful crossover potential, and are good books to give out to skeptical adults who do not believe teen fiction can be literary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBMKU3Z52O5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423183096#wasThisHelpful","RHBMKU3Z52O5Q","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in grad school, I had my first experience with Gene Luen Yang's work when we read his most famous graphic novel thus far, American Born Chinese. Though disparate in subject matter, Boxers does have something in common with his prior work, the magical realism that Yang brings to bear even on historical or contemporary subjects. In Boxers, Gene Luen Yang manages to pack quite a punch with his spare prose and straight forward drawings.Though I learned about the Boxer Rebellion in college, I'll admit that my memories thereof are limited at best. Based on extensive research (okay, I checked Wikipedia), Yang actually fits in the main historical points without being at all tedious or lecturing. Basically, Yang has perfected the ability to teach without seeming like he's teaching, which is ideal for the intended audience. He conveys the difficult times that led to the rebellion, the drought and the negative impact foreigners were having in China, through the lens of the life of one young boy who grows up to head the rebellion.Little Bao did not start out as a remarkable boy. He lived in the shadow of his older brothers and had his head in the clouds, fancifully imagining himself the character in an opera. With Little Bao's optimism, to some degree never shed throughout his journey, Yang captures the wholehearted believe the Boxers had that they would be victorious. In no way did they imagine that their gods would let them lose or that foreigners could truly take over China.Remember how I mentioned the fantasy angle? Well, in Boxers, the beliefs in local gods, the beliefs being challenged by the conversion to Christianity coming with the influx of foreigners, are manifested physically. Yang literally pits the old gods versus the imperialist forces. Through a mystical process, Little Bao and his friends are able to transform themselves into gods of China, and fight with a strength much bigger than their own bodies and kung fu training give them. It's a bit strange, but I think Yang makes it work, and this technique adds a lot of color and vibrancy to the otherwise fairly spare Boxers, highlighting the colorful culture that is being suppressed.However, Boxers does not preach. Yang, unsurprisingly given the dual nature of this release - Boxers being paired with Saints from the other side of the conflict, presents a balanced view. He makes it quite clear that horrible acts are perpetrated by both sides. If anything, Yang shows how horrible war is. Little Bao, once so innocent and fanciful, does brutal things, as so all of the Boxers. Bao must choose between love and war, and each time he chooses war and China. Boxers is surprisingly dark, intense and bloody, but done in a style that I do not think will overwhelm most readers.Gene Luen Yang's Boxers confronts subject matter not covered enough in western culture with an even, honest hand. He adds in fantasy to the history, making for a more metaphorical and more visually exciting read. The focus on visual over narrative storytelling will make this a great read for both more reluctant readers and those at a higher reading level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMN4SHZHC2J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596433590#wasThisHelpful","RLMN4SHZHC2J9","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saints is a companion graphic novel to Boxers, which takes on the opposite perspective: that of a secondary devil. This terminology may not be familiar to you, so allow me to explain. A secondary devil is a Chinese person who has converted to Christianity, thus aligning themselves with the foreign devils. Saints covers the same time period, but has only one moment with the same scene happening, though it does offer further insight into the events of Boxers just the same. Though they're companions, I do think reading them in this order does work slightly better.In Boxers & Saints, what Yang really digs into are people's motivations. How does an unassuming Chinese boy grow up to kill his countrymen as a Boxer? Why would a young girl convert to Christianity, rather than sticking to the gods of her country? Yang doesn't set out to teach the reader exactly what happened; there aren't any specific dates or anything like that. Instead, he shows the feelings and the ways of thinking that led to the bloody battles and the hatred. Boxers & Saints are nuanced, subtle and thought-provoking.The main character of Saints made a brief appearance in Boxers, as the girl young Little Bao wanted to marry when he grew up because her face resembled an opera mask. Four-girl, so called because she was the fourth child to the family and believed to be a devil and to represent death, has no true name and is not beloved of her family. She tries to get them to accept her, but all they see is how she falls short. As a child might, she begins to act out for attention, by making a devil face. Her mother, sick of the comments from others about Four-girl's devil face, takes her to a Doctor, who happens to be a Christian, and he convinces her to stop with the devil face.When Four-girl learns about the foreign devils, she is thrilled and eager to learn about their religion. Though she doesn't necessarily find the Bible compelling, what she gets from Christianity is the acceptance she's always craved. On top of that, they finally give her a name: Vibiana. Though Vibiana does not entirely understand Christianity or what the stakes are, her new religion is so important to her, because these people, these foreign devils, accepted her where her own family would not. That's why she would put her life on the line rather than renounce her faith.As I mentioned in my Boxers review, the Boxers would put on the guise of Chinese gods, but, in Saints, you can see that there are actual humans fighting the battles. With this technique, Yang makes it clear that the guises of the gods are metaphorical, the boys so convinced of their victory because they have their gods' approval and support.Similarly, Vibiana has visitations from Joan of Arc and even Jesus. The one from Jesus is fascinating, as he has the same eye marked on his hands that the old man who gave Bao the method to take on the guise of the gods had. I'm not entirely sure what point Yang is making with this, perhaps that all religion comes from the same source? The reason I bring this up at all when I'm not sure myself is to show how complex Boxers & Saints are and how well they will fuel discussions. I could see them being an excellent classroom resource, a fun, easy read that looks at the Boxer Rebellion, war and religion in an entirely different way than a textbook.I did personally like Saints slightly less than Boxers. This may be because there's a good deal more text in this one, and it does lean a bit towards YOU ARE LEARNING NOW, as Vibiana is instructed in the ways of Christianity.Boxers & Saints are best read together back to back, so the reader can fully flesh out the commonalities between the two and look at the many nuances. They're fairly light on text and heavy on character motivations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68TPMR4ZM81B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596436891#wasThisHelpful","R68TPMR4ZM81B","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm one of the few people who never got around to reading Kendare Blake's Anna Dressed in Blood, though I do have a copy and will read it...someday. Initially, it wasn't really on my radar, because horror isn't something I seek out, but the reviews convinced me. Antigoddess, however, was a topic that called my name and I was hopeless to resist that call, much like Odysseus and the sirens. Thankfully, Kendare Blake lived up to all the hype, and Antigoddess was a non-stop horrorshow and thrill ride.Antigoddess is one of those books where the reader basically has no idea what is happening at any point. To predict the outcome, you'd basically need to be a prophetess like Cassandra. Sometimes, I hate this in books, especially in mysteries, but with Antigoddess it works. That feeling of being out of your element and out of control really plays into the mythology, the fact that these gods, even diminished are really beyond our ken. Though I don't mind predictable formulas (like romances and their inevitable HEAs), Antigodess was a refreshing change, because I had zero clue how it would end at any point, and have even less idea what will go down in book two.I am all about Greek mythology, and, while Blake's interpretation might not exactly be canon, it's mindblowingly cool and creepy. So the Greek gods have basically continued existing and doing their things, blending in with humans or running around in non-populated places, whatever they want. But then, dun dun dun, they began to die. Obviously, they're not super thrilled about this because 1) they're supposed to be immortal and 2) they're dying in really nasty ways. Like Athena getting slowly smothered to death by owl feathers growing inside of her body. Anyway, Athena and Hermes are trying to figure out a way to stop dying, and so are some other gods (most importantly Hera and Poseidon) and they're all also at war. There are also so humans involved and it's all just nuts in the most awesome sort of way.What really makes me squee about Blake's world building is how empowering it is for women. Yes, there were always female gods, and some of them are quite powerful, but, in Greek mythology, the dude's are still really running the show. In Antigoddess, though several male gods are present, it's the women who are running the show, specifically Athena and Hera. Hermes defers to Athena, for example, and Poseidon to Hera. In the original mythology, Hera is powerful, but mostly just gets to be cuckolded over and over, without any ability to prevent Zeus from sleeping around and then punishing the girl, who, often, Zeus even raped. Hera still may not come out of this smelling like roses, but at least she's imbued with agency. Within the human characters too, Cassandra and Andie are exceptionally strong. Blake writes female characters who kick serious butt and have brains to back that up.Though I didn't emotionally bond with the characters, they're all fascinating and compelling, so that even the comparatively slow beginning didn't drag for me in the slightest. Also, good news for those who are sick of romance dominating plot, that is not the case here. There are some ships that you can board, but they take up relatively little page time. Also, for the record, I am definitely on a couple of those ships, and got to watch the one I wasn't on sink. Mwahahaha. *high fives Kendare*The other thing I really want to note is how well Kendare writes. I'm not a visual reader, but Blake has a way of making things very visceral, and putting definite images in my head. Very few writers can do this for me, and I'm always so impressed when it happens. Her descriptions of the feathers seeding Athena's body especially will be haunting me for a while.Kendare Blake's Antigoddess is a dark, creative roller coaster ride of a read. For readers who enjoy action-packed books or unique mythological retellings, particularly with a feminist bent, Antigoddess is a must.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHU3AN8AHSX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765334437#wasThisHelpful","R1VHU3AN8AHSX3","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After finally reading Ness' The Knife of Never Letting Go a month or so ago, I was very curious to try his forthcoming novel. What I'm sure of more than ever now is that Ness is a massive talent. I am also convinced that his books will not work for everyone, because they are daring and strange and twisty and complex. More Than This is a cinematic, philosophical confusing novel, but one I ultimately found fascinating.I find myself rather at a loss on how to review this book, given that practically anything would be a spoiler, since this is a book that opens up, revealing new layers. For the first hundred or so pages, all you know is what's revealed in the blurb, and talking about anything past that in any detailed way would be to reveal spoilers best left in the dark. Thus, this will probably be short and vague, but bear with me.The storytelling of More Than This has a rather unique feel to it. Though told in what might seem like a fairly ordinary third person limited narrative, there's something cinematic about More Than This. The novel unfolds like a movie before the reader's eyes, a twisty movie like Memento or Inception that people need to watch several times over to have any sort of solid understanding of what's happening. Even more fascinating is that Seth seems to have a postmodern awareness of his role in the narrative, often calling situations before they even happened, as though he is the creator of his own story.Seth dies in the prologue, drowns in icy waters. But then he awakens in his childhood home in England, the one his family moved away from after his brother was kidnapped by an escaped prisoner from the neighboring prison. He's thirsty, hungry, and weak. And dead? Seemingly alone, he gathers what food is unexpired and searches out clothing that fits to replace the bandages that covered his body. Whenever he rests, Seth dreams of his life, of his parents who never forgave him for what happened to his brother, of his friends who abandoned him, and his boyfriend who he maybe loved.Of course, there's so much more to More Than This, rather appropriate no? Only I can't tell you about it. I could compare it to a particular film, but that would be a spoiler like whoa. Keeping things incredibly simple, I had some questions about the worldbuilding, serious ones, but I loved the message of the story, one of looking at the beauty in life and finding your more. I'm also not convinced it really needed to be quite so long.For such a massive book, this review feels rather ineffectual book, but the book itself serves as a sort of metaphor for life and how we take it for granted. It's a journey to be undertaken by the reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SO8TAWMP6GF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763662585#wasThisHelpful","R3SO8TAWMP6GF4","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely adored Robin Wasserman's The Book of Blood and Shadow, which blended horror, paranormal, historical and contemporary fiction into something dark and beautiful. As such, I had very high expectations for The Waking Dark, which were partly met but not wholly. The key thing to know about The Waking Dark is that it is a horror novel, pure and simple, though calling the novel simple is rather misleading.The Book of Blood and Shadow began with blood and murders. The Waking Dark tops that, opening with twelve deaths in five outpourings of seemingly random violence, each witnessed by one teen who survived. For the most part, The Waking Dark follows these five teens: Daniel, Jule, Ellie, West, and Cass. Wasserman uses a third person narrative style that does occasionally drift to other characters temporarily, but 95% of the book is about these five.The Waking Dark follows along a basic horror story arc. The murders occur, but then life settles a bit and normalcy seems to return, only not quite. Something dark lurks beneath the surface of the people of Oleander, Kansas. It's almost as if the id is taking over, people's basest and most secret desires taking control; instant gratification mattering more than social mores. Wasserman's tale is unrelentingly dark and creepy.The large cast of characters is both a boon and a drawback. None of them quite get enough characterization for me to be wholly invested in them, a fact exacerbated by not ever getting to see them before the Killing Day, as the day of the opening comes to be known. However, the large cast is an intriguing one. Daniel's the son of a drunk, who calls himself the Preacher, and judged by the town for that. Jule, short for Juliet, is part of the infamous Prevette family, meth heads, meth makers, and meth dealers, and she's trying to figure out if she can be free of that taint. Ellie is driven by her faith in Christianity. West is a popular football player, trying to hide that he's in love with a boy. Cass is popular and smart, babysitting kids (and she hates kids) in order to save up enough money to escape Kansas for college. There aren't many YA books written about kids like these, except maybe those like Cass, so reading about them was refreshing.The best aspect of The Waking Dark is Robin Wasserman's writing which is positively beautiful. That woman can turn a phrase. This raises The Waking Dark above the average horror offerings. She does use the horror to make commentaries on human nature, war, and faith. She manages to make the novel quite meaningful, though the plot is something straight out of a horror film, sort of like The Bible Belt Goes Bananas.As may be obvious, what I didn't care for was the plot. The whole thing just seems way too absurd to me. I feel like this could have been a great idea, but the explanation for how this madness came to the town strikes me as utterly ridiculous. Not buying into that, it's really just violence for violence's sake, which is all very well, but horror really isn't my genre of choice.Horror fans, get thee to a bookstore, because Robin Wasserman's The Waking Dark is a creepy thrill ride full of death and blood from the first page to the very last ones. Even if you're not much for horror, The Waking Dark may be worth it for Wasserman's beautiful prose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22YNJNIXDT5JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375868771#wasThisHelpful","R22YNJNIXDT5JM","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After my last middle grade was such a terrible dud, I was a bit afraid to embark into these pirate-laden waters. What if I felt like they'd shivered the timbers of these books unfairly, robbing them of a better life for inferior content? Or stole away my precious time, better spent with other books? Thankfully, Caroline Carlson's pirates aren't such vicious fiends. They're quite honorable, as pirates go anyway, and entirely lovable. Magic Marks the Spot is pretty close to perfect for what I want from a light-hearted middle grade: humorous, populated by lively characters, and promoting the idea that both boys and girls are capable of the same sorts of things.Before I even got to page one, Magic Marks the Spot had already made me smile and snort. See, before the page numbers even start counting, there are several pages of letters, which set the tone for the rest of the novel. In fact, letters, documents, and snippets of books are woven brilliantly throughout the novel, a technique often used, but rarely done to quite so enjoyable effect.Hilary Westfield receives a letter congratulating her on her acceptance to the Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates' Piracy Apprenticeship Program and telling her that the program will change her from ""a wide-eyed and innocent young man."" Hilary writes back, informing them of her excitement and correcting them on a factual error: namely, she's a girl. The VNHLP writes back aghast and offended, forwarding her application on to Miss Pimm's Finishing School for Delicate Ladies, much to Hilary's disgust. In her final response to the VNHLP, she closes with this:""I assure you that I will walk the plank a thousand times, into cold and shark-infested waters, before I will attend Miss Pimm's.  I remain,  Hilary Westfield  Really Quite Furious with You""From that moment on, I was in love with this book and its characters. Hilary is a fantastically sassy girl who refuses to let anyone, be they parent, headmistress or pirate, tell her what her gender means she can and cannot do. Magic Marks the Spot is so girl-positive and anti-stereotypes. Pirates can be friendly, girls can be pirates, boys can sew without it doing them a lick of harm, governesses can be sassy, and old ladies can be badasses. These are excellent lessons for the intended age group, and are conveyed in a totally non-preachy way.Though almost everyone she meets tells Hilary she cannot be a pirate because of her gender and social standing, she does not give up. She has a dream and will not let anyone stop her from getting there. Plus, she has a plucky gargoyle sidekick to help cheer her up when times get rough, like when she's forced to attend Mrs. Pimm's, which teaches courses like etiquette and fainting. Gargoyle is so completely precious, with his desire for ear scratches and dream of one day having a pirate hat.Hilary's governess, introduced as a rather drab, formidable figure, turns out to be wholly delightful as well. As soon as she ceases being Hilary's governess, she's able to open up to Hilary and truly be a friend. Eloise Greyson is a wonderful human being, and I totally support the ship of her with the pirate captain Jasper, Terror of the Southlands. He's basically the most lovable pirate after Captain Shakespeare from Stardust. Oh, and Charlie, his first made is adorably awkward, and I am waiting for some super cute middle grade romance to happen later.The one aspect that had me side-eyeing the book was how unaffected Hilary is to learn that her father is the bad guy. Yes, he's not been the most supportive parent ever, but she's sad for like five minutes and then is completely unaffected for the rest of the book. Admiral Westfield was not so terrible that a daughter wouldn't struggle to accept his villainy or be tempted to join up with him. Hilary's a strong girl, so I don't doubt that she would make the same choices, but I would have liked to see her feel more in response to what is a completely groundbreaking change for a child.Magic Marks the Spot kept me grinning and laughing the whole way through. There's situational humor, sarcasm everywhere, and silly puns. Basically, it's perfection for me and other people who have the sense of humor of a ten year old, like, say, actual ten year olds. I see this being a huge hit with the intended audience, but it's a delight for an older reader as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPU9SZNL723W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062194348#wasThisHelpful","RCPU9SZNL723W","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first, I totally thought this was going to be one of those times where I really like a book that most of my friends did not. The early reviews were discouraging, but it was a 4 star book for the first 75 pages or so. From there, things slid downhill. My hopes were high for Starry Nights, but, sadly, a highly original, creative, beautiful concept turns into a cheesy pile of instalove. Be warned that this review does contain some spoilers.The opening of this novel is so strong. Whitney's a talented writer, and the concept is gorgeous. At the outset, we have Julien, an artist of limited talent, whose mother runs a Parisian art gallery. He does tours and generally loves art of all forms, music, paintings, sculpture, dance, etc. At night, Julien wanders the halls and sees the art come alive. The subjects pop out of their frames, Degas' dancers performing ballets that only he can see.The imagery of this, the idea that the paintings have lives of their own within the museum after dark, is stunning. While, yes, there are all sorts of reasons this is unlikely, it's beautiful magical realism, and done very well. At least, until it ceases being magical realism and turns into a paranormal/mythological plot.While I wasn't a fan of this plot twist where the story went for the mythological rather than the subtle beauty of magical realism, which is one of my favorite things right now, I still admire the originality of the world building that Whitney devises. She's built a novel around the Muses, which I've not personally seen done before. On top of that, she brings in a look at the evolution of art, the way it went from being something done solely by educated men to something that can be created and appreciated by anyone. These are powerful themes, and I still think she handles her concept well. Though not quite what I wanted, her Muse mythology is fascinating and meaningful.Where Starry Nights flops is the romance. It's a classic case of instalove, complete with the relatively flat characters so typical of this romantic ""arc"". Even before that, though, I have issues with the romance. She's a girl in a painting and he's a person, so their options are pretty limited, and, though I do sometimes go for weird ships, they didn't have enough of a connection for me to root for them in the face of odds where she's not even a real person. Sure, she likes to eat and he brings her food. They both like art. Wow, do they both like Breakfast at Tiffany's too? There wasn't any real verve or banter in their conversations which are largely boring, and I personally thought he and Emilie, who's in a total of three scenes, had a lot more chemistry.Julien and Clio, the girl in the painting, fall in love pretty much immediately. In a rather classic Romeo & Juliet scenario, Julien is just out of a bad breakup. Clio, on the other hand, has been in a painting for over a hundred years in a private home, meaning that she hasn't seen ANYONE BUT HIM. He is literally the only boy she's seen in hundreds of years. Instalove is bad enough when there are options, but, when it's ""I love you because you're the only person I've literally ever been capable of loving,"" to me that's not romance but desperation. Part of love is choosing that person over other people, not being cornered into it by circumstance.Then, there's the ending, which is completely cheesy and convenient. The book could have at least ended in the expected heartbreaking place, but, oh no, this is paranormal romance world and there just HAS to be an HEA, even if it makes no sense. Let's nurture the concept that manicpixiedreamgirls will literally step out of our pop culture to love us. Yeah, that's healthy. Well, good luck to you, Clio and Julien. Two people with no marketable skills who got together when one was on the rebound and one had never spoken to another boy. I'm sure this will end well.All told, I do think there is a good framework to Starry Nights, but the instalove killed it. I'm left feeling not angry, but disappointed. This could have been a thoughtful, slow-paced, magical novel, but instead went the way of paranormal romance tropes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DO1T8EFLXOBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619631334#wasThisHelpful","R2DO1T8EFLXOBK","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a huge fan of the original Jessica Darling series, or, at least, as huge of a fan as one can be while intentionally deciding not to finish said series, I was super curious about Megan McCafferty's prequel. I mean, more Jessica Darling is pretty much always acceptable, except for the fact that I had my reasons in stopping after two books, but that's an issue from another time. Anyway, now we can see Jessica tackle junior high, and McCafferty brings Jessica's trademark wit, observational skills and honesty to middle school.Middle school Jessica does have a lot in common with high school Jessica, which is probably not all that surprising given that they are the same person separated by some timey-wimey stuff known as life. McCafferty does a good job making the narration similar but a bit different than that of the original series. This Jessica does come across a good deal younger. She's not got as impressive of a vocabulary, though she's starting to build it because she's discovered that her English teacher will really raise her essay grades for each thesaurus phrase substituted for a normal term. Plus, middle school Jessica is a lot more naive and less confident than high school Jessica.By high school, Jessica Darling has pretty much comes to terms with her role in the social hierarchy and that she will never be the most popular girl in school. In middle school, Jessica's still trying to be what she's not. The series title, Jessica Darling's It List, is actually a bit misleading. In fact, this is Bethany's It List. Jessica's much older sister Bethany, in a rare instance of sisterly feeling, has decided to help Jessica avoid the curse of dorkdom by passing down the patented method for achieving popularity. Unsurprisingly, the It List does not work so well for Jessica.See, Jessica, intelligent though she is, does not excel at pretending to be something she is not. Her half-hearted attempts end up fooling no one. Jessica's a bit of a dork and a teacher's pet, and there's no changing that. If she doesn't care about boys, she won't pretend to and she has trouble caring about her friends' woes over such things either. In fact, her biggest seventh grade fails occur when she stops being Jessica, like when she signs up for CHEER TEAM!!!, which she does not have the spirit for.Megan McCafferty totally captures all the awkwardness of middle school. The romantic awkwardness, like how the boys chant at Bridget on the bus, like hooting like a pack of monkeys is really endearing. Or how Aleck (aka young Marcus Flutie) flirts with a ""wear her down"" annoyance tactic. The friendship awkwardness, which is pretty much encapsulated by Bridget becoming gorgeous just in time for seventh grade, leaving Jessica to be a normal. The middle school years especially are a time of transition where friendships come and go, and many BFFs are actually trying to climb on top of one another up the social ladder. Then there's the budding friendship between Hope and Jessica, who any readers of the original series know will be besties eventually, bonded by their judgment of everyone else's stupidity and ridiculous social rituals.The (Totally Not) Guaranteed Guide to Popularity, Prettiness & Perfection is the middle school version of Mean Girls, I swear. I can even cast them for you. Bridget would be the obvious choice for Regina George since she's the prettiest and most popular seventh grader, but she's actually more of a Karen Smith, because she doesn't really know what's going on a lot of the time and is very easily led. Manda is the Regina. She even makes up slang (mondo) and decides when it's over. Sara, though she wants to be a queen bee, is Gretchen Wieners, a born follower, who does everything Manda says and always will, even though she resents Regina's treatment of her. Jessica's the Cady and Hope is Janis/Damian, only they could never care enough to make Jessica into the evil popular girl, and Jessica would never want Burke Roy, the Aaron Samuels figure. Also, I'm sure you all didn't need to know all of that, but, whatever, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION.Though it's been too long for me to say with any assurance how well the occurrences here mesh with those of Sloppy Firsts, The (Totally Not) Guaranteed Guide to Popularity, Prettiness & Perfection does stand very nicely on its own. McCafferty's depiction of middle school cliques, awkwardness and romance shines with her trademark humor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YCF2R1TCVT7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316244996#wasThisHelpful","R2YCF2R1TCVT7B","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today, we open with a rant. Now, this isn't really about this book in particular or anything the author did. This rant is about publishers and how they like to sneak series into our lives. Listen, I don't mind series, though I am getting a bit tired of everything being part of a series, but what I cannot abide by is thinking a book is a standalone and it turning out to be the first book in a series. Nothing in the blurb or on Goodreads indicates that this is part of a series, but, as the last chapter makes clear, it is. HARRUMPH to this I say. I'm left feeling annoyed with the book, as though it did something to me when this is a failure of the publisher in marketing it properly as what it is: the opening to a series. Despite this, The Fantastic Family Whipple actually was a cute middle grade novel, but do be warned that it is yet another series.Young readers are going to love The Fantastic Family Whipple, I have little doubt. World records are so compelling to children for reasons I don't quite fathom now that I'm an adult. Even so, I remember marveling over the Guinness Book of World Records just like everyone else did back in elementary school. In library's I've worked out, the Guinness Book has always been one of the most popular check outs. Kids love this stuff, and they will love this book.Even better for young readers, the records being set in The Fantastic Family Whipple are all ridiculous, which will no doubt have the young readers chortling. For example, one of the attempted records involves a hamster-manned rocket flight and another involves hopping up and down on one leg. Even better, the Whipples participate in an Unsafe Sports competition, which I am sure will captivate young imaginations.The cover really captures the light-hearted humor, silliness, and bombastic nature of The Fantastic Family Whipple. In addition to the hijinks, there's also a mystery for our utterly un-illustrious young hero to solve. Arthur Whipple is the only unremarkable member of the Whipple family, but it's his turn to step up and be important. Also, thanks to their new neighbors, the Goldwins, Arthur's family may be joining him in his losing streak.I did like The Fantastic Family Whipple, but this is one of those middle grade novels that I think loses a lot of its charm for an adult audience. The jokes and the situations are perfect humor for children, but, while entertaining, didn't drive me to the heights of glee that I think they would a child. Also, I would have liked to see a bit more progress made on the mystery plot line in this book. The ending felt arbitrary and sudden.If you know younger readers who love humor and can't stop reading the Guinness Book of World Records, they will love The Fantastic Family Whipple. As an adult, the humor wasn't quite my speed, so I probably will not be returning for the sequel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H749NVUGXA5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159514689X#wasThisHelpful","R1H749NVUGXA5S","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gah, the adorableness of this book. Middle grades can be so good, because they give that focus on family so often wanting from YA, and I just love the family of colorful characters brought together here. Counting by 7s is an enchanting middle grade novel with a lot of heart.One of my favorite stories to see in fiction, aside from a slow burn hate to love relationship is that of a family forming out of people who aren't necessarily related. Sure, a lot of people love their birth families, but just because you're not related to someone it doesn't preclude them being your family. The connections between people, what makes a familial bond, has very little to do with blood, and more to do with supporting and motivating one another. This message is one that I find so important.Willow Chance is, as the blurb says, a genius. She's smart to the degree that she has difficulty interacting with other people, because she cannot fathom why they do not find the intricacies of gardening or language or multiples of seven fascinating. Middle school proves a torture, because no one wants to hang out with the weird girl who's dressed like a janitor (to blend in with nature, you see). To make matters worse, she aces a test and is accused of cheating. Because of that, she's sent to counseling with the worst counselor ever: Dell Duke.What Dell discovers is that Willow is not a cheater or a troublemaker, because he gives her SAT tests and she aces them all. He also watches her learn Vietnamese over the course of a couple of weeks. The girl's brilliant. Dell becomes a bit obsessed, in a professional way not a creepy way, with Willow and feels the odd urge to try to help. Then both of her parents (not her biological ones either) die, leaving her at the mercy of the foster system again.Spontaneously, another family, the son of which is also forced to go to counseling with Dell, adopts Willow and they form this strange little family. The book is just so touching. They all are made better by their relationship, even though there are so many hardships. There's a lot of diversity and self-improvement and emotion. Over the course of the book, I came to care for all of them, even Dell, which I did not expect.There are a lot of middle grade books about genius children or at least much smarter than average children. To be frank, these are my favorite ones, because I like children that act more maturely. Though Willow's well-read and clever, her character definitely does read convincingly like a twelve-year-old. The narrative voice is fabulous and convincing. Willow just jumps right off the page and into your head.However, much as I love the narrative voice and the emotions, the writing did leave me wanting. The problem is that, while I love the way Willow's perspective is done, we don't just get her perspective. A drifting third person limited interrupts. That could be fine, except for the fact that the third person perspective reads EXACTLY LIKE WILLOW'S. Also, Willow's perspective in the first chapter has a sort of talking to the audience flair, so the third person sections really don't fit with that sort of style.A touchingly emotional middle grade, Counting by 7s is one that I recommend rather highly.

"Robyn Schneider's novel underwent a title change from Severed Heads, Broken Hearts to The Beginning of Everything. Both titles I think are fitting for the story within, though I must say I feel a certain affection for the original, which conveys both the humor and the darkness of Schneider's witty, brilliant debut.Ezra Faulkner theorizes that no one's life really begins until they go through a personal tragedy. This may seem an odd sort of belief, but it makes sense. Tragedy has a way of putting things in perspective. The loss of a family member, of mobility, or of social standing has a way of forcing a person to reevaluate life and decide what is really important. Realizing how tenuous and random life can be, it's crucial to spend what life you have being who you really are and with the people who really get you.Ezra and Toby were best friends until they were fourteen. That friendship came to a halt after a tourist stood up in the row in front of them on a roller coaster at Disney, the tourist's severed head landing in Toby's arms for the rest of the ride. For the rest of high school, Toby will be that kid with the severed head. Meanwhile, Ezra grew up well, attractive and athletic, and became friends with the popular kids. He partied, dated hot girls, and planned to get a college scholarship for tennis. Then, at a party one night, a driver hit his car, leaving him crippled.As school starts up for his senior year, the former Homecoming King doesn't feel like he belongs anywhere. He walks with a cane, his girlfriend has hooked up with his former best friend, and his plans for the future are shot. In his life's nadir, he finds a sort of freedom, though. He can now admit to being intelligent and nerdy, rediscover his friendship with Toby, and cultivate a spot with some of the school's nerds. Tragedy serves as a bridge to help him realize how unsatisfying his life up to then truly was.Schneider's writing is fantastic. First of all, she completely captures an authentic male voice. Ezra never read like a girl to me, but neither was his narrative over the top in an effort to sell his maleness. Secondly, Schneider peppers the narrative with literary references, which, admittedly, might be alienating to some teen readers, but that I loved. Finally, there are the puns. If you do not appreciate finely tuned wordplay, you might find The Beginning of Everything pun-ishing. However, if you deem puns fine humor, you may well laugh your head off (don't worry; Toby will catch it for you).The romance in The Beginning of Everything falls a bit into manicpixiedreamgirl territory, but it works. Ezra is taken with Cassidy immediately, with her mystery, her intelligence, and her vibrancy. She appreciates his puns and can give them back. They have great chemistry, but she always keeps her walls way way up. Why this worked for me is that Ezra falls in love with her, but in a totally high school first love sort of way, and not in a true love forever sort of way. Also, there's a realization of how little she actually was the perfect girl of his dreams.The only aspect of the book that left me wanting was the ending. The climax that leads to the spilling of Cassidy's secrets was unexpected, despite the foreshadowing that lead up to it. That scene did not rub me the right way, and just felt a bit out of place in the novel. Plus, Cassidy's sudden opening up didn't seem fitting with what went down either. Without explaining what happened, it's hard to put this clearly, but I found what happened a bit puzzling and melodramatic.Robyn Schneider's novel is highly intelligent and full of black humor. Fans of John Green, particularly Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns, will most definitely want to read The Beginning of Everything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRAMW0CDUJIMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062217135#wasThisHelpful","RRAMW0CDUJIMM","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Returned is not going to work for every reader, though that's not surprising since no book does. I suppose what I mean to say is that it will be a tough read for many. The pace of The Returned is slow most of the way through, though there is some serious speed right at the end. What Mott's really digging into is the concept, so it's a very philosophical read, a brainstorming of what such a strange occurrence could result in. If you need books packed with action and excitement, The Returned will not do that for you. Sure, it's people coming back from the dead, but it's not zombies and there's no mayhem or brain-chomping.In The Returned, Mott puts forth this concept: people who died begin coming back to life. They don't all reappear, nor do they necessarily seem to appear in the location where they died. None of them remember anything between their death and returning to life, and they are all the precise age that they were at the time of their demise. All memories seem to be intact. Scientists can find no rhyme or reason in why anyone is returning and why some do or do not return.Using a family in the small town of Arcadia as an example, Mott depicts the spiral of society into chaos and hatred as this phenomenon occurs. As one might expect, there's a lot of discussion of what it means to be human and what the Returned really are. These people died but now here they are. Is it the same person or a different one? Should they have rights? The ethical concerns are fascinating.Mott also looks at the possible logistical issues with regards to the Returned. Since they pop up in seemingly random places, like Harold and Lucille's son Jacob who appeared in China, there's the difficulty of sorting people back to where they belong. More of an issue, though, is what to do with all of these Returned if the formerly dead begin to outnumber the true living. The government doesn't know how to handle the situation, and the public is torn between hatred and fear of them and joy and hope at having lost loved ones back.What this does to interpersonal relationships is my favorite aspect, of course. A situation like this begs so many questions: if a person remarried after the spouse's death and the spouse Returns, what happens? What if two teenagers were deeply in love until one of them died, and, now the dead one Returns still 16 with former love so much older? If they had sex would that be statutory rape or a whole new situation? In pretty much every way, no one has any clue how to deal with the Returned. It's scary and confusing and hopeful and worrisome.If you're wondering whether The Returned is right for you, I point you to those hypothetical questions. Do you find the consideration thereof a fascinating enterprise or do you think that such speculation on something so utterly unlikely and illogical is pointless? If the former, read away. If the latter, probably not, I'm sad to say. The Returned lives in the hypothetical, and the beautifully simple writing likely will not be enough to save the novel for you if you simply do not care for that.However, despite the fact that I loved the intellectual exercise, the writing, and that the ending almost made this hard-hearted reader cry in a public place, I did have a couple of issues with the book. First off, I think it's a bit ridiculous that, at least towards the start, there was never any move to put The Returned to work, except for the one famous artist. I mean, come on, if there are more people then there will need to be more stuff, so there need to be more workers. Obviously. Also, I'm not a really a fan of how the book wrapped up, which, sadly, I cannot explain without spoilers. I just felt like it was sort of a weak and anticlimactic way to do it. I get why, as that ending is more poetic, but I thought it a bit too simple.Though I have nothing against romance novels, I am really excited to see Harlequin broadening their horizons with titles like The Returned, especially since they're doing so with such great books like this one. Patient readers who adore high concept reads that will really make them think need this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227MKZIOXL2RH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778315339#wasThisHelpful","R227MKZIOXL2RH","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My love for Throne of Glass is well known, but, after reading some reviews, I started wondering if the book was quite as good as I remembered. There were some fair criticisms, things I'd not even considered. In Crown of Midnight, Maas really hits those elements that were missing from the first, and ups the stakes to an incredible degree. This sequel is a must read for those who loved Throne of Glass and perhaps even for those who were on the fence.One of the criticisms I'd seen was of Celaena being proclaimed a heartless assassin, but that not really ever being shown. Instead, she's going to balls and eating candy. Of course, I love that the assassin has a softer side, but I did agree retroactively that it would have been good to see more of her dark side. In Crown of Midnight, you get to see Celaena living up to her reputation, and, when this girl is on a killing spree, it's a thing of bload-soaked beauty. She may like frilly dresses, but she's also totally cool with being covered in blood. Being able to see all of the facets of Celaena really adds depths to her character.The other main criticism of the first book that I agreed with was that the King, clearly the villain, didn't have much of a role. He just sort of cackled evilly every so often. In Crown of Midnight, we get to see more of him and learn about his plans, still only the very slightest understanding, but it's enough to make him one intensely creeptastic villain.The plotting of the story becomes much more complex in Crown of Midnight. Actually, I was really surprised by the direction that the story has gone, very different from the more basic fantasy roots of the first. There are a number of twists, none of which I really saw coming, though I felt really dumb that I missed the biggie, since there were a lot of hints. The plot is full of twists and turns, and full of betrayals. I do have some quibbles with the world building, but they're minor enough I can't really draw a line to any one thing.Of course, there's also the romance. The age of Dorian is over and now it's all about Chaol (as it should be). All I can really say about what happens here is that I approve wholeheartedly. This is why I love guys like Chaol, all cool and collected on the outside, but so much passion on the inside. *sighs happily*Maas impressed me with her willingness to be cruel and heartless to the characters. To be honest, I really didn't get the impression from Throne of Glass that she would be willing to kill off characters, but I'm thrilled to be wrong. Oh, she's brutal. Mwahahaha. And, no, I won't tell you who dies, so have fun sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time. As you may know, I find killing off a beloved main character a mark of good fantasy.Sarah J. Maas really proves her talent in Crown of Midnight, deftly avoiding any sort of second book syndrome. Instead, she greatly amps up the world building, plot and intensity. In my opinion, this series is a must read for fantasy fans. The third book is poised to be epic and heartbreaking, and I am so excited.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF6JC5G0J1Z4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619630621#wasThisHelpful","RF6JC5G0J1Z4R","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deciding to read Love in the Time of Global Warming might have seemed a questionable choice, because I absolutely loathed with every fiber of my being the first and only Francesca Lia Block book that I read: Weetzie Bat. However, if I didn't risk possibly hating this one and feeling stupid for wasting my time or being deemed a ""hate reader,"" I wouldn't have gotten to experience this amazing book. Even going into a book fearing the worst, there's a chance that you will be unexpectedly swept off your feet, and I've seen this happen to pretty much every blogger I know. So, surprisingly enough to me and to Bekka of Pretty Deadly Reviews who convinced me to read Love in the Time of Global Warming, I kind of loved this book.My issue with Weetzie Bat was that the book read like I'd been unwilling forced into some sort of drug trip, which is not my thing in the slightest. The book is crazy and the writing annoyed me to no end. Love in the Time of Global Warming is definitely incredibly odd and a little bit crazy, but, for some reason, one I can't really put my finger on except to say that it just sort of comes together perfectly, this one worked for me.The writing, while still more poetic and off the wall then I generally like, is this lyrical prose that fits perfectly with the story. Block makes excellent use of imagery and achieves a style that hearkens back to Homer's Odyssey while still being totally her own, which I really admire, because it's so tough to achieve.What I really love about Love in the Time of Global Warming is that it's this genre mash up of awesomeness. Block blends together mythology, science fiction, post-apocalyptic, and magical realism into a book that should come out an incomprehensible mess, and may for some readers, but combined to be this brilliant, strange utterly unique little book for me.There's this real blend of science fiction/post-apocalyptic with the retelling elements. While some aspects are explained with science, like the giants, others are where the magical realism comes into play, like the lotuses. Personally, I love magical realism and the way that it brought everything together and really made this retelling possible in a world no longer populated by gods and goddesses in our cultural imagination.In no way is Love in the Time of Global Warming a strict retelling, but Block manages to bring in quite a few of the major plot elements, and they're clearly recognizable. Even better, Block doesn't have the tendency to go on and on in endless descriptions like Homer does. Also, Block takes a story that's very patriarchal, with the only women vile seductresses or waiting at home for their men, and makes it an LGBT love story with a heroine, slyly named Penelope in a nod to the one awesome woman in Homer's work, instead of a hero. All of the main characters have LGBT leanings and they're all messed up, but ultimately likable people with more to them than what initially meets the eye. In some ways, the apocalypse is what frees them to be who they are, because the end of the world really puts life into perspective.My only reservations are these: one personal and one more analytical. On a personal note, I didn't feel any real emotional connection, this not being so much a character-driven story. In fact, I'm amazed I liked it so much given that I'm such a character-based reader, however the writing and story really resonated and struck the perfect tone. Analytically, there was a little plot line about Pen's parents that I didn't really think was entirely necessary. I didn't remember this from The Odyssey, but apparently another account (as in not written by Homer), explains this little addition. While I can see why she did that, it felt rather out of place since not much really happened with regards to this small twist.If you appreciate genre-bending novels, particularly those with magical realism, I urge you to give Love in the Time of Global Warming a try. It's a strange, unique book and won't be for everyone, but Francesca Lia Block has woven together something magical here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B27JJP4EAUVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805096272#wasThisHelpful","R1B27JJP4EAUVK","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First up, the disclaimer: yes, I know Claire Legrand and she's awesome, but that did not influence my opinion of the book in any way. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Though I've had Claire's debut novel, The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls for over a year now, I've not managed to work it into my schedule, so I'm glad I've finally gotten to try her writing. Also, I'm pleased to say that I like her writing. Hurrah! Claire Legrand has written a beautiful, occasionally creepy story about a grumpy young girl who learns how to open up her heart and enjoy life again.My second favorite aspect of The Year of Shadows is definitely the heroine. Olivia Stellatella is a delight, but which I mean she is a seriously grouchy, cynical kid. She may be young, but her life has been hard and it's getting more difficult by the time. First, her mom abandoned her, then her dad got completely caught up in trying to save the orchestra for which he conducts, and now her family (Olivia, The Maestro (Dad, though she never calls him that because he made mom leave), and Nonnie (grandma)) has moved into the concert hall, living in two little rooms and making do with the makeshift kitchen. Olivia hates that she's had to move here, worries that they won't have enough food to eat, and shops at the thrift shop. Even worse, she knows that, if the orchestra's ticket sales do not improve, it's done after this season, meaning they'll be even worse off because of The Economy. In other words, if this were a movie, Olivia would be played by either a young Winona Ryder or Christina Ricci.Actually, that comparison is pretty accurate too. Much as I try to resist going too crazy with comparing books to other books or movies, I can't resist this time. There are a lot of parallels to Casper but with some of the creepiness of Beetlejuice, but, of course, with some magic totally unique to Legrand's vision. The ghosts are by turns horrifying and friendly. The shades pretty much reside in Creeptown, USA and Legrand's Limbo is haunting.Now, let's go back. Remember how I mentioned that Olivia was my second favorite? Well, my favorite is Igor. He's this cat who adopts Olivia, though she might tell you it happened the other way round. Olivia fancies that he speaks to her, and imagines that his voice sounds very like Cary Grant. Igor's such a cat, with his helpful suggestions like this one: ""I know what will make you feel better. Petting me. Better yet, asking for permission to pet me"" (211). How can anyone not love a cat that just might talk like Cary Grant? Also, I credit Igor with getting the kids through everything and teaching Olivia how to love. He convinces her to give people another shot and nudges her in the right direction with his knowing cat ways.Another aspect I adore is the music. In Claire Legrand's bio, it says that she ""was a musician until she couldn't stop thinking about the stories in her head."" Her love of music really shines in The Year of Shadows. Her descriptions of letting music wash over you are lyrical and moving. The dynamics of the band too are so apt, especially the depiction of the trumpet player. It's wonderful when authors can work in some of their real life passions, because that emotion seeps into those sections in a way that really shows.The ghost story element is well done, especially for the intended audience. With each ghost, there's a little miniature story arc full of action and adventure, followed by a scavenger hunt of sorts, and what kid will not be all over that? I did have some minor quibbles with the way some of the logic worked, but, for the most part, I was able to sit back and enjoy the story.Themes of family and friendship are also highly prevalent in The Year of Shadows. Though I think a lot of the right notes are struck here, I don't think they're held quite long enough or played with enough emotion. Legrand does a nice job establishing the friendship with Henry and Olivia, but their lunch table friend Joan comes and goes as is convenient in the story. Similarly, Henry never comes to any sort of realization about his bullying friend, though it seemed like that would be one of the impending plot points. With family too, resolutions seemed a bit too smooth and sudden, with the awkward moments skipped or glossed over. This might be a plus for younger readers, but I was hoping for those emotional wallops. Also, we're sort of left hanging on what's going to happen to Olivia next, and I'm wondering if she's going to be okay.Claire Legrand's sophomore novel features lovely writing, both sassy and creepy ghosts, and a heartwarming tale of learning to let people in. The Year of Shadows is an excellent read for middle grade readers and for older readers who enjoy new twists on ghost mythologies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX50R13AGAYXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442442948#wasThisHelpful","RX50R13AGAYXG","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After several disappointments with David Levithan's works written with Rachel Cohn and Andrea Cremer, I'd built up some healthy skepticism about whether his writing really worked for me. With Two Boys Kissing, I now know that he's an author I definitely need to be reading, and am no longer concerned about the collection of his books I already own. Two Boys Kissing is beautiful, a statement about what matters and what it's like to be a gay boy or man.David Levithan's writing is pretentious, of that I have no doubt. It certainly will not appeal to a lot of readers, who will be annoyed by that, and I don't know how it will play with teen readers, but I love it. The writing in Two Boys Kissing is complex and beautiful and simple. There were so many beautiful quotes that are heartbreaking or inspiring or funny. Plus, I'm personally not bothered by pretentious writing so long as it fits the narrative style and it's perfect for Two Boys Kissing.The narrators of Two Boys Kissing are, in fact, none of the boys involved in the plot of the story. In fact, they are all dead. In what the blurb aptly describes as a ""Greek Chorus,"" gay men from times before, specifically a generation dead from AIDS watches the boys live out their lives and marvels at how times have changed. At first, I was immensely skeptical of this writing style, but I actually ended up being a huge fan of the way this played out. Though a bit distancing from the actual teen characters and their issues, I found myself highly connected to this chorus of dead men, choking up in every one of their little asides, either from sadness or the inspiring beauty of their words.By having this chorus of men narrate, Levithan was able to do two things: universalize the experience of being a gay man into more than just what the eight boys specifically focused on have experienced and indicate how much progress has already been made in the acceptance of homosexuality. Certainly total acceptance remains in the future, but the chorus marvels at the fact that two boys can kiss in front of their high school for over a day and receive largely positive feedback. Being gay is no longer as closeted as it used to be.Another aspect of Two Boys Kissing that I loved was the diversity of the characters, both ethnically and situationally. Characters, both main and minor, come from different racial backgrounds, and that's just a fact and not a defining characteristic. Levithan also portrays with the eight gay teens eight different experiences of being a young gay in America. There are the two boys kissing, broken up and trying to figure out how to become friends. There's a couple in a healthy relationship, accepted by both sets of parents. There's a potential couple in the making, one of the boys who is partway through his gender change from female to male. There's a boy who was badly beaten for his sexual identity, determined to support his best friends in their record-breaking kiss. Finally, there's a boy who fears no one will ever love him who trolls the internet for connection, pretending to be whatever someone wants on a gay dating website. Two Boys Kissing really focuses on capturing the whole range of experience and does so well.My complaints are very minor. First off, and this could be very serious for some, Two Boys Kissing is definitely preachy. However, I support the messages herein and didn't mind the preaching. Still, it's worth noting that Levithan isn't setting a scene before the reader and leaving them to draw conclusions; he also sets out the conclusions he wants the reader to draw. The other thing, and this is really nitpicky, is that Levithan really loves the term ""screwing,"" and uses it a lot. It really just seemed really out of place and overused, since I feel like it's slang that I don't hear all that much anymore.I loved Two Boys Kissing. Levithan has written a gorgeous novel with a unique perspective and really delved into the issues of being a gay male. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in GLBT fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUV6HUIKDA895/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307931900#wasThisHelpful","RUV6HUIKDA895","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I'm that guy. You know, the one who reads a book that trusted friends, ones I usually agree with, were super impressed by and ends up unenthused. The blurb for Devil (since I can't be bothered to type all of that out over and over) did give me pause, what with the focus on River coming to town. The whole thing suggests instalove, but early reviews were promising and an ARC arrived, so screw the blurb and full speed ahead! Well, turns out I should have listened to my first instincts, because both the romance and a plot twist bothered me.In no way do I think Devil is a bad book, and there was even a brief time where I thought a 3.5 rating was coming for it. Tucholke excels especially at the horror aspects. Pretty much everything that happens ranges from eerie to totally messing with your mind to terrifying. The concept and execution of River's deal was done incredibly well. Tucholke also manages to pull off so many surprises, which upped the intensity. If you're really into horror, then I think Devil will probably be worth your time.The other aspect that I really enjoyed was the atmosphere. As with most gothic novels, there's a sort of place out of time feel to it. Though set in the modern world, Violet's little town and her house seem caught in the past. The most popular town activity is watching old movies. Violet listens to her grandmother's music and wears her grandmother's clothing, as a way of connecting. Violet's been so alone since her grandmother Freddie died, unable to connect with her brother, who she loves but who also irritates her with the way he treats girls. Tucholke sets the scene well, with the spooky giant house, the sleepy town disconnected in some way from modernity, and the slower pace of life. Tucholke's writing fits the narrative well, though it isn't a style that especially speaks to me.The characters all felt pretty flat to me too, though that could be due to Vi's impaired mental state. The only one I really connected to was Neely, who was for me the most likable in a flawed and strange bunch. The portrayal of Sunshine upset me especially, as she never actually DOES anything, except hook up with Luke, Violet's brother, even though she knows he's seeing another girl too. Sunshine gets called a term that means she charges for sex, beat up, terrified and all sorts of things, but the reader never gets a sense that there's anything more than that to her. She's shown as entirely vacuous and vain, living solely to hook up with any willing guy. All of the characters seem pretty similarly one note, but Sunshine was the most distressing.One of the aspects I didn't care for, as it so often is, is the romance between River and Violet. Now, as the blurb suggests, Violet's instalove for him does have a reason behind it, so, though painful, that's legit. He can mess with her mind somehow and create these feelings in her, which speaks strongly to abusive relationships and could send a powerful message. Unfortunately, I didn't get a real sense of the change he wrought in her, since the book opens pretty much with his arrival, so I never really got a sense of Violet as a person, because I knew her so briefly before her every thought became suspect. I can see where Tucholke put in clues to the brainwashing effect, like how Vi's initial analysis of River's appearance differed greatly once her mind started clouding, but it wasn't quite enough to help me differentiate regular Vi from River's Vi.For a while there, this book was working for me. The horror was great and there wasn't a real romance because mind control and the writing's pretty solid. Then the end happened, and I find the romance unpalatable and the twist was one of the worst ones I've ever read.As I said, early reviews of Devil have been really positive and there were things I liked, but, as a whole, I really do not see the appeal. Whatever made this magic for others was not there for me. I may try the next book depending on where Tucholke goes with it, and there's room for me to like it, but I have to review this book on what happened within its pages, not what MIGHT happen in the next book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4MYQR0LAFRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803738897#wasThisHelpful","R1M4MYQR0LAFRQ","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If You Could Be Mine falls into two much-needed categories of YA: GLBT and non-white. As such, I really wanted to read it, and I'm glad I did. Farizan's debut has a fresh narrative voice, one that has a very non-western feel, while still being open and clear. Set in Iran, Farizan tackles first love, being different, friendship, and homosexuality with honesty and heart.The plot of If You Could Be Mine, while not melodramatic or action-packed, is enthralling. I, for one, love being able to take a journey to another culture in my reading, something that I don't get to do enough. In my experience, a lot of the non-western novels I've read (generally aimed at adults) tend to be unremittingly depressing, but Farizan retains lighter moments and keeps the tone fairly bright while still capturing the restraints that Iranian society puts onto Sahar and Nasrin.Sahar has loved Nasrin for over ten years, and wanted to marry her. Soon Sahar will be heading off to university, assuming she passes her exams, and Nasrin, who Sahar always hoped would wait for her, is marrying a young doctor. Feeling both betrayed and determined, Sahar would do anything to keep Nasrin with her, beautiful Nasrin who makes Sahar feel more special and confident just by returning her affection. Being homosexual is in Iran a serious crime, one punishable by death, but, for Nasrin, Sahar would risk anything; Nasrin is more practical and more used to a comfortable life.Since Nasrin cannot be convinced to call the wedding off just for love of Sahar, other plans have to be made. Through her gay cousin Ali, Sahar meets a bunch of gay and transgender people living in Iran. Now, oddly, Iran embraces transgender people and even helps finance the gender reassignment surgeries. In this, Sahar sees hope. By changing who she is can she have everything that she wants? The fact that Sahar would alter herself this way when she has always felt like a woman, all of that for a girl, is startling and terrifying. The harsh laws of society make gender reassignment seem like the only solution to be able to remain with the person Sahar loves.Farizan does all of this very well, because she keeps the book non-preachy. There's not really a sense of judgment. At most, there's disappointment in those who do not try for what they want, but that feeling of disappointment is aimed more at the unforgiving society than the people themselves. While everyone doesn't come out in a good light, perhaps none really do, no one is demonized either.I think what held me back from loving and really connecting with If You Could Be Mine was Sahar. I sympathize with Sahar and her narrative voice fits her, but she's a bit...empty. Sahar's young and hasn't really developed to much of a self yet, having always been all about keeping Nasrin happy. She doesn't have an incredibly strong personality, and her desperate need to be with Nasrin, despite the fact that Nasrin had gotten engaged without telling her, was something which I really could not relate to in the least.An impressive debut, If You Could Be Mine tackles tough and unique subject matter with openness and a lack of judgment. Those looking for more YA set in other cultures and/or glbt YA must get their hands on this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UJZVWD0BPHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616202513#wasThisHelpful","R18UJZVWD0BPHJ","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my second experience with Jennifer Salvato Doktorski in as many months. In a lot of ways, her sophomore novel is much like her first, with similar strengths and weaknesses. Both novels exhibit a lot of promise, but left me vaguely irritated and unsettled at some of the themes and messages throughout. Famous Last Words is an improvement on How My Summer Went Up in Flames, with a slightly more likable heroine and the delightful focus on Sam's summer job.The best part, and what makes Famous Last Words stand out from the bulk of YA offerings is that t he main plot deals with Sam's job. At 16 going on 17, she's got a summer job as a paid intern at the Herald Tribune. She doesn't get to do much but write obits and fetch coffee, but the excitement of the newsroom delights her. In fact, she's much happier working late nights and crazy hours at the newspaper than dealing with other teens in high school.Sam has quite the work ethic, though that is in part due to her desire to avoid thinking about other things, like her problems with her best friend, boys, and college. Getting caught up in the mystery of the case against the mayor, who seems to be doing something illicit, Sam assists the actual reporters and does some amateur detective work. Through her job at the newspaper, she discovers a passion she didn't realize she had - for writing and for life. Writing obits makes her realize how important it is to truly live. I love that the newspaper work isn't something in the background here at all; it's in the forefront and Doktorski really delves into the process and the problems facing the newspaper industry today.As with How My Summer Went Up in Flames, I'm also largely impressed with Doktorski's characterization and writing. Most of the characters feel very authentic and human, with the little quirks that really make them feel alive. My personal favorite is definitely Sam's sassy grandma and her touching stories about Sam's late grandfather.However, Sam has a lot of the troublesome qualities that made Rosie such a frustrating heroine in How My Summer Went Up in Flames, though I do not think Sam's quite as hateful. Both Sam and Rosie are judgmental, jealous of any girl who talks to a boy they have any sort of interest in, and terrible friends. One of the main focuses of the book is the deteriorating friendship between Sam and Shelby. Sam has a lot of legitimate reasons to be mad at Shelby: the way Shelby wants Sam to be someone she's not, the way Shelby ignored Sam for a boyfriend, and the way that Shelby abandons Sam at parties. Instead, Sam gets mad about other things; Shelby's drinking and flirtatiousness, and the possible damage to her reputation (love that subtle slut-shaming).Meanwhile, Sam turns into a puddle of goo at the feet of an obviously obnoxious guy just because he has a pretty face, much like Rosie did over and over again. For all her judgment of Shelby for flirting with guys, Sam tries (though she pretends to be in ignorance of what she's doing) to string two guys along during the summer. She's single and has every right to do it, but so is Shelby free to do what she wants. Since Sam doesn't respect Shelby, I don't respect Sam. The actual romance in Famous Last Words is cute, but I was so irritated by Sam I didn't feel like she deserved the nice guy she got, because she learned very little. She does determine to do some more work on her relationship with Shelby, but her sense of elitism over the drunken, popular, pretty people never dissipates in the slightest.Running through both of Doktorski's books is an intense distaste for underage drinking, and perhaps any drinking at all. The ""good"" characters almost never drink in both. While I'm not saying underage drinking or perpetual drunkenness is admirable, arguing, even through fiction, for such abstinence education is silly; we all know how the prohibition turned out. Neither Rosie nor Sam has, to my knowledge, a reason to be so anti-drinking, like a family member who suffers from alcoholism or was killed by a drunk driver. It just seems very out of place and preachy.Both Sam and Rosie seem like believable people, and they are well-characterized. At the same time, they're not likable, at least for me. Of course, unlikable characters can be pulled off admirably, but my issue here is that I do not think that either was meant to be perceived as unlikable by the reader. The other characters generally seem to find them charming, and any hate they get is because they're too cool or talented and the other person is jealous. The fact that the two are so similar also seems a weakness.My second experience with Jennifer Salvato Doktorski leaves me still convinced that she can do great things as a writer, but that she's not there yet. The continual themes of hatred of other women, of drinking and of slut-shaming bog down otherwise incredibly fun books. If you want to try Doktorski, I would recommend Famous Last Words over How My Summer Went Up in Flames.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UWZTXZA4RDW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805093672#wasThisHelpful","R1UWZTXZA4RDW2","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's this old song called ""Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah"" about a young boy whose parents force him to go to camp. It's a funny, silly song, written like a letter to his parents. At first, he hates camp and is begging them to come and get him, but, by the end, he loves it. On the simplest level, this is the plot of Ari Goelman's The Path of Names.Dahlia differs from the usual middle grade heroine. She's grumpy and antisocial, preferring math and practicing magic tricks to spending time with people. When her parents force her to go to a Jewish camp, she's pissed. She doesn't have any interest in Judaism and would prefer to be at math camp. Her parents promise to let her leave after a week if she completely hates it and she plans to, but instead she gets caught up and the weeks pass almost without her realizing. All it takes to make a girl love summer camp and befriend people is a couple of ghosts, possession, and a mystery, no big deal.Immediately upon Dahlia's arrival in camp, she sees two girls run through a wall. Because of her love of magic, she suspects there's another aspiring magician in camp, but her search proves fruitless. When she realizes she's been seeing ghosts, though, Dahlia's hooked. She begins researching these two girls, only to discover that they disappeared 72 years before. They're also trying to warn her about something.Oh, also, Dahlia's been possessed by a dead man's spirit and she's dreaming his memories. The Path of Names deals heavily with Jewish mysticism and themes. I really appreciated reading a novel set in a tradition outside of the Christian. Also, though religion is obviously a huge plot element, the book did not feel preachy in the slightest. Goelman gets into kabbalah a bit, and it's all pretty fascinating.The Path of Names is told in third person, rotating through third person limited perspectives. Though most often focused on thirteen-year-old Dahlia, the perspective also goes to her older brother (16), a camp counselor, and David Schank (19), the young man possessing Dahlia. I feel like I say this a lot in my middle grade reviews, but this is really a story that works for all ages. Goelman's writing and plotting are sophisticated, and not written down to a younger audience.In fact, I'm not a hundred percent sure how much the average kid would enjoy The Path of Names, with the discussions of math and Hebrew. I thought it was very well done and enjoyable myself, but the pace was a bit on the slower side. I imagine it's a better book for kids on the older side of the middle grade spectrum, as the reading level is fairly high.If you've been looking for a middle grade novel set in a different culture or a cool ghost story, The Path of Names is an excellent choice. Goelmans writes well, and I'd certainly be willing to read more of his books in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KYM2HV0SW3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545474302#wasThisHelpful","R5KYM2HV0SW3J","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kasie West debuted earlier this year, and she's pretty much one of my favorite authors already. She excels at characters and romances. Basically, her books make my heart oh so happy. The Distance Between Us has a little bit in common with Pivot Point, but is largely a departure from the much more serious tone of that series. The Distance Between Us is fluffy good times of the highest order.To figure out if you would enjoy The Distance Between Us, ask yourself if you like the following things: Pretty in Pink and The Gilmore Girls. If you answered yes to one or both, then you should probably make reading this book a priority. If you haven't seen them, then you should probably rectify that AND THEN read this book. If you don't like either one, well, GOOD DAY SIR.Caymen, whose name is never explained, which is to me the biggest flaw of the book, is my girl. Seriously, she is acerbic and sarcastic like you would not even believe. I imagine that some readers will be rubbed the wrong way by her attitude, but it was like coming home. People never know if she's serious or joking, because she always says things with a straight face. Also, she cannot resist answering a stupid question with an especially sarcastic response, and, oh, how I love her for it.Here's where things get quirky. Caymen works in a doll store, owned by her mother. Dolls and More barely pays the bills, and Caymen has been raised to hate the privileged, like the man who left her mother. As such, Caymen is disgusted when this obviously rich guy comes into the store and beckons to her, as he talks on the phone. His outfit alone would probably pay expenses for her and her mom for a month. He also happens to be kind of cute, but, ugh, so stuch up and rich.Of course, that's not all there is to it, because cute, rich boy (Xander) comes back. The relationship between these two is super sweet, especially because all of their problems coming together are really internal aside from her mom being iffy on her dating a rich boy. However, otherwise, the only obstacle really is Caymen's trust issues, which are pretty mighty. Xander definitely becomes a candidate for best book boyfriends, because he is so considerate, doesn't overreact, and apologizes when he's been out of line. There's a lot of bonding and banter here, and, though they do get serious, it feels real and not like forever love; maybe it will last and maybe it won't.Social classes and economic disparity are central to The Distance Between Us, which is pretty great. Caymen's poor, like shops at thrift stores because she has to poor. There's an incredibly adorable moment where Caymen takes Xander there because his clothes are too nice for a particular outing. The treatment of some of it's a bit idealized, since most of the discomfort about her economic status comes from her. However, Caymen does have some insulting friends, like the ones that show up in Pretty in Pink. Anyway, I really appreciate that West chose a heroine who's not in the upper or middle classes.On top of that, West, like in Pivot Point, does a fantastic job building out the supporting cast. There's a healthy female best friendship depicted between Caymen and Skye, who couldn't be more different, but love and support each other endlessly. Skye's boyfriend, Henry, who initially is kind of weird and didn't mesh with Caymen or me, turns out to be a sweetie and hilarious. Xander and Caymen's families both are well built as well. I love that West doesn't skimp out on the supporting cast. I love it so much.When you find yourself in need of a fluffy, happy-making read, look no further than The Distance Between Us. With well-developed characters, snappy dialogue and abundant humor, Kasie West's novels are must reads for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23I8NTLIL2WGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062235656#wasThisHelpful","R23I8NTLIL2WGT","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was in middle school and high school, I was all about romance novels and chick lit. I couldn't get enough of largely idealized love stories. As I got a bit older and realized the universe wasn't soon going to deposit a hot foreign guy on my doorstep, one miraculously only attracted to me and wealthier than Midas, I got a bit disillusioned. Only in the last couple years have I started to enjoy romance novels again, though it's hard to say whether that's because of increased cynicism or optimism on my part. There's something sort of comforting in a familiar, predictable plot arc sometimes, knowing that HEA is coming and that there will be hot sexy times.Second in the Whitman University series, By Referral Only is technically a companion novel, following the roommate of the heroine of Broken at Love. Ruby Cotton and I got off to a bit of a rough start. She's not as easily likable as Emilie, more judgmental and intentionally crass. Also, she's a virgin-shamer, which isn't a good way to endear a character to me. Still, she did grow on me a bit as time went by and she realized how bad her emotional hang ups were. Also, the fact that she's an actress and loves Shakespeare and musicals, as well as being a great teacher for a class of children was good too.What's awesome about By Referral Only is that the traditional gender roles are pretty much swapped. Ruby Cotton loves sex and hates commitment. She intentionally seeks out hot guys that she's not attracted to any way but physically for extended flings, because one night stands aren't good enough to be worth the trouble. Ruby's sexually adventurous and emotionally closed off, due to painful relationships in her past. Now, when I say painful, I mean real life painful, not tragically abusive or anything like that, because this isn't one of those stories. She's just had her heartbroken and doesn't want to go there again.Sick of subpar hookups, Ruby decides to launch a website so that the women of Whitman University can objectify the men on campus right back. The ladies of Whitman can rate the men both in terms of how good the sex was and whether they would recommend him overall. That whole premise is pretty hilarious to me, ngl. Anyway, Ruby immediately catches the eye of a hot boy in class, only to realize he's gotten the lowest ratings of any guy on campus on her site. Whoops.Of course, Cole, the guy, turns out to be too tempting to resist, despite the lack of referral from her peers. Plus, the whole mystery of why he's such a good kisser, but apparently bad in the sack, engages her curiosity. Oh, did I mention Cole is Scottish? Seriously. Where are all the hot European men in my life? I feel cheated. Cole turns out to be a really nice, rather nerdy guy, who shares Ruby's love of musical theatre. He's also totally the more innocent one in the relationship and very focused on commitment. They definitely made a more believable and shippable couple than Quinn and Emilie, with romantic issues that are way more true to life.The other awesome aspect of By Referral Only is the focus on healthy female friendships, often absent from romance novels. Emilie and Ruby get along really well, even if they are both busy with boys a lot of the time. Still, when Ruby needs advice, Emilie comes through for her, not just telling her what she wants to hear but what she needs to hear. Plus, it's not one of those situations where they secretly hate or envy one another. Ruby's a bit jealous of Emilie's loving relationship, but in the ""I wish I had a love like that"" way and not in the misery wants company way. Ruby also has a burgeoning friendship with Cole's sister Audra.The focus on how well off everyone at Whitman is did get old, though. Seriously, you all bathe in twenty dollar bills, I get it. Ruby liked to mope about because she comes from new money and a lot of the other Whitman students don't respect her. Poor little rich girl, let me wipe away your tears with a big stack of money.If you enjoyed Broken at Love, By Referral Only will not disappoint. If you're just checking in now, reading By Referral Only probably won't spoil anything, since it's not like it's a spoiler that the couple from Broken at Love ends up together. The Whitman University series is fun, quick and totally entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R211FHUCF16WHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1489544453#wasThisHelpful","R211FHUCF16WHS","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most delightful things about middle grade fiction is the focus on friendship and family over romance, which tends to dominate a lot of young adult reads. In this case, though, romance is the name of the game, at least on the surface. I was a little bit skeptical of the premise, but Emma Emmets, Playground Matchmaker turned out to be totally adorable, full of nerdy jokes, cuteness and allusions to some of my favorite books.Though the blurb doesn't mention this, probably because kids wouldn't much care, I am one hundred percent convinced that Emma Emmets, Playground Matchmaker is a retelling of Jane Austen's Emma. How awesome is that? SUPER AWESOME. Basically, Emma inadvertently matchmakes Annie and Henry at summer camp, and, when Annie credits her skills, Emma decides this could be just what she needs to make something of herself. Em has been pretty unpopular, because of the horrifyingly EMbarrassing nicknames Isla, the most popular girl in their grade, had given her. Now, she plans to tout her matchmaking skills to make people happy (and to boost her own place in elementary school society).Like Emma Woodhouse, Emma Emmets has mostly good intentions, but doesn't necessarily have a great grasp on the whole matchmaking thing, because she's not all that familiar with romance and gets a little too caught up in herself. Still, she's pretty successful at matchmaking on the whole. All the boyfriends and girlfriends in fourth grade did creep me out a little bit (there weren't many couples until middle school in my day - most of us still thought the opposite gender was kinda gross), but I like that DeVillers put an emphasis on matchmaking friendships too, not just romantic relationships. The overall message really was about helping kids find kindred spirits, and it really shook up the school's cliques and brought people together.Emma has a little romance of her own going, that also follows a sort of Jane Austen line. The new boy, Daniel Dunne, makes fun of Emma on the very first day. Since he's rude to her, she decides she hates him too and considers him an enemy. Obviously they're not, and they have a cute little flirtation going, though I love that it's kept very simple and not overly emotion-y.The writing didn't do too much for me though. DeVillers writes in third person, but it really reads like first person. I am just not a fan of when third person narration is full of exclamation points and ellipses. I prefer my narration a bit more staid and for the thoughts of the MC to be delineated separately. I'm sure this won't bother the intended audience, but it was an annoyance for me.Emma Emmets, Playground Matchmaker is a funny, sweet story about the trials and tribulations of elementary school friendships and relationships. Though not an ideal read for older readers, the Jane Austen connections were enough to keep me happy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWBS4I1O3A1ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159514661X#wasThisHelpful","RWBS4I1O3A1ZO","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sidekicked had me at superheroes. I can't get enough of them, at least so far, and the superhero books I've read thus far have yet to seriously let me down. Sidekicked is a great read, full of action and humor, like all the best superhero stories. Full of twists, turns, and middle school awkwardness, Sidekicked is a delightful addition to superhero fiction.Like most superhero stories, Sidekicked takes place in a fictional city, the home to the most famous of all superheroes, Justicia. In Justicia, seeing superheroes saving the day is commonplace, much like in Kurt Busiek's Astro City. Cops and EMTs wait for superheroes to arrive on the scene of any crime involving a villain, because they're both outclassed and used to the aid of the heroes. These heroes are actually possessed of powers, not just rich kids with toys, though they are mostly wealthy since being a superhero is a costly venture - secret lairs aren't free, you know.Andrew Bean's middle school has a secret program, one that allows him to skip gym: the Highview Environmental Revitalization Organization (They keep the trash off the streets!). Also known as H.E.R.O. Drew is one of only six kids in this special club, all of them special and all in training to one day be superheroes. Each one gets paired up as a sidekick to a hero, who can teach them the tricks of the trade, unless they refuse to meet with you like Drew's does.Drew's alias is The Sensationalist, because he has super senses. All of his senses are greatly enhanced, except for touch, which is a blessing. Though these powers are fairly useful, he feels out of place with even the rest of the sidekicks, who have super strength or speed or can walk through objects. Drew wants either to be normal or to be truly exceptional, but feels trapped in the middle, not powerful enough to be a Super but to strange and nerdy to fit in with the rest of his classmates.Drew falls into classic outsider territory. Told in first person narration, the commentary throughout the novel is hilarious. He just made me smile, like when he was working out what his catchphrase might be and said this: ""'I'm the sensationalist, and I at least smell better than you!' Maybe I have a future as a deodorant pitchman.' The rest of the cast is well-developed too, and it's a nice ensemble of quirky characters. I love that Jenna is the most powerful of the sidekicks and that a female Super is the strongest hero currently in action. There's a real emphasis on the strength in everyone and looking past the surface.What most impressed me with Sidekicked though was actually the plot. Anderson keeps everything fast-paced, full of attacks by villains, some of which were pretty intense. At a hundred pages in, I had this awesome theory about the twists that were coming...and I was wrong. A lot of novels targeted to younger readers really telegraph the twists, but Anderson didn't do that. Everything came together really nicely, and he surprised me with each one, even though I was watching for them. Now, I'm not saying I'm the best at anticipating twists, but I suspect the intended audience will be shocked when they reach the big reveal. I really appreciate when middle grade fiction isn't dumbed down.Anyone who enjoys superhero stories will most definitely want to read Sidekicked. Though a middle grade novel, John David Anderson's Sidekicked is a story that will please children, teens and adults alike with its clever humor, vibrant cast, and action-packed plot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CX38IKAIS06R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062133144#wasThisHelpful","R2CX38IKAIS06R","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really did not expect to like Ink. Obviously, I did when I requested the book (Japan! Fantasy! That cover!), but reviews started pouring in and almost all were negative and listed the sorts of reasons I generally agree with, like relationship dynamics and instalove. Here I am, though, having really liked Ink, almost loved it, in spite of all of that. While I can see why a lot of my trusted friends haven't enjoyed it, I had a ton of fun reading it and, minus some hiccups on the romance side of things, thought it was a strong novel besides.To explain this disparity between my opinion and those of others, I have to explain just how much of a nerd I am. In 2008, while interning at a public library, I picked up a love for manga, which has since bloomed into a love for anime and kdrama. Even before that, Asian culture fascinated me, but now it's verging (if we lessen my crazy) on obsession. There are a lot of upsetting elements in the average kdrama/manhwa/anime/manga/jdrama. Men tend to be dominant; women weak and easy to tears. Boyfriends tend to be overly physical, verging on abusive, with their girlfriends. I see this, but, for some reason, it's not as much of an obstacle to my enjoyment as it is in American pop culture. Now, I'm not saying that the romance is necessarily like this in Ink, but I'm trying to explain that my standards are subtly different for the stories set in this other culture.For those of you who are big fans of manga (which will be my shorthand for all those permutations listed above), Ink is delightful. Amanda Sun peppers the text with those classic scenes to be found in almost any shoujo manga: the wrist grab, the boy carrying the girl on his bike, the close stares that don't end in kisses but leave the heroine a blushing mess, the yakuza, the sakura. There were so many moments that made me laugh giddily because I recognized them from pop culture. Ink really does read like a manga, which is made of win.The premise, too, is fascinating, and I really think Sun does a marvelous job with it. I was impressed with her writing in general, but her descriptions of the ink coming alive really do burst off the page. In fact, her love for Japan, for kendo, for art, and for Japanese history really do shine through. Her twist on the mythology of the kami, Japanese gods really worked, and seemed pretty sensitive to Japanese culture thus far; I am so glad Katie, a white girl from the US was not a kami. Also, the plot takes a Death Note sort of turn near the end, which is going to become more of a factor in later books I think, that makes me want to take a chip and eat it...while cackling malevolently.Katie does stalk Tomohiro quite a bit in the beginning, but, even that, I'm okay with, for the most part. She's a bit of a creeper, but she does have reason to be curious: she saw his pictures moving and ink dripping seemingly from nowhere. Plus, she was really homesick and lonely, and the mystery of what was going on with Tomohiro was a good distraction. Getting caught up in that is what helps her transition from a foreigner to someone who really belongs. Once she gets more involved in life there, her Japanese improves much faster and so does her general quality of life.About the romance, I really wouldn't categorize it as instalove personally. For one thing, Katie and Tomohiro really do spend a fair amount of time together, and time elapses between their initial meetings and their declarations of love. They do move too fast once they start the relationship, and do the whole inexplicably drawn to each other thing, though. However, I'm willing to mostly let that slide, since Katie and Tomo do actually have chemistry and are occasionally quite adorable together, like when Tomo blushes. I won't say I'm shipping them hard, but I don't hate them as a couple either.The downside of their relationship was how serious their bond became. They do the whole ""I'm ready to sacrifice myself for you"" and ""can't live without you"" thing, which is really getting old. I really don't think most teens are this willing to die for love. Not only that, but the dialogue at these points always gets so hackneyed and melodramatic. Tomo definitely tries to do the manly keep Katie in the dark and protect her thing sometimes, but, what saved this book for me, Katie doesn't let him. Both Katie and Tomo know about the imperfections of the other, and they call each other on their bad habits. Katie calls Tomo out several times for not telling her things or for being a jerk, and Tomo does the same when Katie keeps stalking him. They're accepting one another's bad qualities, not unaware of them. Even if Tomo tries all that masculine nonsense, Katie doesn't let him. Though I don't approve of a lot of Katie's decisions, they are at least real choices, and not her being forced one way or another by other people in her life.Ink turned out to be a fantastic book, despite my expectations to the contrary. If book two were available now, I would not hesitate to read it right away. I highly recommend this one to fans of Japanese or Korean pop culture!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIDKKGLCLXC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037321071X#wasThisHelpful","RIIDKKGLCLXC4","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A year or so ago, I changed my book-buying policy and bought two debuts I'd never read based on the incredibly positive reviews: Divergent by Veronica Roth and Legend by Marie Lu. Well, the former turned out to be an immense disappointment, one I disliked to the degree I resent my past self for having wasted hard-earned money on it. Thankfully, I do not need to invent time travel and break the time-space continuum by going back in time and killing my impulsive, past self, because Legend actually turned out to be good.Marie Lu's debut is jam-packed with action. Where the derring-do in Divergent comes across as over-the-top and done merely because of how cool it sounds, the action scenes in Legend belong. Both Day and June commit seemingly impossible acts all of the time, but they also have the experience and the injuries to show for it. They do not come by their skills easily; they work for everything they earn, despite being prodigies.Everyone who reviews this book gushes about Day, and, much as I like to feel unique, I cannot help but do the same thing. Day's chapters were my favorites all the way through. He's just such a noble criminal, and he reads very much like a boy. My love for Day is also inextricably bound up in the beauty of the formatting for his chapters. Day's sections are printed in a golden font, which might prove difficult to some readers, but which I love wholeheartedly. Also, and this is a bit of an odd criticism, but I think it's cool how June's chapters have a practical black font, and Days' are more ornate and unique, to represent their upbringings.June is a tougher character to like, as she's meant to be. Where Day is the rebel with a heart (and font) of gold, June works for the evil dystopian government, and is rising quickly through the ranks. June believes wholeheartedly in what she's doing, and is determined to prove herself by catching Day, the killer of her brother. June grows as a character throughout, becoming someone you continually root for to make good decisions.With slews of books coming out marketed as dystopians that really are not, I will have you all know that Legend truly is. The dystopian elements work quite well, though they are not all that unique. Having read so many of them, I recognized the various twists from other works and was not caught off guard by any of them. Many readers will likely not have so much knowledge of the genre, though. Nor did my knowledge of where the book was heading impact my enjoyment of the novel in the slightest.I do agree with a criticism I've seen around and about that Day and June both read too old. According to the novel, they are both fifteen. They are prodigies and I get that, but they should still be in puberty, and I'm really supposed to buy that they're the most powerful people in all of the Republic? I get that they're prodigies, but how are there no adults that can even begin to give them a run for their money? Every time the text mentioned them being fifteen, it would throw me out of the story because it just seemed off. The novel might make a bit more sense with 17-18 year old main characters.Legend has well-written action scenes, solid world building, and convincing dual perspectives. I am so glad I have a copy of Prodigy ready to start soon, because I do not want to wait to learn what will happen to the characters next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OB1K7NVUHBU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039925675X#wasThisHelpful","R2OB1K7NVUHBU2","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my goodness. You're going to need to let me gush right now. I just love, love, love this book. Having finished, I almost want to go back to the beginning and start over or read every book Snyder has ever written. Almost from the first pages, I have just devoured this story, living in fear of the ending coming too soon (which of course it did). Book two should be out now! Waiting will be so, so painful.Okay, I will try to be a little bit more helpful in my review now and explain why I am such a fan girl about this book. Like the main character in the Inside Out series, the only other books I've read by Snyder thus far, Avry is an incredibly strong woman (she's 20, so a bit older) with some serious emotional scarring. Unlike her counterpart, though, Avry has a much more likable personality by nature. She is vibrant, incredibly bright and stubborn as anything (I wonder why I identify with her so much, haha).Another consistent factor in Snyder's writing is that she is completely stellar at building up romantic tension. Without resorting to any sort of torrid descriptions of the physical reactions every time the hero does so much as touch the heroine, Snyder makes the reader swoon for the heroes as they live vicariously. Honestly. The romance sections are just so amazing, even though she doesn't go into serious detail, you feel and imagine everything.I also love the fantasy world she created. I mean, princes + magic + dystopian background almost cannot go wrong. And she did it well. Her world feels really well thought out. The different kinds of magic, the way they interact, and the fact that science in its way remains important despite these higher powers completely blew me away with the awesome.The drama has only just begun, and, as you already know, I will be first in line to read book two. I recommend this highly to fans of The Goose Girl, Kristin Cashore, or Snyder's other books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQ6L1UXGAJ4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778313077#wasThisHelpful","R1TQ6L1UXGAJ4L","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shaun and Georgia Mason are adopted siblings and well-respected bloggers. Georgia's a newsie, meaning that she tells the truth without bias, only the facts. Shaun's an Irwin (as in Steve), which means he likes to poke zombies with sticks. Oh right, did I not mention the zombies? There are zombies. And they do want to eat your brains or any other part of you they can get a hold of. Anyway, back to Shaun and Georgia. They, along with their fictional/techno-genius friend Buffy get selected to follow along on Senator Ryman's presidential campaign, which is super amazing, because the government has never taken bloggers seriously before. They're thrilled, until mysterious and awful things start happening around them.My description of Feed kind of sucks, but I can't really think of how to improve it. Suffice it to say that there are zombies, mayhem, politics and sarcasm. What more does one need? It really is harder sometimes to summarize a really good book, because they tend to be a little deeper, making it hard to put all of the awesomeness into a summary. Thankfully, I can mention all of that in my review.Zombies are ridiculous. We all know this, even those of us who rather like to read about them. There's not really any scientific reason to believe zombies possible; personally, I would more readily believe in pretty much any paranormal creature before I would believe in zombies. Unicorns? Sure, my young self is delighted and says they exist! Vampires? Why not? People can be cannabalistic, besides Catholics already drink their saviors blood. Back to pseudo-seriousness, though, Feed has the best explanation of zombie-fication that I have seen thus far. Grant also does a good job of giving a description and then doing the authorial equivalent of shrugging her shoulders and telling the audience to suspend disbelief, but in a good way.I absolutely loved Feed from the first page. Why? Georgia/George. She is fantastically snarky and grumpy and sarcastic. She's like me, only with worse eyes (mine suck, but at least I can go out on a sunny day). Not every other character feels fully dimensional, but they are all built out in a believable way, to the degree that George understands/cares about them. George is standoffish and only bothers to learn about certain people, so everyone wouldn't be distinct in her world.The writing is pretty fantastic. I always know an author has talent when he/she can write distinct voices and you can tell who's who without necessarily needing to be told. Grant achieved this. The little snippets from the various characters' blogs so obviously correspond to one or the other, even before you reach the part telling the author's name.The format was pretty great, too. The bulk of the story was told from George's perspective, with only well-integrated background. The quotes from blogs enabled Grant to put in some more back story, which might not have fit in the flow of a characters every day thoughts without making the novel feel forced.One thing that really amazed me about Feed was that it wasn't a dystopia the way you would expect. You would generally think that the zombies were the problem, right? Not really. I mean, they are a concern, but society has figured out how to live with the problem. The United States really is much the same as it has ever been, which is why the fact that it's a dystopia is even more of a creepy reflection on our current lifestyle.In some ways, the society in Feed is the one I would least be willing to live in of all of the dystopias I've read. Okay, only in one way. But still. What's my problem with this rather-better-than-most vision of the near future (2040)? Needles. These people get blood tests approximately 85,000 times every day, to ensure that they are not in the process of becoming zombies. As a person who refuses to get the flu shot every year because I'd rather take my chances, this is not a future I want to be a part of. Needles are the worst.Oh, and, less seriously, you may have noticed in my less-than-inspired description that there's a character called Buffy. She's actually named Georgette, but she figured, hey, I'm short and blond and cute...what else would my name be? Loving the reference so hard. And I'm fairly certain that Joss Whedon would appreciate it and the book as well. (I could be wrong, but this is my guess.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WR802GPOZR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316081051#wasThisHelpful","R10WR802GPOZR4","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you ever read a book and think: ""I just want to be best friends with the author. Can we just hang out and I can soak up her/his brillance? Pretty please?"" Other people think this way, right? This is how I feel about Mira Grant. I declare myself a fan girl with pride.Feed was one of my very favorite books that I read in 2011. I loved it, and it caught me largely by surprise, because anything with a designation of horror makes me skeptical, since I'm the biggest wimp ever. However, I was immediately charmed by Georgia's intelligence, sarcasm, and hatred of people. Whenever I love the first book in a series that much, I worry that the next one will be a disappointment. I mean, how can it be as good? Well, just let me say that literally from the quotes before the first chapter, my worries vanished. I knew from the beauty of the writing that I would love this one just as much...and I did.These books are pretty massive, roughly 600 pages each, so they take some reading, even for a speed demon like myself. The world building in this series is freaking mind-blowing. I cannot even put into words how good it is. Grant has so many details, all intricately woven so it never feels like you're sitting back for fifty years of exposition. Well, at least, that's how I feel. I know some readers have been turned off by all of the focus on politics and science, but I loved that, even though science and politics are pretty much at the top of the list of things I hate.Despite the length, I really never felt like the plot of Deadline dragged. I was constantly eager to keep moving and find out what was going to happen next. This book made me cry, made me laugh, made me seriously concerned for the state of humanity, and made me go WTF just happened (Ending, you were cray...why do I not have Blackout now?). You should definitely watch out for Grant's humor, which can be found throughout. She has this great, dark sense of humor that just kills me. For example, she describes grocery shopping in the post-Rising world as ""not an activity for the faint of heart"" (345). Yes, you do learn about grocery shopping in a zombie-afflicted world. The characters are all vibrant and feel so real. In a lot of ways, her style reminds me of Joss Whedon. Just saying.At this point, I'm going tell all you peeps who haven't read Feed to bounce. Either go read my review for that book or, even better, GO BUY FEED AND READ IT RIGHT NOW. The rest of this review will have crazy insane SPOILERS for Feed (not for Deadline), so I really don't want anyone without any knowledge of book one continuing on. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Now, folks who read Feed, that ending was insane, right? Talk about a book that stayed with me. I usually forget endings but I did not forget that for sure. WAAAAHHHHH! I love that Grant wasn't afraid to kill off the MC. I mean, that's just badass, but it's also difficult to recover from, which is why you don't often see it. This, too, explains my initial fear of this book; a narrator switch was compulsory and I adored George. Well, thankfully, Shaun totally works as a narrator. You even get some George, because, check it, all those happenings have officially pushed Shaun over the edge of sanity into crazy town. He's now hearing George in his mind, and not just through memories.Usually, this is not a plot line I would be able to handle, but Grant has done it so well. See, the thing is that George and Shaun had only each other for so many years. They are more closely bound to one another than Heathcliff and Catherine, on top of being a million times less obnoxious. Because of this, it makes sense that he can't let her go completely. In fact, the only thing keeping him going is his need for revenge on whoever orchestrated her death, because Shaun's not buying Tate as a mastermind. Where Feed delved into corruption in politics, Deadline focuses on the medical profession, and the truths of Kellis-Amberlee. I don't want to go into any more detail than that, because that might detract from your joy on the journey. Just know that it's amazing.Mira Grant's Newsflesh Trilogy is, without a doubt, my favorite zombie fiction. With complete honesty, I can think of NOTHING that I would like to change about them. I could open the book up at random to any page, any of them, and find a quote I love. For me, the writing, tone, pacing, humor, world and characters are all absolutely perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38YEZETPK69F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031608106X#wasThisHelpful","R38YEZETPK69F2","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because of the cover (pretty dress), I was really excited about this one. Then I saw a lot of mixed reviews around the blogosphere and put on my skeptical cap. Thankfully, I'm in the group of people that just ate Grave Mercy up and looked around for more. It's kind of funny, because I started reading this and Candlewax at the same time, the latter of which was compared to Cashore; I ended up giving up on Candlewax and think Ismae is way more Katsa-ish.To that end, let's discuss Ismae, shall we? She may be a nun of sorts, but she kicks major butt. She's the kind of girl who hides a crossbow in her skirts. A Crossbow. No joke. Of course, she doesn't live in a society that respects strong women. She is married off at a young age to a brute, but refuses to accept his abuse. She would have been killed, but was rescued and sent to a convent where daughters of Mortain (the death god/saint) are trained to kill. It made me so sad to watch her trade being controlled by her father to being controlled by the convent. Watching her mature throughout the book was a pleasure.Duval is completely amazing. I love him and would not mind having one of my own. He's so supportive and caring of the people that he loves and so distrustful of anyone else. He's incredibly intelligent and focused. He reminds me a lot of the hero from Touch of Power, who I also adored. His relationship with Ismae grows in a very natural way. He is so freaking swoon-worthy.Grave Mercy is quite long. Reading it took me three days, which, given my record, is like forever, at least with my primary book. The length has turned some readers off, but I, personally, never felt like the book dragged at all. One complaint was that we didn't get to read about the training of the killer nuns, but I was okay with missing out on that.Robin LaFevers is definitely a new favorite author for me. I want book two, Dark Radiance immediately! Apparently, it's going to be about Sybella, rather than continuing Ismae's story. Although I love Ismae, I think I approve of the decision to move to a different character. I wonder if we'll get Annith's story in book three. I hope so!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJM32MUX8UIC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054762834X#wasThisHelpful","RJM32MUX8UIC2","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"came to this book with absolutely no expectations. Prior to reading it, I knew nothing about the book or its author. The only reason I ever picked it up was because I won a copy of the second book in the series from Goodreads' First Reads program. At first, I thought that was bad luck, and I was annoyed with myself for even entering to win the second book in a series I'd never read. Well, now, I just want to pat myself on the back for being so awesome.This book was just so incredibly cool. Dellamonica has created magic as I've never seen it before. The worldbuilding is so incredibly cool. As crazy as it is, there's a sort of normalcy to it that calls to mind magical realism. The Unreal, and the liquid magic, are just so incredibly unique and astounding. Oh, and, it's apocalyptic. So many things that I love are in this book!The story alternates between past events and present ones. In the present, where we start, Will, a crisis negotiator, arrives to interrogate Astrid Lethewood. She was arrested and then apparently moved to this special facility because of her mental instability. The first chapter captured me immediately, with Astrid's craziness and everything being said making me want to know more.I'm not usually one to cast roles for a potential movie as I'm reading a book, but I can see Astrid as no one but Summer Glau, and I do think this could make a completely amazing television show. Although I'm not sure that Summer necessarily fits what Astrid is supposed to look like, she plays crazy and intelligent better than anyone else. Astrid comes off as a sort of a weak, quiet character, possible insanity aside. Really, though, she has so much power.In the past, we learn about how she discovered the truth of her father, Albert. He left her a big house, although he was a wastrel during most of his lifetime. In it, she finds a bunch of what appears to be junk, but then she discovers that all of those items are chantments, enchanted magical objects. One can turn a number two pencil into gold shavings. Another can make you more beautiful.Astrid begins to recover lost memories and learns more about the magic and her father, with her friends, Jacks and Sahara at her side. Sahara is so perfectly her character. I have such a vivid mental image of her in my head as well. These three are all so well-characterized. The other figures in the story, I have less of a handle on, even Will, though you see from his perspective for about half of the book. Everything is bound up in Astrid's universe, which mostly consists of three people.Indigo Springs may be the best urban fantasy novel I've read to date. It's vibrant, magical and edgy. I am so excited to start on Blue Magic soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GJ8CR58I5SR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041T4RDC#wasThisHelpful","R2GJ8CR58I5SR6","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read The DUFF a couple of years ago, I really, really liked it, though I didn't expect to because of the title. However, my memory being the mostly useless contraption that it is quickly faded. Jenni of Alluring Reads reviewed The DUFF a few months back and completely panned it. She pretty much loathed the book, and that stunned me. While Jenni and I certainly don't always agree, we often do, and I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about A Midsummer's Nightmare. Well, I still don't know for sure about The DUFF, but I loved this one.For one thing, Keplinger writes like a teenager so well. Both here and with The DUFF, I don't think anyone open-minded can deny that she has the lingo and cadence and emotional landscape down. In a lot of books, I mentally age the characters up in my head, because their circumstances (absent parents, not actually attending any high school classes) and way of conversing just do not necessarily seem teenage. In Keplinger's, even though her characters do things I may rather wish a 14 or 17 or any age person wouldn't do, I never feel for a moment like they're not teenagers.To be entirely frank, though, this book did begin with a pretty major disappointment for me. I was convinced that this book was inspired by Shakespeare. For some misguided reason, I even though I had read a synopsis and that it was set around a high school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Ummm, seriously, what the hell? Where does my brain get this stuff? That's not what it was about at all. I confess. I was VERY wrong. However, that title! It promises Shakespeare, and I wanted it okay.However, A Midsummer's Nightmare did turn out to be inspired by a classic work of fiction, just not the bard's. Actually, Kepliger got some amount of inspiration from Catcher in the Rye, a book I personally really did not like. The connection, while not an incredibly strong one, lies in the mental state of the heroine, who shuts herself off from emotions by making bad life choices. She doesn't see the point in friends, because people are just phonies anyway. I'm quite proud of myself for having picked up on the reference before I read the blurb. Also interesting is that her step-family's last name is Caulfield. Nice one.Roughly the first half of this book really hurts to read. It's a good hurt, the kind John Mellencamp might approve of, a straight punch right to the emotional gut. Whitley makes so many bad choices. She gets completely wasted, hooks up with whatever guy she can find, and avoids any sort of real emotional interaction. In the opening scene, Whitley wakes up on the morning following graduation to discover that she's in someone else's bed, having had sex with some (admittedly quite attractive) guy whose name she does not even know. Worse still, he wants to chat, when she just wants to get the hell out and not talk about it, so she tells him she never, ever wants to see him again, which, conveniently, shouldn't be too hard since he's moving.Her parents, in stereotypical YA style, neglect her. Whitley's mother and father divorced six years previously, and she was glad of that, but her mother never got over it, still ranting and raving about how awful her father is to this day, and her father only spends time with her once a year. Still, she lives for these summers with him. Unsurprisingly, Whitley wants to throw a fit when she discovers that her father has sold his quirky condo by the beach and moved into a suburban monstrosity of boredom. With his new fiancee. And her two children. One of whom is that guy she had sex with the night of graduation. Apparently, his name is Nathan.Whitley has always been called unflattering things for her drunken, boy-seducing ways: slut, skank, easy, whore. That never really bothered her before. In this new small town, with less people to blend into, the label really starts to hurt, particularly when someone she cares about calls her a whore or when she discovers a Facebook group formed to talk about her lewd behavior. Obviously, this is a hugely touchy subject, and I was really concerned about how it would be handled. Thankfully, Keplinger, after setting the stage and delivering a harshly truthful depiction of how cruel teens can be, sends precisely the message that I was hoping for. Since I know these issues can be an automatic DNF for a lot of people, I want to share Nathan's apology for having called Whitley a whore:""'I'm sorry for what I said to you that day.' Nathan's hand slid from my elbow to my wrist. 'It wasn't okay for me to call you a whore. It's not okay for anyone to say that. Not the people online. And definitely not me.'""What Nathan said was not okay, but he owned up, and he stepped up from there on out to make sure that she never lets her think he truly feels that way. When she doubts herself or blames herself for an attempted rape, he reminds her over and over again that it was in no way her fault. Honestly, I loved Nathan. He messed up in anger, yes, but who doesn't? He wasn't violent, and he apologized wholeheartedly, and was completely supportive from that moment onward. Of course, he also happens to be both nerdy and built, so...can I have one? Seriously, he wears shirts that say things like ""MAY THE MASS TIMES ACCELERATION BE WITH YOU"" or that have the hand sign for live long and prosper. Also, the boy can kiss. Seriously, if you like hot kissing scenes in books, Keplinger has got your back. Just make sure you have some sort of fanning implement handy.Even better, as much as I loved the way that Nathan and Whitley's relationship slowly evolved, that was not the central plot line of the book. A Midsummer's Nightmare focuses more on Whitley overcoming her issues with her parents, and learning to not be so self-destructive. Just for the record, I don't think there is anything wrong with her sleeping around or getting drunk occasionally or being a loner, except that those things did not make her happy. She needed to grow, and, as much as she hated it for a while, being thrown into a different family environment was the shock to her system that she really needed.Keplinger's characterization rocked. Whitley, of course, rocked, confident and broken and funny and bitchy and insecure. However, the others did not take a backseat to her. Nathan, of course, gets quite a bit of development, but I've already talked about him. Bailey, Nathan's younger sister about to start high school, hero worships Whitley. Bailey begins as obnoxious to both Bailey and myself, but grows to be this irresistibly adorable kid. After a rocky start, Whitley does actually help Bailey open up and feel a bit more confident. Also, I have to say how much I loved Whitley's first friend Harrison. He is gay and utterly tenacious, simply determined to make Whitley accept him as a friend. The boy has style and totally has her back, but is also not a stereotype at all. There's a real affection between the two of them that is touching. Even Sylvia, the soon-to-be stepmother gets some good characterization. The only exceptions are Whitley's parents, but that has to do with the plot arc more than anything. Basically, I cared so much for Whitley, Harrison and the Caulfields; I rooted for them so hard.Any book that can make me feel such a full gamut of emotions and leave me grinning like a fool afterwards, in that insane post-book bliss, has earned that five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ZIUJYR20H3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316084220#wasThisHelpful","R16ZIUJYR20H3A","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lost Girl has been sweeping in praise, and I can see why. Sangu Mandanna's debut is a mature, beautiful story with philosophical resonances. She touches on what it means to be human and on the nature of creation. This is a book that makes you think about the world, and what it would be like if it were just a little bit different. Though The Lost Girl didn't quite cross the border into being a story that I absolutely love, I can confidently recommend it to anyone who appreciates a thoughtful, introspective story with a bit of action.The world herein depicted differs very little from the modern world in which we live. The only real difference is the existence of the Weavers and their Loom. Modern-day Frankensteins, not of name but of occupation work there, building humans from dust and bones. These Weavers create Echoes, copies of real human beings, insurance policies of a sort. Purchase an Echo of your beloved child and you will not have to worry about her death, because you've got a spare raised in secrecy by Guardians to know the intimate details of her life.The process is not explained in detail, and I do admit some skepticism about how the Weavers are able to create physically identical human with the ingredients Mandanna relates, but this really doesn't detract from the story. The idea of the Echoes is less of a scientific venture than a philosophical one. What does it mean to be an Echo, to be intended to be someone else? Are they human? Do they have souls? Are they individuals? Should they have rights?The heroine, who names herself Eva, is the Echo of Amarra, the eldest daughter of a wealthy family in Bangalore. There's no doubt that Eva is her own person. She enjoys pursuits that Amarra does not, like art, and loves a boy that Amarra does not. Amarra and Eva both resent the intrusion of the other. Eva's presence cheapens Amarra's life because she feels expendable, and like she has to share everything with Eva; Eva exists only to be an imitation of Amarra, and has to squash her individuality, her desires, her ambitions. Their relationship and the way that only one of them can truly, openly exist at once has echoes of What's Left of Me by Kat Zhang.I rooted for Eva to get a chance at life. She has so much spirit and such a strong will to live, but she has no right to life if she doesn't follow a strict set of rules, and, even if she does, she could be killed for any number of reasons. Somehow, though, I never really connected with her or the other characters, except perhaps for Amarra's charming little brother Nikhil. I'm not really sure what was missing for me there, but that disconnect I felt kept me from completely loving the book.My only other concern is the very end. The very last chapter made things a bit more cut-and-dried than I would have liked. I thought Mandanna was going for an unclear ending, and she does in a way, but she tied up one arc with a neat little bow that did not fit with the mood of the rest of the book. For the kind of book that The Lost Girl is, the vaguely happy ending sounded a false note for me, though I imagine most readers will thrill to it, particularly if invested in the characters.Sangu Mandanna is an author to watch. Her debut is powerful, beautifully-written, and full of moving philosophical questions on what it means to be human. The Lost Girl is a great read-a-like for Kat Zhang's What's Left of Me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17D74XFZGNUH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062082310#wasThisHelpful","R17D74XFZGNUH0","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As happens from time to time, I've read a book that is wonderful, but that does not work perfectly for the kind of reader that I am. Rootless by Chris Howard is a true dystopian/post-apocalyptic novel set in a nightmare landscape. The writing is beautiful and the characters are unique. I definitely like Rootless and I'm very impressed by Howard's debut, but I'm too easily confused by science for it to be the perfect book for me.First off, I want to praise Chris Howard's writing to the skies. The writing is beautiful, perfectly matched to Banyan and to the world itself. Howard manages to establish that Banyan speaks in dialect with the use of words like ""reckon,"" but keeps it to a minimum. Thus, he clearly gets across the sound of the characters without making Rootless any less readable. Dialect done wrong is a miserable reading experience, and I think Howard takes a marvelous approach.Howard builds from a pretty standard dystopian formula with the evil corporation GenTech, but the world itself is like nothing I've ever read before. The world has gone to seed in just about every way possible. Trees and animal life (except for humans and locusts) have died out. The only remaining food source is a genetically modified corn that the locusts cannot eat, which means the locusts have to settle for the only remaining dietary option: people. Man-eating bugs are pretty much my worst nightmare. There are also pirates, and a whole lot of other unscrupulous, cutthroat folks. In Rootless, characters really do suffer, and it's not all about the romance; people die in nasty ways, just as they should in a good post-apocalyptic.Banyan works as a tree builder. What's a tree builder?, you might ask. Well, since the trees are gone, the landscape's a tad empty. Rich folks will pay to have trees built on their landscape. Banyan, as his father taught him, crafts trees out of metal. This is a very strange concept, but one that puts such a stark mental image of this world into my head. His cast of characters is just as memorably strange as the trees built out of metal.As I mentioned previously, the world in Rootless is one in which countless things have gone wrong. Genetic modification of foodstuffs lead to stronger locusts, which lead to no trees. A lack of trees presents its own problems. The moon also came closer to the earth, which messed with the ocean. All of the non-human animals are gone. Everything that's left is controlled by a corporation, the only institution capable of making food without cannibalism. All of this was just way too much for me to process, and I spent a lot of time confused, trying to figure out why something happened and what repercussions it would have on society.From interviews I've seen, I'm sure Howard has done his research and put tons of thought into everything, but he lost me. Actually, I had a similar problem with The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi, which is beloved of many people who understand science much better than I do. To tell you the hard truth, I was at best a mid-B range student in high school science. I know just enough to get things really wrong and muddled. Readers with more science background or less inclined to puzzle over things endlessly will likely not have this issue. Also, since Rootless is told from a first person perspective, the world building will likely become more clear as Banyan learns more.Oh, one last thing, Howard is a HUGE Star Wars fan. It's all over his inspiration board on Pinterest, for example. His love of Star Wars really shines through. There are some very cleverly done references, which I, having been raised from a young age to be obsessed with the original trilogy (the only one that exists in my brain), loved. Watch out for those, Star Wars fans!I highly recommend Rootless to readers who enjoy harder science fiction with a focus on world building and storytelling. Fans of Paolo Bacigalupi and Star Wars should especially take note.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SQV2RV3H26X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545387892#wasThisHelpful","R1SQV2RV3H26X4","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just devoured this novel from the first page, which is set in a bookstore by the way (what's not to love?). The Talents are similar to some other stories I have read, most recently those in the Alcatraz Smedry series by Brandon Sanderson, although he did something quite different with them. It reminded me too, for reasons I cannot divulge, of Shanna Swendson's Enchanted, Inc. books, which are also completely fabulous. The writing is good, the characters are interesting and the plot draws you in and keeps you there.Tamsin was easy to relate to from the get-go. Most everyone has felt like an outsider at some point or had sibling issues (although not me, as I'm an only child) or wished desperately for some special talent. She has a bit of an edge to her, which I appreciate for the most part. She sneaks out to bars to drink beer and watch bands with her roommate Agatha. She's sarcastic with her family. In addition, she adapts well to all crisis situations, trying desperately to make things work out; even though she doesn't always succeed, it's awesome that she tries, rather than sitting idly by waiting for a savior.My one big complaint about Tamsin is the scene where she smokes a cigarette in her room. Blah blah rebellion blah blah badass. I really hate smoking, because, well, it's awful. However, what really bugs me about this scene is that it has so little bearing on the rest of the book. It seems so out of place. Tamsin never smokes again, nor does anyone else mention her doing so. I can't help wondering if she was a smoker originally and most of it got edited out. Either way, it struck me as clunky and gross.Gabriel was totally awesome. His talent (finding things) rocks. I seriously want one of him for my own, so he can keep me from having to turn my house upside down trying to locate my missing remote. (This happened this evening and the remote was, of course, in the first place I looked. Why I didn't see it, I don't know, but that's always how it goes.Once a Witch was such a fun read and I am eagerly anticipating starting the sequel. If you're looking for an awesome summer read, definitely pick this up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BV5A6XLFJD4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006J40MDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BV5A6XLFJD4Y","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mira Grant's Newsflesh trilogy is absolutely amazing. I love every single page of this series, and the box set is a great deal, one I will surely be gifting to friends, because, seriously, I cannot recommend this series enough.Yes, it's a zombie book and there's plenty of action and such to keep the pace moving. The Newsflesh Trilogy is also SO much more than that, a powerful commentary on politics and society.No author has surprised me like Mira Grant did in Feed. I never thought I could love Deadline as much as Feed, but I think I loved it more. The series even ends on a strong note.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QL8AQNYS34VN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031622507X#wasThisHelpful","R1QL8AQNYS34VN","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I need to state clearly for the record that this was a totally stellar read. It reminded me quite a bit of A Long, Long Sleep by Anna Sheehan, which I read and adored a couple months ago. The stories are not the same at all, but the general idea is. Both take a well-known fairy tale, put it into a futuristic setting, and make something completely new and original with it. Cinder is, in case you couldn't guess, a revisionist version of Cinderella.I loved how Meyer weaved in the core elements of the fairy tale, but felt free to make some changes too. For example, Cinder was adopted into a family by Linh Garan, who promptly died, leaving her in the care of her stepmother, rather than him being her father as in the original story. One of her stepsisters is evil, but the other one is actually her best friend. She attends the ball where Kai is to choose his bride, despite having been ordered not to go. All of that clearly draws the correlation to the fairy tale.Cinder is all about dramatic irony, or at least it was for me. The book ends with a big reveal. I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be a twist, or if the audience was supposed to be sitting there shaking the book all the way through because they knew what was going on and no one else did. I suspect it may be the latter, because what happened was so obvious. Really though, I don't think the knowledge of where the overall story was heading detracted from the book at all.The setting here is completely amazing. Earth has apparently been through some serious turmoil. It now contains only six countries. The formation of these large powers occurred during the peace conference following World War IV. Ouch. Not to mention the fact that there are now folks living on the moon. What I am not sure of is whether the Lunars were initially human, although I suspect so.Cinder is a powerful heroine. I love how much she is not run of the mill. She has expert skills as a mechanic, is over a quarter machine, and hardly cares about her appearance. She cares deeply about the few people (or androids) she's close to and will risk herself to protect them. Plus, having a crush on the prince does not turn her into a brainless puddle of goo, something that I see a lot when the heroine hangs out with the hero of her book.Book two promises to be even better. I have no idea where the story will go from here and cannot wait to find out! Recommended to all fans of science fiction and fairy tales.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJRFI2J9L512/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250007208#wasThisHelpful","R2FJRFI2J9L512","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because of my immense hatred for the term ""new adult,"" I really did not have any plans to read this, though I did put on my GR to-read shelf for what that's worth. However, Jenni of Alluring Reads read this very recently and praised it to the skies, which prompted a Twitter discussion. Both Jenni and Steph of Cuddlebuggery insisted that I should read this book, but, because of a recently instated book-buying ban, I doubted that would happen anytime soon. At the book club's white elephant party, I ""stole"" a gift that included the paperback of Easy. Let's just say that I will definitely listen when Jenni and Steph tell me to read things.First off, this writing in Easy was amazing across the board. I have no complaints about this book being so immensely popular. Webber knows what she's doing and I can only hope that having been picked up by Penguin will make all of her books easier to get a hold of for people like me who do not like to buy ebooks. In case the fact that this used to be self-published worries you, do not be worries, because this has been both well-written and well-edited. Oh, also, can I say how incredibly thrilled I am that the email and text conversations in this book did not involve any text speak?Initially, Jacqueline frustrated me. Her newly ex-boyfriend, Kennedy, was so obviously an awful human being. Their relationship reminds me in every way of that of Elle Woods and her high school boyfriend in the movie Legally Blonde. A handsome, preppy guy heading for a sleazy career (lawyer/politician) dumps his beautiful, devoted girlfriend so that he can sleep around in college. On the plus side, that's better than cheating, but I had no patience for Kennedy whatsoever and could not fathom why Jacqueline stayed with him.Thankfully, Jacqueline proves herself again and again. After the dumping, Jacqueline reverts to using her full name in place of the nickname ""Jackie"" that he gave her, a reference to the president he was named for and his wife (UGH, seriously, why did she not know he was awful before?). When he inevitably comes crawling back, Jacqueline's much more mature about it than I could ever be, remaining civil but consistent in her lack of interest. Heck yes, girl!As is pretty well known by this point, Easy begins with an attempted rape, and that is a main theme throughout the book. Another reason I struggled with Jacqueline as a heroine at first was that she did not report the guy. However, I know that's completely realistic behavior. Thankfully, with the help of her completely supportive BFF, Erin (who I totally loved btw), Jacqueline manages to take charge of herself, finding new mental and physical strength. I loved that. Also, though there's a depiction of the dark side of the Greek system on college campuses, Webber does not malign it entirely. She kept everything fair, and I appreciate that, even though I'm one heck of a GDI and want nothing to do with frat guys myself.Please, please, please do not judge the romance in this book off of the blurb. The whole bit about how ""He watched her, but never knew her"" sounds creepy as hell, and, seriously, Lucas is not like that. He was in her class, so he would watch her there, the way people do when they're bored during a lecture. Since she was cute and smart, he would take note if he saw her on campus. This is completely normal and non-stalkerish behavior, okay? Lucas is not that guy; he does nothing a normal college student wouldn't do in the course of an attraction.Obviously, I love Lucas or I would not feel the need to defend his honor thus. He's just a great guy. He does do a couple of questionable things, but, honestly, I'm glad about those because they made him real. Otherwise, he would have been in manicpixiedreamboy territory. He's got some darkness and makes stupid decisions sometimes, which is much better than if he were purely perfect. As with all the best heroes, he empowers Jacqueline, and helps her to be better in every way. Plus, he does not pressure for sex at all. Speaking of sex, wow. Webber can write a sizzling scene. Much as I love YA, I do get to missing a well done sex scene, and Easy definitely scratched that itch.In case you didn't figure this out by now, I ended up loving this book, so much so that I devoured it in a matter of hours. I only hope I can figure out how to get my hands on her Between the Lines series soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R305RIFLW9DYPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266745#wasThisHelpful","R305RIFLW9DYPC","A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DK7AQ0RSPXCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, let me say that this is really a fantastic, luxury toilet paper. It's 3-ply and comes in rolls of 176 sheets, which means that it's not great for septic systems. If you don't have to worry about that, this toilet paper is a treat... soft, absorbent, and very, very plush.This particular package of Quilted Northern is ""compressed core"" toilet paper. In essence, the company slightly squished the rolls when packaging to produce a product that takes up less space. This doesn't alter the useability of the product - toilet paper is toilet paper - but it does result in a substantial reduction in the size of the package, which means that substantially fewer trucks will be needed to get this stuff to the store. I recently read an article about how seemingly tiny changes in energy consumption by large corporations can result in huge overall energy savings, and I applaud Quilted Northern management for making the effort to be more environmentally friendly. Overall, this is a great toilet paper from a forward-thinking company, and I definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YW3WOP8VIHLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144VRB8E#wasThisHelpful","R1YW3WOP8VIHLM","AGHIUO1B3IF8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGHIUO1B3IF8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my 8 year-old who loves dolls and stuffed animals, and I find it to be a decent but fairly basic, no-frills baby carrier. It's pretty, and comes with a really nice padded fabric seat for the baby, which I like, but the straps that allow it to be worn are just okay. They're thin nylon, and slide over the child's shoulders like a backpack with no padding or reinforcement. It's easy to get off and on, but it's not exactly comfortable to wear for long periods of time.My daughter has tried this carrier with several different dolls, including her 12"" Corolle baby and a larger sized Baby Alive doll, as well as with her Build-a-Bear animals, and it works fine with all of them for short periods of play, which is all she requires. Overall, this is a good pretend baby carrier for the price, and I think most little girls would like it just fine. For dedicated baby wearers willing to spend a bit more, however, I'd recommend a Boba Mini Carrier, a higher-quality toy baby carrier made by a company that makes real baby carriers too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33LF2UIPJQYR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T68QBSW#wasThisHelpful","R33LF2UIPJQYR7","AGHIUO1B3IF8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGHIUO1B3IF8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these jeans for my husband and he's been wearing them quite a bit. The waist has an inner elastic waistband all the way around, which he finds to make them a little more stretchy and comfortable around the waist than your average pair of jeans. Style-wise, the hips and thighs of these jeans are fairly slim-fitting, while the calves and ankles are cut a bit more generously. It's not what I'd typically call a ""relaxed fit"", but my husband still finds them very comfortable.As far as quality goes, these jeans are just what I'd expect from Wrangler... sturdy and well-made, and they've held up great in the wash.

"This waterproof pad is double-sided with a moisture barrier in the center, and flat rather than fitted. It's exactly the size of my daughter's mattress, so it covers the bed from edge to edge. I've always had a wrap-around, fitted mattress pad on her bed, which works really well but is a bit of a pain to get off and on the mattress, especially in the middle of the night. I was hoping this pad would be a bit more convenient and work just as well, but it doesn't.First of all, because this pad isn't attached to the mattress in any way, it tends to bunch up a bit. There's always a lump or a crease somewhere in the bed. My daughter doesn't have any Princess and the Pea-like tendencies, so it doesn't really bother her. A child with sensory issues, however, like my son - who notices every little rough seam or itchy tag - would never be able to sleep on top of this mattress pad.The other major problem with this pad is that it hasn't proven to be really, truly waterproof. The moisture barrier itself doesn't leak, but because the pad is two-sided, any wetness near the edge of the pad wicks right around to the bottom. It might be fine in cases where it's going to be changed just as soon as it gets wet, but for us, overall, this product just really didn't do the job.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4KWROBLVRH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058MITP8#wasThisHelpful","R2C4KWROBLVRH2","AGHIUO1B3IF8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGHIUO1B3IF8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Hoover SteamVac carpet cleaner, which I love, but I never use Hoover's own cleaning solution in it because I absolutely detest its scent. This Oxy Pro cleaning solution from Rug Doctor worked great in my SteamVac. The bottle recommended using 1.5 to 3 ounces of solution per gallon of water. I went with the lower amount - at which rate this bottle can make more than 40 gallons of finished cleaner - and my carpets came out nice and clean. For the price, this is definitely a very effective cleaning solution.As far as the scent goes, this solution doesn't actually have much of one. The concentrated form is noticeably scented, but when I was actually using it in the cleaner, I could just barely smell it, and by the time the floors were dry, I couldn't smell it at all. So, while I would definitely recommend this for anyone who hates heavy perfume, I'd guess it's probably less than ideal for those trying to cover up noticeable pet odors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQPTYG89UWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB8NA14#wasThisHelpful","R1KQPTYG89UWD","AGHIUO1B3IF8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGHIUO1B3IF8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm old enough to remember many, many years ago when Charmin first replaced their regular 2-ply Charmin toilet paper with Charmin Basic. I hated it! That was a long time ago, however, and these days Charmin Basic is much better than it used to be. It's fluffy, not at all scratchy, and absorbent enough to get the job done. Personally, I still prefer 2-ply toilet paper, but now that I have a houseful of kids I find that 1-ply does have its value... we have a lot fewer clogged toilets and I don't hear calls of ""Mom, I'm out of toilet paper"" nearly as often.In the past, I've found prices for Amazon Grocery items to vary quite a bit... sometimes they're a bargain, while at other times they are way over-priced.

"I have been using Avery labels for many years. They aren't inexpensive, but I'd rather pay more for a quality product than waste my time dealing with the printer jams, smeared ink, wrinkles, and peeling edges that come with using cheap generic labels. These full-sheet labels are thick enough that they don't wrinkle and work great in my laser printer. They have an indented edge all the way around so that they're easy to peel, even if you cut them in half or quarters, and they go on with no wrinkles.If you use new shipping boxes or envelopes, these labels are perfect and I highly recommend them. If you reuse old shipping boxes, however, these particular labels aren't quite thick enough to fully cover up old labels, logos, or black markers.

"I only drink a cup or two of coffee per day, so I have a 4-cup coffeemaker for the days when it's just me, and a 10-cup for when company comes. It's a pain switching between the two, so I was excited to try this thermal pot, which can hold up to 12 cups but also has a 2-4 cup brewing strength setting designed to make the perfect small pot of coffee.Anyway, I've had this coffeemaker for more than a month, and l'd definitely recommend it if you need the 12-cup capacity. It's got a nice, large reservoir that's easy to fill, and the removable filter basket makes it easy to load and easy to clean. The set-ahead timer feature is simple to set, and the adjustable strength settings do a fair job of helping you make the coffee as strong or as weak as you want it. And, as long as you're making a full pot, the thermal pot works great... the coffee comes out piping hot and stays hot for a good couple of hours.Though this pot does a good job for large pots of coffee, it doesn't do nearly as well for tiny ones. Compared to my old 4-cup Mr. Coffee pot, the 2-4 cup setting on this pot simply makes a much weaker brew. I have to use an extra tablespoon or two of grounds with this pot to get the coffee to the right strength. Worse yet,  the thermal pot just can't keep a little pot of coffee hot at all... just five minutes after it's made, it's already reached the point where it comes out cold enough that I end up wanting to stick it in the microwave.

"These pads are soft, absorbent, and very, very thick... not the kind of pad I prefer during the day, but fantastic for overnight!

"My 8 year-old daughter is a huge Lego Friends fan and got this as a late Christmas present. It's fantastic! I was extremely nervous that the hot-air balloon was going to be one of those delicate, ""for display only"" kind of Lego creations,  but it's not at all. It's very sturdy, with everything clipping on in multiple places and reinforced with hidden Technic pieces inside. Nothing falls off! I'm very impressed.In addition to the balloon, this set also includes two figures, Andrea and Noah, and pieces to build a little nature area with a waterfall, a red and white-checked picnic blanket with food, and a cute little campfire complete with toasted marshmallows. My daughter loves having her Friends figures fly in the balloon from her little Lego city to the jungle and back!

"I have bushes and trees right outside my kitchen window, so it's hard to put a bird feeder in a critter-safe spot. Raccoons are my main problem... they love to shake, knock over, and dump anything they find. This feeder seems to have stumped them! I have it hanging from a 6-foot shepherd's hook, and though I'm sure they can reach and shake it from the bushes, they can't seem to get enough out of it to make it worth their while.The holes at the bottom of the feeder are designed very well... easy enough for the birds to reach in and pick out, but not at all open to the elements or prone to spill out.

This 120-count bottle lasts twice as long. The flavor choices of mixed berry, raspberry, and pineapple sound a little odd to me, but the kids seem to like them just fine, and the bonus, from my perspective, is that these are colored with vegetable juices rather than unnecessary food dyes.Prices for Amazon grocery items vary greatly... sometimes they are a wonderful deal and other times they are way overpriced. Currently, the price for this bottle is about the same as the regular price at the grocery, but definitely not as good as when they go on sale buy one, get one free.

"I have a 19 year-old Kenmore vacuum that's still going strong as ever, and though I love it to death, there's no way I'm driving all the way to Sears to buy replacement bags. I've ordered several different kinds of generic bags online over the years, and though they've all worked, none have worked quite as well as the original Kenmore bags. I was hopeful that these would be better, but so far my feelings about them are a bit mixed. On the plus side, they fit my vacuum well and do a fantastic job of trapping dirt and odors inside... absolutely no smell or escaped bits of dust flying through the air. On the minus side, my vacuum makes a very loud, strange, hissing sound with these bags, one that I've never heard before, and that makes me paranoid that they might be restricting air flow to the point of putting extra strain on the motor. I really want to like these bags, since they work well and are reasonably priced. But that hissing sound?

I almost always wear an XS, but I decided to order up to a medium in this cami based on all the other reviews... and it's still too small! Though I'm actually pleased with the way this cami fits around my waist - it's tight enough to be slimming but not unbearable - it is just way, way too tight around the chest, even though I'm only a 32B.

"This is a very nice cookbook with all the recipes you'd expect to find in an Italian cookbook, including appetizers, salad, meat and seafood, side dishes and desserts, and of course, lots and lots of pasta. Recipes are sized big - 6 to 8 restaurant portions, which at my table easily feeds 10 to 12 - and generally simple to make but expectedly time-consuming. Though I got this cookbook primarily for the pasta recipes, I actually ended up liking the salad portion of the cookbook best... it has many wonderful green salads and dressings, as well as an amazing bean salad and an olive salad that I'm dying to make as soon as I can find all the ingredients.Overall, this is a very well-done, comprehensive Italian cookbook.

"I have four cats, all 10+ years old, so we've tried lots of different cat foods over the years. Three of our four cats will eat just about anything, but the fourth is pretty picky... enough so that we end up feeding him canned food more often than not. It's not that easy to feed canned food to just one out of four cats, so I was really hoping that a high-quality food like Nutrience Original might be good enough to tempt Mr. Picky's taste buds and become the perfect feeding solution for the whole cat family. Unfortunately, not only would he not eat it, but one of the cats who usually eats almost anything wouldn't eat it either. So, though I'm really impressed with the Nutrience concept and I'm sure this is a great pet food in general, this particular formula just isn't for us.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZSZ6T1ZTDG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDZTGMM#wasThisHelpful","R14ZSZ6T1ZTDG6","AGHIUO1B3IF8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGHIUO1B3IF8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have four cats, and one of the four has problems with throwing up almost every kind of cat food we've tried. For the past year or so, we've been feeding her Purina One Sensitive Systems, which she tolerates better than other foods but still throws up once every 2nd or 3rd day. Needless to say, we were willing to try something new.Overall, I was really impressed with the quality of Nutrience's Grain Free cat food, and the fact that the ingredients are US-sourced is definitely a plus, too. As for the cats, all four absolutely love it - even the pickiest one, who often gets canned food instead - and the one with a touchy stomach seems to be tolerating it at least as well as the Sensitive Systems. Definitely recommended for picky eaters as well as cats with other dietary concerns!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ADKIZZTKHDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDZTVXG#wasThisHelpful","R34ADKIZZTKHDX","AGHIUO1B3IF8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGHIUO1B3IF8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's very sturdy and really opens up nicely so that it's easy to skim through and pull out what I'm looking for. The lid is a bit problematic... though it latches shut very nicely, there's no good way to hold it open, so it tends to get in the way when I want to access the files inside. That's not a huge flaw, but would definitely be an irritation if I were using this on a daily basis.The capacity of this file is not tremendous - the bottom expands to just over an inch - so it's great for holding a couple hundred pieces of loose paper, but nothing more than that.

I'm so glad I did... it's wonderful!This set builds a little vampire castle, and includes vampire and human minifigures. The design is very cute, the instructions are detailed and clear, and the bricks themselves are made of a high-quality plastic - reasonably comparable to modern Lego. Even better, the set includes sound effects, and a cool vibration-based motion technology that makes it extra fun to play with once it's built.

When I saw these boxes, marketed as legal sized, I assumed they'd be just enough wider than the regular letter sized boxes to accommodate 14-inch long files instead of 11-inch long ones. Instead, they're fully twice as large as the regular sized boxes, simply too large to be filled solid with paper and still be portable.I'm not able to use these boxes as I'd originally intended, but they're still fantastic, so I've got them storing clothes instead of files.

"I needed a pencil sharpener for work, and I loved the idea of the USB plug on this one since my cubicle has a computer but no open electrical outlets. Overall, I'm pretty pleased. This sharpener has a good, steady motor, and sharpens pencils pretty well under USB power. The shaving receptacle is generously sized, and is easy and mess-free to empty, and the retractable cord makes it simple and tidy to stow away in my desk when not in use.Though I use this sharpener mostly under USB power, I've also tried it under battery power and plugged in to a wall outlet using a USB wall charger, and in comparison, the motor is definitely stronger when plugged into the wall than when plugged into a computer. Bottom line? If you have continuous access to a wall outlet, a standard wall powered sharpener is probably still your best bet, but if you're looking for an alternatively powered sharpener, this is a good one that gets the job done under any kind of power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2458BUU49WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL55JQM#wasThisHelpful","RS2458BUU49WU","AGHIUO1B3IF8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGHIUO1B3IF8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ms. Kondo has written a charming autobiography of her own obsession with tidying up, and then put what she has learned into a useful guide. I finished reading it last night and plan to follow her instructions as best I can.  I gave the book four stars because 1) I have not yet put it into practice; 2) she repeats herself over and over as though she believes what she says will not sink in unless read 100 times in the same words; 3) she never once suggests that people try on the clothes they have decided to keep or discard. It makes me wonder if the Japanese are so slim and petite throughout their adult lives that their clothing sizes never change. I wish that were true for me, but I think tidying up is going to take me a little longer since I will have to try on my clothes; and, 4) only twice in the book does she mention the word ""donate"".  She talks about the mistake of trying to hand off clothes to family members, unless they really want them, but she never encourages donating clothes to organizations that help people through disasters.  It makes me wonder if this is not part of the Japanese culture.  All those hundreds of ""garbage bags"" of clothes that she helps people ""discard"" could help people that really need them.

"I am so impressed with this Byer EasyCot.  I've searched and searched through everything from air mattresses to futons to cots, and I've finally found what I was looking for!  This cot is amazing.  You take it out of the sleeve, open up the legs, turn it upright and that's it! It is so comfortable, so long and wide, that I even found I could turn on my stomach and sleep with my arms spread out.  All this without any additional foam. I like the feel of the fabric and the tension is perfect for my back.  One note for the first time you open it: I kept waiting for the legs to ""click"" into place so I could be sure they were in the proper position.  They don't do that.  You have to make sure the hinges are positioned properly since they don't really lock together.  I realized that after a couple minutes and finally got both ends secure at the same time.  It would be easier to do with two people, but you don't need two.  I'm only 5' 4 1/2"" and not particularly strong, and I did it myself.  I can also carry it alone.  The sleeve it comes with has a large strap on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGM8G735C9MVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A16KAQM#wasThisHelpful","RGM8G735C9MVW","AA0YPCLUF78B4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA0YPCLUF78B4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautiful white/off white tai chi outfit that fits perfectly.  But it is not real silk.  It is a shiny soft polyester.  That said, the outfit is well made.

"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. I feel as though I am walking on a soft, squishy yoga mat.  They fit almost perfectly.  I wanted to wear them inside the house, as I take off my everyday shoes at the front door.  My chiropractor recommended walking inside the house in something more supportive than bare feet or flat slippers. I don't think they have particularly good arch support, but the rest of the shoe feels very supportive and comfortable.  The back heel area seems a bit loose, but the length of the shoe is perfect, as my front toes are within half an inch of the front.  Anything smaller would be too short.  I tried them on with tennis socks and they fit perfectly as well.  So far so good.  I would buy another pair in a heartbeat, but I think I will wait a month to see how they wear. Update: I just bought two more pairs! They are so comfortable, both inside and outside the house, that I don't want to wear anything else. They even look nice with skirts and dresses.

"I live in North Texas, and our blistering, ungodly sun makes me a fan of any solar product.  I look upon the yards of little old ladies with green eyed envy-their kitschy garden lights twinkling mere inches from my finger tips.  How can you not love something that runs, for free, off sunshine?--the odd battery swap out aside.  Choosing to feed my unhealthy obsession, I decided to add a fountain feature to help keep mosquito's out of my birdbath-West Nile and all.I looked around at several items in 20ish dollar price point, and decided to give this product a go.  I expected, per the reviews, for it to give me only a few hours of full pumping with several hours of dedicated and insincere spitteling.  Keeping your expectations low, rarely leads to disappointment in life, and proved wise concerning this purchase.I have my pump's solar panel on the outside rail of a 2nd story, west facing apartment.  Around 8am the shadows from the tree and building move aside enough, the water begins to gurgle and sputter about like a pidgin having a heart attack.  By about 10:30 that pidgin has developed epilepsy on top of its cardiovascular condition and around 1pm the water spurts forth like a roman candle with nothing to loose.  It continues to gush with its wet-moistness  until about 5pm, when it sputters around like a tweaker who can't find their shoe and is completely off around 6-6:30 pm.I had to cut a hole in the center of one of the nozzles to keep the stream from flying out of my pot.  With full Texas sun it shoots about 6 inches.  It's like mama said, ""Why bother adjusting for 6 when 4 will do.""  Good advice when considering second husband and adjusting the nozzles on fountains.If I lived in a cloudier climate, and not three inches from the sunny bunghole of Satan, I would be probably be disappointed with this product.  As is, I live in the sweltering home of the deep fried heatstroke, and find this product serving my purposes well enough.  Some day I want to save up for one of them fancy pumps with the a/c or battery backup but for now I will just appreciate the daytime quirkiness of my buy and pat myself on the back for saving money.Update:I ordered this in summer of 2013, as of Feb 2015 it is still running great!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ATD8KEVJ4XYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ACGMSBG#wasThisHelpful","R3ATD8KEVJ4XYT","A2PWMBT2BK15NA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWMBT2BK15NA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you look at my book purchases on Amazon you'll soon realize I don't read much outside of Comics and Hard Sci-fi, but Renea's book was a delightful exception. I wanted something smutty with a bit of a mythology/paranormal bend and was richly rewarded.Now like most Texans I like my salsa to burn coming and going...so when it comes to Paranormal Romance I'm much the same way. I want it to sizzle when I read it and think about it later, and this book delivered. What I didn't expect was to like the main character so much. Linden is sarcastic, funny and likable in a way a lot of romance stories try for and fail. You believe she is capable at her job and relate to what she goes through the same way you relate to the movie Office Space.Her romance with the studly and godly Cyril doesn't feel contrived and while Cyril is metaphysical he isn't annoyingly perfect. In fact, he's quite the A-hole at the start of the book. Epicly hot, lovable, A-hole...who ends up growing on you as you find out who he is and why he is keeping Linden at arms length. So at the end he's not an A-hole, or the baby boy she ""changed,"" he was just protecting himself..make sense?

"I just picked this up from my neighborhood Kroger and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise.  I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate, but have been eating low carb for medical reasons.  I've been doing great on my diet and craved a little chocolate so I looked at the organic isle hoping to get something with less junk in it.1/3 of this bar has 11g carbohydrates and 2g fiber and 8g sugar.  Most dark chocolate candy bar's chime in at least 18-19g carbs for 1/3 a bar and plenty are 21 to 30 (depending on the kind of chocolate.  So for a reasonably proportioned splurge this is a great treat.  Even better for people who have type 2 diabetes, or a thyroid problem, who need to really watch out for how much sugar they are having.The flavor is a mellow dark chocolate.  It has a bit of that bitter kick which most dark chocolate has (and why I don't normally have it) but with this bar it's pretty rich, and the coconut gives the illusion of sweetness I want from milk chocolate.  I also really like coconut, so bonus.  If you don't like coconut, you probably won't enjoy this bar, but if you do, give it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OP2RU6KSDRUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096MVD5O#wasThisHelpful","R1OP2RU6KSDRUN","A2PWMBT2BK15NA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PWMBT2BK15NA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this to replace my starter that went off after storing for 6 months without feedings and needed to be replaced. This version has a much sweeter taste than the dried version by Breadtopia. Also, it was ready to bake with after only 48 hours of feeding. If you want to start sourdough right away, this is an excellent choice. I am very, very happy with my first bakes with this.My only concern is that it seems susceptible to that orange bacterial infection, do definitely keep a backup of some fed discards in the freezer. (Instead of throwing out your discard, separate it and feed it as if making another culture. Then, straight to the freezer as a backup. I like to keep several backups.)Lastly, if you want a very sour flavor, keep your starter wetter / more hydrated (like thin pancake batter), or replace 10-20% of the flour in your recipe with whole rye flour, as this will give it a very sour SF-style flavor.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O83E6812UHC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C0E5VG#wasThisHelpful","R2O83E6812UHC7","A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The flavor was truly terrible, and it caused a great deal of nausea from drinking this cup. I wanted to try white-roast coffee because it doesn't need sugar, but it did not agree with me at all. Now I can't even give this stuff away to friend, they are put off by the smell and won't even try it. The aroma is really difficult to describe, but the flavor is like a weak tea made from ground cashews, and the color is like that of white tea.

"This helps so much with fighting viruses. I can't tell if it helps with colds or not, but anything in the herpes family, it helps a lot. I can't have nuts or the CMV (cytomegalovirus, similar to mono) comes back, but if I counter-balance with this lysine, I'm fine.It also has helped in treating shingles, which is unbelievably painful, and in preventing outbreaks. Someone gave me biscotti with only a few walnuts in it, and boom, shingles starting. Since using these with ANY arginine-rich foods, I've been able to avoid getting any more.If anyone else is looking for shingles help, or anything in the herpes family, here is what has helped me the very most:1. Lysine to compensate for arginine in foods. I use this brand and it's perfect.2. Durham's bee propolis supplement 3 times a day during an outbreak (but only if you're not allergic to bee stings). Or the queens delight, which contains propolis.3. Vitamin C (I use this same brand in 1,000mg time release tablets) combined with green or black tea. Vitamin C on its own does not help. Tea on its own may or may not help. But when you combine the two, they help a LOT. If you feel the tingling of an outbreak looming, if you do enough tea & C quickly enough, the lesion will never even form!4. Durham's ""wonder salve"" stops lesions from spreading and reduces pain and itching on existing lesions.5. Vitamin C serum - yes the same kind people use for wrinkles and anti aging - apply this directly to the lesion. I may stop using the wonder salve, as the vitamin C serum seems to work faster. I had an especially stubborn lesion on my ankle that was not responding to the propolis salve (""wonder salve""), so on a whim, I tried the vitamin C serum I normally use on my face to prevent wrinkles. That stubborn lesion/scar had been itching and burning for weeks after the lesion appeared healed. The C serum cleared it the rest of the way in a few days.I hope this information helps someone else. This particular product (Now Foods Lysine) and their time-released vitamin C are invaluable tools in my Arsenal to fight any viruses in the herpes family, all of which stay with you for life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2O8HBETLY7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OQLIW#wasThisHelpful","R3B2O8HBETLY7R","A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really hate this cover. It came with three in the box, and 3/3 have been less than satisfactory. The first one, I couldn't get it to install correctly. There was no solution for a wet install, and I couldn't find the bottle from before. The second one, when I pulled off tab 2, it took the shield off with it instead of removing the mask layer. The third one got the tiniest specks of dust, and since it was a dry instal, those specks are now big ugly bubbles that won't come out.This shield also gets that greasy rainbow look so easily. Even with freshly washed hands, the surface becomes messed up enough that in only 5 minutes of use, it becomes difficult to read the text because of smudges. I'm wiping the thing down literally every 5 minutes.I used ArmorSuit for my last device. It wasn't perfect, but it was 1,000x better than this. I'm going back to that brand, because these are just awful.UPDATE: After 2 months of use, tolerating the bubbles, this shield caused my iPod to stop responding when I try to type the letters i, u, o, and p. There was no bubble in this area. It just couldn't detect my finger touch. I got so mad I finally took the screen cover off and threw it in the trash, and now the entire screen works.

"I ordered this camera maybe 6 months ago, which was the previous version R1, and then switched to the current version, which is the R1-Pro that's replaced the old model in the same listing. I liked the older version because it took extremely good video for my purposes. Even going 75mph down the interstate, when I reviewed the footage, I was able to clearly read mile marker signs and license plates. Much like our own vision, the edges of the far peripheral vision were not as clear, but they were still far better than I expected at high speeds. Driving around town it sees pretty well across the entire 170.My biggest problem with the old version was that the buttons and interface were somewhat hard to operate. I had to take it down and fiddle with it to do anything at all. The buttons just weren't user friendly. Thankfully, this has been fixed in the new model.The R1-Pro model that's listed now, I like much better. It has a number of improvements, three of which are really important to me.1) The video resolution is higher in the new model. I haven't tested it at high speeds yet, but around town so far it's great. This lens sees better than I do.2) The user interface is less clunky, and a bit more intuitive.3) They added a panic button. If something happens, you activate the panic state and it will lock the current file as protected, so it doesn't get recorded over when it loops around, just the same as if you've had it detect an accident.I need to fiddle with the parking and motion detection features. I turned motion detection OFF in the old one, because there was a delay, for example, when starting to move again after waiting at a stoplight. Motion detection I don't recommend. Parking protection I do recommend.Last thought - if it doesn't like your SD card at first, try using the device to format the card. It wouldn't accept one of my memory cards until it was formatted. Now I also like to carry a spare SD card in my purse. That way if there's a longer stretch I want to preserve (like on a two hour trip), I can swap the card out and deal with it later.Overall, I do recommend this if you've never had a dash camera before. It's a really good value for the price, it's easy to use and pretty much fool-proof, and the company's customer service people (at Vantrue) have been extremely patient with me bugging them with questions every two days. They really are very responsive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IM21Y5UER11M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA29I2E#wasThisHelpful","R3IM21Y5UER11M","A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm disgusted that I spent $30 on this thing, yet am unable to form a single cookie. I have made zillions of spritz cookies in my lifetime, but all with an old 70's plug-in electric press and my grandmother's recipe. I can't find the recipe. My sister can't find the recipe. My mom can't find the recipe. My grandma passed away 5 years ago. I tried the recipe that came with the press (the basic butter cookie version), and it just didn't work at all. I tried the plain ungreased pan, parchment paper, silpat, and foil. NONE of them worked. All you can do is peel the cookies off the press with your fingers, which distorts the shape and defeats the purpose of using the press at all. I am thoroughly disgusted.The product is sturdy and well-made.The barrel is easy to load and clean.The mechanism puts out an even amount of dough each time.BUT THE COOKIES WON'T STICK TO THE PAN FOR ANYTHING.If anyone has had any success with this press using a different recipe, please please please comment and let me know. I need my Gramma's recipe, and it's just gone. I've looked at dozens of recipes online and tried different variations, but nothing works.The press puts out the correct amount as what I was used to using the old electric trigger style. That was the amount we were always going for, so I am not sure how the press could be the problem, but the manufacturer claims that the recipes included are tried and true.

"I get horrible shaving bumps in the summer, and this year they even came from waxing! I've tried every remedy of salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and witch hazel.

Shaving or waxing, just cleanse the area after and apply this. I do a few spritzes, then rub it in really well with my fingers.Note: it smells rather terrible, but that's a small price to pay for something that finally provided relief.

"I'm really happy with this tumbler, as it lives up to the promises. The borosilicate glass allows strength without adding weight, and the double wall keeps hot coffee hot for about an hour, and it gets to lukewarm in about 2-3 hours depending on how full the cup is. I haven't timed it with cold drinks yet, though it does succeed in not forming condensation on the outside. It did form condensation within the double walls, which I did not expect, but I guess that's ok. The one thing I would change is to create a vacuum inside between the two glass layers.The silicone lid is a standard size, so if you have old lids from other to-go coffee mugs, they will fit this too, which is nice. I'm NOT a fan of the taste of silicone, so I use a narrow coffee straw. One more idea for the manufacturer would be to create a lid with a silicone seal where it connects, but borosilicate double-wall glass for the top where your lips touch to drink. That would be AMAZING.Considering the quality, utility, and the price, I'd say this tumbler is an excellent value, especially if you want something to double for both hot and cold use.

"These are an okay substitute for the Beauty Blender. You can use the same techniques, and it does need to be wet first.Limitations:Not as soft and squishy as the BB.Texture not as smooth as BB.Harder to squeeze water out than BB.Absorbs more product than BB.So these are good if you're on a budget, but they are not close enough to the real Beauty Blender to call a perfect dupe.HOWEVER, these are great to learn on and practice with before investing in the real deal. Also, the real Beauty Blender is MUCH less expensive when purchased here on Amazon. Instead of $30 for one, sometimes there are pairs for $22-$25 on here.

"I saw this in a movie of all places, and decided to try it. Now I use it every day and don't know how I ever lived without it! Because it is oil-free but non-drying, it is suitable for all skin types.Pros:Controls acne without drying the skin.Light scent of cucumber and green tea.Soothes redness.Really does prevent acne if used daily.Cons:If you don't like scent, you might not like it.

"I use this for highlighting cheekbones, above brow arch, and at the center of each eyelid. It works beautifully. I find it's best applied with two fingers, or a very soft blush brush.

"My lips are constantly dry, chapped, and peeling during the frigid, dry winters where I live. As a result, even the creamiest lipsticks show off the horrible cracks in my lips.Colorburst Lip Butter to the rescue!I love this product and have collected nearly every shade. It acts like a balm, nourishing and hydrating the lips, but with color that doesn't catch on the cracks and dry areas! There's no smell or taste, except a hint of Shea butter. Also, if used over a Chapstick or other conditioner, the medium color lasts for several hours. You don't need a mirror to apply, and it doesn't get on my teeth or smear.I recommend going to the product website to see the color swatches and choose the shades you like, then coming back here to check the prices.

"I ordered 4 of these pencils through Amazon, and two of them arrived damaged during shipping, with all the color rubbed off the end. When I tried to see if they were salvageable by sharpening, I learned that they are impossible to sharpen, even though they are made for it. The wood peels away just like a pencil, but the colors are so creamy that they just jam up in the sharpener, leaving you with an empty top when you pull it out of the sharpener.Pros:Very pigmented color.Extremely creamy texture.Cons:Very fragile.Can't be sharpened due to creamy texture.I did also try Nyx's mechanical pencil (a twist up version) in Silky Cashmere, and it is phenomenal. Long lasting, waterproof, no irritation on the waterline.I love Nyx products, but the Slide On Pencil was an abject fail. Try the Mechanical Pencil instead.

"After doing a great deal of research into what would be best to help my early fine lines around my eyes, I knew I needed hyaluronic acid, peptides, and retinol. I also knew I wanted NO parabens.I absolutely adore this product. It soaks into the skin quickly, and the best part is that the HA helps whatever product you use right after it to be pulled into the skin as well.I ordered this to use as a daytime treatment for around my eyes only, but now I use it morning and night on all of my face, and even on my hands! In the morning, it goes all over my face followed by a gel moisturizer by garnier. At night, it goes around my eyes, followed by Watts Beauty retinol serum, and on the backs of my hands, followed by a cocoa butter moisturizing cream.It's too early to tell how it will affect my eyes, but based on research and the ingredients, I'm certain the combination will help. On my hands, however, I noticed a difference within just a few days! Normal moisturizing with heavy emollients is not enough in our cold, dry Montana winters, but by using this HA serum followed by the emollient cream, my hands are happy and youthful again!Don't be afraid to later your products!! This can be used by itself, but it's excellent for pulling other products down I to deeper layers of the skin.Highly recommended.For the record, I purchased from Direct 2u Wholesale, and was very happy with their service.

"This first college edition textbook for Intermediate Microeconomics is good, I give it that. It does a decent job in taking a topic that is mind-numbingly confusing and making it marginally understandable.However, it's only slightly better than Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach (Eighth Edition) by Hal R. Varian, who also does as good a job as can be expected of explaining the same mind-numbing material. This title only wins the ""slightly better"" endorsement because of the prettier graphics and more frequent side-notes. However, the concepts are EXACTLY the same, only slightly differing examples with fewer pictures in the Varian version.Considering the astronomical difference in price, this sparkly new title just isn't worth it. How are students supposed to afford this? Unless your professor makes this title absolutely mandatory, I say go with the Varian book instead.

"Ok, let me start by saying this this IS going to be painful, especially the first time. However, it is very akin to waxing in terms of pain, only you have complete control and can kind of ease into it. The first pass is the worst; grit your teeth and get through it, and as you go, this skin becomes desensitized and it dulls to little tugging pricks.I found it most effective to go in the correct direction (as shown in the manual) first, but then come back and hold the device in the opposite direction to catch all the stubborn hairs that were lying too flat. This works because then the barrel is brushing the opposite direction, lifting the hairs and allowing them to snag and be pulled. I also found that the manual's claim that moving in small circles is more comfortable to be true.The device did not clog up with hairs, but you have to stop and brush the hairs off periodically, as it spits the pulled hairs out the back towards your feet as you move from ankle upward. I had no trouble with bikini area. It is supposed to hurt more, but maybe I had just gotten so used to it by the time I got that far up the leg.Finally, the ideal length of the hairs stated in the manual is true! You only need 0.5-2.0mm. I found that in the areas where I had shaved and were the correct length, the epilator was MUCH more effective, pulling most of the hairs in only one or two passes. The longer areas (1/2-3/4"") were much more difficult. So for best results, I would recommend shaving 1 week prior to use, so that the hairs will all be the most ideal length.Overall, one of the best purchases I've ever made! For less than half the cost of a single waxing at a salon, you can do it at home, and do it over and over! If you hate shaving or struggle with ingrowns, this epilator is more than worth the investment! Like with waxing, it will be less painful each time. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's SO worth it!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB41MBT8RGFQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OUYX66#wasThisHelpful","RB41MBT8RGFQD","A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3S6TH7OGNG7PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I take these for what's in them, and I started them a month before my knee surgery where they had to saw off and bolt down a section of my shin. It's major bone breakage, and I had a hard time after getting the first one done, so wanted to be more nutritionally prepared this time around.I'm 1 month post-op, and my knee/leg is healing WAY ahead of schedule, and I was able to get off painkillers entirely after only two weeks. I feel the addition of this supplement really did help with my bone and other healing.The only drawback is that these are REALLY hard to take. They upset my stomach something terrible, causing an hour or more of nausea every time. I actually ended up vomiting every time I tried to take them on a light or empty stomach, or before eating. After taking them with my biggest meal of the day did not solve the problem, I have begun taking this right before bed.

The author made me care about her and want her to be able to have what she wants. Additionally, the island played such an integral role, it was almost as though it was a character in its own right. This is a must read book and I loved it so much that I have added the author to my must read authors' list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGOONYZB7JR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RJHWKO#wasThisHelpful","R3UGOONYZB7JR4","A26KWG162U8VBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26KWG162U8VBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really loved this book - very sexy romantic suspense. I really enjoyed the interplay between Blake and Hadley. Hadley is a country music star whose life is threatened. Blake is tasked, against his will, with keeping her safe. What follows leads to romance and a horrific crime. This book kept me engaged until the very last page.

"Once again, the author has outdone herself in this delightful historical romance. Hannah is learned woman in the Scotland of long ago, when women of the gentry were expected to be meek and mild and, most definitely not educated. Despite feeling very plain, she has numerous bids for her hand in marriage (and her dowry). Alexander is delighted when she accepts his bid, but is flummoxed by her behavior and insistence at being included in running the keep. These two strangers, though legally wed, must find a way to work together to stop an untenable horror from destroying all that they hold dear.The author has created characters with depth that you can't help but fall in love with. Add in a horrific problem and the author's masterful storytelling style, and you have an exceptional book. If you love historical romance, you will love this book. And if you don't, this book just might change your mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCWM5KJZY42E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDRJ8JU#wasThisHelpful","R1SCWM5KJZY42E","A26KWG162U8VBQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26KWG162U8VBQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just love this series - it has it all - a mystery with lots of ghosts and a hint of romance. Add in a great story, and you've got a wonderful book. Verity can see ghosts, well, mostly one ghost, Frankie, but he helps her see other ghosts. Ellis, her former fiance's brother, can't see them, but believes her and has experienced a poltergeist with her. Ellis is also a cop and helps Verity try to solve a murder.

"I loved this book so much that I was sorry when it ended. It grabbed me from the first page and kept me turning pages late into the night because I couldn't put it down.Mia is a quirky geek IT girl. While brilliant, she has a very limited ability to interact with other people, especially men. So when the new head of security, Jake, arrives, she is at a loss as to how to talk to him. Add security problems at her job that keeps him in her orbit, and many funny interactions follow. Throw a murder into the mix and Mia seems to be in over her head.This is a funny and smart chick lit mystery. I love having a heroine that is smart, especially when she is thrown together with a hot security chief. I am really looking forward to the next book in the series. More Mia and Jake, please...... I have added this author to my must read authors' list. If you are a fan of Julie Moffett's Lexi Carmicheal series, you will love this one.

"First of all, let me say what a striking cover this is! It is one of the best covers I've seen in a while. As for the story, it is a bit of a departure from the team this series has focused on. David is undercover DEA but has some common ties to Hunter and the guys from books 1-3. This could definitely be read as a standalone though if you haven't read the other books.One main difference in this story, other than the length, is that it focuses on a married couple with children. Over the last few years, they have drifted apart as his job has increasingly monopolized David's time and Lori has gotten caught up in her resentment of it. Both of them have begun to notice the problems but don't know how to fix them. As is typical, they have been neglecting the intimate aspects of their marriage. David takes some time off work to remind Lori how he feels about her and how much he desires her. The problems occur when his work unexpectedly bleeds into his home and Lori's life could be the cost.I thought this was a very realistic representation of how couples can get after years of complacency. Their way of reconnecting was spicy and fun. I will be looking forward to the next offshoot novella. The preview was interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WIZBC9G7F3K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VLBOVU#wasThisHelpful","R2WIZBC9G7F3K4","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story is book two in the Men of Mercy series, and oh what men they are...whew! While this could definitely be read as a standalone, I highly recommend reading book one first. You will love it, so start there. Resurrection River focuses on Ranger, the brother of the hero from book one, Hunter. The relationship between Ranger and Amy started long before this book, but somewhere along the line it got messed up. That didn't stop the two from having feelings for each other, although Amy's marriage to Ranger's best friend does keep them from acting on those feelings...at least until he dies. Ranger had to deliver the news of his friend's death, and steps up to take care of Amy and her baby. Amy wants to be with Ranger, but feels guilt. The two clash frequently over Amy's doubts, but when dangerous things begin to happen surrounding her, Ranger is determined not to ever leave her side regardless of what she wants or who else wants her.I loved this story just as much as book one, maybe even more. Ranger was totally swoon worthy, and Amy was spunky and determined. When this couple gets hot and bothered, serious sparks fly. I love them and the other men from Ranger's team. I can't wait to see who gets the next story! I'm hoping it's Merc!I received an early copy for review from the author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTARPFEV05CG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VL0FTW#wasThisHelpful","RTARPFEV05CG9","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read and loved the first two books in this series, I didn't hesitate to jump when the author offered an ARC for this story. I'll start by saying that this book is very different from its predecessors. It focuses on the brothers, Jared and Hoyt who were raised mountain backwoods by a family of criminals. Jared is finally ready to try to take out his aunt's criminal operation even though he knows she and her people will kill him and Hoyt on sight. What he doesn't count on is encountering the one person worth saving in the whole mountain community, a girl who saved him first long ago, Sparrow. Sparrow feels trapped by her lack of education and money. She longs for a different life, and Jared convinces her to risk her life and escape with him. Unfortunately, circumstances cause him to mistrust her, and he then turns on Sparrow. Her existence becomes less desirable than what she already had. I have to say that Jared made made furious several times over his treatment of Sparrow. I wanted her to cut him off, but her kind nature and lack of worldview showed, and she was too quickly forgiving. In the end, Jared does get a big wake up call, and I was happy about that. I definitely like them as a couple because she gives his life the positive softer aspects it desperately lacks, and she has the forgiving spirit necessary for dealing with his quick temper.Now, as for Hoyt, he got a lot of page time in this story too, and his association (not quite a relationship yet) with Hayden progresses as well. Unfortunately, a lot happens to change Hoyt from his usual easygoing self. Overall, this story was emotionally tougher than the others in my opinion. I am definitely ready to read more about Hoyt. He needs a happily ever after more than anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VXBNDQO2K4BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VL0PWE#wasThisHelpful","R2VXBNDQO2K4BM","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was completely unfamiliar with Tess Diamond when I was offered an ARC for review, but the book description sounded interesting enough for me to give it a try. I actually had already downloaded another book to read first, but once I read the first couple of paragraphs in Dangerous Games, I was intrigued enough to keep reading.The story begins when Maggie Kincaid is recruited to help with the investigation into the kidnapping of a senator's teenage daughter. Maggie was formerly with the FBI but had wit a couple of years previously due to a negotiation that went wrong. She blamed herself, and after surviving a kidnapping as a child, she couldn't deal with her failure to bring a victim home. She never wanted to be involved in that type of situation again, but with medical issues making recovering the victim even more urgent, she wasn't able to refuse.Despite facing ridicule from former co-workers, stonewalling by the victim's father, and the cocky interference of Jake O'Connor, Maggie doggedly pursues answers. Without giving too much away, I will just say that I enjoyed the chemistry between Jake and Maggie, especially when he was trying to get a rise out of her. The story was well written and gave just enough details to draw you into the story but also keep you guessing. It did end with a pretty decent cliffhanger, but my understanding is that book two will follow close behind this one. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSJK25RQGCTCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017JSEGQO#wasThisHelpful","RSJK25RQGCTCH","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have really enjoyed The Colton's of Oklahoma series. Throughout the series, little questions and suspicions kept popping up about Greta. Finding out about Greta's ""evil twin"" aft the end of the last book was a shocker as was who took a risk to get Greta out of trouble...her fiance's brother. Tyler was super sexy and completely blunt about his desire for Greta. His compete lack of pretense seemed to both catch Greta off guard and also turn her on. It doesn't take long for Tyler to find out what has been going on in Greta's family and discover why she is in danger. He is interested in her although not yet willing to determine how much. He decides to protect her as best he can and figure out the rest later. With Tyler and her brothers all looking out for her, Greta feels safe but discovers her twin can still get to her. The twin wants to steal her life, and Greta is not sure if anyone would even know the difference. It is up to Tyler to prove her wrong.I thought this was a great way to wrap up the stories of the Colton siblings.

"This is the third book in this series, but while I think reading the previous two prior to reading this one would be helpful, it is definitely not necessary in order to enjoy this story.  While many of my favorite characters from books one and two made small appearances, this book primarily focused on Jake. After having lost his left foot and hand while serving in the Army, Jake has built up his own security and investigations company. A famous pro football player hires Jake to find out who is harassing his cousin, a young lady who is confined to her apartment by her overwhelming fears. Jake begins communicating with the young lady, Natalie, through text and quickly finds himself attracted to her quirky humor and angered by the events that have predicated her fear. He is determined to make things better for her in any way he can, and finds himself drawn closer and closer to her. Even though Natalie can't even bring herself to let Jake in her home at first, it doesn't keep this story from being extremely sexy. Let's just say they get really creative until they finally get together physically, that's when the sparks really begin to fly. Unfortunately, whoever is targeting Natalie is covering tracks very well. When the truth comes out and all the betrayals are revealed, it may be the ultimate setback which keeps Natalie locked away forever.I've enjoyed all three books in the series. I hope there are more to come, especially the story of Sabrina and Kaga!I received an ARC for review from Net Galley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SVAN9YNGICDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947556#wasThisHelpful","R1SVAN9YNGICDW","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"is was the twenty seventh book I've read by Allison Brennan, so I guess you could say I'm a huge fan. This particular series is absolutely my favorite. Just as a note, this is definitely not a standalone. It is book ten in the series, and each book builds on the previous one. Actually, in my opinion, you get the best reading experience by first reading the Evil trilogy and then the FBI trilogy. These two series help familiarize you with the Kincaid and Rogan families. They also take you through everything that happens to Lucy Kincaid, the events that shape who she is. Having this background information just makes the Lucy series ten times better.This story has Lucy and Sean tracking prison escapee Nicole Rollins, a murderer they helped apprehend in the previous book. Lucy and Sean are FINALLY engaged ( yes, I've been waiting for that for a long time), but there is no time to celebrate. DEA and FBI agents are being murdered, and all hands are on deck working around the clock to recapture Rollins. Sean and Lucy are pulled in different directions, but try to connect as much as possible. Unfortunately, things only get worse when Kane, Sean's brother, disappears in Mexico. Sean knows he has to go find Kane, but hates to leave knowing Lucy is likely a target for Rollin's violence. He enlists the help of a trusted colleague to watch over Lucy and sets out for Mexico.Lucy is working non-stop. Information is leaking from someone within the joint task force. The leak forces Lucy to question everyone she knows and works with. No one is above suspicion other than a couple of close friends. Lucy's brother, Jack, also arrives in town to help out.Personally, this was my favorite Lucy story to date. The action and suspense were continuous, the depth of the relationship between Lucy and Sean is beautifully depicted, and Jack and Kane ( two of my favorites) are front and center for much of the story.  I truly can't wait for Kane and Siobhan to get their own story.  I'm completely addicted to the Kincaids and the Rogans.I received an ARC for review from Net Galley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17CZ6LZIUPUWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250064333#wasThisHelpful","R17CZ6LZIUPUWO","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mary Burton has long been one of my favorite authors. I especially enjoyed the Senseless duo and the Texas Rangers Trilogy. Honestly, I thought the first two books in the Morgans series were okay, but much more procedural than previous novels. Happily, this story picked up the suspense. While there is a romantic element, the Morgan's are not exactly an emotional family, Alex least of all. Rather than out of control chemistry, this is a couple of fully closed off individuals who gradually find their way into each other's lives and eventually each other's arms.Leah was attacked several years ago by her ex husband who stabbed her repeatedly and left her for dead. Now, her friend is murdered in the same manner as she was attacked. When weird things begin happening in every area of Leah's life, she has to wonder if it is paranoia or if someone is stalking her. Alex made a point to get to know Leah as a way to further his investigation into her friend, but he finds himself drawn to her even as she is unwittingly drawn right into the middle of his investigation. The two slowly draw closer and closer as the danger escalates. Alex vows to protect Leah at all cost, but can he keep her safe when the past comes to call?I enjoyed the creepiness of this story and the twists and turns. Leah was a great character, and I loved how strong she became.I received an ARC for review from Net Galley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMLL6ZQPR1M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE63O9K#wasThisHelpful","R2EMLL6ZQPR1M3","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the first in a new series. Several characters ( the members of Hunter's task force team) are introduced right off the bat. They have a funny sense of humor and the team camaraderie reads very strong. After returning from a disastrous mission overseas, a connection is found in the U.S. linking back to the terrorist they had been tracking. Jake and his team are sent undercover back to his hometown where he is expected to get in with the suspect in any way possible. The only problem is that the suspect is Evie, Hunter's former lover. He has tried to convince himself over the years that he hates her, but if sleeping with her will get him the answers he needs, he has no problem with it. What Hunter doesn't know is that after he left her, Evie chose a man on the rebound and ended up in a sickly abusive relationship. She got out but still lives in terror of her ex. Now, her ex has leveraged her cooperation with something illegal, and she can't find a safe way out of it. When Hunter throws himself into the mix, things become just as dangerous as they are complicated. He quickly realizes Evie isn't the criminal he was led to believe, but will she still want him after she finds out why he sought her out in the first place?This book was wall to wall action. Once the danger hit, it never slowed down. I was actually late leaving my house this morning because there was no way I could stop reading at 95%. I absolutely had to know how it was going to end. A little blurb at the end of the epilogue caught me by surprise and made me very excited about the next book. Lindsay Cross is absolutely going on my favorite authors list.I received an ARC from Net Galley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3XWR2PZTF2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VJYL7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3XWR2PZTF2T","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love how this book starts off with Davis, the series twin, laughing. It was such a sweet cute scene between him and Jamie. More so than the previous books in this series, this book starts off with action and keeps the suspense and danger high throughout. Poor Davis, it seems like he has been injured in nearly every book, and this one is no exception. His injuries won't stop him from keeping Jamie safe though. He has wanted her from the first time he saw her and has placed himself in her path as much as he can. Now that she needs his help fending off a nightmare from her past, he will risk anything.This was such a great story.

"I thought the author did a pretty good job of keeping the feeling of this story similar to the original series. I liked seeing Kade older and interacting with his son. Ellie was funny and a good fit for Kane. Though it was a novella, it read like a full length story and didn't rush things. Kathleen didn't really read true to character for me. I'd like to give an exact reason why, but she just felt off, maybe a bit too sweet and coddling. In any case, that's very subjective, so maybe it's just me. In any case, it was a nice story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZHQL9GO6LSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFHEFSY#wasThisHelpful","R3KZHQL9GO6LSH","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He quickly became a favorite of mine, and I wanted to see him happy. No once could have been more perfect for him than Claire. The lengths they went to in order to be with each other were beyond belief. They loved and trusted so deeply. This story also reiterated the great love of Vine and Anton.

"Though it was definitely not on par with Callaghan series, this was a sweet contemporary romance. I was hoping for a bit more adventure or even a touch of suspense, but the straight up romance was still nice.

I will say don't skip this book even if, like me, you hate to read things that might make you emotional.

They are so passionate, but their soul deep connection is what pulls me in and makes me want to read more about them.

"So much more is going on in this book than even in the first one! It appears that the danger for Vine and Anton is never going to go away. In fact, Vine apparently has a new enemy, or one of Anton's enemies is using her to get to him. Anton is concerned for his new little family, distracted by the pending death of his father, and suspicious of the people he should be able to trust the most. Vine is worried and feeling like an outsider to Anton's life. This book had even more passion and intrigue than the first book, and it ended in a way that leads me to believe book three will be a shocker.

"I found the series on Kindle unlimited , but was unfamiliar with the author. Having read several mob style romantic suspense novels in the past, I decided I had a pretty good chance of enjoying this one. I'm really thrilled that I gave it a try, because I completely loved it. Though our hero in this book is definitely not one of three good guys, her is a good man, and here had been in love with Vine for years. She was promised to him through a mafia arranged marriage, and even though she believes the agreement died with her parents, Anton has no intention of letting her go...ever. At first, Vine is furious because she is ripped out of the life she loves and thrown into a situation she thought would never occur. As she gets to know her future husband, however, she comes to realize exactly how much he loves her and how much he has put into making sure she will be safe and happy. Vine decides she and Anton can truly be happy and melts almost seamlessly into his life. If he loved her before, he is nothing short of obsessed with her now. The passion between this couple is off the charts. They are perfect for each other, but not everyone is happy with their union, and Anton is hiding a secret which may rip everything apart if Vine can survive long enough to discover it.This was a great story, and I'm thrilled to have found a new series I love on Kindle Unlimited.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R792C7JLAFX7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YV1O32K#wasThisHelpful","R792C7JLAFX7H","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is part of a fairly large series called The Krewe of Hunters. I had read one of the books in this series a long time ago and really enjoyed it. I tend to read at least a book per day, so even though I planned to read more of this series, I had unfortunately forgotten the name of the series and the author by the time I remembered to check them out. Recently, I have tried a few other paranormal type series trying to find this one with no success. Thankfully, I spotted this book on Net Galley. As soon as I read the title, I knew this was what I'd been looking for and requested the book. I was so happy to get the ARC for review!The Krewe of Hunters is a special FBI division with lots of special funding and leeway to investigate crimes with a paranormal type element. Diego's best friend and partner in the FBI has just joined the Krewe and issued an invitation to Diego. He is wavering about the decision until his ex-wife (whom he is still in love with) calls desperate for his help. He makes a snap decision to join the Krewe hoping their resources will get him to Scarlet faster.In the meantime, Scarlet is seeing ghosts. They are even appearing on her camera making her the focus of a police murder investigation. Scarlet is terrified of the ghosts, but the when the Krewe arrives, they believe the ghosts may be trying to help. Working together with the ghosts might help the Krewe solve not only the recent murders but maybe even some decades old, however, can they help save Scarlet or will Diego have to continue learning to live without her?I enjoyed the story and the characters, especially Daniel the ghost. There were enough plot turns to keep me guessing and enough action and chemistry to keep me turning pages. I'm so glad I found this series again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27J1LEU40KSKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXDO22C#wasThisHelpful","R27J1LEU40KSKA","A1Q33020JJKDAN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Q33020JJKDAN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this story even though I am no closer to deciding exactly which guy I want to root for. I like them both. This book gives so much more insight into all three off the main characters, but instead of making the choice of who Sage should be with, it really only made it harder. The story was full of tons of kick butt action and suspense, and I didn't want to put it down.

"Blood on Snow starts well, with a few twists and turns and a anti-hero protagonist who is just intriguing enough to not be an instant turn-off.Unfortunately the story lacked enough depth to keep my interest. At a mere novella length the story begins with tension and resolves somewhat blandly. It almost felt like Nesbo ran out of characters and plot to keep the story exciting  rather than the story actually resolving well.I'm usually a huge fan of Nesbo works, but I won't be pursuing the rest of this series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FXF1FBAIT88Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354193#wasThisHelpful","R1FXF1FBAIT88Z","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The weird thing about this book, if this was just a complete rip-off of the Millennium Trilogy with derivative characters and style I would have probably given it 5 stars. As it is however, an average thriller using Larsson's characters, a sense of mediocre achievement and betrayal pervaded my reading of this novel.(SPOILER ALERTS ONGOING)There were some good action sequences, but overall the story was overwhelmed with sins that I couldn't look past. Too many minor characters, a very late and extremely contrived introduction of Lisbeth's sister as the big-bad. Attempts at conspiracy fell flat (There is a mole in the police!), especially compared to the deep corruption revealed in the original trilogy. Lisbeth was reduced to a tom-girl action-hero stereotype with very little page time.Where the original trilogy had a gloomy nihilistic tone, this novel read more like a B-grade crime thriller, but what hurt the most was how destructive the tale was to the original characters. Everything just felt like a try-hard attempt to replicate the power of the previous books. Why can't they leave good things alone?","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FA9JL38JYRKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354282#wasThisHelpful","R1FA9JL38JYRKJ","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even if you have seen the movie, or like me had the plot of this story spoiled by reviews or analysis, this book is amazing. As easy to read as a cheap thriller, as deep as a literary novel, and as unsettling as a horror. Mystic River is probably going to stick with me for a while. Probably the best thing about it is, despite having the twists and turns of good fiction, one really feels like they are listening in on the three main characters lives as they bounce from tragedy to tragedy.

"For the longest time I honestly thought this story was some sort of 'orphan child coming of age' novel. Don't judge a book by its cover I guess. It wasn't until a quiz question identified the book as being about vampires that I realized I had it wrong.So was it a good vampire novel. Yes and No, hard no to be impressed by the epic scope of this piece. Possibly one of the most well written ends of the world I've read.On the other hand, some of the early scenes were cheesy as milk-mold, and personally I found it hard to care about the characters in the second half of the novel because I'd just become attached to the first lot dammit!The ending was a little underwhelming, I suppose because this is a trilogy, SPOILERS nonetheless it seemed a bit of a cop out to design this huge world-ending situation, and then conclude the novel by destroying, one group of the vampires only.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FDKS6SSIQRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345504976#wasThisHelpful","R29FDKS6SSIQRZ","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not being a big fan of prequels or spin-offs, but a huge fan of the Song of Fire and Ice I thought a graphic novel was not a painful way to give Hedge Knight a go.Present is Grr Martin's chaotic violence and unique ability to weave a tale complete with twists and adventure and heroism, without somehow seeming far-fetched or cheesy fantasy fiction. The Hedge Knight is however a more traditional approach to fantasy, a story following a single hero rising from poverty to get mixed up with kings and 'dragons.' Also present was Martin's confusing and thorough approach to lineage and family, which will be familiar to readers attempting to keep up with Westeros' elaborate family trees.The story itself is strong but not awe inspiring, much like the artwork which while technically brilliant I felt simply did the job of telling the story nothing more (nothing less though so still 4 star)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R126VHVCJ7TC1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477849106#wasThisHelpful","R126VHVCJ7TC1G","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a book I thought I was going to love, so the 3 star rating could be in part due to the disappointment of high expectations, but honestly the book was a let-down. Disease Proof had been sitting on my wishlist since I heard about it being an evidenced based health advice book and a viable alternative to fadish an alternative medicinal self-help type books.However in the end Disease Proof tells anyone half-educated little new, Eat your veges, exercise and avoid fatty and/or processed food, Sure perhaps I learnt a few more details about healthy living, but ultimately it was more a reminder than a healthy lesson. And like many books of this genre, I highly doubt anyone who doesn't know that keeping active and eating vegetables is good for you is going to pick up this book. There are several technique and practical advice pages that may help the small portion of people who pick up this book but need a practical boost to live better.I really liked the holistic section focused on sleep, stress, social relationships and chronic pain, but alas this was effectively the closing chapter and not nearly as much time was spent on these topics.This review may seem overly harsh, the book is accurate well researched and covers an important topic, its could have done with more writing pizzazz and perhaps more detail aspects of health living other than eating (I guess diet has a huge impact on health so it also had a huge portion of this book, but still) In summary, this book is worth a look it you are in the rare bracket where you want more technical knowledge about health living and have no-idea where to start.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UFMT0JDBHMUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014218117X#wasThisHelpful","R1UFMT0JDBHMUZ","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been hearing about the Chowder Society and a classic novel called Ghost Story in 'horror fiction' topic for Quiz-up for ages (I'm best in NZ by the way), and finally saw a hard-cover at a sale and picked it up!My story aside, if you like Stephen King's older works and are a horror fan in general Ghost Story is worth a look. Even though its not technically that old (published 1979) the book has a nostalgic feel and a slow pace that is usually absent from modern horror. While the tale-spinning old men of the Chowder Society and Mr Wanderly aren't the most unique or sexy of protagonists the story redeems itself by its powerful images, crazy but ultimately sensical plotting and an ending that most authors would/should be jealous of.The slow and somewhat rambling pace may put some excitement-junkies off, and its hard to attach to the large cast of character presented in a symphony of chaos narratively, but the well-executed mythology and 'ghost' story was above par and I can see why this novel brought horror into the upper echelon of publishing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R237SEE07NV1MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJ1ZP0K#wasThisHelpful","R237SEE07NV1MB","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An intriguing concept - The Finkler questions follows a protagonist who is not in fact Jewish, but almost pathologically jealous of his friend Finkler, who is. The story follows our main man around as he imitates, fakes, and almost makes himself jewish.

Deep North is a semi-biographical novel (by which I mean the story is strongly based on the life of the author's father + research with some dramatization to make the story more powerful and effective [don't panic history remains intact]) of the experience of WWII POWs in a Japanense prisoner of war camp building a railway to 'nowhere'The scenes are harrowing and violent to say the least, but Deep North is not just a festival of gruesome treatment of war prisoners, the depth of characterization is almost more haunting, especially the stories of the soldiers back home and trying to live their lives.I wouldn't recommend the story to those even remotely squeamish, in some respects reading the book was horrible, incredibly rewarding though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUE1J9JLXRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804171475#wasThisHelpful","R1EUE1J9JLXRR","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So this book finally put me off this series (thank goodness fans yell, now we won't have to read your negative reviews no more.) The novel started with such promise - our main lady revealing that she was in fact addicting to cutting for prophecy. An intriguing move joining real life issues with fantasy fiction.But then the rest of the long story happened, endless conversations about human vs other politics which aside from being boring confused the crap out of me (cue fans of book accusing of stupidity.) The majority of the book wasn't from Meg's point of view (and she is the best honestly) and I knew the book was a dud as I approached the end I realized I had no idea what the climax would/could be.On the plus side - one less series to feel obligated to read.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZQPDQWP0HYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWFZ7CE#wasThisHelpful","R2YZQPDQWP0HYK","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Touch was an intriguing tale, built around the idea of a person (or entity) than can possess people indefinitely, and what might happen in such a person's life.The tale was well constructed, fascinating and the action well-crafted, bloody, and tense. I only had a couple of beefs. One was that similar to the body-switching of the narrator, the story zipped around between the characters origins, random anecdotes and the present day action. While it wasn't tough to follow it did weaken the drive of the plot. Second was the book was a bit too long for what it was - as a kick ass action story that touched on some deeper themes I found myself having to intentionally sit down and read this book through, because I fund myself getting bored with the 400+ pages.Nonetheless an interesting read","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFHEJ4JIMI82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM9S8XE#wasThisHelpful","R2KFHEJ4JIMI82","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As per the headline, I read Blood Meridian on recommendation of a friend as I loved the Road.So what was Blood Meridian like? Personally I did not enjoy this as much as the Road as the narrative was less personal, more action focused than Road. If that sounds like your thing than BM is likely for you. The too stories have much in common: an examination of human beings and violence and the place of innocence in horrible worlds. BM is perhaps draws more from history and has more culture contains within (whereas Road was unifying in its bleakness.)I wasn't sad that I read Blood Meridian but it wasn't my slice of cake.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXJXENJ45BJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679728759#wasThisHelpful","RXXJXENJ45BJF","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So Shannon's earlier book The Bone Season was somewhat of a let-down for me. My friends adored the thing so I thought I would give Mime Order a chance.To be frank for about 80% of the book I regretted the decision. After a melodramatic but pointless prologue the book begins immediately after the end of Bone Season, and quickly sees Paige return to London to deal with the supernatural politics of her unnatural creed. The weird thing is I wanted more London in Bone Season, but I wasn't happy with the world portrayed in Mime Order. Everything seemed too organised, I was thinking that if the unnaturals were a big like gangs then they surely would be somewhat informal (i.e. not having a set ruler.) The world of Mime Order felt more like try-hard Harry Potter which was a shame.Second problem in a similar Potter vein, was the shear weight of the terminology, Shannon seemed like a big linguistic show-off playing around with all these 'mancers' but the effect was one of making the book gimmicky and lacking substance. The plot meandered around endless meetings with various unmemorable characters (seriously I could only tell you about Paige, Warden and Jaxon if you asked me right now) except for some brief moments of interest when that certain someone showed up again (sorry spoiler (c'mon not really))The final redeeming feature was the climactic ending. In fact I suspect this book was written largely as filler to build to a well written ending, which was genuinely so good I almost added a star. Here is hoping that the rest of the series is ALL crafted so well because overall this book was a drag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TNRTAV7TJ4PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620408937#wasThisHelpful","R2TNRTAV7TJ4PX","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok so I was reading this book with the succinct recommendation that it was a ""mind-f***"" for the first 50 pages I felt more like the book was a just a drag, and the author couldn't get his head together to write a coherent story. After about page 75 and definitely after page 100 the book really started to take off.

"There were a few things that struck me about Reviver as I began reading, first, the prose is exceptionally well written. Tight, tense and clear it was a rare moment to not feel absorbed by the coherence of the story. Second however was the slight tropey plot. A forensic professional who speaks to the recently dead to build a court case, never seen that before.Nonetheless, the tale goes places unexpected, and most enjoyable is Patrick's ability to riff about the social consequences of 'revival' while keeping the story alive.I must confess the final confrontation and aftermath started to get a bit cheesy and cliche, but I don't regret reading this one for a second.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GH4WQFDC2HO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250021707#wasThisHelpful","R3GH4WQFDC2HO6","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So definitely had to read the second installment of Maus after rereading the first. I must confess, while still strong and brilliant the second novel meanders a little. There is a heavier focus on the author this time round, with Spiegelman riffing on the pressures and difficulties of creating the follow-up.In saying that the history is during a much more brutal phase of the Holocaust, the father's experiencing much more violence and death (portrayed with significant harrow.) So it's hardly like the book is all about the author. The final few panels were expertly done and appropriately heart-wrenching. The strange juxtaposition of seeing Spiegelman's father deteriorate with old age while recounting his near-death experiences prompts a maelstrom of feelings. One feels an odd agreement with the ranting father when he says 'I survived for what, this?' referring to the difficulty and inevitable decline of old age. At the same time one gets the sense of a man living a full and complete life (which many did not obviously)In summary Maus portrays the holocaust in a unique and powerful way, personal without preaching, insightful without overblowing it. Once again finding a bizarre paradox of humanizing the tragic events by depicting people as animals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O05F9PIHGDJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679729771#wasThisHelpful","R3O05F9PIHGDJS","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wasn't the first time I read Maus - so this review is more of a 'is this still good' and the answer is definitely yes. My initial reading was as a teenager, now as a (supposed) adult I found myself identifying with different aspects.The whole metaphor aspect has probably been overcooked over the years in review, but it is worth mentioning that the depiction of the Jews as mice and Polish as pigs creates a fascinating paradox in that the cartoonish perhaps even childish aspects both softens and hardens the brutality of the story. The most powerful effect however is the emphasis on 'race' and the plight of the mice.In terms of storyline Maus manages to cover both broad issues and personal through Spiegelman's father. When I first read the book I was struck by the direct persecution of the Jews, from an older perspective I was more intrigued by the relationship and family dynamics portrayed in the book, such as Spiegelman's family refusing to change their lifestyle in the face of poverty.Perhaps the strongest aspect of this piece, is created the strong desire to read the second part, much enjoyed even the second time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32MJ6Z7T318EM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394747232#wasThisHelpful","R32MJ6Z7T318EM","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There were many draws to this book - a good title, a theme that involved one of my great loves (walking) encased in a relatively light book. However I found myself not really enjoying this book, the idea is that as the author wanders the meridian he recounts important historic and scientific progress around that point and topic. While this sounds good in theory it makes for a somewhat disjointed book, at one point discussing the cosmos, then Charles Darwin and the dinosaurs. It makes a lot more sense when the epilogue reminds us that the author has been pondering their own and mankind's significance in the universe (which explains the heavy content)In regards the quality of the information the knowledge imparted by this book is a little heavy and pretty formally presented without much flair or verve, for people already fascinated by the topics they probably wouldn't hear anything new and for those uninformed Raymo kinda jumps right into the complicated stuff (it involved trig)Overall by far not my favorite non-fiction.

The initial setting was quite strong, a sort-of Dickensian world where psychics are outlawed and band together to perform black-market magic. Shannon even provided a great inciting incidents, our main character semi-accidentally killing a G-man - thinks were going well.Then an abrupt shift. After being abducted, Paige our main girl, wakes up in Sheol a sort of Gulag for psychics, were she is slaved off to the cold, cruel and powerful 'Warden.' (no prizes to see where that relationship is going) the plots shifts more to a confusing vampire vs human conspiracy theory thing which I admit I didn't quite get even towards the end.There was some strong action in the novel which kinda carried the book, overall there was far too much jargon, minor characters and incoherence to really enjoy, but I must stress that the initial concept was pretty cool, and I suspect the series may be one to keep following.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0JB2P631UT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620401398#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0JB2P631UT6","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not going to tackle this book as I found the predessor a little dull - however many reviewers recommended that I give it a go and overall I'm happy that I did.Immediately beginning the novel I felt the prose was tighter, the action smoother and hundreds of pages fell away quickly.The book did start to sag after the middle. I think perhaps lacking a strong tension to keep the pages turning. The conclusion while satisfactory felt like less of a climax and more like finishing touches. Perhaps the most annoying thing I felt there was less focus on dreams and magic in the second half the story almost becoming a political thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R420MNEQ6SGRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EP2TVO#wasThisHelpful","R420MNEQ6SGRJ","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the scale of urban fantasy Seawitch errs more towards the police procedural side, with a focus on typical investigative practices such as interviews and 'clue-gathering.'

"I thought for a long while about how to rate this book. I had been initially intrigued by the premise, and there were a few strong scenes in the first half which while reading gave me hope of an enjoyable read. in the end however I found Gibson's The Peripheral disappointing.My first difficulty with the book was the overdose of concept. Certainly Gibson would have wanted his futuristic novel to have a certain degree of jargon and new technical terms (and no-one wants to bog their book down explaining every one) but i found the book to be overwhelmed with terminology and assumed future concepts that for me did not gel well with a smooth story. I even went so far as to purposefully slow my reading speed down and try and comprehend better what was going on. Honestly the exercise only served to provide evidence that the action and description in this novel were poorly balanced.Second on my list of justifications - the characters. Aside from their esoteric names, Macon, Wilf, Netherton, I honestly could not tell you anything about the people in this book. I couldn't even tell you who was the protagonist and who were secondary characters. Sure there was a bit of action and drama, I challenge any reader to tell me a personality trait or characteristic of any of the players in this novel, as everyone seemed more present to discuss futuristic politics than have genuine personalities.My final beef (final I promise) is that the general presentation of the prose was sporadic at best. With chapters ranging from short to very-short the pacing was jerky. The overall one of the novel started as quite serious and dark, and somehow by the end of the novel was almost comedic (particularly the chapter titles) Of course often sci-fi has elements of satire and humor, in this case however it left me wondering whether I was reading a thriller or a black comedy.It was a shame to not enjoy The Peripheral, I respected the concept, and there were some definitely strong scenes in the book. Ultimately I felt like I was reading a draft that needed 3 more editorial sweeps and rewrites before it became marketable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KF1YDUXZXTHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158448#wasThisHelpful","R1KF1YDUXZXTHA","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first few pages of this beast held such promise, a main character with a magical inferiority complex, a downtrodden people begging for redemption...Very quickly though this piece started to lose ground. Too much mythology was thrown into the first few pages, and while the world building was obviously thought-out, I never really had a sense of the world Raasch was trying to create. Aside from the 'love interest' and the 'mentor' characters the minor players were a little too minor and I felt myself getting muddled between bad-guys.I couldn't work out whether the book was supposed to be pushing the action or the intrigue, one moment there would be magical violence, the next our main character was getting tricked into attending a ball.Based on the author note, Snow Like Ashes is the product of an authors passion for a fantasy world they have apparently be developing for years and while I can appreciate the work from that point of view, there are so many better fantasy novels out there with more finely tuned world building and balance between politics, relationships and the brutality of such settings.

"I really really like the Raven Boys, good characters, twisty plot, and a well designed world that put together real world problems with somewhat believable supernatural elements. Then came the Dream Thieves which I honestly have had to look up my review to remind myself what happened so immemorable was the piece (turns out I enjoyed it but obviously not enough to remember anything that happened...)And now there is Blue lily, Lily Blue. If I found Dream Thieves immemorable, then Lily Blue is doomed. The story meanders terribly with multiple talking scenes throughout the first half, and only the occasional twist in the later to keep momentum. The characters seemed to have lost their verve somewhere. There was one really powerful scene with Adam and his father, then that plotline fizzled out, resolved far too easily. The 'bad-guys' felt like monster of the week enemies with little significance, and finally the small development towards the search for G was quite interesting but hardly explored enough.I suspect Stiefvater (boy am I glad the author name appears at the top while you write a review) is enjoying the prospects of a long series, and is toning down the major developments, unfortunately resulting in a yawny book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMMVS3Z4SVWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JD36AV8#wasThisHelpful","R3EMMVS3Z4SVWT","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book intrigued me from the moment I saw it. I must admit first of all that I have a very hesitant opinion of fanfiction. While I understand that people want to expand, explore or twist fictional (or celebrity) universes and share their thoughts, there is another part of me that rankles at the thought of writing about characters and a world that someone else slaved to create.If anything this book did give me some things to think about, such as comparing mainstream adaptations (such as Sherlock) to fan-fic and asking the question How is this different? Unfortunately the meandering subjects, overblown writing (which I fear may be similar to the fanfic discussed) made the book feel unprofessional and half-baked.I did enjoy the vague exploration of the rationale of fanfic, and the chapters linking specific fiction and television to fanfic were the strongest.It was mildly annoying that the book did not explore in more depth the response of authors to fanfic (controversy is always entertaining) and I felt many topics (such as the large amounts of sex) were only touched about tangentially.The most difficult thing about the book was the constant in-joke style of reference, the author frequently referring to events and subjects briefly, obviously with an expectation that the reader knew what they were talking about.So is this book recommended - only if you are very interested in the subject.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTN5HJR2NNJEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939529190#wasThisHelpful","RTN5HJR2NNJEU","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was to read this piece for book club, and was finding it hard to track down, everywhere I went said they didn't have a copy but that the book was amazing.So eventually when I found it there was quite a bit of anticipation...Unfortunately my enjoyment fizzled, I really got into the story in the first few pages, then found myself getting lost in the lengthy passages.

"In the Young Elites Lu creates a world where magic users are shunned and feared. Our main character Adelina struggles with the potential for power, and the danger of her own family and the prejudiced world she lives in.The story is comparatively short for a fantasy novel, Lu is quick to present action and skillfully puts together a plot without bogging down her story in world-building. This is a double edged sword however, the story is somewhat shallow. The characters, aside from Adelina herself are underdeveloped and I found it hard to relate or feel compelled by them.I think after reading it, The Young Elites feels more like it should be a blockbuster movie with high-end special effects.

"SPOILERS FOR BOTH THIS BOOK AND ITS COMPANIONMy first reaction to hearing about the existence of this book was confusion. Many of the discussions I had in person and online around the companion book The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry centred around the real feelings of Queenie towards Harold, the conclusions tending toward the books theme being in part about that mystery and Harolds realisation that he would never know.So in some respects the appearance of this book blasted apart that theory. Very much a companion book the Love Song of Queenie Hennessey is written from the perspective of Queenie who is writing letters to Harold from her Hospice bed. The narrative jumps between Queenie explaining the past and her experiences at the home. In general the prose is sharp and the book is well written with some genuine humour and heart-break at times.Nonetheless I did not actually appreciate this instalment of the tale. Hearing about Queenies genuine love for Harold was mildly sweet, however destroyed the mysteries mentioned above (I dont know if others felt the same.) Stretching the story out to reveal a relationship between Queenie and Harolds son David just seemed contrived, especially the clich of Queenie being with David on the night of his death, conveniently structured to give Queenie the guilts without her actually being at all to blame.Overall the story lacked verve and tension  Im not sure if anyone would pick this up without having read The Unlikely Pilgrimage, but having nothing to encourage page turning but a scene we already saw, this time from Queenies perspective the book dragged.Im sure extreme fans of the original book will be pretty into this book, for people like myself who enjoyed but was not overjoyed about Harold Fry I would hold it up as an example of a tale better left without a prequel/sequel/companion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32213QADN49U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFAZ3W8#wasThisHelpful","R32213QADN49U4","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So Amish Vampires in Space. Obviously not mean to be taken seriously, however begging the question  how should one take this book?My first surprise in picking up this gem was an introduction from Jeff Gerke (who writes, the First 50 pages  recommended reading for would-be authors.) He explains that Amish themed novels had saturated the Christian books market, (and of course vampire fiction the general young adult) Im not too sure where the Space came from, other than In Space is a long-standing clich and one cant be too picky having chosen to read this book in the first place.Apparently the idea was given to Neitz who returned a piece played straight certainly a hilarious move in general, not sure where it leaves a reader however. This book read straight leaves one wondering if they are meant to enjoy the story with a slightly humorous backdrop or not read it at all and just chuckle at the idea.To be honest, the latter is best. Aside from one moment when a pig flies due to its bat mutation, the story is oddly devoid of laugh out loud humour, relying mostly on the bizarre take on tropes and clichs, leading to one reading the book in a permanent state of cringe. It must be said that the story is constructed relatively skillfully, and I actually recommend the book as a study in story construction (as the stupid premise prevents overthinking other areas.) I guess the problem is that book doesn't commit to pure humour, but the story and characters are just a little shy of being relatable and fun.In summary  the joke is almost entirely in the front cover, I recommend not only judging the book by it, but in fact considering yourself to have absorbed all of worth from it by observing the cover.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20H1XVELO0WJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HONV36Q#wasThisHelpful","R20H1XVELO0WJ9","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scalzi's Lock In had a premise that sucked me right in, and even held my attention for the first few chapters. The skillfully built world provided an intriguing setting for a police procedural, and Scalzi shows an admirable talent for creating plausible characters within a sci-fi novel (a genre that often sees ridiculous characters engaging in equally ridiculous plots)However the tale unravels steadily throughout. The first awkward was the juxtaposition of our young protagonist as a FBI agent investigating a gruesome murder, against his life at home with 'Mom and Dad.' I was willing to overlook the clumsy shift in tone between police procedural, and family hubris, but the rest of the story relied too heavily on the sci-fi gobbledygook to make sense of whats going on. I'm sure a true fan would have understood the plotline, I just felt dumb and disappointed.My final beef is that there was too much unmet potential. Perhaps Scalzi was saving ideas for later in the series, I was wondering why there wasn't more drama around the 'Lock-ins' and the political and social pressures. Instead there were just a few gags about the main character using the 'Ford Pinto' of Threeps and a brief sequence about the unreality of being in the same room as your prone body. I had been hoping for insanity, ethics, politics and psycho-physiological mayhem (that made sense)I'm glad I read Lock In, its a cool idea and the story is decent, but just decent not MIND BLOWING","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3940J8Y3I5MIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHCBE1C#wasThisHelpful","R3940J8Y3I5MIF","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The focus of the story is a sort of mythological action romp about judgement and the afterlife. The main character is a bewildered young lass trying to determine what the heck is going on as a 'Messenger' shows her the ropes of his reaper-like role.The story is somewhat brief and I felt Grant relied heavily on the allure of his mystics and a solid ending twist, rather than relate-able characters, although this was alright for a short-term escapist hour.

"Since I started reviewing, the Reacher series has been going through a saga of sorts. Culminating in the meeting of Reacher and his sexy female replacement/counterpart in the Military Police. I was disappointed in that tale, that Child didn't take a dare and change the  series forever by having Reacher 'settle down' or at least form a relationship deeper than wham bang bang thanks ma'am.Instead he returned to his vagabond ways and Personal is the first installment since. The first striking thing about this novel is Child's decision to write in 1st person. Unless I'm mistaken Reacher has previously been presented in 3rd person throughout the series. Really the only difference though, aside from the 'I' statements is no gratuitous descriptions of Reacher's physique or appearance (which arguably are some of the best parts)The other twist is that in this tale Reacher becomes an international man of mystery and is sent to London, in a similar vein to the above point, this doesn't actually mean much, aside from English place names, a statement of how 'things are the same everywhere' and tiresome references to Sherlock Holmes.Plot is the strongest point of this novel, and while the secondary characters lack the depth of past novels, the fast paced and 'personal' storyline will keep Reacher fans happy.The ending line in particular stood out, which is not something I usually compliment in a novel, but for this one Child really pulled out an amazing image, (almost) literary level.

"Its been a while since I've read a book as fun as this one. Although after finishing it I have been left with a concerning feeling that I was supposed to find the tale immensely meaningful, rather than just a witty romp with a twist.Even without delving deeply into the story SPOILS are hard to avoid so don't read on if you don't want them. The tale revolves around our narrator who explores her child and young adulthood through the lens of her sister Fern. There are more themes than you can shake a stick out, most of which are tangentially explored without overdoing any particularly topic. The story covers ethics, humanism, family dynamics, memory and personal isolation.The prose is unique, easy to read and fun, perhaps at times over the top but always interesting.I read the book because I heard it is in the running for the Booker Prize, although I suspect the book is too dramatic and overt to win, still worth a look-see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YL5GUJX4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZTLN62#wasThisHelpful","R25YL5GUJX4I","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've become a bit wary of books that look like this - after several environmentally focussed books that have left me negative about the future I don't really want any more.Luckily as a first point Freinkel is very balanced and optimistic in her writing. Yes she touches on the environmental horrors of plastic and the pseudo-island(s) corrupting the worlds oceans, but she also presents the topic with hope and while not many explicit solutions, good directions and philosophies to adopt (although she does end the book on a pondering how much plastic will we consume in 2050)In regards to content Freinkel's writing is a little heavy and I felt the prose lacked the verve and spark that many pop-science novelists possess. Nonetheless the content was well managed and did not swing on wild tangents or delve too deeply into personal stories as many non-fiction writers do.I would have liked to hear more early plastic disaster stories and more balance in the examples. I felt like Freinkel cherry picked the organisations and places she would visit rather than trying to describe the world of plastic manufacturing as a whole. Although as mentioned earlier this is a balanced piece, that covers many viewpoints without vilifying anyone (although one of the plastic lovers is portrayed as a bit of a lunatic perhaps accurately.)The strongest message of the book with Freinkel is to be commended for is trying to change the perception from plastic as a readily created, consumed and condemned product and a valuable resource that if used correctly could benefit the environment and us rather than being an uncomfortable product of convenience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPW1FWF5DCNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005652BZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XPW1FWF5DCNU","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book started with much promise - a mystical dream theme that opens enough plot doors to carry the book, a tense future where the main characters would undergo the 'Try' and hints of intrigue surrounding The Place and its the people.Then much to my angst we had to delve into the history of the place. I imagine those who love the premise would have enjoyed it, I found myself bored and waiting for the main characters to come back. When they finally did, MILD SPOILER the Try I was excited about seemed to pass without note and the book felt like it was floundering in plotlines - was it a coming of age tale of two young girls, a dystopian drama, a magical tale of a girl and her Beach-Golem?There seemed to be several character introductions in the second half that stymied the flow, and while I liked the main plot-point I felt it was strangely executed, the climax seemingly more about an intense idea the author must have had rather than a natural progression of the characters and their story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H9VJJYQCAQQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374318530#wasThisHelpful","R3H9VJJYQCAQQX","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading outside your own culture is highly recommended. Observing the links and the differences is half the enjoyment, the rest is from the startling originality that comes from freedom from familiar tropes and cliches.Of course there is a downside, a couple of the tales, Dog and Plow-Ox, (there was likely animal symbolism I missed) seemed directionless and a bit random. The Mistake and The Ancestor were compelling and powerful.

"Arsenault's offering 'What Strange Creatures' is itself quite the strange creature. The novel can't seem to work out whether it is a thriller, Nancy Drew mystery, or literary novel of family dynamics. Unfortunately this is not a brilliant piece that melds all three, but a mediocre tale that falls short in each.The first warning sign was the beginning, the dramatic start of a the protagonist's brother being accused of murder very quickly prompts a massive groan at we jump back 3 weeks in a blatant attempt to maintain interest while the characters are fleshed out.Problem is the characters feel a bit to fake, the issues too contrived to be believable. Our lead actress is a PhD candidate (and has been so some time) in what I suspect is meant to be insightful a minor character points out that she cannot finish her thesis because she doesn't have any faith. A pretty heady statement for a theme that is featured no-where else in the book (i.e. no prior focus on faith or religion that I noticed)Anyways the plot struggles along bouncing between chapters which are a bit like 'meet my quirky family aren't they literary?' and sequences which read more like a John Grisham, where a potentially crooked prosecutor is investigated (how or why the main character thinks she has the right to or the appropriate skills or the naivety to believe anything she finds will hold up in court is not questioned)Obviously I found the book underwhelming, while there where patches of humor, insight and moments of compelling characterization (Jeff has a few moments where one actually feels something for his predicament) overall the piece was just a bit too 'novelly'","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G7K9LE8565JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G97TBEO#wasThisHelpful","R1G7K9LE8565JD","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grave Witch has a lot that I should like, paranormal crime, a dark take on urban fantasy, a protagonist with many supernatural entanglements including father drama.(mild spoilers)Where Grave Witch falls over is that there is simply too much crammed into this novel: death personified - which was a decent start and obviously fits with the whole 'Grave' thing - but then there is fairy-land, Wryd Witches, a supernatural backstory witch was just too similar to many others (esp Hollows series) and final an attempt at some level of normalcy (which by that point all this is introduced normal is long gone)While there was some good action, and a few strong scenes particularly towards the end, the majority of the plot seems driven by an even mix of Intense Magical experiences, and a series of faceless law enforcement characters either co-operating or hindering our protagonist.Our main lady Alex Craft (well thought up name at least) is pretty likable and possesses a good mix of sass and sense. Of course as mentioned earlier is a sexy supernatural lady getting mixed up in supernatural politics anything new these days?Maybe I'm a bit jaded on the genre, I was quite surprised to see this book rated very highly, without a few dud star ratings. I guess most who read this one love the format, and those who read it and don't might be a bit daft to read a genre they are overly familiar with the formula of (whoops)","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24LG02KCAH3T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060N6OZG#wasThisHelpful","R24LG02KCAH3T0","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had a lot of potential. A novel devoted to humanizing psychiatric patients and humor! What could go wrong?Firstly the Scottish brogue, its especially jarring that O'Donnell writes in plain English, but opts to have his dialogue in the dialect (the old literary no-no.)Secondly the humor isn't always what was promised. Many of the jokes are actually Dadish punchlines unrelated to the Ward or its patients/consumers/PEOPLE.Finally the narrative doesn't lend itself to page-turning or enjoyment. the 30+ chapters are essentially short stories devoted to the people O'Donnell worked with, sometimes a fellow staff-member or a brief segue into a related topic such as medication. The book concludes with (however true) rant about funding and lack of staffing and the incident that compelled O'Donnell to quit.This review probably seems overly negative, given the four star rated. The book is overall quite good, the people intriguing and the author's genuine empathy and wit refreshing. Nonetheless due to the problems mentioned above this piece is mostly recommended for people interested in the area, rather than a stand-out work of non-fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODVYN7S0XV37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K21GLY#wasThisHelpful","RODVYN7S0XV37","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess somewhat consistent with the lengthy subtitle, when reading The Lady and her Monsters I found it difficult to discern the main theme. Was this a biography of Mary Shelley, a dissection of dissection, or a review of the novel Frankenstein's Monster itself?The content is enjoyable nonetheless, I think the historic review of cadaver-snatching, galvanic experiments and society at that time's general view of morbid topics was the strongest thread. Focus on the actual novel was altogether too short, and the sections of Mary Shelley's life while vaguely interesting felt more like a summary of the various dramas in her life as opposed to the links between the 'real life Frankenstein's' and her writing.I learnt quite a bit reading this book, although due to the above reasons I can see why some would be frustrated with this particular piece.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VO0OLUNUTX3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006202583X#wasThisHelpful","R2VO0OLUNUTX3F","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And so it goes: Slaughterhouse-Five has honestly been on my to-read list since highschool. Its one of the few study-able novels available in my class that I didn't follow-up and read for my own enjoyment at some point.So, my first surprise was that I had strongly linked this novel to the idea of aliens. For some reason I had convinced myself that the Slaughterhouse is question was actually an alien thing, something like Soylent Green but in space.What actually happens instead is the main character Billy Pilgrim believes (incorrectly or not is not truly resolved) that he has been abducted by time-bending aliens and his life is narrated in non-linear fashion (think Time Traveler's Wife mixed with Butterfly effect)As a literary novel I thoroughly enjoyed the oddness of it, it is the best book I've read?

"Pre spoilers:Wool has the most amazing beginning I've read for some time - without giving too much aware, there is a optimum balance between action/plot and dystopian world creation, I was sucked in within a few pages and held for a hundred.SPOILER ALERTAbout the middle was where the two stars got lost. After the shock of the first few chapters and the jubilation of Jules escaping the silo, the story seemed to descend into cheesy one liners and a war that failed to interest me whatsoever, whether this was the unmemorable minor characters involved or the dull prose I couldn't tell. Jules seemed to muck around in her new Silo doing very little but somehow risking her life in the mix.The final conclusion almost perked me up, and was looking to be intensely tragic and/or exciting, but just kind of resolved almost comically without much (believable) explanation.END SPOILERS (as if you're still reading this review if you're avoiding spoils)In conclusion I think Wool is worth it - the world Howey is built is equally intriguing and harsh, the characters and specific plotlines themselves, in my opinion let the story down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BLC7Z56R7I54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00873GRU4#wasThisHelpful","R2BLC7Z56R7I54","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether this product will be enjoyed depends strongly on the rationale of purchase. If you're a fan of the play and simply wish to own a copy of the script, then obviously this is all for you.If like me you have not nor are likely to see the play, the script itself is passable, although one spends the entire time wondering how well the characters would be acted as opposed to truly enjoying the story. Luckily the 'book' comes with an intro from the writers, a pair of interviews, and a behind the scenes journal which will satisfy fans of the play, and readers who want some form of material from Rankin to immerse themselves within.In total, Dark Road is a welcome brief diversion - an intriguing insight into the creation of a crime-thriller stage-play, and recommended for fans of the author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Q9Y5V16NBY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRIFYHG#wasThisHelpful","R14Q9Y5V16NBY4","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, OK, so where do I begin with this book? I guess I'll start with the best description I can muster: A Mils & Boon romance set on a pirate ship (apparently this has been done before despite being second only in unlikeliness to Dinosaur erotica) stretched to more than 600 pages through endless mind numbing information dumps about sailing and 'character development'The first warning I was reading a book I probably should have put down, was the beginning chapter being in pure 'pirate' with so much copious boat-speak I found myself balking before the story even started. Luckily from chapter two onward the prose is somewhat ordinary, however there was a constant jarring bounce between forced lingo and plain language that I constantly found myself thrown out of the story.Such as the story was - the entire first part is devoted to our main characters Cate and Nathan (honestly couldn't Lynne have picked names at least a little nautical sounding) running away from each other while somehow sharing the Captain's cabin at night (a curtain apparently is all needed.)The second and third parts pick up slightly with more action, although almost every fight is depicted by our main character Cate fretting about Nathan's wellbeing. without actually getting to see much of whats going on (which generally wasn't much). Unless you're actually drawn into the romance of Nathan and Cate, there really is little tension to carry the novel, the book reads more as a series of piratey experiences of Cate while Nathan avoid each other.SPOILER ALERTThe worst thing about this book is after 600 pages of dithering and finally getting some resolution the plot is thrown pointlessly into the need for a sequel, I honesty would have preferred an unhappy conclusion to the threat of another book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LHG39AM120W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009B8VSAI#wasThisHelpful","R11LHG39AM120W","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You're Next is the consummate thriller novel; the main character Mike W is a 'getting there' middle-class builder with a 'fosterling' past, a beautiful yet precocious daughter and a wife that matches. Somewhat randomly his family is tormented by a pair of dicey strangers, and he has to call on his dubious childhood friend 'Shep' to help them out.Everything about this novel is the ideal crime-thriller, a good balance between creep factor and straight out action, pure-evil bad-guys and desperate good guys all combine to somewhat satisfying read.I only have a few complaints...First the title - honestly YOU'RE NEXT. That has got to be the ugliest title splashed across the book I've ever seen.Second - this book is actually too polished. All the chapters, events, characters developments all feel straight out of a book on how to write a thriller novel. I felt like the book was a soul-less product, planned edited and executed. The good guys were too perfect, even their flaws were crafted perfected to keep the book comfortably in the 'commercial novel' zone, the bad guys were (evil) cardboard.Last (but perhaps not least) You're Next is too long. Less time could have been spent on Mike's past, as all this essentially did was introduce us to Shep and explain Mike's background which probably could have been done quicker. By the time the plot was finally revealed it all became very long-winded and verging on unbelievable, certainly not a plot-line that skillfully tied together multiple themes and characters in an intriguing story.Basically if crime thrillers are YOUR thing YOU'RE NEXT will be a good read. If you prefer something a bit more original - not for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7WIMSM2YTZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I1KKNE#wasThisHelpful","R1D7WIMSM2YTZD","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked this series, particularly the fact I had no idea how it was going to end. Would gross mutations be revealed to the world? Would our beloved characters defeat evil but live in the FAYZ for the remainder of their days?Although beginning Light, I started to get a little worried. The Gaiaphage embodied was mostly described by Diana, who was having mummy issues and couldn't seem to decide whether she liked her child or not. The child itself quickly grew from infant to teenage (probably to make the fight scenes less bizarre) although I couldn't shake the image of a superpowered baby rampaging the FAYZ.Plot was a little light and the battle heavy, good thing Grant does excellent fight scenes. Without giving too much away before a spoiler section, there was death, redemption and horror galore and if anything the danger for the characters was 'almost' on par with GoT.SPOILER ALERTSSo what really bothered me about the book was the final conclusion(s.) The fight with Gaia was sufficiently epic and enjoyable, but I was confused by Little Pete, the Gaia seemed to believe that Pete needed a 'norm' to possess and was slaughtering them - yet Pete ended up in a Moof? Incidentally the showdown between Gaia and Pete was brief and uninteresting. While I actually respect Grant's simple explanation for the whole fiasco because I wasn't reading the books for the sci-fi factor, the conclusion of everything essentially disappearing and the only beef being what charges the state wanted to bring against the children seemed a little 'meh'And really what was with Sam's final showdown with Drake? Not only did he not have to do go back to fight him, he didn't defeat him he just got to watch what happened when his powersource went flat.Anyway not totally despondent about the end to this series, it was sufficiently brutal, I just felt Grant should have pushed the bizarre factor and crafted an ending no-one expected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8QP8ZPZTEVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LOLHA#wasThisHelpful","R3A8QP8ZPZTEVE","AHHU34NT0HTR1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHU34NT0HTR1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its all here---the original peoples, the Spanish explorers, the Mexican settlers, the American settlers, the wars, and Texas as part of Mexico, Texas as an independent nation, and Texas as part of the United States.

The children are placed with an absurdly cheap shopkeeper and his mousy sister for the war's duration, and they are very unhappy there, suffering from the shopkeeper's frugality and the sister's inability to stand up to her brother. Nevertheless, Carrie and Nick gradually form a relationship with the two, and come to see the underlying reasons for the miserly ways of the shopkeeper and the fearfulness of the sister, as they grow to know the household of an estranged sibling of the two. Very complex characters, and that's the great strength of this story.

"I picked up You Can Never Find a Rickshaw When It Monsoons: The World on One Cartoon a Day by Mo Willems at a library sale last week. You know Mo Willems, right? The amazing children's picture book author, he of Pigeon fame and Knuffle Bunny fame, universally adored by children of all sizes and ages (even those of us who are 58). If you know who he is, then you know why I couldn't possibly pass up this book for a buck. I read the blurb on the back, telling You Can Never Find a Rickshaw is a compilation of cartoons Willems drew during a round-the-world trip he took in 1990. He made one cartoon a day, each a drawing to help him recall the quirkiest thing that happened that day.But here was the most amazing thing about this little $1 buy:Autographed!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EKZU1FDUH67O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00POFB0NC#wasThisHelpful","R1EKZU1FDUH67O","A1E2NA2F4RTQ9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E2NA2F4RTQ9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im planning a celebratory forty-year-anniversary visit to Yellowstone later this summer. To prepare, Im slowly reading a lot of Yellowstone-ish books. This one is a collection of excerpts from the stories of early travelers to Yellowstone. Truman Everts got separated from his exploration party and spent thirty-seven days alone in Yellowstone, for example...now thats a story. Any number of wild animal attacks. A surprising number of people who were burned badly from geysters. I loved reading about the group of explorers that tentatively divided up, pre-park, Yellowstones great sites and contemplated the riches each might obtain from future tourists there. If you are headed to Yellowstone or you just love Yellowstone, this is a book you will want to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9OOQYPPJQHHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002T24SUK#wasThisHelpful","R9OOQYPPJQHHX","A1E2NA2F4RTQ9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E2NA2F4RTQ9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What would it be like to spend your life (more than thirty years of it) working in the copy room of The New Yorker, agonizing over whether to hyphenate a word or add a comma? Part of the fun is the who; Norris isnt checking spelling and firming up sloppy writing for seventh-graders, after all, but for the likes of some of our worlds greatest writers. Part of the fun is also the puzzling through the sometimes contradictory rules, and reflecting on The New Yorkers stylish grammar choices amid the contradictions (always doubling the final consonant before adding a suffix, for example...interesting).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQY09UC9M45L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393240185#wasThisHelpful","R1WQY09UC9M45L","A1E2NA2F4RTQ9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E2NA2F4RTQ9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far I am really liking this cable.  It feels very sturdy; I like the corded variety.  I don't have a gold phone, so it doesn't match mine, so can't say as to how well it matches.

"I really love this book.  The writing style is superb.  I feel like I'm right there in the midst of everything, instead of reading a book. I had hoped to learn a lot in this book, but hadn't been expecting it to be such an engaging read.I went to school in the 60s and 70s, and we NEVER got beyond WW2 (if we got that far) in any of the history classes I had.  All the history we had on labor unions (I can STILL see the pictures of Samuel Gompers) was just SO boring!  However, what I got in this book was totally different.  I ordered this book  because I wanted to learn what happened regarding the Rust Belt, which I had just found out about several months ago (had never HEARD of the Rust Belt till I saw it as the reason for low house prices in this area).  What I got instead, were lessons in MY history.  Things that were going on while I was growing up (and after) that I never knew about.  Things I didn't hear on the news, or anywhere else, because I was in a totally different area of the country, where we have no manufacturing.  (My grandfather had been a general manager in a cement plant and he despised unions, as did my father.  I wonder if he would have despised them so much had he been a worker bee, rather than a manager!)This story was about OUR people!  Our friends and relatives and neighbors.  This was so different than in school, where you are just taught about a large ''general'' group of people.  I could RELATE to these people, and what they went through.  And on both sides, actually.  The company had to turn a profit, and it had to keep up with all that was going on.  The workers needed to keep up with inflation, and wanted to feel that they were worthy, after all the hard work they put in.  They both had totally valid points of view.This story is about so much more than one or two towns.  This story shows what has happened to us as a nation, and what is continuing to this day.  The greed today knows no bounds.  Almost all the jobs are gone from this country.  We had such a huge backbone with our factories.  And now, they're just not there anymore.I've been looking at many of the beautiful old homes that are abandoned and falling apart.  Nobody wants them; nobody cares.  Nobody wants to live in these towns anymore.  The towns that used to be full of our friends and relatives are almost deserted.  What the H has happened to middle America?  What has happened to our jobs?  Our economy?  Our children?  How has it all come to this?I am sick at heart as I write this.  For all of us.  This writer has done a great job in showing us a blow by blow picture of what has happened, in a microcosm.  And how greed in the right place, can hurt so many people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLXFDNJIMHCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199765618#wasThisHelpful","RTLXFDNJIMHCZ","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't like this book very much; was not what I expected at all.  I thought I would be learning about Hatshepsut.  Instead, I was just told over and over ad nauseum what she MIGHT have done, what she MIGHT have thought, what she PERHAPS said and whom she PERHAPS loved.  I think there would have been a much better to write a lot of this, while showing it's speculation, but not having the same things repeating over and over.I DID get out of the book that they don't know much about what really went on.  All they had was what the records say that were left for posterity, and of course they all said exactly what they wanted them to say.  There was no Josephus or anyone to write up what REALLY went on.  Most of what we are given is probably a slick lie, just because they COULD do it!I had always been interested in Hatshepsut, and was excited to think I was finally going to learn all about her.  I  DID learn that she had shared the kingship as coking, with Thutmose III.  I really don't understand that, as I had thought she was the only legitimate king they could find.  I would have thought that after Thutmose came of age, that Hatshepsut would have been retired from the Kingly office!  This book DID make me wonder what really did go on behind the scenes, as far as said kingship between the two of the.  I had always supposed that since the  Pharoahs were supposed to be gods, that whoever was in at the time would have had to be the correct person, and you would not NEED two kings!I also felt that the author did not like Hatshepsut at all, and I got the impression of a strong dislike at times.  That might not be true, but it was the impression that I got.The book did have historical Egyptian information in it, which was good.  I always like learning about history.  Just hope some of what I learned was really ''for real!''","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VGH29RUJ8N4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956768#wasThisHelpful","R1VGH29RUJ8N4P","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with this book.  As far as the things that happened to him being unbelievable, I would say there are plenty of the same such unbelievable things in Autobiography of a Yogi, the Bible, and many other religious texts.  It doesn't matter whether your Buddhist or not, as far as believing in miracles go.  We can't know for sure either way, as we weren't there.  But I would not throw the book out with the bathwater over miraculous happenings.The book is very well written.  I didn't think I was going to get interested in it at first.  The first few chapters were extremely dull to me.  But it picked up a little later, and I found the whole book very fascinating.  It actually reminded me a lot of Autobiography of a Yogi.  And there were yogis in the book with the Buddhists, which I thought was fun; I've always had a lot of respect for both.I was also impressed with the amount of research that went into this book, and how the author was able to make the book so readable.  I do have to say though that all the names were kind of overwhelming to me.  It was kind of hard getting used to them, and many of them I found totally unpronouncable.  But I kind of just fudged (and sludged) my way thru those parts of the book.I didn't care for the part of the book where Sogyal was told that if he didn't find his cohort and have her with him, that he would not live as long nor would he be able to do all the things he was supposed to do.  That just rubbed me the wrong way for some reason.  But who knows!I enjoyed reading this type of book again; I haven't read any like this for a long time, and they are very enjoyable and inspiring to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQBUXTMEVXFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140194146X#wasThisHelpful","R2YQBUXTMEVXFV","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really great, especially considering they are gluten free.  They were easy to make.  I used coconut oil, with a bit of melted butter for additional yummy flavor.Love it when I find a product that tastes really good, and also doesn't have lots of really bad ingredients in it (HFCS, GMOs, etc.).  I don't have to go gluten free, but I feel it's probably better to do that if you can, so it's really a GOOD thing!These make a great snack for sometimes, but due to the sugar content (which is not good, but is certainly better than HFCS), will try not to eat these very often, and make them a rare snack for very special occasions!The company seems to be very good from what I can see, and I plan to try other items by them also!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W7MW1KT6Y9SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHSV6VM#wasThisHelpful","R2W7MW1KT6Y9SK","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am writing this purely as a normal consumer with no need to use advertising, etc.  I believe this book would be valuable to someone who needs to capture the attention of the public, especially using advertising.It had some very interesting things in it, but there were other things in it that bored me to tears and I could hardly get through!  He used lots of examples in the book, and if you weren't familiar with what he was using, it made it much harder to make sense of.  However, he did have lots of things I am familiar with, and when he talked about those it was easy to follow and relate to.  I didn't always agree with everything he said, even though he's a professional and I'm not!It was interesting to find out how much work goes into certain sounds/songs in commercials, TV shows, movies, etc.  I always thought it very important to come up with really good jingles for commercials.  There are lots of them I remember from the 60s.  But now?  Not so much.  I think the quality has gone way down (even as the technology as improved by leaps and bounds).  The same with TV show theme songs!  The ones Sherwood Schwartz wrote, I can remember word for word.  But nowadays they can't even HAVE comeon theme songs, because the commercials are MUCH more important than the TV show.  I just see that the creativity doesn't exist in the shows anymore.  I guess that's because they're putting their creativity in the sounds to try to entice you to watch/listen to something.  I mean, everything he talked about that was put into one Superbowl game just seemed totally insane.  It USED to be that the superbowl was (hopefully) a good football game you watched.  If you read this book, you will learn that that is a totally misguided thing to think!  (And this is probably why I stopped watching them years ago!)  I think there is a whole chapter in the book just devoted to the one Superbowl game.All in all I think this book included some really good information.  Parts of the book were very interesting and readable; other parts were not.  I think it might be very good for someone who is starting out in a business, and may be able to get some ideas for advertising and other things to do that could help your business get off the ground.  Other than that, I think this is kind of a hit and miss book.  Some people will really love it, and other people not so much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352LK6F98ZWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544191749#wasThisHelpful","R352LK6F98ZWK","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My only problem with them is how HEAVY they are!  They have a fairly thick piece of wood (well, thick for a placemat) in between the mat and the cork backing.  They call it hardboard (which I had never heard of before).  Between the weight and the cork, they do NOT move around on the table!

"This is a pretty little necklace.  I LOVE the rose gold plate.  This is the first rose gold I have ever had and I really like it.The diamonds are barely visible.  In fact, from some angles, you can't tell there is any sparkle at all, it just looks silver like the metal.  The silver chain is very pretty.I think it would be nice for a young girl, but would definitely not recommend it for an anniversary or birthday present for the girl/woman in your life!  But for a girl aged 12-17 or so, this would be a really nice present.  It is a very pretty design, and I think also that this might be much better with the 1/2 ct weight instead of the 1/4 ct weight.  With the 1/4 ct, you just really can't even find the diamonds.

"I haven't read any civil war books in a while.  This one is way different than any I had read before.  I had never given a thought to spies in the war, ESPECIALLY the Civil War.  I just didn't think there really were any!  But after reading this book, I am fairly well convinced that the battles and even wth the War, were won and lost because of the spies!To start with, the book was GREAT!  A really fun read, and hard to put down.  That's not saying that everything in the book was fun.  There were many horrendous things in there.  But there were just so many things in the whole book I had never thought of before.  I.e., what it's like living wth your city under occupation by the enemy, and what it's like being ostracized in your city after you have been outted as being a spy for the enemy while living as one of them, and what it's like living in the army while camouflaging your sex!  And riding from place to place as a civilian and how you get thru the different guards on the roads.  And how you hide the enemy.The book was just fascinating to me, while also being very informative and also fun!  I mean, I had never heard of Belle Boyd before.  Reading about her made me wonder if she was the character that Scarlett O'Hara was based on!  What an absolute pistol she was!  And totally fearless!  The other 3 ladies had the sense to be afraid at times, but Belle didnt have that particular problem!All of these ladies did magnificently in wartime, but once the was over, they seemed to lose their sense of direction, which was kind of sad.  I definitely need to find out more about Belle, and have ordered a book on her (there are several).  Belle even found out things from Yankee soldiers who KNEW she was a spy!  Just unreal!  A true southern belle!This book really opened my eyes on how much information spies were able to obtain, and how helpful the information was to the troops.  Right down to having a slave working for Jefferson Davis who was able to get all types of information every day and send along up north.  Just unreal!  They had quite a system going with that.I totally recommend this book.  Very enjoyable and informative at the same time.  As well as helping you actually get the feel of what it was like living in these cities during the time of war.  (I had been able to imagine living in the country from GWTW, but not living in the cities in both sides of the conflict.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392U6DI4E9GTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062092898#wasThisHelpful","R392U6DI4E9GTB","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have read well over a hundred books on the Holocaust, the death camps and survivors.  Every one I have read has touched me in some way, usually in many ways.  This book is no different.  World War 2 is one of the most horrific things that has happened to this planet.  So many different peoples hurt in so many different ways.  I don't really understand it, but to me it feels like all of these people's stories need to be told.  These people should not have suffered like they did, and it's a sin for people not to know about it and be in their shoes and feel their hopelessness and pain for a little while, while they learn what happened to them.  This is the reason I read these books; they actually pull at my soul.That being said, this is another special book, telling the stories of what parents and children went through when trying whatever they could to save their children.  These people had some happy endings, but of course there are also many tragedies as well.  These children were denied their childhoods, and had to become little grownups overnight.  To laugh and giggle and play and run around could mean certain death at times.  I feel the pain and hardship the parents and children endured.  And how strong and good the people were who helped them.  It reminded me of Corrie Ten Boom, and The Hiding Place.  Beautiful stories of loving, courageous people who risked their own lives to help others.I would definitely recommend this book.  It is beautifully written, and hard to put down until you finish.  It is not nearly as graphic as many holocaust stories, but it is very helpful to learn what happened to some who weren't put in camps during the war.  My feeling is that this book would be great for a teenager that one wanted to start teaching about the Holocaust.  Of ocurse it isn't taught in school anymore, so if you want your children to learn about it, you need to teach them yourselves, pretty much.  When I was in school in the 60s we learned about it, but not that much.  I remember two pictures.  One of people in striped pajamas staring hopelessly out of a tall fence, and one of people who were nothing but bones (mainly men with no shirts on and hardly able to keep their pants up).My love and admiration go out to all the people who lived through these times and survived, as well as the people who helped them to live through it, and also the people who help tell their stories now.  These people need to be heard and they need to be loved, as they are all us.  All of us are people that these things could happen to and the world has to learn what happened and make sure that these things are never EVER repeated.My thanks to the author and all who shared their lives with the readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VKIB78K53OUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062297104#wasThisHelpful","R3VKIB78K53OUV","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is not as involved and indepth on medical topics as some of the other books, it has more general information.  But it really does a great job of showing the reasons that it is good to try going wheatfree.  It makes a really good reference book to keep closeby in case you have any questions about what to eat.  This book has some great recipes in it, by the way.  ANd I like the way it's laid out, too.  Easy to find information in.  Definitely recommend this book for use in going wheatfree.

"For about the last 7-8 years or so, I have been extremely interested in anything Valkyrie.  I have about 4 different movies on it, and have read several different books on it, and as soon as I became aware of it, I started a Rememberance on July 20th at my home, for Claus von Stauffenberg.  A wonderful man.  What a brave man he was to try what he did.  Additionally, while being very interested in most things WW2, I have been very interested in it from the standpoint of the German soldier, as well as the Americans.  I remember one particular book I read by a German soldier and what he/they went through, and it was fantastic read, from a man in the trenches (Soldat: Reflections of  a German Soldier).  My father's family was German and I was interested in how Hitler affected the German soldiers and the people.  (Also, when I was a kid, Combat was my favorite TV show starting when I was 5 years old!)I have read many different aspects of WW2, and the most shocking thing I heard about Hitler (to me of course) was when he ordered the destruction of the German Infrastructure, so the Allies would get no use out of it.  I knew he was a monster before that, but when I read what he would do to his own people, I was just stunned!I wanted to give you some of my WW2 history before I gave my review.  I already knew a lot of the things in this book, due to my extensive studying.  I REALLY love this book!  I like books that go out and find out all the details there are to glean on these types of topics, and this book did a wonderful job.  I had so much respect for Speer (for what he did at this particular time I mean) and Rommel and von Stauffenberg.  (I had always really wished that Rommel had been the head of Germany instead of Hitler, and thought of what he might have accomplished with the country.)  So many of the German people were just like your next door neighbors.  This whole war was so very sad to me.  So much waste and destruction and grief.  And tha'ts not even getting INTO the holocaust aspect and The Final Solution.I am grateful to the author for putting together all this great information like he did, on this topic, since it has been of interest to me for years.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting information on this topic, for people wanting information on the side of the Germans during the war and how they handled it, and also to anyone who would like more information on WW2.  This book is beautifully written, researched and notated.P.S.  I went to the FInd A Grave website once on 7/20 and was reading the comments people were leaving for von Stauffenberg.  One person had merely written  ''damn oak table!''  I found that to be a brilliant summation in 3 words, for that day.  I truly admire all who stood up to that monster, because they knew the risks and defied him anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0EVPLR0XC3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199927928#wasThisHelpful","R3B0EVPLR0XC3V","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was just a lovely, heartwarming book, through and through. A beautiful story!  It was extremely readable and very hard to put down.  I have never before read a book on someone finding their biological parent, though of course I had thought about this kind of thing my whole life, and seen lots of stories on TV, both true and  fictional.After reading this, you totally feel like you know these people.  They are just larger than life in the book.  And as another plus, it was great learning things about Nat King Cole and his family, and how they lived in the times they did--that was just a huge bonus!I totally recommend this book.  It is heartwarming, poignant and fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCBJXLDIN2DRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062103172#wasThisHelpful","RCBJXLDIN2DRR","AJWQKYD4B4Q8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJWQKYD4B4Q8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very impressed with this book, and with the author.  This book had loads of really good information and tips, which are good in general, even if you should decide not to go with the Alkaline Cure.  What I really loved about this writing style is how simple it was.  You didn't have to think about what he was saying, or analyze it.  It was all right there and very straightforward.  Also, when he said you need to do something, he explained why.  I tend to not do things if I don't  understand WHY I'm to be doing (or not doing) them, and understand why it's important and helpful.  The book is not real long, you can read and understand the concept in a sitting or two.  He includes a section for 14 days worth of menus, and a section with recipes for what is on there.  The recipes are not too hard or elaborate or timeconsuming, for the most part!  What I really love, is on the 2 page format for each day, which includes the menu, he also tells you what  you need to prepare for the next day ahead of time, so you can really judge your whole day, without having an ugly surprise later, knowing you should have made something a day or two in advance and you didn't.I was familiar with a lot of the information in this book.  There were several things in here that are included with Macrobiotics (such as chewing the food many times, and not drinking with meals).  He explained the reasoning behind this which is so helpful, which I noted above.  There also are not snacks included on this, which helps your leptin get regulated.  Also info on not eating at night which is important, and he explains.  Acid/alkaline is also an important aspect of Macrobiotics.  Herman Aihara did a GREAT little book on acid and alkaline, but it was MUCH harder to understand than this book.  (Herman got much more technical, to say the least!)I found this book to be very inspiring!  And the inclusion of the pH litmus to test yourself is totally cool!

"I bought the new Roku 2 and the new Roku 3.  (Yes - I love this stuff.)  I think I'll return the Roku 3.  The new Roku 2 includes a lightning fast processor (which is actually the same processor as the new Roku 3, but with a lower price tag).  The best feature of Roku 2 is that it shows you the cheapest source for each movie, which can save a lot of money in the long run.  (The new Roku 3 also has this feature, but Apple TV and Fire TV do not.)MAIN NEW FEATURESFaster processor  The main reason to buy a Roku 2 is that it has a really fast processor at a cheap price.  The fast processor makes moving through menu options to find shows very fast.  It also has shorter loading times (if your internet connection is quick enough).  After using this processor, going back to a slower processor would drive me crazy.Other new features  The new Roku 2 does not have many other substantial new features, but still includes the many great features that Roku has developed over the years.  The new Roku 2 can be boiled down to a really fast processor at a good price and the ability to instantly see which source is renting each movie for the cheapest price.WHATS NOT INCLUDEDHere are a few other things youll need:- Internet- Credit card (to pay for movies and shows ... most require a subscription or rental fee)- HDMI cable- Mount (If you have a WALL-MOUNTED TV, youll need a mount to attach Roku to your TV.)UNLOCKED ECOSYSTEMThe main reason to buy a Roku is that Roku is not trying to push you towards certain content providers.  Apple TV, for example, does not allow you to access shows and movies from many sources.  Fire TV tries to encourage you to buy content from Amazon (although a few other content providers are available if you look for them).  Unlike Apple TV and Fire TV, Roku makes it easy to search for shows and movies from many sources AND lets you see how much different providers charge for shows and movies.  This difference is IMPORTANT  If you want to watch a certain movie, youll love instantly seeing which source rents the movie for lowest price!  Bottom line  Youll probably save money in the future by renting shows and movies via Roku 2.DIFFERENCE FROM OLD ROKU 2The most important thing to note is that the new Roku 2 is very similar to the old Roku 2, which one exception  The new Roku 2 includes a much faster processor than the old Roku 2.  If you want to be able to search for shows faster and load shows faster, then upgrading to the new Roku 2 is a smart move.  Note  If your internet connection is slow, then Roku 2s faster processor will not help load shows faster.DIFFERENCE FROM APPLE TVRoku 2 will enable you to access shows and movies from many more sources (often with lower rental prices).  The Roku 2 interface might not be quite as simple as the Apple TV interface, but Roku 2s interface is still easy to use.DIFFERENCE FROM FIRE TVFire TV provides access to several sources of shows and movies, but Roku 2 provides access to more sources of shows and movies (perhaps more sources than youll ever need).  Roku also makes finding the cheapest price much easier (by instantly showing you prices from different sources).  As of today, Roku 2 does not have games (unlike Fire TV).DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER ROKU PLAYERSBoth the new Roku 2 and Roku 3 include the same fast processor and 1080p (HD) resolution.  Buy Roku 3 if you want voice search on your remote (rather than by downloading an app on your phone), you want headphones, or you want to pick from a few simple games.  Otherwise, buy Roku 2.  Roku 1 also has 1080p (HD) resolution, but the processor is much slower.  Only buy Roku 1 if you dont mind a slower user interface and other delays.  Dont buy the Roku stick  you deserve better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6J1XLXVOOSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJ3IREE#wasThisHelpful","R1F6J1XLXVOOSS","A1PQHPE3S51Z18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PQHPE3S51Z18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INTRODUCTION  The new Roku 3 is very easy to setup and use.  The processor is extremely fast.  The user interface makes accessing countless shows and movies simple and intuitive.  Rokus best feature is that it helps you find the cheapest source for each movie.MAIN NEW FEATURESVoice search  The voice recognition is not perfect, but it definitely beats trying to scroll to type one letter at a time!  While its great to have voice search built into the remote, you can just download the app for your phone to use voice search with older Rokus.  (As a result, you dont need to buy a new Roku 3 to get voice search, but the Roku 3 remotes voice search doesnt have reliability issues like the app.)Other new features  Well, in my opinion, there are not many other substantial new features.  That being said, the new Roku 3 is still an amazing player (because it has the same great features as the old Roku 3).  I cannot tell any difference in processor speed between the old Roku 3 and the new Roku 3.WHATS NOT INCLUDEDRoku 3 actually includes almost everything youll need.

"My boys LOVED this car maker.  They learned all about injection molding and had a fabulous time Christmas morning making cars.  They don't actually get to do too much of the process because the maker does most of it, but they didn't mind at all.  This was all they wanted to do on Christmas morning...until it BROKE not once, but twice.  My son learned that if you don't load the wax sticks point first, two wax points will end up touching inside the first chamber and slip off of each other when you're trying to press the sticks in.  This creates a jam of two sticks stuck in the first chamber and no way to push them into the melting chamber.  The jam occurred where you can't easily access the sticks, so it took a long time for my engineer husband to fix the problem.  Sure, my son should have loaded the wax with the point first, but this is a toy for kids--Mattel should have anticipated things like wax jams would happen and at least create parental access to the chamber or at least make it harder for a wax jam to occur.  The wax sticks have tiny tips--it really isn't apparent the tip should go in first.  Lesson learned.So, the first jam was repaired by my handy husband who designs things for a living.  My kids proceeded to make a half dozen more cars when the car maker broke...again.  Who knows what's wrong with it this time.  My husband says he'll look at it later because the last repair sucked up an afternoon.  This toy should be more durable.  I don't spend $40 anticipating a toy will last an afternoon.  I was also lucky enough to find wax refills, so I dumped $25 on those, plus $10 on another mold set.  In total, I spent $75 on a toy that lasted a day.  Not good, Mattel.Also, Amazon won't let me return the car maker because I purchased it at the end of October from their Holiday Toy List for my kids for Christmas.  What that Holiday Toy List didn't mention was that Amazon's Christmas return policy of a January 31 return deadline didn't start until November 1st.  So even though I purchased the item from their Holiday Toy List that was out at the end of October and didn't give the toy to my kids until Christmas, I am unable to return it because 30 days has passed from my purchase date.

"Apple invested an amazing amount of resources to make the iPhone thin.  I am sure their engineers struggled to remove each millimeter.  Why undo all that work by using a thick case?  This case keeps iPhone THIN.  It also has a clear back so people can see that you have the new iPhone.

"Let me start by saying I'm buying copies of this CD to include with every family member's Christmas gift this year.  It's that good.I don't really listen to this kind of music anymore, but I purchased this album to give to a family member for her birthday and CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD IT IS.  I used to listen to Jon Schmidt back in the day (we're talking 90s here) when I was a teenager and he was just starting out.  I purchased his very first album when it was newly released and used to go to his concerts when they were held in little tiny venues.  ""All of Me"" was my favorite song, and I spent hours at the piano perfecting it.Fast forward almost two decades. I hadn't listened to Jon's music in years, and I was blown away by how good this album is.  Just...WOW.  I've been listening to it nonstop all afternoon as I've been designing my Christmas cards, and it's truly inspiring.  I could listen to ""Where Are You Christmas?"" on repeat all day.  I am duly impressed.  Count me as a re-converted fan!P.S. As I went to purchase tickets to the Piano Guys Christmas concert to give to my parents (and saw the prices) my husband and I had a little chuckle as we remembered attending one of Jon's concerts back in the day at our university.  I think the tickets were $5 and the room where it was held (not even a theater) wasn't even full.  Jon, you've come a long way and deserve every bit of success!

"This movie is an instant classic!  Wow, what a gem!  It will stand beside (maybe even replace?) ""Pride and Prejudice"" as THE period piece of all period pieces!Let me just say, I rarely buy DVDs (especially without viewing them first), and I rarely watch movies again in a short time span.  However, after reading the reviews of this movie and finding my local library did not have it, I purchased the film.  I AM SO HAPPY I DID BECAUSE IT SURPASSED ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS!  This movie is so HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL and STUNNING that I have owned it for only five days and I've already watched it twice--and I can't wait to watch it again!  This movie just draws you in--it's so romantic and yet subtle, and it does a fabulous job exploring the social issues created by the Industrial Revolution.  It truly takes you on a remarkable journey, sweeping you off your feet!  The film makes you take a keen interest in the characters' lives, and you can't turn it off until you find out how it ends.  (And the ending is SUPERB!  *SIGH*  You will love it!  It's definitely THE most romantic movie ending I've ever seen, and it's accomplished with ""less is more"".  It's so tender and beautiful that I predict you'll watch the last 8 minutes over and over!)The characters and their development are FABULOUS!  Mr. Thornton is so complex and has so many dimensions--you come to appreciate what a compelling character he is after exploring his motivations and thoughts during the course of the film.  And to see how tender he is at the end (and to see him smile!) is so breathtaking and satisfying!  Richard Armitage is STUNNING in this role.  He gives the performance of a lifetime--a certain classic.  He really made Mr. Thornton into a real person, a person you want to understand and want Margaret to love.  WOW!  I have to admit, I thought Daniela Denby-Ashe was a little weak as Margaret (she was just a little too breathy and whiny at moments for me), but Richard Armitage made up for everything and was SUPERB.  Truly outstanding!I'm on a period-movie kick right now (much to my husband's dismay!) and have watched ""Wives and Daughters"", A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice"", the new ""Pride and Prejudice"", and ""North and South"" over the space of two weeks.  I have to say, ""North and South"" is the one that I can't stop thinking about.  The music is hauntingly gorgeous, and the story has so many fabulous dimensions to draw you in.  You will not be disappointed!  An absolute classic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352FEV3U3NYGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AYEL6U#wasThisHelpful","R352FEV3U3NYGU","A1PQHPE3S51Z18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PQHPE3S51Z18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this doll for my 3-year-old daughter for Christmas, and I have to say, I'm really impressed.  It's amazing to hear it say your child's name!  You can also program it with three other names that Dora will incorporate into the things she says, which I love.  She really does ""know"" every name you can think of!  My son's name is Benson, and I thought we'd probably have to settle for Dora saying ""Benny,"" but no!  Even Benson was on her list!  My husband is a product design engineer, and even he was super impressed by the features of this doll.  They really did think of everything--you can even program it while it's still in the box!  Yes, I think it's kind of a pain that Dora can't remember more and that I'll have to reprogram her twice a week or so, but to see your daughter's face on Christmas morning when she hears Dora say her name will be priceless!NOTE FOR PARENTS PROGRAMMING THE DOLL ON CHRISTMAS EVE WHEN FISHER-PRICE IS CLOSED: When I installed the drivers for this doll on my computer that runs Windows XP, I received an error message from Microsoft saying the software hadn't been tested by Microsoft for compatibility with Windows XP and that I shouldn't install it or it might make my computer unstable, susceptible to a virus, etc.  I called Fisher-Price's customer service, and they told me the software was tested by their engineers and that it's completely safe.  They told me to click ""continue"" to install the software.  I just thought I'd pass the tip along!Again, this doll is SO unqiue!  It's definitely the hot, must-have toy for Christmas!UPDATE FOR PARENTS HAVING TROUBLE INSTALLING THE DOLL'S SOFTWARE:  I have read other reviewers saying this doll keeps giving the error message that it's not connected to the computer when it is.  The doll is not defective--it goes back to the comments I made above about installing the drivers.  To fix this problem, you just uninstall the drivers using the ""control panel"" on the start menu, and then you reinstall the drivers and make sure Windows XP knows it's okay to install the software even though Microsoft hasn't tested it.  I, too, got the error message that the doll wasn't connected when it was because when I installed the drivers the first time, I stopped the installation process when I received the Microsoft error message.  To fix the problem, just uninstall the drivers and install them again, making sure to accept the installation despite the error message.  I hope that helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF28VI71YKA76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00080VMKY#wasThisHelpful","RF28VI71YKA76","A1PQHPE3S51Z18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PQHPE3S51Z18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I, too, was SHOCKED to find Gordon Korman's funniest books out of print.  I loved his stories as a kid, especially the Bruno and Boots series, I Want To Go Home, and No Coins, Please.  Unbeknownst to me, my mom gave all of my books away while I was at college.  Now that I have children, I decided to again build my collection of Gordon Korman books so I could share these fantastic stories with them, only to find most of the classics are out of print.  This is honestly a travesty.  I have SO many wonderful memories reading this books and laughing until I cried.  I have read these books over and over and never got tired of them.  The stories are so witty and well written--the characters are fantastic!  If you have grade school kids or young teens, they will LOVE this series!

"You get what you pay for with Technivorm. SCAA certified which means you get a hot cup of coffee. I originally did not purchase this on Amazon because it was only available at another company with initials WS. Technivorm incorporates a copper heating element which makes this a better choice than the aluminum heating element used in the China made Bonavita. This machine is well made in the Netherlands and seems built to last. If there is one thing I would love to change, it would be the plastic filter basket. Not because it doesn't do it's job, I just don't care for hot water mixing with plastic, although unlike other coffee makers I purchased, this one produced no plastic tasting coffee. Wish Technivorm sold a stainless steel filter basket option.

"When I checked the log in the app to see what requests were being asked,  I was surprised to see that Alexia was picking up my conversations and recording pieces of them.  I contacted Amazon Echo Tech Support and was told to shut the mic off and just use the remote control to speak commands. That was a bit disturbing to me since the echo was not being activated by it's keyword ""Alexia.""  Instead,  it was randomly turning on, listening and recording.  Not happy about that,  so I now have the mics turned off (hopefully) and just use the remote to issue commands. However, the Echo does keep track of everything you ask it and this will appear in your app request log which you can delete.  I use it to play my prime music and did sync it with my iTunes music library and that works well.  I check news and weather and on occasion have asked questions that she could and could not answer.  It's compatible with Pandora and Audible books. Also works with iheart radio and tunein radio so you can access a lot of internet radio content.  It's also compatible with IFTTT which opens up more possibilities. It's portable and the sound quality is decent for such a small speaker. Overall, I am satisfied with the device as long as it's not spying on me now that the mic was turned off.  Has a lot of potential for further expansion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8SDXEPLII2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X4WHP5E#wasThisHelpful","R8SDXEPLII2S","A3FHDF143WLZMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FHDF143WLZMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coma is based on the 1977 novel by Robin Cook. The film stars Genevive Bujold as Dr. Susan Wheeler who becomes suspicious when her friend is left in an irreversible coma after a routine procedure. Once she uncovers evidence of other patients being left in comas after undergoing procedures in the same operating room, she fears a conspiracy.

"Product looks decent enough in the room and delivers a strong steady stream of mist. Nature sounds, which are low quality and on a very short (appox 10 second) loop, are easy enough to shut off by touching the rear button. The beeps when turning on, pressing buttons and shutting off, cannot be turned off. They are a bit annoying but no deal breaker for me. Each press of the start button increases the time from 30, 60, 120 and 180 and then off. One press of the light button emits a white light. Second press dims it and third press turns it off.My main concern about this diffuser is that the water in the tank gets very warm, almost hot which is not good for essential oils. Those who wrote an honest positive review (not those who wrote glowing reviews because they got the unit at a discounted price) need to check the water in their tanks after the diffuser has run for a couple of hours to verify the water temperature and ensure their units are functioning properly. I checked by putting my finger in the remaining water. The base and water were a bit too warm, and heat can alter or destroy certain constituents of the oils and thus the therapeutic benefit may not be as optimal. In addition, I am not comfortable with a diffuser that gets this warm as this could also be a potential fire hazard. It's possible that I received a defective unit, but my gut feeling tells me that they all run warm. I may order another and see how that goes. I will change my rating & review if it turns out the replacement machine works fine.**Update**I received my new diffuser today and filled it with water to the line, added essential oil and ran it for 1 hour before checking the water in the tank. Once again, it was very warm. So the first unit was not defective and these diffusers simply heat the water in the tank. Take this into consideration when purchasing this diffuser.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6N89SA5J5CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLBBQ9U#wasThisHelpful","R2D6N89SA5J5CF","A3FHDF143WLZMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FHDF143WLZMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two teenage boys, neighbors in a London high-rise housing project gradually become aware that they are in fact gay. This coming of age film is a small gem of a movie and a real classic. Probably one of the best gay themed film of the 90's and certainly one of my favorites!

"Sound is very good for such small speakers. I have these in my living room and they sound perfectly fine. The volume, bass and treble is more than adequate. This is my first purchase of a Sonos system and I'm very pleased.  Sonos customer service was outstanding. I had to call them you get help setting the speakers up with a NAS through my router.

"I'm sorry but I have to agree with the bad reviews here.  Very cheesy, with wooden performances and no real chemistry between the two leads. The plot?  Best friends make a pact to be together in a decade if neither finds love. With two months left in their deadline, they both scramble to find someone to avoid being each other's last resort. But guess what happens?  The problem with the film is that it's never really interesting, amusing or sexy.Scenes are totally unbelievable with superficial characters who are not really interesting and the entire film just seems insincere.  I will admit that I found the character of Myles (Jack Turner) to be quite the catch despite his endearing flaws.

"I only have this sound bar for a few days but so far,  so good.  Sound is very good for a 29 inch bar.  One of my biggest issues is dialogue.  I had problems clearly hearing the dialogue in movies on my previous bar which was quite expensive. Even the clear voice option didn't really do much and dialogue sounded muffled.  This Vizio blows away my previous bar big time. I can now hear what is being said and there is ample bass and treble settings for me as well. It has Bluetooth,  Surround sound and Tru volume which keeps the volume at an even level.

"Certainly not as good as Rec 1 and 2 but better than Rec 3 for sure. Our TV reporter ngela is rescued from the building and taken to an oil tanker to be examined. The film starts off in the building where it all began and shows her rescue. Once she's brought on board the tanker, things quickly get out of control when a rabid computer-generated zombie-monkey attacks a crew member transferring the virus into him. This is a pretty solid rollercoaster ride of a film. The acting is good and although it lacks the fear factor (and hand held camera element) of the original, it's still gory fun and entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQRN6DKGR902/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USBLWS0#wasThisHelpful","RYQRN6DKGR902","A3FHDF143WLZMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FHDF143WLZMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"15 months ago I bought my first Roku 2, a Roku 2 HD. Can't say enough good about it. When I upgraded to a 1080p HDTV in the living room I moved that 720p Roku 2 HD to the bedroom and added a Sony ""Smart"" Blu-Ray player that had Netflix, Amazon, Crackle and a few other channels for the new 1080p HDTV figuring to completely bypass adding a 1080p Roku. Even though I mainly watch the channels that were on the Sony Wi-Fi Blu Ray player I still wanted a 1080p Roku so I bought an XD last week.The reasons I prefer the Roku to the ""Smart"" Wi-Fi Blu Ray player are that the Roku is much faster to get watching since the Blu-Ray has to boot up from a cold start and the Roku of course has far more channel selection including the ability to add private channels. Adding private channels is something the Blu Ray player will not do. The Roku draws very little power, less than a nightlight and is always at the ready. Each time I started up the wi-fi enabled Blu Ray player I muttered that I needed a Roku.I was planning all along to buy the new Roku 3 but the Roku 2 XD went on sale Mother's Day week and I figured I'd be just as happy with it for less money, so I made a snap decision on an impulse buy which turns out to have been a good one. I was not needing the Roku 3's wireless headphones in the living room and I suspect that feature eats batteries in the remote faster. I don't play video games, I watch TV so I don't need the video game function of the Roku 3 either.With my first Roku 2, the HD model, setup went by the book with no issues so I never had any contact with Roku support. However with the XD I kept getting a ""011"" error. First I went online with Roku chat support, waited about 10 mins in que and was connected to a CSR. After explaining the issue and sending the IP CONFIG data the CSR requested I was instantly disconnected from chat. I pushed button to reconnect to chat and started calling the support phone number on the ROKU support page. The support phone number posted leads to a phone tree which instructs you to ""Push 3"" for player support. I pushed 3 and instantly heard a dial tone meaning I was disconnected. That's right Roku hung up on me.I tried phoning 3 more times with the same result each time. After about 15 minutes in chat que I got connected to a different CSR. While waiting in chat que I rebooted the player and it connected fine and I've not seen the error again since. I didn't change anything on my end at all! It has worked perfectly since. I don't know whether or not the CSR changed something in my network remotely that enabled it to connect and will probably never know. I've rebooted the XD unit several times to verify it reconnects with no errors. After this support experience it is easy to see why so many people get frustrated with Roku support and just give up returning the player. There is no excuse whatsoever for posting a non-working support phone number on your support webpage.While I'm not exactly thrilled with Roku's tech support I love the product itself. Both of mine are working great and I use both of them daily. I recommend them for expanding the variety of programming available in a fast, convenient, compact and economical package.With about 4 million players to support I can understand why Roku support isn't more personalized, but if they aren't actually doing phone support they should take the phone number off their support webpage because the ""click-dial tone"" after pressing 3 as instructed just increases customer frustration and makes Roku support look inept.A note about 720p vs 1080p on Roku's. There is practically no 1080p programming available! Even premium services like Netflix, Amazon, etc go 720p tops. Netflix did a 1080 HD experiment for a while however isn't currently pushing any 1080p at the moment, but this could change by the time you read this. You can get 1080p on Vudu at this moment though.Also the Wi Fi and internet bandwidth requirement for 1080p is much higher than 720p. This really became evident when watching 1080p movies on Vudu. I've ordered an upgrade on my DSL internet from 3mbs to 5 and going to a higher class of wi fi router. That will speed it up enough to make it workable without waiting as long for the streaming to start on 1080p video files and eliminate buffering pauses after streaming starts. Before going to a 1080p player like a Roku XD make sure your existing network can handle 1080p streaming or be willing and able to upgrade it. Upgrading may be a non-issue for cable modem fed wi-fi internet. In fact a 720p player like the HD model is fine for 99.5% of the programming available on Roku at this time. The only real 1080p stuff I've found is on Vudu and that is for movies you've bought the 1080p version of.I knocked off one full star for the support issues I had with this product. The product itself is a 5 star item and working great but I can't explain why it is working now when it wasn't initially. If you have connection issues out of the box as I did with this XD unit, then what good is a 5 star item that won't work with a support system that is somewhat frustrating? Some people just won't have the patience to stick with it. It took about 35 minutes to get the player to connect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203ZKTSTCZOAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CLPP8E#wasThisHelpful","R203ZKTSTCZOAP","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Toshiba model is a ""5 Star Value"" but I'm giving it a 4 star rating because it isn't the very best of the best 32-inch HDTV's out there, but good enough for my needs. Honestly for the money you can not beat this model.I also have the Toshiba 40 inch 1080p version of this same set which is about 9 months old and the great performance I've enjoyed with it is at least part of the reason I decided to go with this 32 inch 720p version for the bedroom.  I already had a ROKU HD box in the bedroom which is also 720p so the two are now working perfectly together.  If I bought a 1080p HDTV I'd feel like I needed to upgrade the ROKU also and thought I'd try this 720p TV instead figuring that really I'm not a big watch TV in bed guy.Before deciding I looked in person at this one and at 1080p 32 inch sets by two other good name brands that cost substantially more.  Really on the 32 inch sets at five feet away the difference between 720p and 1080p didn't make all that much difference and I just didn't see spending so much more money for so little benefit.  This set was to replace a non-HD CRT that was over a decade old so about anything would be an improvement.  If you must have the very best of everything you probably aren't reading reviews for this model anyway because it is not 1080p.Cons:720p not 1080p.  This is a big deal for some people, I found that to me it isn't such a big deal.Large frame around screen so it isn't as compact as other good brands with thin frames that cost a lot more.Remote sort of clunky but functional.Takes about 12 seconds to boot up.Channel changes are not instantaneous but lag about 2 seconds behind pushing the button.2 stage mute.  Push Mute button 1x and volume goes to 50%, push again and it mutes 100%.No WI-FI, SMART TV or built-in DVD/Blu-Ray, just a basic HDTV.Pros:Great picture for 720p with really good colors, no dead or stuck pixels.  Sharper than I expected.Surprisingly robust full range sound with no external sound accessories required.  A real strong point!Audio leveling tames blaring commercials but can be defeated in the setup menu if you want commercials to blare.Cheap!Good brand name.Easy to set up.Really sturdy fixed stand that also is stylish.Versatile compliment of inputs including 2 HDMI, 1 Coax, 1 Component, 1 Computer, 1 USB.Various format sound outputs, more of them than some other budget sets, including Dolby digital.Good build appearance that doesn't look like a cheapie.Low key green pilot light on front isn't overly distracting.No freaky or unpleasant odors.Fairly energy efficient with a $13 sticker on it.200x200 mounting pattern for wall mounts.All programmable & universal remotes (cable/satellite/etc) have TOSHIBA codes.Simple to set variable SLEEP timer.I shopped around quite a bit making lots of comparisons by ""showrooming"" several stores.  I decided on this one and waited for a sale.  Amazon and a local Big Box had the same sale price for President's Day but I went with Amazon because of no sales tax.  That way I could get the extended warranty for about the same cost as the TV alone at the local Big Box.  My only concern then was having to return it if damaged or malfunctioning but I know from experience Amazon is great to worth with on returns.The set arrived on time with my free 2-day Prime Member shipping.  The box had a huge gouge in one side but the TV itself was fine so the box did what it should.  Stand assembly on these takes about 3 minutes or less and requires only a Phillips head screw driver and a smooth flat surface like a bed or sofa where you can lay the display face down with the bottom hanging over the edge in order to attach the stand and secure the 4 included screws.When you first power it up it will boot to a screen that asks you to choose between HOME or RETAIL mode.  I chose HOME and then it did a channel scan which took at least 5 minutes and then was ready to go.I found the tip about turning off the automatic brightness function last summer on these Toshibas.  Turning the auto brightness off does perk up the picture and make the colors vivid.  Turning this feature off makes it look like it does in the store in ""retail"" mode.  Turning off the auto brightness does make the display run at 100% all the time so it uses slightly more energy and I suspect it also may shorten backlight life, but still if you find the picture too dark or colors too dim this is a tip worth trying so I'm repeating it here:1. Press MENU.2. Scroll Right to PREFERENCES.3. Scroll down BEYOND the bottom of the visible menu to find ENERGY SAVING SETTINGS and press enter.4. Press RIGHT control once to turn Auto Brightness Sensor to OFF.5. Press MENU and press Menu a second time to exit menu.  Done.Under PICTURE category in menu settings I suggest you leave the DYNALIGHT function ""ON"" as this is completely different from the Auto Brightness function.  Dynalight improves contrast and it looks slightly better to me with it turned on, which is the default setting.  This is especially true on night scenes or any scene with lots of dark colors such as an old black & white film.Also under the PICTURE category on the main menu I set this one to DYNAMIC mode and it looks great with no other video adjustments at all.  All the video settings were left at the default except I turned the Automatic Brightness off and set the mode to DYNAMIC.Next I adjusted the sound EQ and set the bass to +8 and the treble to +2.  It sounds amazingly good for watching movies or normal TV shows. Dialog is crystal clear and music sounds ok.  Some 32 and even 40 inch TV's have weak sound and leave you wanting more, but both my Toshibas have great sound and don't need any external sound augmentation for normal movies or TV shows.  I think Toshiba's sound is way above average because bad sounding or weak audio is a frequent complaint, even with some other good brand names.I really like this 32 inch HDTV in my bedroom.  I'd buy this exact model again, especially when it is on sale.  I really shopped around and I don't think you can do better with a top name HDTV for the money.  I looked at some cheaper ones too.  I liked this one better than the cheaper ones and better than some of the more expensive ones.  Again my previous good experience with my 40 inch Toshiba weighed heavily in my decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Z4808MUSVQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073K645A#wasThisHelpful","R8Z4808MUSVQW","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable works great with my ROKU box.  I have other HDMI cables that are built sturdier with strain relief where the cable enters the connector.  So this one gets 4 stars for the less than military spec build quality.  The more expensive cables do not perform any better, they are just built to be more durable.  I'm not constantly connecting and disconnecting these cables, so decided to give this one a try to see how it would work.  It functions perfectly with no drop outs or smearing.  If you are setting up and tearing down a lot this cable won't be as durable as some of the more costly heavy duty cables with strain relief, but for a permanent or semi-permanent installation it seems sturdy enough and on par with economy cables costing at least twice as much at the local big box.  The cable is fairly flexible and not too stiff.  Liked the frustration free packaging.  It has plastic slip covers to protect the gold plated metal on the connectors so they are in great shape after shipping.  I got it next day instead of 2-days for some reason which was super quick.  Has the Amazon logo on the connectors too.  I'd definitely buy more of these when I need them and have no reservations recommending them for a permanent type installation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLOGEGWE77C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L1ZYYM#wasThisHelpful","R3VLOGEGWE77C1","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own five other Monster products which are musical instrument cables and speaker cables.  While not my favorite brand of instrument cables they are at least 5 years old and have been 100% reliable.  So I had more than a little confidence in the brand name and the reviews were way above average.Splitters are not all the same apparently.  I knew not to try a $5 one from Walmart as those hardly ever work with cable TV.  After installing this I lost one HD cable channel which now says the signal is too low.  Otherwise the splitter works fine.  Used the Wilson brand RG6 cable to run another line to the bedroom from it.  I actually expected even more signal loss, so only losing one HD channel was acceptable for getting cable into the bedroom and I'm happy with the product.  The only way I could be happier would be if I had lost no channels at all.  For me this worked out OK and is no doubt a bit better than some of the others out there which cost just a tad less.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZ974WUZVYMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00108UNEY#wasThisHelpful","RRZ974WUZVYMP","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In spite of what you might see about it not being the right part, the part I got from Starkville Ford was exactly correct for my 2001 Grand Marquis.This is the part to fix AC/Heater fan malfunctions if:1.  You have the automatic temperature control with digital temperature readout and the readout works.2.  When operating various functions you hear the damper/actuator moving or making the hissing noise indicating it is changing functions such as changing from vent to defrost.3.  The AC/Heater fan doesn't run at all or runs only on one speed, such as high, no matter what speed the dash control is set to.  (Once the fan speed control no longer controls the fan speed it is only a matter of time before the fan will fail to run at all.  Mine ran about 16 months constantly on high until eventually it only ran part of the time and turning the vehicle left or right would make the fan stop or run sometimes until eventually it wouldn't blow air at all.)There are several videos online such as youtube that shows having to drain coolant, completely remove one hose, partially remove another hose and relocate several other parts.  However not all of that was actually necessary with some specialized mechanic tools such as pivoting head sockets.  All that would be necessary for shade tree mechanics without these specialized tools though.The Ford Crown Victoria is essentially the same as a Mercury Grand Marquis.  The Crown Vic is still being used by law enforcement.  Most of these agencies do not use a Ford dealership for service out of warranty but will have one local repair shop that does their repairs because this costs far less.  I found out which shop here works on them for the local Sheriff's Office and various municipal police departments in the county.  I took the Mercury and this new part to this shop figuring they would probably know how to do it better than I would.  I watched as the mechanic did the part swap in 30 minutes including taking time out to take a couple of phone calls.  He had done this before and had the right pivoting head Mac tools and super long needle noise pliers for the job.  The engine was just warm, not hot and he didn't drain coolant at all except what coolant bled from the single heater hose he disconnected from the heater core.  I was really surprised when the job was done so quickly having heard it was a two hour job.  I got there at 2:15 PM and was out at 2:45 PM.  He added about a pint of fresh anti-freeze to replace the tiny bit that bled when he removed one of the hoses from the connector to the heater core mounted on the firewall.  I was impressed at the ease with which he did a job I had anticipated would take me 2 hours if I was lucky even if I had all the right tools, which I don't.  I suggest asking a deputy or police officer what shop does their Crown Vic repairs.  This is good info to have with this vehicle platform for any repair on them.  If you take it to the dealership you can expect to pay many times over what an independent shop charges for exactly the same work.This part is the exact replacement part and I was very impressed with the speed of shipping and glad to get the genuine Motorcraft part.  It cost about the same as aftermarket knockoffs on eBay.  I would order genuine Ford/Mercury/Lincoln parts from Starkville Ford again.  They saved me about 30 dollars over buying the exact same part from the local Ford dealer.There is no telling how many people buy the much more expensive fan motor assembly only to find out that the fan was fine and this controller was bad.  This part frequently fails and sooner or later many Ford Crown Vics and their various incarnations including Mercury and Lincoln versions will need this part swapped out.  I love my Grand Marquis and consider it the best vehicle I ever owned surpassing reliability of the Buicks and Cadillacs I've owned, but this part's failure rate and the difficulty of replacing it is one of the very few things I don't like about my Marquis.  Otherwise it has been a very reliable vehicle.  I dread trading it and don't want to yet.This part mounts to the firewall and the metal heat sink part goes inside the vent system for airflow cooling.  It is secured to the vent housing by two screws and is located just under where the hoses clamp onto the heater core nipples on the firewall.  There is only one electrical connector that pulls off the old part and pushes on the new one on the right side when mounted.  Changing it out isn't a problem but getting to it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FG2OFB459NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041X79YM#wasThisHelpful","R36FG2OFB459NR","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used electronic tuners for a long time.  Most of them that I've owned you have to plug into your instrument.  That means they don't tune with a microphone but only with an electronic signal directly from the instrument.  I bought a Korg GA-30 that was about the size of a credit card with a built in microphone to tune acoustic instruments about 8 or 10 years ago.  I used that Korg until getting the Snark.  The Korg was durable and fairly accurate but the LCD display wasn't lit making it tough to read in low light and the needle seemed to jump around sometimes for no good reason.  Still for the money the Korg was a good deal on a tuner with a microphone in it's day.Enter the Snark SN-2.  This Snark will tune about anything.  It will tune either by vibration clipped onto the headstock of a stringed instrument or don't clip it to the instrument and use the built in microphone.  Clip it to a music stand, clip it to anything and it still works when you use the built in microphone for a guitar, upright bass, violin, saxophone, trumpet or even a tympani.  Use the vibration setting for tuning an acoustic or electric guitar or ukulele or mandolin or banjo without interference from other sound sources.  It tunes about anything no matter the notes or key you want to tune your instrument to.  It senses the entire scale.The Snark SN-2 has a well lit, clean and bright display that is easy to read in bright light or total darkness.  The display pivots to any angle.  It is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock.  The battery seems to last a fairly long time, longer than the 9-Volt battery in my tuner pedal that burns through pricey 9 volt Duracells at the rate of about 1 per month.Long term durability seems to be a question to me due the small pivot on all the Snark clip-on tuners.  I've only been using mine for about 2 months now and while the pivot part seems sort of fragile I've had no issues at all yet and it still works good.  I don't think you should drop it very often.  So far I've dropped mine once with no damage.  Even if it did break, 10 Snarks are cheaper than the rack tuner I have and the Snark is just as accurate.While long term durability is undecided I can't complain at all about the versatility, accuracy, high visibility display or the low cost.  I really like mine and use it everyday on an electric bass or a ukulele or a guitar.  It really gets around and tunes them all.  The color is sort of a metallic red, almost Candy Apple Red.  I ordered spare batteries but haven't needed to change one yet.I'd buy it again and suggest one as a gift for any musician that doesn't have one.  I'm sure they'll use it often.  This tuner is a real good buy at a good price.  Spare CR2032 Lithium batteries are less expensive on Amazon, so I suggest ordering several with your tuner so you'll be prepared.I've never used the metronome feature other than to check it out.  It flashed a locked tempo but I really don't need that feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO232LC7WA7CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWKPHC#wasThisHelpful","RO232LC7WA7CJ","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ukulele straps are a rare thing and I've yet to find the perfect one.  This one gets close.  Not all uke players use straps, some do and some don't.  Purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced.  However I have two acoustic-electric ukes and they are heavier than the non-electrified ones the purists use.  I've found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing.  A preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar.  This Neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less.There is another device called a Uke Leash that also works well.  It ties onto the headstock. I like this Neotech better because even though the instrument isn't balanced perfectly, it is balanced better than with the Uke Leash.  The Uke Leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the Neotech Simple Sling.This Neotech Simple Sling soundhole clip strap works on my Concert and Tenor ukes equally well, but I have to adjust it some when switching it between the two.The wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument.  I don't know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached.  This strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments.You have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument.  The clip on the Neotech Sling is wider than most I've seen and this extra width reduces, but does not completely eliminate, that risk. The wider clip spreads the stress out.  I've seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and I'm afraid to try them on a ukulele.  I like this one with the wide clip and will keep it.The Uke Leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place, so I like this Neotech soundhole clip device better.The only thing I don't like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap.  But once on it is great!  You look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you can't do it with a hat on.  It gets easier the more you do it.I'd buy the Neotech Simple Sling again.  I recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but don't want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes.  Just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODXGBZZR58K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079KQEOK#wasThisHelpful","R1ODXGBZZR58K4","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You are looking at what I consider to be the best friend a voice ever had.  During a 40 year broadcast and voiceover career I have used (or been forced to use) every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the Shure SM7B and it's predecessors the SM7 and SM5.Large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi-track studio work.  I've used over the years the Sennheiser MD421, EV RE20, EV RE27N/D, Shure SM7B, Shure SM7, Shure SM5 and most recently tried a Heil PR-40.  Sometimes this was not of my own selection, but I just used what was available.  Of the lot the Shure SM7B is my favorite of the ones still available.  The SM7B is a better shielded SM7 and the SM7B of today has a better shock mount than the old SM7 or earlier SM7B.  The shielding in the B model minimizes RFI from computer monitors, florescent lighting, radio transmitter proximity, etc.  The SM7 was a redesign of the SM5.  I consider the SM5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn't been in production in ages.  I have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the RCA 77DX and RCA 44 but they were not as good as the SM5 or SM7 or SM7B.Today's SM7B is the best non-condenser vocal microphone still in production.  Stop looking and buy one.  You will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word.  It has a very controllable proximity effect, something that is missing from the EV's.  I can play a SM7B like a violin, the others I just don't seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact.Everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an SM7B while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn't.DJ's change jobs a lot and I got tired of finding the EV RE20 & RE27N/D mics or the Sennheiser everywhere I went, so I bought my own SM7B.  I never liked the EV's or Sennheiser much and didn't ever feel like they were much of a tool.  The Heil PR-40 is pretty good but doesn't have any on-board EQ options.  For recording not having the EQ is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can't do much of that.The SM7B is a tool for skilled vocal talent, so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an RE27N/D but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the SM7B is only dynamic large diaphragm mic I know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give.  The reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing, voice work.  The others are more versatile, but the SM7B is ""THE VOICE"" microphone and that was all it was intended to be. It has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects, but it is primarily a vocal microphone.Of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast, the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably.  That is one reason vocals sound good on a $4,000 tube condenser microphone, since it can capture all the complexity, inflection and multi-frequency overtones of the human voice.  Unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn't intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise.  If you are doing a dry voiceover you can't hide the hiss of a condenser under something else.  With the SM7B you don't have to.Even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves ""Recording Engineers"" today are usually totally ignorant about.  They figure anything short of a multi-thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong.If you want a good all around microphone, this is NOT it.  If you want the best dynamic vocal microphone, here it is.  As others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear I've ever connected to it.  I think if you have some cheap USB interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers.  Most real studio preamps are a good match for it. I've plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too.  You need at least 60 dB of gain, the spec sheet actually says 59.  70 dB would be better. Lots is made of the ""LOW OUTPUT"" of -59 dB but it isn't all that much less than the Shure SM58 which is -54.5 dB! -4.5 dB isn't much at all for any decent mic preamp.  But again most of the ""one-box-solution"" USB interfaces with built-in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind.The Shure SM7B comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments.  Every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra.  They all need an external windscreen but only the SM7B comes with one! I got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens.  It has a nice metal case for storage/travel.  I think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one Shure calls the A7WS but still come in the metal case.  I use the smaller windscreen mostly and Shure calls them the RK345 and their distributors still carry them. The smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and I'd suggest getting one of the RK345's, but that is the only accessory you'll need to add.  The windscreens are held on by some little Velcro tabs but easily interchanged.  They are also very durable for foam screens.On the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple EQ adjustments for Flat/Bass Rolloff/Presence Boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best. You can just leave the plate off if you want. This is easily the most EQ flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic.So I'm just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work.  I should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new Heil PR-40 first to make sure I was still an SM7B guy and it took a while for the Heil tryout to happen since I didn't want to actually buy one.  I still am an SM7B guy.  I would give it 4.5 stars but it won't let me do that, since there is nothing better right now in the class I rounded it up to 5 stars, but the SM5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVTPSSU9DWUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E4Z8M#wasThisHelpful","RCVTPSSU9DWUH","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Surprised when this one piece unit was smaller than I thought it would be and yet sounds a bit better than I expected for the price. Sort of a WOW moment.  This fat banana sized speaker box can get pretty loud for the size of it, but you won't be DJing dances with it.  It is a more personal type ""near-field"" speaker than a speaker for a big room or even a small crowd. I turned it down to about half volume to run it for a while to break it in. After a few hours of break-in time I cranked the speaker wide open I heard nearly no hiss or noise even when there was no music playing. Remarkably quiet actually, possibly because it is digital and not analog.  At first I thought it was dead quiet but if I hold the HP unit right next to my ears with no music playing I can hear a very faint hiss, but the hiss is negligible and I really had to go looking for it which is far lower hiss than most conventional 2.0 desktop type speaker systems.The digital operation also explains the clarity.  It does have exceptional clarity and to my amazement retains this low distortion even when cranked wide open.  If you are looking for the window rattling BOOM-BOOM-BOOM of a 2.1 desktop system you will be disappointed with this, but if you want a very small speaker box that fits in your laptop bag which delivers clarity at a much louder volume than typical built-in laptop speakers, low distortion at full volume and no artifacts in the sound then this might work well for you. If you want the boom-boom-boom rap music style bass then you'll need to get a conventional 2.1 desktop system with a subwoofer as no sound solution this small or this simple is going to deliver the boom-boom of a 30 watt 2.1 desktop system.  This thing only has a slightly over 2 watt output capability, but it is a really clean 2 watts.When I play music it is not noticeably distorted at all. This HP unit is not a Hi-Fi speaker set or a studio monitor set, but soundly beats the laptop's built-in speakers. The Dell laptop I bought this past August never was very loud, but it is at least 5 times louder with this HP speaker box connected. That is seriously louder.  Plus the HP speaker has better low end and mids since the laptop speakers have no low end whatsoever and lack even lower mids.  I would liken the HP unit's sound quality to a high-end stereo table radio. I've got a set of traditional 2.0 desktop speakers that are louder but also have much higher distortion and are sort of hollow sounding in general compared to the HP speaker.  The HP speaker box sounds clearer with lower listener fatigue than my typical desktop speakers which I would characterize as being midrange heavy with much higher distortion than the HP digital USB speaker box.With this HP sound solution there is one cord instead of a bunch of cords all over the place plus there is no power adapter drawing current all the time as is the case with more conventional desktop computer speakers.  When the computer shuts down so does the speaker power so there is nothing else to turn off.  All you need is one available USB port to plug it into.  There are no other wires at all so it could not be simpler.  Plug it in and your Windows computer will automatically install the USB PnP driver for it in a few seconds and it is ready to use.  No other software is required.  No batteries required either, as it is powered by the USB power from your computer.As others mentioned the cord could be longer, but for use with a laptop the cord length is fine but the cable is sort of stiff and tends to go where it wants to go, so that makes it seem shorter than it actually is. If you want to use it with a desktop machine you'll want a longer cord and extensions are available from any store selling computer items including Amazon.  The cord included with mine is exactly 26.5 inches from connector tip to connector tip.  There is a Velcro wrap attached to the cable for storage convenience.  The included cord will do for my purposes.I use the HP speaker box mostly for listening to music.  This HP unit sounds best when playing music from my Dell laptop when I set Windows Media Player's graphic equalizer to the CLASSICAL preset and I've found I can't really improve much on that preset manually. When set that way I put on a 320 MP3 of the remastered ""MY GIRL"" by the Temptations and could actually hear the bass part all the way through. Impressive for a speaker box this size.  I found that over-boosting the bass on the graphic EQ of Media Player decreased the overall volume but didn't increase the bass much, a gentle bass boost works better and the CLASSICAL preset actually sounds best over all no matter what type of music I played and none of it was classical. The EQ seems very sensitive when this speaker is connected and a minor EQ adjustment goes a long way.As others have mentioned the volume control on top is handy and so is the mute/power button on front.  The black velvet pouch fits it perfectly, looks classy, keeps the box and cable together and offers protection for the unit in your laptop bag.  Lacking is a headphone jack on the unit which would have been a nice feature so you could use the digital processing with headphones instead of being restricted to using the computer's analog soundcard output with headphones.I've read reviews that this unit only works with computers running Windows, but then again I've read some people use it with a Mac.  I run Windows so I can't say whether it works with a Mac or what you have to do to get it to work with a Mac.  Some people also ask about using it with other devices like phones, video players, TV's etc, but it is a computer speaker and will only work connected to a computer's USB port.  Others want it to work like Bluetooth speaker but it requires a wired USB connection.For the money I don't think you'll find a better USB powered Windows laptop digital speaker box that is so small it easily fits in most laptop bags and adds very little weight. I've seen other small speakers that cost more but this one is really a good value and works just fine for me. If it had some way to attach to the top of the laptop screen and had a headphone jack then it would be perfect.  As it is it is close enough. It is a neat little add-on for my desktop and it travels well.  I can recommend it as being a good quality item suitable for personal use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GQ2IONPS2IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WQ2T5S#wasThisHelpful","R29GQ2IONPS2IH","A2KI91IR3RA7D0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KI91IR3RA7D0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mysteries in Space [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - In hopping to another planet Swamp Thing bumps into Adam Strange who is travelling on the Zeta beam and ends up on Rann. Meanwhile, a pair of Thanagarians (Hawk People) are offering to help with a famine on Rann in return for a few pieces of knowledge including the technology behind the Zeta beam which they claim they want out of simple curiosity. Swamp Thing, now orange and bumpy, is spotted and Adam Strange is called out to handle the monster. Before Swamp Thing can utter a word Swampy is blasted into oblivion. I don't LOVE that Swamp Thing has moved into the realm of outer space sci-fi but Alan Moore's writing remains spectacular.Exiles [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - Naturally, Swamp Thing manages to reconstitute himself and next time he meets Adam Strange he quickly demonstrates his ability to speak English. The unexpected meeting of two Earthlings on an alien planet is handled very cool but what else would one expect from Moore. Swamp Thing offers an alternative solution to what the Thanagarians offer, mainly using his own ability to tap into the green to solve the famine, but the Thanagarians have no intention of simply walking away from the opportunity to get the Zeta beam technology. I'm still not a huge fan of Swamp Thing In Space this is remains an excellent story.Reunion [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - We get the return of Anton Arcane suffering in Hell but more importantly hos brother Gregory Arcane (The Patchwork Man), father of Abigail. As far as I'm concerned this is one of the all time great Alan Moore stories. As a 17 year old I found this story very emotional but as a father of two daughters I it's heart wrenching. As if Abbi hasn't faced enough tragedy of late this final encounter with what's left of her father is just to terrible for words. Only Alan Moore could write this story. No other comic writer could improve on this tale and that's despite the fact that the Swamp Thing makes no actual appearance.Loving the Alien [art by John Totleben] - When I was 17 I really did not enjoy this issue. This is an experimental comic both in writing and visuals and it is not an easy read. In jumping to another planet Swamp Thing ends up entangled with a sentient alien vessel. Swamp Thing constitutes his body using biological material, in particular vegetation but in this case he uses the biological material at hand which is the body of the ship itself. The ending is very surprising and poignant. You really have to read this one slowly and carefully but there is a great story here.All Flesh is Grass [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - At the suggestion of Adam Strange, Swamp Thing arrives at planet J586 and as always merges with the indigenous plant life. Unfortunately J586 is a planet of bipedal sentient plant life and Swamp Thing ends up becoming a massive version of himself composed of hundreds of beings who's thoughts confuse him. The planets resident Green Lantern is able to extract the essence of Swamp Thing from the mass of creatures and he is able to continue on his quest. This is a very well written, intelligent story but I didn't love it in 1987 and I don't love it now. It's just so far from the Swamp Thing formula that even though I can recognize the genius of Alan Moore I find myself looking back fondly to his earlier writings.Wavelength [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - One of the better issues in a story arc I really wasn't loving. Swamp Thing meets Metron of the New Gods and the two manage to pierce the unbreachable ""Source Wall"". I loved the appearance of Darkseid. No one but Alan Moore could give Darkseid such effortless menace.Loose Ends [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - Swamp Thing returns to Earth and kills everyone involved in his execution in true horror movie fashion. In the end he is reunited with Abby.Return of the Good Gumbo [art by Rick Veitch, Alfredo Alcala, Stephen Bissette] - I consider Alan Moore's run on Swamp Thing to be the greatest run in a continuing comics series. Having said that this was not the conclusion I would have hoped for. Alan Moore was REALLY trying to test the limits of his writing abilities but I found the stories increasingly difficult to read. I just wanted to sit down and read a comic book not Shakespeare or Chaucer. Moore also left Swamp Thing in a very difficult state for other authors to run with. Swamp Thing was now a God who resisted solving all human pollution and hunger problems simply because human's would then feel no no need to conserve the planet. It's a fine idea but where do you now take a character who is unkillable and able to control all plant life even creating semi sentient humanoid plants and entire plant cities? Moore also left it pretty clear the Swamp Thing had retired with Abby.I love this series but I would say it peaked with book two and by books five and six had really lost it's original intent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LBGXAI4BPQZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401246923#wasThisHelpful","R3LBGXAI4BPQZH","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background:Before 1985s Crisis on Infinite Earths DC comics had but one continuity. Sure, there were events that DC would conveniently ignore or forget about but mostly it was accepted that there was a continuation of events starting in 1938. In order to get around the radical change of superheroes that started with 1961s Flash of Two Worlds DC introduced the idea of a multiverse with Earths 1 and 2. Somehow the original Earth got relegated to the number 2 spot. Crisis started the idea of simply wiping out or changing continuity sometimes coinciding with large crossover events.The idea of Convergence is that Brainiac had been grabbing up cities prior to them being erased from continuity. Mind you, being removed from continuity doesnt mean you are destroyed, it means you never existed in the first place which is a pretty frightening concept. It actually seems like Brainiac did a pretty cool thing but for some inexplicable reason decides to hold a winner take all competition between the cities with a being named Telos acting as referee. The winning city will get control of the planet in order to populate it.Story Plot *** SPOILER ALERT ***:Brainiacs plot is sabotaged by the interference of a villain from the Warlord universe named Deimos who has managed to become uber-powerful by tapping into the power of all the time travelling characters of the DCU. Not sure how one would do that since most of these characters simply used technology rather than some innate ability to travel in time. Deimoss plan is to have all heroes and villains Brainiac has collected fight all the heroes and villains in continuity to the death in order to create a new universe where everyone will worship him. Say what??? How the hell would that work? Deimos orders the characters Brainiac collected to attack those outside their cities saying, Kill them all and this world is yours! Captain Marvel replies with a chearful, With Pleasure. Wait, WHAT??? Why would these heroes obey Deimos apparently with glee? It wasnt just Cap who appeared happy to commit murder of heroes he clearly knew from previous contacts.Deimos is then killed him off unceremoniously by a blast from Zero Hour Hal Jordan and reality starts to collapse because its not a DC event until reality collapse. So Jeff King builds up an obscure D level villain from a series few comic fans care about into an existential threat on a universal scale and obliterates him with a quick blast from Parallax. The heroes still in continuity take off and Brainiac, who is suddenly a good guy, monologues while still not explaining the point of Convergence. In order to stabilize the universe the characters are sent to their doom back to their respective time lines in order to cease existing sorta how they didnt exist prior to Convergence. As Batgirl states, Oh, God. This is confusingAt this point I have no idea what happens. Superman, Parallax, Flash and 80s headband Supergirl fly off to what I assume is Crisis on Infinite Earth to save the universe despite the fact that the Crisis was resolved decades ago. Then we get 4 pages of images of various planets with their original character versions standing behind the newer versions; for instance the Golden Age JSA and the new Earth 2 version. What this is supposed to represent escapes me. The planet is engulfed in a maelstrom but emerges lush and beautiful and vibrates itself to the Earth 2 universe where it becomes the new Earth 2. Imagine that. The entire planet vibrates itself into the Earth 2 universe and presumably plants itself in the exact same orbit as the destroyed Earth 2. As the Church Lady would say, How Conveeenient.Analysis:During the story Robin asks himself, is there NO POINT to any of this chaos? The answer would be yes. Brainiacs motivation is never explained. Based on the events its hard to imagine Deimos was capable of succeeding in the least. Telos seemed like an entirely superfluous character. King could have simply replaced Telos with Brainiac and cut out the middle man. The heroes were fighting for nothing and in the end went back to non-existence.The other problem is the sheer volume of characters. When Superman is talking you have to consider which Superman because there are so many versions. When Brainiac arrives he is attacked by three Supermen and in another panel we have five. Such is the case with many of the characters. Telos breaks The Jokers neck but which Joker? A short time later there is another Joker. How can you care about characters when you have different iterations all over the place? It is not impossible to juggle a large roster of characters but Jeff King doesnt juggle he just spills characters all over the place. There is no structure. I can only imagine the confusion of a casual fan. One moment Superman is telling Supergirl its time to leave and on the very next page an indistinguishable Superman is still on the planet facing off against Brainiac. Oh wait, his belt is slightly different from the Superman who took off.Of all the DC Comic Crossovers that have occurred Convergence was the one I looked forward to the most but when the comics started hitting the shelves the professional reviews were devastating. Unfortunately the reviews were spot on. My least favorite DC Crossover was Grant Morrisons Final Crisis and thats coming from a big Grant Morrison fan. Final Crisis felt like a complete overindulgence of a great writer but some readers loved it and an article on IGN actually had it as the greatest DC Crossover ever. Convergence fails in a whole different way.Perhaps the main problem is that Jeff King, who is not a comic book writer, was handed the job of writing. Different mediums require different writing styles but in many cases its hard to imagine where this story would be successful. We have characters like Telos who seem to change temperament at the drop of a hat. In one comic hes brutally killing Kandorians and then looks like hes threatening to kill Robin on the final panel. Next comic hes all cool and nice. Issue four ends with Deimos vowing to release Brainiac but thats yet another false cliffhanger as he never even attempts to do so. This one simply does not work and the professional reviewers nailed it with their low grades.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B70Z9MZ0BKOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401256864#wasThisHelpful","R3B70Z9MZ0BKOK","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book Five Covers August 1986 to January 1987Home Free [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - Abigail Cable is arrested and charged with ""Crimes Against Nature"" when photographs come out of her in a romantic embrace with the Swamp Thing. She jumps bail travelling from Louisiana to Gotham City only to be arrested almost immediately and jailed when her identity is noticed by Harvey Bullock. There are Swamp Thing stories that absolutely burned themselves into my psyche thirty years ago. This is not one of them. That is not to say it isn't a great story it's just that humanity comes off so heartless and disgusting that perhaps my young self chose to forget it.Natural Consequences [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - Swamp Thing discovers what has happened and travel to Gotham intent in releasing Abby. The story features the return of Dwight Wicker who is on a mission to hunt down Swamp Thing after the moss monster killed his boss, General Sunderland in Alan Moore's first story line. Swamp Thing unleashes a shock and awe campaign against Gotham City attracting the attention of it's resident defender, Batman who sees his entire city covered in vegetation. Wicker even pays Lex Luthor himself one million dollars for ten minutes of his time on order to come up with a plan to destroy Swamp Thing once and for all.The Garden of Earthly Delights [art by John Totleben] - Swamp Thing has engulfed Gotham City in foliage but the scariest thing to those in power is that an increasing number of Gothamites like it. Batman faces off against Swamp Thing with disastrous results for the Dark Knight. To his credit Batman begins to question who is right between Swamp Thing and the law but when Gotham City digs in its heals in order to not give in to blackmail Swamp Thing begins to demonstrate just how powerful he his become. In the end Luthor succeeds where Batman fails and the Swamp Thing is completely and entirely destroyed.The Flowers of Romance [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - We see the return of several more characters that predated Alan Moore's work on Swamp Thing, Liz Tremayne and Dennnis Barclay. Liz is completely paranoid that General Sunderland is still seeking them out for destruction unaware that Sunderland is long since dead. It turns out Dennis is a murderous psychopath who has been isolating Liz entirely for two years. Having been destroyed in the previous issue, Swamp Thing makes no appearance in this storyEarth to Earth [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - Abby is working to accept the death of her one great love and even attends a touching eulogy. Even the normally omniscient Phantom Stranger sees no evidence of the Swamp Thing's existence on Earth. At the end we discover that Swamp Thing has survived having somehow transferred his essence to another planet.My Blue Heaven [art by Rick Veitch and Alfredo Alcala] - Oh, what to do when you're the only sentient being on a planet and happen to have God level powers. After weeks of solitude Swamp Thing recreates a small town populated by dozens if not hundreds of automatons including his own dear Abigail. Alan Moore's writing remains peerless but I didn't like this turn in 1987 and I still don't like it. Being able to somehow detach his essence and jump between planets makes Swamp Thing essentially indestructible and being able to create a town effortlessly moves him towards omnipotency. I think back to Swamp Thing fighting vampires and nightmare Monkey King's and now Moore seems to be closing the door on those kind of intimate horror stories. In the end Swamp Thing abandons the blue planet and jumps elsewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLCDVHQXL1LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401230962#wasThisHelpful","RDLCDVHQXL1LF","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is what I was hoping for and here was what I got.I like to run and I have an app to monitor my progress but I don't like to just hold my phone. I was hoping for something that I could slip on easily and start up then remove easily when I'm done. First of all the armband is exactly sized to the Galaxy S5 which means you have to remove it from any protective case. When the phone is in the armband there is nothing to allow you to easily turn the phone on and off so you kind of have to push the mushy side of the armband and try to hit the side power button. The armband is covered with a loose plastic so it's not very easy to actually to use the touchscreen. It's possible to do it but not easy. You need to put it on your arm tight or it will slip and it's not the easiest thing to do with one hand. Not super difficult but a bit awkward.It's clear to me that the armband is simply intended to hold the phone rather than use it and I suppose the argument would be that one wouldn't really be able to use a phone on their arm anyway but in the end it seems barely easier than just holding it in my hand where I actually CAN use it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U118NJQEYK4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBU8D42#wasThisHelpful","R1U118NJQEYK4Z","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was drawn to this book because Jennifer Hecht was listed on a website as one of the top voices of Atheism and this appears to be her most well-known book. This is not really a book intended to advocate atheism so much as a chronicling of Doubt through history starting with the foundation of Judaism. Jennifer doesnt limit herself to Western doubt and explores the critics of Hinduism as well as the most popular atheistic philosophies including Taoism, Confucianism and of course Buddhism which like Hinduism came from India.I found it very interesting to read early critical arguments against the existence of Gods, a lot of which were quite powerful. I sort of always thought that the Roman or Hindu Gods were simply accepted as real by just about everyone in ancient times or those who doubted were cowed into silence by threat of violence. I was delighted to see that skepticism has existed probably as long as belief and the skeptics were not unknown figures but peoples whose names I was aware of but didnt realize were skeptics. I was also delighted to see that many of these ancient thinkers employed some very clever logical arguments. I pay fairly close attention to atheist arguments and some of these were new even to me. For instance one thinking ponders that if one is reincarnated with no knowledge of a previous existence isnt that the same as dying.Although the book clearly has atheist sympathies its not an out and out attack on religion and I appreciated that. Its not that I mind attacks on religion in the least but I do enjoy reading books promoting skepticism that dont immediately send theists fleeing (see Sam Harris). Hechts book doesnt have the entertainment value of say a Christopher Hitchens book but its historically informative and still fun to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYKH11T71ZSIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060097957#wasThisHelpful","RYKH11T71ZSIT","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story opens with Arsene Lupin and two associates breaking into a home but the crime ends a complete disaster and Lupin is forced to flee alone, his only prize a mysterious Crystal Stopper. The problem is the stopper is almost immediately stolen from his possession and Lupin is obsessed with regaining an item that would normally appear to be utterly worthless.I had issues with the two previous books. In the Hollow Needle, Lupin essentially became godlike in his ability to control every situation and steal any item. LeBlanc toned him way down for 813 but the story was nearly impossible to follow with way too many characters and twists. The Crystal Stopper improves by keeping the story simple and having a very human Arsene Lupin. It is possibly the most intriguing Lupin story with Lupin becoming very engaged in helping free one of his henchmen who faces execution because of his involvement with Lupin. Lupin eventually becomes involved (not romantically) with his henchmen's own mother who explains that her boy fell in with the wrong crowd because of the influence of a man bent on revenge against her. The irony being that Lupin himself would be the wrong crowd although that's never explicitly stated.As with most of the Lupin stories the Gentleman Thief is pitted against an adversary, in this case an entirely corrupt police deputy. About halfway through the story Lupin goes head to head with Deputy Daubrecq and finds himself entirely outmaneuvered. Having Lupin as a real, fallible human is so much better than incomparable, omniscient Lupin from The Hollow Needle. Daubrecq is probably Lupin's best foe since Herlock Sholmes and this is probably my favorite Lupin story yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVWA5AYFCQ4BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506113230#wasThisHelpful","RVWA5AYFCQ4BR","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of lists of the best Pirate movies put Captain Blood number one and I wont deny its a good film. On the other hand its darn near impossible to grade a film produced in 1935 to movies like Pirates of the Caribbean. They are completely different animals.For a film produced 80 years ago I was very impressed. Obviously its black and white but it does have sound. There is a lot of overacting which is standard for the era and the sets often look very much likes sets. On the other hand there were some sets that were quite impressive and it was obvious that was money spent. They were able to afford scenes with huge groups of extras and the movie contained some surprisingly effective model work.The first half of the film is generally very accurate to the book. In the movie Peter Blood is a bit cleverer and more in control. For instance in the book one of the doctors on Barbados suggests a plan for Bloods escape whereas in the movie Blood approaches the doctor convincing him to help escape. It's in the second half where the movie does a significant amount of rearrangement of events and in several cases multiple characters are combined into one. Having read the book I didn't love all the changes and if they were trying to streamline the story I would have cut more from the long, slow first half. For someone who hasn't read the book I think the movie narrative would likely work quite well.Captain Blood is a sanitized look at pirating but I have to say that the final battle between Captain Blood's ship and several French ships was brutal and thrilling. There wasn't blood and gore (which really wouldn't work in a black and white film) but there was a ton of death and destruction as the ships utterly pounded each other to splinters. This was a surprisingly effective scene given the limitations of 1935 film making but is a testament to practical effects. At first I wasn't loving Errol Flynn's sometimes cheesy performance but he has an infectious personality that really grew on me. For a film from the 1930's I give this one high marks. Do I think it's more entertaining than some of the recent Pirates of the Caribbean movies? No, but it's a fun film for a quiet Saturday evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW5IEILF03IH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JMR7#wasThisHelpful","RW5IEILF03IH0","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The League of Extraordinary Gentleman Volume II is what I consider to be the last great League material. The Century and Nemo series have grown on me over time but they pale in comparison to the first two volumes while The Black Dossier, in my opinion, remains the weakest League material written by Alan Moore. With Volume II the original team is still together including Mina Harkin, Allan Quatermain, Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, and the Invisible Man, Hawley Griffin. This time Alan Moore does a mash-up between his Extraordinary League and H.G. Wells War of the Worlds with a mix of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars. It makes sense that if an invasion was coming from Mars that John Carter might have seen it leaving.What is probably the most amazing thing about this book is the pacing. It is extremely slow and patient but it is a tribute to Alan Moores skill as a writer that its never boring. This is very much a character driven story, the kind that only a superior writer is capable of. The story is very atmospheric, complimented by Kevin ONeills wonderful art. A great majority of the story happens on a literal dark and stormy night and there is a palpable terror as the Martian invaders prove to be technologically advanced far beyond Victorian England and clearly have no compunction about killing any humans that cross their path. It is during this dire hour that the League begin to come apart at the seams and the series arguably hits its peak. There is a scene with Mr. Hyde and the Invisible Man that I would classify as one of the all-time greats in comic book history.This is a book I could read a dozen times and find something new with each reading. I would put this among the all-time great graphic novels and a must have for comic fans. Besides issue 1-6 readers are also treated to the 46 page The New Travellers Almanac. This is a mostly text story where Moore tries to weave in dozens and dozens of places from literature in order to create his world and its a pretty amazing achievement. Moore manages to take the classic War of the Worlds ending and give it a unique twist as he mixes in another H.G. Wells story, The Island of Dr. Moreau. I love this second volume and recommend it highly to any fans of comics and/or classic fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRC87PCD9JKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401201180#wasThisHelpful","RDRC87PCD9JKW","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a list of the best pirate movies Captain Blood frequently sits at the top and this is the book upon which the film is based. Written by Rafael Sabatini and published in 1922 its loosely based on surgeon Henry Pitman with a considerable amount of embellishment.If you love pirate stories its hard to find a better or more historically accurate one than Captain Blood. Bloods arrest and sentencing to Barbados are all based on historical events from the late 1600s. Pitman manages to free himself from his captivity when the island is attacked by pirates and makes his way back to England. Blood, by contrast, takes the boat with the help of other prisoners and becomes a pirate himself. The problem is that Peter Blood is consistently shown as a good man and even after he abruptly becomes a pirate he continues to have a strong code of ethics. But being a pirate, by its very nature, is to be a murderous thief. Its established that Blood has considerable seaman skills but not his crew so how did they become such effective pirates? Much of the book is devoted to the tension between Blood, who believes himself to be a good man and his profession as a pirate so it's not like Sabatini ignores it.What is it about pirate adventures that enthralls so many people? Pirates are by their very nature criminals unless sanctioned by a country (which frequently happened). I think the allure is the perceived freedom of Pirates who make themselves a law unto themselves and travel the sees with allegiance to know country. Occasionally pulling into a port to use their spoils on drink and women. It's a lifestyle that has been massively romanticized but few people want to be a REAL pirate and Sabatini by and large maintains the romance even if he does tend to sanitize the drinking, womanizing and violence. There is also a very visceral level of excitement in having huge wooden vessels pounding each other to splinters and here Sabatini delivers the good. The final Battle between Blood's ship the Arabella and the French fleet is thrilling even if it's just on paper.Captain Blood, the character, is well executed and as bold as his name. Blood doesn't trifle with fools and he'll risk life and limb to achieve his goals. When Blood wins despite overwhelming odds it feels believable. I wasn't as convinced by the effectiveness of his crew which were ex slaves form Barbados but Captain Blood himself is a larger than life character who's hard to root against. Overall, the book was everything I was hoping for and the 1935 film is an excellent adaptation even if it does juggle around a lot of the events of the story. If you enjoy pirate action this is about as good a book as you'll find.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX7JCBWD1KHDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142180106#wasThisHelpful","RX7JCBWD1KHDC","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released way back in 1989, Bye Bye, Lady Liberty was the very first Lupin the 3rd made for television movie. This is one of four Lupin movies released by Eastern Star since March 2014 but the only one with an English dubbing. My assumption is that Eastern Star does not do its own dubbing and Bye Bye Lady Liberty is the only one that just happened to have already been dubbed. As far as I know this is the first time the film has been released in the US and the dubbing was done for a UK/AUS release.If youre excited to have dubbing dont be. For one thing because of copyright issues Lupin is referred to as Wolf throughout the movie. Second, the voice acting is not very good. About the only one who did a decent job was the woman who voiced Fujiko. Goemons voice was the worst or as hes referred to in this dubbing, Gomen. But if you find the dubbing unlistenable just use the original Japanese version with English subtitles. Im not going to ding the movie for including a lousy dubbing since the original audio is available just as in the other Lupin movies.Despite being the iconic moment of the film the theft of the Statue of Liberty is somewhat silly. Lupin (Wolf) steals Lady Liberty in order to find the Super Egg (an enormous gem) that is hidden somewhere in or no the famous statue. Having the 151 foot tall statue in his possession gives Lupin the opportunity to search in relative leisure.  One the Super Egg is found the statue is basically gone from the plot. Things then get very complicated. The villains are a group of cultists led be a 120 year old occultist with true magic powers and deadly breath. Not only does the cadaverous villain want the Super Egg he also wants something called the Manipulative Virus which was created by the mother of a young genius whos been hanging out with Jigen and Lupin while the mother has been travelling with Goemon whos been acting as her protector.There are a lot of gears in the plot perhaps too many. The film has its moments but I would not put it among my favorites in the Lupin series. The animation is inconsistent and Im not a huge fan of stories that bring in actual magical powers since they seem inconsistent with the tone of Lupin series. Ill give the movie four stars but suggest watching it with subtitles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1548LMGCJQ2MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVFA2Z0#wasThisHelpful","R1548LMGCJQ2MO","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Akira was a watershed moment for Anime in America. Until then most Americans associated Anime with cheaply made cartoons involving giant robots, flying battleships or teams of five fighting heroes. Then came Akira and Americans discovered that the Japanese were capable of producing high quality animated films without cutting corners. 27 years later Akira remains a visual treat with an unforgettable story.Here is a confession. Although I think that Akira is an absolute must have for Anime fans I was never as big of a fan of it as I was other popular Anime. There is something extraordinarily disturbing about the film. It is most definitely not a film for young children and contains some extremely graphic violence and horrific imagery. When I was 18 this film really messed with my mind as there are moments that play out like a waking nightmare. Nowadays I appreciate the film a lot more but back in the day I would have preferred Castle in the Sky or Ninja Scroll, which also had violence but didnt mess with your head.My other issue with Akira is some of the design issues. In most cases the designs are beautiful from the spectacular Neo-Tokyo to Kanedas gorgeous bike. The character bodies and movements are fluid and believable. My one issue is with the faces. Just as a Hiyao Miyazaki film has a very distinctive look so does Katsuhiro Otomo. The difference is I find Miyazakis faces very aesthetically pleasing whereas Otomos faces are often pinched up with narrow set eyes. It sort of adds to the creepiness of the film but in this case I think it was inadvertent.So Ive criticized what I didnt love about the film but it remains a monumental achievement. Despite the main characters having some rather unpleasant characteristics Otomo still managed to make them highly sympathetic. The pacing is well done, the music is very distinctive, and the backgrounds are beautiful. The cyberpunk atmosphere is totally 80s but that gives the film a certain charm rather than making it feel dated. I first watched this film when I was 18 and found it remarkable but creepy. All these years later and I appreciate it a lot more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KI5QHMLN1E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENNA62W#wasThisHelpful","R37KI5QHMLN1E4","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Volume 9 continues the storyline with Flattop Jones that started in volume 8. Flattop ends up in a most unexpected team-up with the overacting ham, Vitamin Flintheart. Having finished the story I'm curious as to how Flattop became so famous as compared to his gruesome contemporaries. He's not the most rutheless villian, in fact The Brow who shows up in the next story line is considerably more rutheless. The storyline is fairly standard with Flattop commiting a crime, getting caught, escaping and then dying at the end. Perhaps his popularity is due to the fact that Flattop was younger than most of the other grotesque villians. Maybe it was his inexplicably congenial relationship with Flintheart that came from out of left field. Whatever it is Flattop Jones remains the most recognizable of all the Dick Tracy villains and that alone makes volume 9 a must have.The next story features the Summer sisters, May and June but more importantly The Brow. The Brow is another foreign spy although Gould always keeps the counties his spies are working for a mystery. The Brow is up there with the cruelest villains Gould has ever created and the naive Summer sisters bear the brunt of his wraith. As with many villains Gould set The Brow up as a truly evil person in order to spend most of the story torturing him to the delight of readers. The Brow is the victim of one of the most gruesome and certainly the most unlikely death ever inflicted on a Dick Tracy villain. Let me put it this way. There is no way the physics of our universe would ever permit what happens to The Brow to actually happen. Nor even close.Next up is a crook named Shaky whose distinctive feature is the he literally shakes as if he had Parkinson's yet he is able to perform tasks that would normally take a high level of steadiness. But anyway, Shaky is involved (ironically) in a shake down scheme that is so boneheaded and likely to fail that even Shaky himself calls it dumb. After reading years and years of Dick Tracy a distinct pattern and the Shaky storyline is boilerplate. Villain attempts a crimes, villain gets ratted out and attempt revenge often on a female, villain flees the police and ends with a horrific death. Gould seemed to be always trying to turn up the volume and Shaky's death is one of the most memorable.The story that follows features the return of Gravel Gertie who appeared near the end of The Brow storyline. This is one of the weaker Dick Tracy stories and goes all over the place. There is one inadvertently hilarious moment where Dick Tracy is dragged behind a car driving 60 MPH by the villainous Measles. Tracy accidentally shoots the gas tank causing gas to spray out and sparks from his coat ignite. The image of a flaming Dick Tracy dragged along at 60 MPH and then flung off a cliff is so funny particularly since we all know he'll be fine. It's clear that Gould was really fond of Vitamin Flintheart because for the third time he coincidentally crosses path with a Dick Tracy adversary, this time having  Measles stumble into his train car. At this point Flintheart is getting more panel time than Dick Tracy jr,, Tess Trueheart and Pat Patton combined.The final story introduces Breathless Mahony who was famously played by Madonna in the 1990 movie. She stumbles across the rotting corpse of Shakey while strolling on the boardwalk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1384UDJO8QJCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600105327#wasThisHelpful","R1384UDJO8QJCX","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes simplisity is best and I guess it's up to a parent to decide if this is the case in this instance. The spin submarine comes in a handful of pieces that can be easily assembled and disasembeled. It really doesn't do much. It can float but you can see it has holes all around so if you push it down slightly in the water it will fill and submerge like a submarine except unlike a submaring it will kinda sit on the bottom.

"A movie producer decides to film a movie in Africa about a fictional ""Lion Man"" who lives in the jungle; an obvious reference to Tarzan the Ape Man. The entire endeavor is an utter disaster as most of the film crew is killed, the guides all leave, the women are taken hostage and the lead actor playing the Lion Man flees into the jungle. The Lion Man, Stanley Obroski, is a physically imposing man but ultimately a coward. However few could remain brave in the face of the horrors he faces (except men from fictional stories in the decades old adventure stories).This is the second Tarzan lookalike, the first being Esteban Miranda from Tarzan and the Golden Lion. Miranda bore such a close resemblance Lord Greystoke that even Jane Porter couldn't distinguish the two which seemed highly unlikely. In the case of Obroski, Tarzan is struck by their incredible similarity both facially and physically. I can only imagine that Obroski was supposed to be a surrogate for Johnny Weissmller who started playing the Ape Man a year prior. Weissmller was an Olympic champion swimmer while Obroski is written as a champion marathon runner who was to play a Lion Man. Although Obroski was written as being as cowardly as Tarzan is brave when push comes to shove he fights back ferociously. You might think that two Tarzan lookalikes would be an impossible coincidence but that didn't stop Burroughs from introducing a third in Tarzan and the Madman.About halfway through the book the story makes an abrupt change when the woman are captured by Apes capable of talking English. Suddenly the story is a about a mad scientist doing genetic engineering on apes. Stanley Obroski disappears from the story and it becomes obvious that he only existed so the Tarzan could pass himself off to the coworkers of Obroski who would then be shocked at his transformation into a brave warrior. Tarzan does it as a joke but it doesnt really make sense since he continues the joke even as events become deadly serious. It was pretty obvious why Burroughs was continuing to have Tarzan portray himself as Stanley even if it made no sense in the story.Near the end, the book reaches it's punchline as Tarzan ends up essentially playing himself in the film they were creating. In a cruel twist of fate Obroski unceremoniously dies off page from previous injurious even as Tarzan enjoys the spoils of Hollywood. There is a strange tacked on final chapter with Tarzan in Hollywood presenting himself as John Clayton. Balza, a wild woman from earlier in the book is now a movie star and an attempt is made to cast ""John Clayton"" in a Tarzan movie where he would play himself. The producers are unaware that he literally IS Tarzan. Instead he is given a lesser role. The entire chapter is intended as a joke but it's all in good fun.Tarzan and the Lion Man starts off well but as often happens Burroughs starts moving the plot all over the place with genetically modified gorilla's, a mad scientist and even a savage tribe of naked whites. Oh, and they found a mountain of diamonds. Tarzan continuing his ""joke"" was a terrible act of cruelty for the sake of the plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCMVA8BXMG99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WAJ6ZW#wasThisHelpful","R2FCMVA8BXMG99","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crucifix Island (January - February 1957) - A roboticist, Dr Tozawa,  imprisoned for stealing money from the Ministry of Science, leads a jail break ending up at the titular Crucifix Island. Tozawa, in many ways mirrors Astro Boy's creator Dr. Tenma. Tozawa also created a robotic son and he's also pretty much a bastard who learns the error of his ways in the end. Unlike Tenma he was not able to complete his creation however since his son, Pook, is currently at robotic school on Crucifix Island Tozawa has a second chance to finish himAfter Pook is completed the story changes dramatically which is common among Tezuka stories. A gang of crooks come to rob Crucifix island which besides having a robot school also has the world's biggest Uranium mine and Pook is tricked into helping the crooks. This is a classic Tezuka story with robots being manipulated and abused by human's. In fact the original robot abuser Hamegg puts in an appearance. Through most of the story Pook despises Astro, jealous that he is a completed robot but as in other Tezuka stories there is redemption at the end mixed with a melancholy conclusion. One of the better Astro Boy tales.This story was turned into a television episode in 1963 called Cruciform Island.Space Snow Leopard (February - April 1960) - Tokyo experiences an unusual snowfall with strange snow that absorbs the energy from robots causing them to collapse. Astro rushes home to find his own family out cold and is attacked by a six legged space snow leopard called Lupe. The leopard is likewise able to drain energy but when Astro blasts him out a window he and his humanoid master flee.Turns out this is all part of an alien invasion and the snow leopard is basically a collection of energy draining amoebas than can change form is separate into smaller pieces. Astro ends up using a interesting method of fighting fire with fire to stop the enemy. The Snow Leopard was used in the 1980 cartoon series in episode 43.The Artificial Sun (December 1959 - February 1960) - A ship is attacked and destroyed by a 'Fireball Monster' prompting an organization to send Sherlock Holmspun along with Astro Boy to investigate. Holmspun tells Astro that he is related to Sherlock Holmes which doesn't really make sence since although their last names are similar they are not the same. Holmspun begins to investigate Professor Ochanomizu as someone involved and despite Astro's protests it turns out Holmspun is correct, Ochanamizu did help create the menacing monster.Initially, Holmspun is quite antagonistic towards Astro and later we learn that the detective is a cyborg whose only human feature is his head. His anger towards Astro is a product of his own self loathing but by the end of the story he learns to accept and respect both Astro Boy and robots in general. This is another classic Tezuka story that deals with the relationships between robots and humans. In the case of Holmspun he is both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G8BGWJX8OJ5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKTJ2VU#wasThisHelpful","R3G8BGWJX8OJ5L","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carnacki, the Ghost Finder was originally published back in 1913 and bears some similarities to the works of HP Lovecraft. Since Lovecraft didn't start publishing until 1917 that mean Hodgson predates him by a few years. I also get a similar vibe to the Alone in the Dark video game series which was inspired by the stories of Lovecraft. I'm impressed by Hodgson's writing but he has nowhere's near the poetic talents of Lovecraft which is why one author is a household name and the other is fairly obscure. That's not to denigrate Hodgson as he carves out his own niche which is a more lightweight version of the horror genre.Usually in stories like these the ghost hunter either always finds actual ghosts or always finds fakes (as in Scooby Doo). In this case sometimes the spooks are real and sometimes not. I've never seen another ghost hunter type series like this. Carnackis three main weapons are his flashlight, his camera and his pistol. Well, also his chalk which he uses to draw pentagrams around himself in the same way DC Comics John Constantine would do to protect against menacing spirits. This works great when the ghosts are real. Not so well with the fakes. I also like Carnacki's policy that if he feels the urge to flee from a situation he does so. This is one of the common tropes in horror movies that people stick around in the face of mortal danger. Not so with Carnacki and it's not really a result of cowardice. He simply has accepted that if he feels that flight is warranted out the front door he will run.The stories aren't particularly scary which is a side effect of having a continuing character who relays the stories in first person narrative. It pretty much guarantees nothing bad will happen. My bigger issue is that Hodgson creates mysteries but never gives the reader the opportunity to play along. There are no clues as to whether or not its a true ghost. If there is a human agent behind the haunting readers get nothing pointing them towards the culprit. This leaves the endings generally unsatisfying. In several stories it seems obvious that there must be a supernatural force but it turns out a human staged it despite the fact that it seems like an impossible act to fake. In two stories it turns out there are both fakers AND real ghosts working independently. There were some moments of tension in particular The Searcher of the End House but overall the stories werent overly memorable.I read the Kindle version and for some reason it didnt have The Hog and The Haunted Jarvee which are listed among the stories in Carnacki, The Ghost Finder so Im not sure why they were omitted. These are good but not great stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IY30RCGP26V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084C1CF8#wasThisHelpful","R13IY30RCGP26V","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im writing this review in hindsight having already finished the series. Convergence has NOT received positive reviews and for me the biggest problem is that Jeff King just doesnt seem to understand the basics of storytelling. Not all storytelling must adhere to a strict template but generally you have a protagonist an antagonist and a conflict. Who is the villain? That would be Brainiac, I mean Telos, I mean Deimos oh Deimos is dead. Who are the heroes? I guess its the heroes of Earth 2 with a focus on Dick Grayson. Oh, the story decides Dick Grayson isnt all the important after all. Brainiac and Telos bring together various cities from slices of reality in the DCU in order to fight. Their ultimate goal is to. um.. errr. huh?Its pretty clear that Telos is a villain, after all he brutally slaughters Kandors Nightwing and then kills dozens, maybe far more Kandorians without remorse. Oops, hes actually a good guy. Deimos true intentions are slightly ambiguous although King does a pretty weak job of hiding his villainy and a little research on Wikipedia will reveal him as a baddie. There is one frame where Yolanda says she doesnt like his smell and Deimos responds as if she said it loudly within his earshot. Nice subtlety Yolanda. Deimos has captured the time travelling characters of the DCU in order to gain their power in order to hmmm. Apparently have all the heroes and villains kill each other.There is one cool moment in the book where Batman (Thomas Wayne) kills a group of villains by blowing himself up but even that I dont understand. I recognize the villains as creations of Grant Morrison prior to the new 52 and Flashpoint but what does that mean? So does that mean those villains are all now dead? Did they even exist post Flashpoint? Would they have all ceased to exist post Convergence anyway? Then the questions start getting very weird. If the DCU is a continuing storyline that simply gets altered by major events like Crisis on Infinites Earths and Flashpoint that means anyones existence can be completely eradicated. Not destroyed but wiped from history. Every achievement, every suffering gone, never happened. We know this happens because that precisely what was painfully explained at the end of Crisis on Infinite Earths when a few Earth 2 characters survived when they were out of the time stream during the wipeout.Thomas Wayne Batman dies but this is clearly not the Earth 2 Batman since that was Bruce Wayne so who is this fellow? Telos breaks the Jokers neck but which Joker is this? Is it the pre Flashpoint Joker or the Earth 2 Joker or some other Joker. A casual reader might react with OMG the Joker was just killed but there really is no impact. In fact in just a few issues well see that clearly there is at least one more Joker still alive. Grant Morrison managed used the idea of multiple versions of characters to make a fascinating story but here things just feel messy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HN90VWP4O21Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W87PILY#wasThisHelpful","R1HN90VWP4O21Y","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ninja Scroll is among a small group of films like Ghost in the Shell that are considered the quintessential Anime of the mid 90s. This was a time when Anime was really started to attract mainstream attention in the United States. Although Ninja Scroll is very derivative of its genre what sets it apart is quality. Like Street Fighter II the Movie it was released among a sea of similar type movies of inferior quality. SF II succeeded because it excelled in its core objective of creating thrilling fights. It is amazing to me how many fighting game tie-ins absolutely could not get the fighting right. That doesnt mean that SF II or Ninja Scroll are at the quality of a Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro but they do what they do superbly. Unfortunately, for every Ninja Scroll there were dozens of garbage movies and eventually I lost interest in Anime because I was burned one too many times. My interest has been somewhat rekindled and Im trying to replace some of the Anime I owned on VHS that loved but eventually got rid of when I upgraded to DVD and blue-ray. Ninja Scroll is one of the first to make the cut.Ninja Scrolls target demographic is young males and as such is an aggressive testosterone filled movie. There is nudity, sexual assault and tons and tons of blood. Im not trying to say that young males are drawn to sexual violence but other demographics may be repelled. Blood doesnt flow from wounds it sprays as if being forced through a pressure hose. What Ninja Scroll does is it delivers what fans of the genre want. The plot is simple but not dumb. The characters are well developed and the fighting is AWESOME! Its hard for me to think of more than a few Anime with comparable scenes of fighting and more interesting combatants. That is not to say that Ninja Scroll is a one trick pony. Ninja Scroll is one of those rare movies that nails just about everything from story to music and even the excellent U.S. voice acting.Lets face facts. You can get away with almost anything in a film like this if you nail down the fighting. Do fans of Street Fighter II really remember anything besides the fights? The plot centers around an exceptionally talented Ninja named Jubei Kibagami who gets unintentionally embroiled in a war between the Tokugawa government and The Shogun of the Dark and must work his way through the Eight Devils of Kimon to take revenge on a man he already killed once. Jubei is cool, and reminds me a lot of Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop (which was released several years after Ninja Scroll), but its the Eight Devils who steal the show. They are by and large human in appearance and its never clear whether they are literally supernatural or simply extraordinarily talented fighters. In Asian film even normal humans are able to achieve supernormal powers through extreme training. Mushizo, for example, literally has a honeycomb within his back where killer bees live. That certainly is not something a human would be capable of having. Each of the Eight Devils is unique and highly inventive and its a blast seeing Jubei face off against these seemingly invincible foes. The writers were smart in keeping Jubei relatable and sympathetic and in most of the fights he wins only thanks to help from another.So what do you get with this release? There are zero extras and it runs in 4:3 aspect ratio rather than widescreen so prepare to have black bars on both side. This is the way the movie was created so this isnt a complaint just something to note. They used the same dubbing used on the VHS copy I owned years ago that was put out by Manga Video but given the quality of the dubbing I dont mind. Seeing this film after so many years was an absolute blast. Ill admit there is a lot of animation shortcutting but the film holds up both in look and in story. In my short list of must own Anime films Ninja Scroll is near the top.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5VRFQKHXTUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOPOSC4#wasThisHelpful","RQ5VRFQKHXTUC","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The finale is pretty much a microcosm of the entire series. Lots of standing around talking and then it ends with a literal 'The End'.With Deimos killed by Hal Jordan/Parallax in the previous book the only villain left is Brainiac. When last we left off the Multiverse was crumbling but that was put on hold long enough for Brainiac to give his background story and then everyone just went home. Seriously, the characters all just went home. There is an implied tie in with Grant Morrison's Multiversity but overall I don't even know what the ending means. So are the realities that Brainiac collected now part of the multiverse? Along with the other realities listed in Morrison's Multiversity do we also add the pre-crisis universe and the pre-Zero Hour universe and a pre-Flashpoint universe? I really have no idea what it all means but it was a very disappointing journey to get to a very forgettable ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MI8X9J0VVD8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1Z0SEM#wasThisHelpful","R1MI8X9J0VVD8D","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So here is where the story stands. Brainiac has created trapped slices of the DCU and is now using a being named Telos to have them all battle. It's a survival of the fittest battle with the winner getting the planet he has created. Meanwhile, a wizard named Deimos is working with the heroes of Earth 2 to track down Telos. Deimos was a villain in the Warlord series and DUH he's still a villain. He's trapped the various time travelling characters from the DCU and is using their powers to enhance his own. In this issue Deimos reveals his villainy and Telos moves to the side of the heroes.The biggest problem with Convergence is there is very little to latch on to. I don't really know what Deimos plan is or Telos plan or what the point is in having the various realities battle. It's just really hard to care about any of this.Like the rest of the series the best I can say is it's alright. It's not terrible and it's not terribly memorable. The writing and art are uneven. Among the many DC crossovers this will probably fall somewhere around the level of Armageddon 2001 in terms of how well it's regarded.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TFXTRIXCAPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1Z0SG0#wasThisHelpful","R13TFXTRIXCAPX","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really didnt know what to expect with this book given the paucity of product description. It is purportedly a celebration of the 75th anniversary of Capt. Marvel and I was hoping it was more than just reprints of stories. Now dont get me wrong. I wasnt asking for new comic material and I love reading old Capt. Marvel stories which rarely get reprinted. Its just that with 400 pages I was hoping for maybe 30 or 40 new pages of text celebrating The Worlds Mightiest Mortal but alas. It is all old reprinted material. Even the rather short section introductions are reprinted. In the case of the first introduction it was taken from Volume 1 of the Shazam Archives.Now I love Capt. Marvel and this is a fine selection of stories but as a celebration its somewhat lacking.

"In 2005 DC Comics launched their All Star imprint which produced a whopping two series including the legendary All-Star Superman by Grant Morrison and the horrific All-Star Batman and Robin by Frank Miller. In 2010 DC Comics decided to do pretty much the same thing and produce their Earth One line which, like the All-Star line, was out of the main continuity. The Earth One series again stuck with Superman and Batman and late last year added the Teen Titans. In over four years theyve produced five volume three of which are Superman. Im confused as to why the series is called Earth One since Earth One is generally recognized as the main reality of the DC universe whereas these stories are outside of the main continuity. I dont even think the Earth One Batman necessarily exists with the Earth One Superman and Earth One Teen Titans.Essentially Earth One Batman is a retelling of Batmans origin with enough tweaks to recognize it as outside of current continuity. It combines elements from Frank Millers Batman Year One and Christopher Nolans Batman Begins and adds some more stuff to make the story unique. At the start of his crime fighting career the Earth One Batman is far less experienced and effective than the uber-Batman on continuity. This makes the Earth One Batman more interesting and relatable. It also makes the stories a lot tenser when your protagonist isnt essentially invincible. DC quest to make Batman the baddest non-superpowered hero ever created has made him inaccessible and predictable. When Batman regularly gets the upper hand on Superman you know things have gone too far. Geoff Johns Batman is entirely fallible and thats what makes him compelling.Placing Earth One out of continuity allows Johns to do pretty much whatever he wants within reason. Obviously he cant kill Batman but other popular Batman characters arent necessarily safe. Johns also has the flexibility to alter characters as he sees fit with the biggest modification being Alfred who is now a former Royal Marine who teaches Bruce Wayne combat. The Penguin is definitely inspired by Tim Burtons revolting Penguin who ran for Mayor of Gotham city. If anything I think Johns was too tentative in making Batman his own. For me the benchmark of a writer making a character his own was All-Star Superman where Grant Morrison absolutely owned his own Superman and if your given the freedom to write outside of continuity I say go for it.I consider Gary Frank a superior artist but his work can sometimes be inconsistent. Not so on this occasion. Frank is at the top of his game and Batman, in particular, looks great. He has a tendency to use celebrities or famous figures as inspiration for his characters faces and its fun to try and figure out his inspiration. In the case of The Penguin hes almost assuredly based on Richard Nixon. I suspect Harvey Bullock was based on James Marsden. I cannot think of one feature of this book that isnt good looking from the front cover to the back and all the interior art.I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to the second book but it comes short of five star material. Its a very solid origin story but I cant say it made a deep impact on me. I read it when it first came out and again in the past few days and I dont remember anything that really stuck with me from my first reading. I mostly remember that I kind of liked Harvey Bullocks portrayal as a somewhat self-absorbed human being while at the same time a very brave and tough cop. I also remembered Batman falling in a pile of garbage on his first foray as The Dark Knight but besides that I pretty much just remembered that overall I thought it was good. Ill give the book a solid B+.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NVAPOWIS055Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401232094#wasThisHelpful","R3NVAPOWIS055Y","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By the end of the first book it was never explicitly established whether Fantomas even existed. By the end of the second book Fantomas had finally put in an actual appearance in full black clothing. In the third book his identity was unmasked at the finale although it was clear that this identity was just one of many and he made his escape. In A Nest of Spies Fantomas puts in an appearance almost immediately in yet another disguise and is much more active throughout.The Fantomas series has always featured lots of disguises particularly from Fantomas and Detective Juve but in A Nest of Spies authors Marvel Allain and Pierre Souvestre go all out. Fantomas has TWO identities besides his identity as Fantomas. Juve disguises himself as one of Fantomas identities and at one point Fantomas presents himself as Juve disguised as one of his own identities. Jerome Fandor disguises himself as another character. A woman in the story disguises herself as a priest and we discover that another woman is actually a character from the first book. In fact the authors have worked hard to tie the series together not just on the main characters but on a lot of periphery characters including ones that havent appeared in quite some time. It will be interesting to see if there is an actual reason why these characters lives continue to intersect or if its just a big coincidence. I would be disappointed if its just coincidence.The biggest issue I have with the series is the ending payoff. When your series is built around the villain it makes it hard to have a satisfying conclusion when the criminal always escapes. In fact it makes the whole criminal investigation pointless. I guess one can read the series as a larger narrative, a continuing investigation but when Fantomas is trapped at the end of each book and simply gets away I cant help but be disappointed. Although there are a lot of references to previous books I didnt feels as if A Nest of Spies advanced the series much. Im hoping A Royal Prisoner will shed a little more light on the mysterious Fantomas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q0NAO0CWPWRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TPU8YK#wasThisHelpful","R2Q0NAO0CWPWRN","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alan Moores Miracleman is one of the greatest series of all time. On a scale of one to five its a six and any comic fan who has not read it is doing him or herself a tremendous disservice. This is the apex of superhero deconstructions. To be more specific this is a deconstruction of Capt. Marvel and the Marvel Family. Dr. Gargunza, a surrogate for Dr. Sivana, is literally inspired by reading a Marvel Family comic. The only thing could have made it more awesome would be if Gargunza recognized himself as Sivana. Regardless this is at or near the top of comic book stories and deserves the royal treatment.Where this volume fails is in the presentation and its the same problems as in volume one. Let me lay out some statistics. The book is 224 pages long. 98 pages are original artwork (pencil sketches, inked sketches) and cover art. There are just 118 pages of material from Alan Moore listed as The Original Writer. There is zero in the way of introduction or background of the series. No offense to the artists but it wasnt the art that made Miracleman one of the great comics of all time. Let me compare it to the Swamp Thing books that were released and are arguably an even better examples of Alan Moores best than Miracleman.Book one of The Saga of the Swamp Thing is 208 pages with 6 pages of background and introduction. You get 8 comics reprinted and over 200 solid pages of Alan Moore material at a price I paid of $11.59.Miracleman book 2 contains 6 reprinted comics and less than 120 pages of Alan Moore material at a current price of $24.83. Miracleman is hardcover and Swamp Thing is paperback but as far as Im concerned this is Marvel Comics taking advantage of fans. If Marvel had combined both books and jettisoned most of the filler they could keep it under 250 pages and include 9 reprinted issues. I am aware that Marvel did not have permission to use Alan Moores name but to say absolutely nothing about the background of Miracleman is a total disservice to fans. It feels lazy and thoughtless.The cover quotes the New York Times saying, Nothing quite as ambitious as The Red King Syndrome has been published before or since. I dont agree. It may be better than any comic written by a writer whose name isnt Alan Moore but for my money Id take Swamp Thing, Watchmen and perhaps V for Vendetta. My only issue with The Red King Syndrome is that Alan Moore has demonstrated the ability to write air tight plots and he falters a bit this time having Dr. Gargunza make a monumentally stupid decision for plot convenience. Besides that one slight stumble and some sometimes dodgy art (not Moores fault) this is a near flawless story.Alan Moore is often imitated but never duplicated and Miracleman was written at the peak of his skills. This should be required reading for comic book fans. I just wish the presentation werent so badly done. Even the cover seems halfhearted and messy. Personally Im not happy that Swamp Thing has never gotten an absolute edition, Omnibus or even Deluxe Edition but even with just paperback books I still think Swamp Thing has gotten a better presentation than Miracleman. The original Eclipse Miracleman comics can be somewhat pricey so this may be the only currently available source to read these stories but I really hope someday Miracleman get the treatment he deserves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NAIAITUO2D7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785154647#wasThisHelpful","R1NAIAITUO2D7M","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have two different comic takes on the Tarzan character being released just days apart including the venerable Burne Hogarth version from the 1930s published by Titan Books and Russ Mannings take from the 1970s put out by IDW Publishing. So if you can only purchase one which is the one to get?From a writing standpoint there is no comparison. Russ Manning does duel duty as both artist AND writer and his stories are far better than those created by Don Garden, the actual writer behind Hogarths artwork. Garden seemed to just crank out text whereas Manning wrote stories and actually gave the ape man some downtime rather than relentless action. The Manning stories are not the greatest stories ever put on paper but writing a continuing storyline in tiny one week installments is a very tough task and Mannings results are better than most.Art wise Im going with Manning although the victory is far less clear cut. The images in the Titan books are a lot muddier but Manning had the advantage of more modern coloring techniques so Im not going to ding Hogarth on that. Its clear that Hogarth was a fantastically talented artist and both he and Manning didnt skimp on backgrounds. The difference for me is that Manning gave Tarzan a more natural appearance. Tarzan was often in stiff heroic stances when drawn by Hogarth while Mannings art was smoother and more flowing. He also seemed to have a larger variety of character movements in his tool chest. This is in no way meant to put down Hogarth beautiful art. I just think Manning has the edge.Presentation wise IDW wins again. Both volumes have nice covers and I actually prefer Titans which went without a dust cover which I consider archaic and just an easy way for the book to get damaged. Size wise the Titan book is somewhat unwieldy because they chose to keep the book a similar size to the original newspaper (shrunk a bit). The IDW book is a lot more manageable. Where IDW dominates is in the introduction. Titans is just four pages long whereas IDW has a significantly longer introduction and contained a ton of background information that I found fascinating. I really grew to appreciate the work that Russ Manning did and all the behind the scenes stuff related to getting these comics produced.This is the final volume and perhaps my favorite of the four. The introduction to this volume concludes with Russ Mannings death at the too young age of 52. Although he was no longer working on Tarzan when he died he stuck it out way longer than almost anyone else would have taking less money than he could have made elsewhere with his skills. He stayed with Tarzan because he loved the character and working on Tarzan was the realization of a lifelong dream. If youre a fan of Tarzan and/or great comic art this is one I dont think you should pass up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LRLNXVD3TZR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402153#wasThisHelpful","R1LRLNXVD3TZR0","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Convergence #0 starts with Superman finding himself lost somewhere out of space and time being taunted by Brainiac. The events move in a very dreamlike manner as Brainiac reveals to Superman various alternate timelines and realities. Even Brainiac himself continues to change from his original 1950s form up to his current form and beyond.As a comic intended to set up the Convergence crossover I confess it didnt really get me charged up. The comic basically sets up the intent of Convergence. Brainiac exists outside of time and space and is able to bring together alternate timelines such as DC prior to Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC of Zero Hour, DC of the New 52. I LOVE the concept but what this comic reminded me of was that a concept is only as good the execution.I enjoyed seeing the various incarnations of Brainiac and the different Metropoliss that Brainiac had collected but after reading the comic twice I left it with a *meh*.This may be the beginning of an amazing crossover but here at the starting line my anticipation has gone down rather than up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDZXDBUE0BF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1Y3QQ2#wasThisHelpful","R3NDZXDBUE0BF9","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a tough one because the quality of the book can be measured in three ways and the quality varies dramatically depending on how you look at it.The first thing to look at is the presentation and in that respect Titan does a very good job. This is a lovely hardcover book with large dimensions befitting a volume containing Sunday comics. Despite being over 13 tall the comics are still reduced from their original size but I wouldnt really want a book that size. The only book I can remember that actually was the original dimension of the Sunday comics was Wednesday Comics by DC which was 20 high. It was cool but the book was so tall in cannot fit on any shelf I own and is a bit of a pain to read which means I only read it once and stored it away. On the other hand the reduction in size does take away from the image sharpness somewhat. It seems like no publisher today wants to simply bite the bullet and split a single Sunday spread onto two pages to keep the original image size without producing a monstrous book.The Introduction to the book is a scant four pages and really didnt tell me much about Burne Hogarth besides that he apparently became somewhat crusty in his old age and seemed concerned with modern artists drawing Tarzan with long hair. I did enjoy the pencil and ink art of Hogarth included in the introduction which showed the beauty of his art prior to the addition of color. All in all I think Titan did a good job but Im not an expert on reproducing comics so others may fault the techniques of Titan. I rarely see one of these comic collections where some reviewer doesnt claim that the reproduction is god awful. The images are a little muddy but that always seems to be the case with comics 70 to 80 years old. The biggest issue for me was that a lot of text was on colored backgrounds and were near impossible to read.Burne Hogarths art is excellent and appropriate for the ape man with lots of background detail including lush landscapes. If given the choice I prefer his contemporary Alex Raymond whose style was a bit more consistent and precise. Hogarths art feels more of a product of his era but thats cool with me. Its no surprise that Burne Hogarths name is used to sell this collection rather than the writer, Don Garden.Tarzan  Versus the Barbarians features a great presentation, fabulous art and Don Garden whose name appears on the cover below the artist. Why? The stories are repetitive and forgettable. He also uses third person narrative which really doesnt work well in comics. There is a reason you never see it employed today. In the stories Tarzan fights against some lost civilization. Then he gets caught, then helps a woman and he gets caught, and he escapes, over and over and over again. I actually found the stories to be somewhat depressing as almost everyone Tarzan comes across is an enemy and the moment he solves the current issue he immediately comes across more problems and more people who hate him. One wonders why he even bothered and didnt just escape into the jungle to be away from everyone.There really isnt much Hogarths art or Titans presentation can do to improve the story. Garden actually reminds me a lot of Don Moore who was the original writer for Flash Gordon and also wrote in third person. Moore only seemed to be able to tell one story and he just told it over and over again. You cant fault Tarzan or Flash Gordon for lacking action but when you read months or years of material in one sitting the repetition becomes painfully acute.I dont regret getting this volume as Im a huge fan of the character Tarzan and I plan on getting volume three later this year but Id be lying if I said this was anything resembling great literature. As Ive been reading this volume Im also reading Walt and Skeezix by Frank King and the difference in writing quality is staggering. I guess thats why Garden gets only a halfhearted mention. This is a celebration of Burne Hogarths art and its here where the book shines. I give Titan all credit in the world for republishing these classic comics and doing it in a quality, respectful manner. Next time, however, lets see a bit more effort on the introduction.One additional thing to add. There was a story in here that I knew Id read before but I couldnt remember where so I checked the Titan volume one and it wasnt there. It finally dawned on me that it was reproduced by DC comics with very similar art. The point of me saying this is actually something disturbing I discovered when looking at my other Hogarth book. I stored it upright on a bookshelf with smaller books around it (Its a very tall book) and the binding in the spine was considerably tighter at the bottom of the book where it was held in tight than at the top. I moved it so that now its surrounded by books of similar height hoping the spine might tighten up but I fear the book may be irreparably damaged.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2V7H073C8MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781163189#wasThisHelpful","R2R2V7H073C8MW","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not particularly impressed with the second volume of Adventures of Superman and gave the book a very generous four stars. I am delighted to say the volume three is not only a vast improvement, it is the best yet. This was the kind of material I was hoping for when I heard about the series. If you were disappointed by volume 2 give this series another chance.Here are the stories in this collection.The Dark Lantern  Writer Jim Kreuger, Pencils by Neil Edwards, The Green Lantern charged with protecting Krypton learns of the doomed planets sole survivor and seeks out Superman hoping the Man of Steel will deliver justice and kill him. In the end it turns out a longtime Superman foe was orchestrating the whole confrontation. A good start to the volume.The Demolisher  Writer Peter Milligan, Art by Agustin Padilla, Criminals beware. A new vigilante has arrived in Metropolis and The Demolisher doesnt mess around. He starts by crushing the hands of the Toyman and putting Bruno Ugly Mannheim in intensive care. Now THIS is what Im talking about. If youre going to write a Superman story out of continuity go for it. I was sure that it was going to turn out that Superman was being affected by Red Kryptonite but nope. Does Superman act out of character? Yes. Is it a compelling story? Yes.Exposed  Writer B. Clay Moore, Art by Gabriel Rodriguez - A grungy reporter for a small rival newspaper of the Daily Planet has been trying to connect the dots around Superman and believes hes discovered a bombshell of a secret. Unfortunately his investigation gets him in way over his head including a dangerous encounter with Metallo.The Sound of One Hand Clapping  Writer Max Landis, Art by Jock, Almost the entire story is one conversation between The Joker and Superman. I absolutely loved this one. The Joker is always shown as practically omnipotent which doesnt really make sense since hes technically a normal human, just one with a preternatural resourcefulness. In this story The Joker decides to tug on Supermans cape and discovers hes WAY out of his league. Batman, who unfortunately always seems to get the better of Superman, also finds out what happens when you get on his wrong side. This is another story where Superman acted in a non-traditional way but it works brilliantly. My favorite story in the book.The Coming of Sugar and Spike-?  Writer Fabian Nicieza, Pencils by Phil Hester, Clark Kent agrees to watch a pair of toddlers for some friends and the boy and girl turn out to be classic DC characters Sugar and Spike. Not only does Superman learn what a handful they are so does the Atomic Skull.Only child  Writer Ron Marz, Art by Evan Doc Shaner, What would happen if Superman met the robot from the movie Iron Giant? Although the giant robot is never referred to as the Iron Giant hes a dead ringer. Good Story.Strange visitor  Writer Joe Keatinge, Art by a bunch of people, This is a story that requires at least a couple of read throughs. Its narrated by Kamandi who tells about Superman who apparently is nigh on immortal and survives even to the end of the universe. There is a continuing thread about a Red Kryptonite rocket that ceases to exist upon launch and the mystery behind its disappearance. This cover of the book is from this story and its one of the more memorable ones.Seed of destruction  Writer Jerry Ordway, Art by Steve Rude, This is a very neat team-up of Superman and OMAC (One Man Army Corps) and a nice homage to Jack Kirby including attempts to emulate his writing and drawing style.Ghosts of krypton  Writer Steve Niles, Art by Matthew and Dow Smith, Superman is haunted by the ghost of a dead Kryptonian.Mystery box  Kelly Sue DeConnick, Art by Valentine De  Landro, The book ends with a womans perspective. Superman gets a lead lined Valentines gift from Lois and he tries to figure out what it is as he fights battles alongside Batman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman. A great way to finish the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XE9U0BN9DUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKGEH62#wasThisHelpful","R32XE9U0BN9DUH","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ive read and reviewed all the Century volumes and all the Nemo (Janni) volumes and this is the first time I did my homework PRIOR to reading the story. Using clues from the product description I read The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Face in the Abyss by A. Merritt and even Eight Hundred Leagues on the Amazon by Jules Verne just on the chance it might get a mention. Turns out what I should have done was watched Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine and read an extremely obscure comic from 1902 called Hugo Hercules.I have not given any of the Century or Nemo volumes rave reviews and thats not going to change with this latest volume. River of Ghosts is very similar in plot to The Roses of Berlin, including hunting down the previously decapitated Princess Ayesha, except this story is not as good. I would love to say that the writer of Watchmen, Swamp Thing and Miracleman had re-found his mojo and produced a new masterpiece but there is nothing here that comes close to Alan Moore at his best. Like the other two stories in the Nemo trilogy the plot appears to be incidental and the story seems to exist to cram in references to literary and movie characters. Probably the most interesting character in the book was the enormous and seemingly indestructible bodyguard of Janni, Hugo Hercules. Hes a bit of an exaggeration of the original comic character but it was neat that Alan Moore resurrected what some consider the first super powered comic character. I had never heard of the character before reading this story.If you loved Heart of Ice and The Roses of Berlin youll probably love River of Ghosts but for me it was simply a pale reflection of Moores greater works. I have no idea if Alan Moore will ever produce another masterpiece like V for Vendetta or The Killing Joke but Ill continue to support his new material even if my reviews arent offering great praise. Alan Moore has produced more marvelous stories than any other comic writer ever and his craftsmanship even here is top notch but it just lacks those magical moments from earlier works. Its an attractive hard cover book but when I go to my shelf to read some great Alan Moore stories this book will likely sit on the shelf collecting dust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFPI68487MZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1603093559#wasThisHelpful","R2YFPI68487MZT","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Want to know what the greatest comic run is in the history of DC comics? Its Alan Moores three years writing Swamp Thing. Yeah, I know. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and art is subjective but read this series and tell me Im wrong. I had the wonderful fortune to read these comics as they were being published and looking back now Im not even sure how it happened. I was strictly a superhero comic fan and Swamp Thing was out of my genre but I was probably influenced by the buzz about Alan Moore. I can remember going to the drug store with my grandfather, when he was still alive, picking up Swamp Thing and being mesmerized. I can remember every storyline in the three year span but none more so than the Monkey King featured in this first volume. Its one of the most horrifying comic stories ever and cemented Alan Moores place as a force to be reckoned with in American comics.What Alan Moore did was look at Swamp Thing and find that his origin made no sense so he completely reinvented the character. At the time I wasnt super thrilled but looking back it was absolutely the right thing to do. Swamp Thing was no longer a man turned into a monster, he was a plant who thought he was a man. One of the most indelible moments in a sea of indelible moments was when the Swamp Thing fully accepted who he was. During a battle between The Monkey King and Ertigan the Demon, Abigail Cable urges Swamp Thing to flee as there are two monsters and Swamp Thing replies Three Monsters Run. 33 years after that line was written Ive always remembered it. I can remember so many specific lines and particular pieces of art and Im the type of person who can barely remember comics I read a month ago. That is how hard these stories hit.It would be a terrible miscarriage of justice to not include Stephen Bissette and John Totleben along with Moore as the reasons for success. Alan Moores writing is so good that even when paired with artists of modest skills *ahem* Eddie Campbell *ahem* he can still produce a masterpiece but in this case he couldnt have asked for better artists. Not only are Bissette and Totleben fantastic artists theyre skills perfectly match Alan Moores horror writing. Dare I say they outdo even the legendary Bernie Wrightson? There is such an incredible creepiness and otherworldliness to the art and again they shine no greater than in the Monkey King story line. The Monkey King is meant to be the literal embodiment of fear and if youve ever read this story you will never forget the image of true horror.If youve never read Alan Moores Swamp Thing do yourself a huge favor and read every issue. There is NOTHING like it being produced today and Moore puts to shame any modern writers. In fact Alan Moore today cannot match the work he produced in the 80s. It can be argued whether or not Swamp Thing is his best ever but I would definitely say that this was written during Moores peak. This is the greatest era of comics greatest writer. Read Swamp Thing, read Watchmen, read Miracleman and prepare to be changed. These are life altering comics and I was privileged to read all of them when they were first published.Let me finish off with a brief rant. What do Green Arrow by Kevin Smith, Identity Crisis and All-Star Batman and Robin have in common? They all have Absolute Editions. Alan Moores Swamp Thing does not have an Absolute Edition. Swamp Thing does not have an Omnibus Edition and currently no hard cover edition being sold on Amazon. How is that right? Swamp Thing deserves the royal treatment not some afterthought effort. Swamp Thing is not some historical DC footnote. It is a series that has continued off and on for over 40 years including up and until today. There IS an audience. Do it DC and make it right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y0MA97QUO360/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009DNVU9K#wasThisHelpful","R1Y0MA97QUO360","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WE3 has a fairly simple plot. The government has a secret program that involves taking three lost pets, a dog, a cat and a rabbit, encasing them in extraordinarily lethal suits and giving them just enough intelligence to follow orders and speak an extremely simple language. Secret government bio weapons is a story thats been explored countless times but Grant Morrison manages to make it feel fresh. The title of the book should be read as We 3 in other words the 3 bio weapons and they are the stories protagonists even as they obey their directives and defend themselves by inflicting carnage on anyone who threatens them. Imagine it like Robocop with animals except if Robocop violently obliterated anyone who threatened him in a flurry of blood, eyeballs and shattered bones.This is one of the goriest most brutal books comics I have ever read but it doesnt feel gratuitous. It feels like the reality of what would happen if animals were trained to defend themselves at all costs by any means necessary and then given the tools to inflict massive bodily. One of the problems Morrison has had in the past (and up until today) is creating characters who feel real. Ironically the three animals, Bandit, Tinker and Pirate, are some of the most real characters Morrison has ever created. Despite being literal killing machines its damn near impossible not to feel tremendous sympathy for them and hope for a happy ending even as the animals inflict and receive horrific abuse.This is another brilliant collaboration of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely and this is a collection by DC that mostly does their work justice.  With only three issues there really wasnt enough material here to sustain an Absolute or Omnibus Edition but what readers to get is a nice amount of sketches and background material. I heartily recommend this collection and unless you are squeamish about the violence I dont see a reason not to give it a chance. One last thing. Another deficiency Morrison has is his ability to give a story an ending that equals the buildup. WE3 has one of Morrisons best and most memorable endings. All and all its a great story with magnificent art.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFINTBN1Y5WD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401243029#wasThisHelpful","RFINTBN1Y5WD2","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are probably a lot of people who would read Ultra Comic and give it one star and I wouldnt blame them. This is definitely a story that will resonate with some people and fall flat on its face with others. Grant Morrison has been experimenting with storytelling for his entire career with some brilliant successes (Flex Mentallo) and some spectacular failures (Final Crisis). Of course these are subjective and IGN ranked Final Crisis as the greatest DC crossover ever but suffice to say it cannot be disputed that Morrison polarizes readers and for some people like myself we find some stories amazing and some awful.Ultra Comics is Morrisons attempt to make a fully self-aware comic book. A comic that communicates directly with the reader. This is similar to what Morrison did with Flex Mentallo but here he has taken it to the nth degree. The main character is literally named Ultra Comics and was created on Earth Prime, the Earth which was originally intended to be OUR Earth in the DC multiverse. It was eradicated in Crisis on Infinite Earths but is apparently back again. Like a lot of Morrison stories it doesnt make a much sense. If Earth Prime is our Earth, an Earth with no super heroes and magic than how was Ultra Comics created and where does he go when he faces off against distorted parodies of the Justice League if Earth Prime has no super humans? A reader will simply have to strap in for the ride because things tend to happen without rhyme or reason because yknow, its Morrison.Ive really enjoyed Multiversity but more as a fascinating comic book experiment than as a tight coherent story. For straight storytelling its all over the place; more of a collection of fascinating ideas than an actual tale. The most lucid story in the series was Thunderworld Adventures. I would put Ultra Comics somewhere in the middle of the pack with Pax Americana and Thunderworld being my two favorites. The beauty of this series is that I can read each comic three and four times and discover something new each time. Thats not true with most writers. In fact the first day I bought Ultra Comics I read it twice and will probably read it several more times.I can envision a reader upon finishing Ultra Comics throwing it down in disgust as pretentious, self-indulgent garbage. My take was different. Im an older comic reader and Ive read a LOT of stories and when I see something different it attracts my attention. Morrisons experimentations dont always work but I respect him for taking risks. In my opinion the entire Multiversity effort gets a B+. Whether you love Ultra Comics or hate it you probably wont forget it and I hope that Morrison will continue to explore this idea of involving the reader in the comic. I encourage people to give this one a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPWMRY0LVNKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1Y3RX4#wasThisHelpful","R3CPWMRY0LVNKI","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tom Swift novels stick to a VERY tight formula. Tom Swift either acquires or creates a vehicle, the Swift family is menaced by a group of thugs (in the first three books its the same group) and he has frequent encounters with his nemesis the red headed bully Andy Folger. With the fourth book we finally get a slight break form the formula. This time its Toms father Barton who invents the titular submarine and we may finally be done with the Happy Harry Gang. The Swifts have an actual goal this time which is to use the submarine to find 300 grand in lost treasure lost at sea.If youre searching for great literature from the early 20th century keep looking. The Tom Swift books were cranked out at a blistering pace releasing 15 books in the first 3 years of publication. But that doesnt mean they arent enjoyable reads and a very interesting sociological glimpse into life in 1910. Thats not to say this is an entirely accurate representation but a readers get a general feel of a simpler time. The Tom Swift books are written for young adults and they feature very simple plots that are easy to follow.Although the plots are simple and aimed towards a younger audience they dont insult the readers intelligence. Reading this as an adult Im impressed with how airtight the plots tend to be. These stories are also intellectually inspirational as we read about the Swifts challenges in building a fully operational submarine. The writer even includes descriptions of the means of propulsion and yet the story never drags down with needless scientific chatter. When the Swifts are in development phase things never work correctly the first time and thats reality. In fact the initial test of the submarine is the closest the Swifts and friends have come to death.Having an inventor as a hero and being along for the ride as he invents might encourage a youngster to consider a career in science or at least increase respect for the scientific method. The only issue I might bring up is that the feasibility of the Swifts having the funds to produce a fully operational 100 foot long submarine seems entirely fanciful. This is no primitive cut rate sub. This is the real deal capable of sailing to the middle of the ocean and descending several miles under the ocean. Its even equipped with a defensive weapon that gets some usage but Im willing to accept it because the author integrates it all into an entertaining tale.With each entry in the series the stories are growing bigger and bigger. The first book had Tom Swift acquiring a motorbike. Whoop-de-doo. By the third story Tom had co-invented a hybrid plane/balloon which was somewhat cool and now hes on a treasure hunt with a submarine. Thus far this is my favorite book in the series. The villains are a bit more interesting and I enjoyed reading of their travels across the ocean including a stop at the classic desert island. This is a series that is aimed at young teens but it doesnt pander or insult intelligence so even older readers can enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10092H1KI2T9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084BZ3MW#wasThisHelpful","R10092H1KI2T9F","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original writer and creator of Justice League Dark was Peter Milligan. Writing was later taken over by Jeff Lemire and with this volume J.M. DeMatteis. I can officially say that each writer has been just about equally bland and forgettable. I will get into the specifics in a moment but let me mention that I have tried three New 52 series including Scott Snyders Swamp Thing, Suicide Squad and Justice League Dark and have found them all disappointing. There are other comics like Forever Evil and Multiversity that I enjoyed but overall it seems like the New 52 is just not for me and maybe its partly due to my age.Peter Milligan set the tone for the JLD and it was decidedly kid friendly. There was lots of emphasis on Justice League and not much on Dark. There were a few creepy moments but nothing a pre-teen couldnt handle. Lemire took it even further in the kid friendly direction with a long storyline dealing the JLD battling longtime JLA villain Felix Faust over the powerful Books of Magic. The story even included a character that I can only assume was intended to capitalize on the popularity of Harry Potter.So now DeMatteis has taken over writing duties and for a brief moment I thought he was taking the series in a new and improved direction. The back of the book shows Nightmare Nurse with a half demonic face garroting Zatanna. Now THAT would be interesting. A member of the team, revealed as evil, turning on her teammates. And her name IS Nightmare Nurse which is a somewhat frightening name. Halfway through the story DeMatteis does a U-Turn and takes the Tales from the Darkside story and gives it a Goosebumps ending and the team is back to being happy and friendly with Nightmare Nurse learning a good lesson in friendship.DeMatteis stories here just seem random and unfocussed. The team is floating around in the House of Mystery and challenges just pop up for them to deal with. Another issue I have is something I wrote in a previous review. John Constantine is constantly referred to as a bastard by the other members of the team despite no evidence to back it up (at least not in this series). Deadman refers to him exclusively as con-man even though he continually fights alongside the team and defends its members. Like the previous writers DeMatteis wants to have his cake and eat it too. He wants Constantine to be regarded as an anti-hero but never has him actually act like an anti-hero (because THAT would be interesting). At one point John Constantine suggests he will leave the rest of the team in peril and escape but is prevented from doing so. This way DeMatteis could point and say LOOK Constantine was going to do something terrible except he didnt and even when he said he would leave them chained up that was out of character for him based on his actions in the JLD.My suggestion in a review of a previous Justice League Dark volume was go read Swamp Thing by Alan Moore which are all available on Amazon. Then read Sandman by Neal Gaiman and if you can find it The Spectre by Joe Orlando. Then come back and read Justice League Dark and compare the two. I read Alan Moores Swamp Thing in the early 1980s and a distinctly remember many of the storylines over 30 years later. I barely remember JLD volumes 1 and 2 which I read just recently. DC has done some great, dark, arcane stories but the JLD is safe for kids and forgettable. Volume 5 is my last volume. Done.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFMBB67HCY3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9PCSKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LFMBB67HCY3S","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first two issues are by Peter Milligan with the Justice League Dark battling a hoard of vampires in Gotham City. When last we left off the JLD was finishing off their long fight with The Enchantress that occupied the entire book and it felt like the vampire storyline started up in mid-stream. Just as abruptly as the storyline starts it ends, seemingly with no conclusion and Peter Milligan writing stint comes to a close as Jeff Lemire takes over. After doing a little research it appears the vampire storyline was a crossover with the I, Vampire series so unless you read I, Vampire you are treated to two issues with no start and no conclusion. Real Nice DC.In my review of book one I wrote that the Justice League Dark had a ton of unrealized potential. Milligan made some attempts at character depth and he had some snappy dialogue but for a team of magical and occult based characters the story felt very benign. It wasnt creepy or gothic or even particularly intriguing or thoughtful. Milligan seemed to focus more on the Justice League and less on the Dark.Unfortunately Jeff Lemire has taken it even further in that direction. His entire storyline is an almost relentless battle with Felix Faust. As if they werent standing in the shadow of the Justice League enough now they spend a significant amount of time battling one of the JLAs classic villains. Many of the magic based heroes powers are either indistinguishable from super powers (Deadman) or so ill-defined that you have no idea WHAT they are capable of (Madame Xanadu). In the case of Zatanna her power are constantly conking out because her ability to do pretty much ANYTHING by speaking backwards makes totally overpowered. The JLD fight in classic superhero style, as a group each using their powers in battle but that exactly how an occult based team SHOULDNT fight. Instead of differentiating the JLD from other super hero teams Lemire goes with the same tired super team storyline. A more thoughtful story could have been highly rewarding but thats not where Lemire and Milligan decided to go.My last issue is with John Constantine. I just dont think Lemire has any idea what to do with him. Hes constantly referred to as a liar, a bastard and con artist and yet there is little evidence to back this up. He lies to Zatanna but even that seems like it was put in just to give SOME evidence that he was a liar and his lie wasnt really done for selfish reasons. Or was it? Who knows? There is an issue devoted to his backstory but all we learn is that hes obsessed with obtaining magic. For what ends? We dont know. The only thing he seems to do with magic is fight evil which flies in the face of his being a bastard. If Lemire wants to make him an anti-hero then do it. Instead Lemire plays it safe as he does with the entire storyline.Based on user reviews it seems as if people are really enjoying Justice League Dark. Here is my suggestion for fans, most of whom are probably quite a bit younger than I am. Go read Swamp Thing by Alan Moore which are all available on Amazon. Then read Sandman by Neal Gaiman and if you can find it The Spectre by Joe Orlando. The come back and read Justice League Dark and see if you still think its five star material.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJVK4YHHPXEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DY8FG90#wasThisHelpful","R2BJVK4YHHPXEH","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jules Verne has never been known to create deep and compelling characters or complex plots but Eight Hundred Leagues on the Amazon was one of his shallowest. The Wikipedia plot summary is a whopping four lines long which may be a record for the shortest description of any Verne story on Wikipedia. It really is little more than a story of a family travelling down the Amazon for a wedding. The twist is that they build an island sized raft with huts and even foliage and they bring along tons of workers. Not exactly roughing it.Most people who know the works of Jules Verne have not actually read his stories and those who have read his stories have probably not read his lesser known works. Here is the thing about Verne. His work is really dated. This is not Victor Hugo or Alexandre Dumas level storytelling. Vernes hook was that he would offer readers a literary tour of places they would or could never go, which was brilliant for 19th century reader but less so for a reader today. If you or I want to experience the Amazon we could watch a nature program or even fly to South America (not nearly as easy or affordable in 1881).Certainly a skilled writer could create a compelling story about a trip down the Amazon but that is not Vernes intention. The trip IS the story and so much of the book is like reading an encyclopedia full of facts. Its like a travelogue from Mutual of Omahas Wild Kingdom narrated by a deep voiced announcer. On paper it can be quite dull. About halfway through the book we FINALLY get a little bit of a plot. It seems that years ago the patriarch of the family was accused of a crime he didnt commit but escaped, changed his name and has lived in relative isolation on his large farm. The trip down the Amazon has inspired him to clear his name but a terrible series of circumstances lands him back in prison with a date of execution.The story continues to drag along as the mans son and future son-in-law desperately try to find the proof to free their dad and when they do its inexplicably encrypted. With Verne writing the story there is never any doubt the man will be freed so the long drawn out attempt at tension is just dull.130 years ago this story might have been fascinating to a reader with the descriptions of South America and the melodramatic story but I think youd be hard pressed to find a modern reader that will find it riveting which is probably why few people have heard of this book. This book sort of showcases the worst aspects of Jules Vernes writing and doesnt feature a cool hook like the Nemos Nautilus or Roburs Terror. Just a big floating pile drifting down the Amazon. If you want to read through the Jules Verne bibliography I would put this story very low on the list of stories to read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL772BGXAFORU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497336333#wasThisHelpful","RL772BGXAFORU","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me get one thing out of the way. Tarzan does NOT go to the Earths core. To say that Tarzan went to the Earths core would be like saying youve gotten to the apple core when you peel off the skin. What Burroughs has done is create a hollow Earth filled with dinosaurs, all sorts of primitive tribes and even a miniature son at the center of the Earth (the true core). Burroughs didnt invent the idea of the hollow Earth but simply used it in a series of books including this one that includes Tarzan. Its pretty clear to me that this was Burroughs the businessman trying to utilize his popular Tarzan character to bring more attention to his Pellucidar books.Here is my problem with Pellucidar. Tarzan is clearly a fantasy character but to me he has always maintained one foot in reality. Even the existence of Pal-ul-don with its own dinosaurs doesnt break any laws of physics but Pellucidar is absurd. The idea appears to be that gravity is within the crust of the Earth rather than the core since people can walk on both the inside and outside of the crust which is about 500 miles thick. A ship, for instance, could sail through one of the polar openings and arrive in Pellucidar unaware that they had moved from the exterior to the interior of the planet. But if gravity were spread out within the entire crust rather than at the true core people couldnt walk on the interior OR exterior. If the gravity came from the interior sun the people inside the Earth would get pulled right into the sun. There are just way too many absurdities for me to take the premise seriously but I guess the big question would be whether Burroughs was able to take this silly concept and create a compelling story.So is it a good story? Not really. Tarzan is recruited to lead an expedition into Pellucidar to rescue a gentleman named David Ennis from pirates called Korsars. This is just a pretense as Tarzan wanders off on his own and gets lost pretty immediately after entering Pellucidar and a group sent to rescue him likewise gets lost and the story dissolves into Tarzan and another character named Jason Gridley wandering around Pellicidar and David Ennis is forgotten about until the last few pages. This is far from the first time Burroughs has written a story where the plot is basically people running around doing stuff.Besides having a near vacuous plot At Earths Core also suffers from some other classic Burroughs writing idiosyncrasies. There are the unbelievable coincidences as characters just happen to run into each other repeatedly in this world of Pellicidar (which literally has more land mass than the external world). In previous Tarzan stories, Tarzan has a nearly supernatural ability to pick up foreign languages almost instantaneously. Its a cheap literary shortcut but I guess we can just assume Tarzan is freaky good at learning new languages except in this book Jason Gridley becomes fluent in the language of Pellicidar in a ridiculously short period of time. On the other hand I dont even know how much time this story is supposed to span. Is it days, weeks, months, years? If the time span is established I must have missed it.Tarzan at Earths Core leaves open plot points that will be resolved in Burroughs other Pellicidar books but thats the whole point. Burroughs was a businessman and here was his version of synergy. Its too bad the plot was so empty.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G107Z79AVJ0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089I41K0#wasThisHelpful","R1G107Z79AVJ0W","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mastermen is another brilliant addition to the Multiversity miniseries but it suffers from the same problem as the rest of the books in the series. The book is released as Mastermen #1 and it comes off as the first in an exciting new series except there is no scheduled issue 2. To put it simply there is no resolution to the story and this is quite common in the Multiversity stories.The story starts off reminiscent of Red Son except Ka-L lands in Germany and is adopted by Hitler instead of landing in Soviet Russia. He is raised as Overman and helps the Nazis win WW II. The natural assumption is always that if the Nazis win WW II they will simply continue to be the same bloodthirsty Nazis perpetually but to Morrisons credit he takes a different approach and after 60 years the Nazi ruled planet has stabilized and Earth-10s JLA seem like a fairly decent group who legitimately protect the Earth from danger. They are not the squeaky clean JLA we all know but by and large seem earnest in their battling of evil. Of the groups members only the seemingly immortal Overman was alive during the Nazis most heinous days and continues to bear the shame. As Leatherwing (Batman) says he wasnt even alive at the time and wont be held responsible.It is in this environment that Uncle Sam rises again and with the help of an unexpected ally creates the Freedom Fighters to end the Nazi rule. The battle is ON and then the story ends. We never actually see The Ray or Black Condor in action and we get one panel of Phantom Lady doing something. The Human Bomb easily gets those most panel time. If this were the first issue of a new series I would be totally stoked to get issue 2 but its not. Unless Multiversity #2 wraps up the story or DC actually does continue the series it remains an unresolved cliffhanger.Multiversity feels like an evolution with DC comics taking existing characters and placing them in alternative situations. Elsewhere stories is nothing new and even the idea that the elsewhere stories exist in different parallel universes has been done for decades but it feels like Morrison is trying to organize and evolve these ideas. DC might be responding favorably to this idea and will be following up Multiversity with Convergence which looks like a similar project to Multiversity. In fact Convergence is probably the most exciting DC crossover Ive seen (which means it will probably disappoint).Morrison tried to inspire seven new series with his Seven Soldiers of Victory experiment which to the best of my knowledge produced none and Multiversity will probably end the same way but there is some really good writing going on here and if DC were to continue these series Id definitely give them a chance. I would recommend all the Multiversity comics with Pax Americana being my favorite followed by Thunderworld but honestly there is yet to be a clunker in the batch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPV52C21GKYAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THMO32I#wasThisHelpful","RPV52C21GKYAB","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive never really understood why Dark Horse chose to publish the Astro Boy comics out of chronological order. In volume 9 we start with The Secret of the Egyptian Conspirators published April to August 1969 followed by The Invisible Giant from May to July 1960 and then we go all the way back to June of 1954 for Cobalt.The Secret of the Egyptian Conspirators is a fairly typical Tezuka story involving the abuse and manipulation of robots. We get a rare appearance by Astro Boy creator Dr. Tenma who was originally shown to be a bastard but now occasionally pops up when Astro Boy is in real danger. The ending is also typical of Tezuka in that its a lot more hard hitting and real than one might expect from a comic with such whimsical art. This is the longest story in the book and probably the best with some pretty good robot fighting mixed with some emotional scenes as the robot Cleopatra is treated with disdain by her evil creator.The Invisible Giant was intended to be an homage to The Fly where a scientist created a teleporter and ends up having his own DNA mixed with that of a fly. In this story two scientists create a teleporter but when one of the scientists turns the machine off in mid teleportation, in order keep to the technology for himself, the other scientist essentially has his atoms scattered. The scattered scientist is able to somewhat reconstitute himself using 3D TVs and begins killing people not out of evil but seemingly from confusion. A villain tries to use the ghostly scientist for his own nefarious ends but Astro Boy arrives to try and stop the villain and save the poor scientist.The oldest story in this book is Cobalt. Astro Boy is sent out to find and disarm an H-Bomb but when they lose contact with him Professor Ochanomizu creates a near duplicate of Astro Boy named Cobalt. Cobalt is powerful but not as technically capable and doesnt have Astro Boys ability to disarm a bomb so his mission is to find Astro. This is the first story featuring Astro Boys little brother, Cobalt, and like a lot of early Tezuka stories the plot is a bit disjointed. All and all a decent book. Not my favorite volume but a worthy addition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQ3VTZHSHPSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569717923#wasThisHelpful","RRQ3VTZHSHPSS","ARNEUO7BF3J55","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARNEUO7BF3J55?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This would clone a 160 GB 3.5inch 7200 rpm drive in about 30 minutes, and 160 GB 2.5 inch 5400 rpm drives in an hour.It also works great to connect drives to a workstation for management or archival purposes.The only improvement I would recomend:  use 3 LEDs, maybe green, yellow, and red to indicate status.  As it is it uses one indicator that is blue when it is ready, blue/ teal pulsing while it is cloning, and teal when it is complete.  Sure, it works, it even looks kinda neat- but it isn't a clear delineation between status.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQ7V3JJZ6IEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKC14OG#wasThisHelpful","RJQ7V3JJZ6IEK","A3VK4UNUGQXHNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VK4UNUGQXHNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For such a small part the price is a little steep, but this is an outstanding upgrade for specialty AR15s.This is ideal on a CQB gun- allowing a right handed shooter to grip-and-rip the mag with the left hand and not have to manipulate anything with the right hand.This also works well on a AR set up with a long range optic and a bi-pod, again allowing the non-shooting hand to do all of the manipulations  (as long as you are using short magazines).I also recommend a badger latch charge handle for both of these special purpose AR15 builds.That covers those two special purpose built AR15s.

"I was expecting something that produces a variable (4.5-8 pounds) trigger pressure followed by a simulated hammer fall, followed by a simulated sear reset.  In other words- a dry fire trigger.  Apparently it doesn't exist.What I got was a bore light, that cleverly enough activates by pressing the trigger.  But there is no hammer fall or reset.  What it does provide is a trigger that I can work that does have a some resistance.As a dry fire training aid the laser is pointless, which means it is added cost to the system that I could be done without.In an AR,  the line-of-sights are so high above the line-of-bore that the laser strike is hidden behind the front sight post at anything less than 10 meters (and that requires the rear elevation to be maxed out)That, and of course the shooters visual focus should be on the sights and not the target area, so looking for a laser strike is bad training.I will keep it, but I do not recommend the device as a dry fire training aid.  I might recommend the device as an engagement skills trainer, especially if it is used in a training scenario with observer-controllers who can watch for the laser strikes on targets, or it might be fun to set up a ""shoot house"" if you can afford to buy a bunch of the laser targets.Build quality is not impressive.  Mine has a split on one side following what looks like an injection mold seam.  The battery contact is a little odd (a washer soldered to the end of a piece of wire that makes the negative contact)Sadly I probably could have built this device using an old bore guide and a laser pointer, but I give them credit for getting the thing manufactured and marketed-  Maybe they can work on the simulated trigger- give it a break and a reset, and make something that replicates the feel of a live trigger.

"This thing should be oh so cool, but-1. With no front camera to sense when the camera is up to your face it has been coded so the phone app locks the screen as soon as a call is in progress.

There is no update available from LG, there is no rom mod available from cyanogen, there is nothing you can do to update the OS (without risking bricking it by installing a ROM built for another model)  I have tried several no-lock apps, and not one can over ride the coding for the screen lock.3.  Regardless of the screen lock and display timeout settings applied in Security or Display settings the phone screen locks right about 30 seconds of inactivity.

I'm not saying that as a complaint, just be forewarned.Form factor is not bad, it is a little fat, as to be expected for a phone with a physical keyboard, but otherwise it is all around small.The slide out keyboard is actually quite good.It makes voice calls with about the same reception as any other phone, and it's not bad for text.

"Captivating and extremely suspenseful, Pretty Girls is the kind of book one doesn't want to put down until the last page is read and the book closed. Even after I finished reading this novel, the characters and scenarios remained in my thoughts for a couple of days.An abducted girl and a very deceptive man's obsession with her sisters lead to the almost utter destruction of a family. Fortunately Claire and Lydia are determined to find the sick individuals who did this and bring them to justice.As usual Karin Slaughter created a cast of totally realistic and thoroughly flawed characters to populate this story. Fortunately, helpless rich wife, Claire, is forced to become much more self-sufficient during the massive drama that hits her and her family. In helping her sister and almost endangering her own daughter, Lydia obtains peace of mind and the justice she had been wanting for more than twenty years.A true page-turner, this book hardly gives the reader a chance to breathe as one suspenseful and horrific scene follows another. Every page read is a step of discovery of corruption in government, law enforcement and those nearest and dearest to the main characters.Thrilling, suspenseful and utterly satisfying, Pretty Girls is an absolute must-read.

I think Ill listen to this on audio as well just to experience it all over again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQWH6GCBSET4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060530928#wasThisHelpful","R3SQWH6GCBSET4","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Way, WAAAYYYY before the final page, I knew I was going to give this novel a resounding five stars. It more than deserves it. In my wildest dreams I never thought I would love this book as much as I have.This Song Will Save Your Life breaks out of the YA mold with fists swinging. I liked every single character in this story; even the less than stellar ones. Mostly I could relate to Elise and I loved, loved, LOVED the strong voice the author gave her.Every aspect of this story gels together to create a winning formula. The characters are excellent, the music is tasteful, and I lived myself into the nightlife setting at Start. I could hear the music, feel the excitement and joy of every dancer, experience the crackling atmosphere, and I smiled like a lunatic while dancing to the music in mind that Char and Elise were playing. My heart went out to Elise and her struggles, and I so appreciated her sincerity and brutal honesty.I loved Elises story  plain and simple as that. She isnt unique, but she is one hundred percent authentic and relatable. The author nailed it with this character. I appreciated the close relationship between Elise and her parents and Im so happy that I got to know her parents and siblings as well. I loved how Elise made mistakes but also how she learned through each of her mistakes and had to deal with the consequences of her actions.Another reason why Im saying that this story breaks out of the YA mold is because the romance is so different. I can only applaud Leila Sales for writing a romance that is so different from what Im used to getting in YA. I wish more authors would be this brave. I dont want to say more about it, or I might spoil it for those who havent read it yet.Can you tell by now how much I LOVED this book? Honestly, I cant wait to read more by this author who has such an incredible talent of bringing her characters to life. I dont think Ive even scratched the surface of all the things I LOVED about this book, but Im sure youve by now added it to your to-read list, and thats all that matters to me. Read this book. Now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BV5FPGULO9C5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374351384#wasThisHelpful","R1BV5FPGULO9C5","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hate List is a captivating novel with a great deal of depth. Blamed for conspiring with her boyfriend, Nick Levil, Valerie Leftman has to suffer through a senior year of hatred, accusations and guilt; all this because of a seemingly innocent list of names of people that she and Nick disliked.As all excellent books should, Hate List starts with a scene that instantly grabs the attention of the reader. Though the book remains quite gripping throughout, there are parts that are a bit lengthy thus hindering the forward motion of the story.The magic of this novel lies in the development and growth of Valerie's character. Not only does she have to move past her grief over her boyfriend's suicide, she also has to face her own guilt over the death and injury done to several people at her school by said boyfriend.When the school year starts, she must face not only her own guilt, but also the accusations and often the hatred of the other kids and even the teachers. This book is all about her psychological journey to healing and the forming of new friendships.The other characters are realistic and all the family scenarios are natural and not exaggerated. For a relaxing read with some depth, I think Hate List is a very worthwhile read.

"In short, this book is mostly much aboutwell, nothing. The first 85% is just your average teenage characters doing typical teenage stuff. Lots of making out, hanging out with da boys, crushing on said boys, the Spring Queen dance, buying dresses for the dance, and getting ready for the aforementioned dance. The last 15% of the book is when the story actually kicks in, but because its the last few pages, expect a massive amount of info dump.Admittedly, the story starts of intriguing and with the discovery of the pyxis box some mystery can be expected. But then the pacing slows down to a crawl and not much of anything happens almost until the end. If youre not put off by the usual grammar errors which are rife in self-pub books, this makes for good afternoon reading to lull you into an afternoon nap.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28AQ99A5JVGQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061UAWQ0#wasThisHelpful","R28AQ99A5JVGQ1","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A superb blend of reinvented history and steampunk set in an alternate reality, this novel turned out to be an excellent and well-imagined read. The story gripped me right from the start and I was awed and mesmerized by the fantastic and frightening inventions of Charlottes world. I wasnt very interested in the romance once it turned into a love-triangle (oh, do I despise those!), but the varied cast of characters, nefarious secrets, mysteries, and brutal tyranny of the empire kept me glued to the pages. All in all this was an exciting novel that set my imagination alight!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBV3ZMOBM6OFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014751438X#wasThisHelpful","RBV3ZMOBM6OFQ","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would never have guessed at the start of this story that I would end up giving it less than a four-star rating. The first half of the book flowed well and I was completely onboard with the romance between Becca and Nikolai. Sadly, a little after halfway, everything started falling flat when  after knowing each other for less than a week  these two MCs became so lovesick and obsessed with each other, and their romance so sappy, it put me off completely. Clearly Stanton has not yet received the memo that insta-love has become a big no-no and a thing of the past. Both these characters are eighteen and therefore I expected a certain level of maturity and clear-headedness, especially from the one who is a royal.Prince Nikolai isnt exactly princely. He only seems to be one in name, but does not behave like, or talk like, a royal. He comes across as a very ordinary teenager and I feel the author couldve done a lot more to make him more like a prince. To me it didnt feel like a prince fell in love with Becca; more like just a boy falling in love with just a girl. Why then bother to make Nikolais character a prince at all?The upside of this book was that I got to travel to a lot of places with Nikolai and Becca. The author either travels a lot, or did her research incredibly well, because she got the different settings down pat, and it was effortless to imagine the places she described.I would consider reading more of Angie Stantons future novels. But for that to happen she will definitely have to get her A-game on where romance is concerned, as well as doing away with the immaturity of her characters. She has potential and this book was centered on a fantastic idea, its just a pity the ending was so predictable and left me disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H33VE9XY4D6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062272586#wasThisHelpful","R2H33VE9XY4D6J","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Appearance of Annie Van Sinderen is a relaxing, sometimes thoroughly scary and slightly longwinded read. Wes and Tyler have film study projects to complete. Will the sudden appearance of Annie Van Sinderen benefit the project or threaten to derail, at least, Wes's effort?I had to read almost half of this novel before I was convinced that I wanted to actually finish it. A worthwhile read in the end, I found, especially the first part of this book overly descriptive and unnecessarily drawn out with lots of superfluous detail.The characters are fleshed out and extremely realistic. The young men, Wes and Tyler, are typical and rather irritating nineteen-year-olds. Wes, with his very obvious self image problem, complicates his own life with his insecurities about approaching women.Annie is very realistically portrayed in both her ghostly as well as her nineteenth century New York girl persona. Maddie is probably the most intriguing and likable character in this book.The final third of this story, however, makes reading The Appearance of Annie Van Sinderen a reasonably exciting and pleasurable experience.Those who love tales of hauntings with a hint of time travel may find this book a truly pleasant read.

"What a cute and memorable novella! Accident-prone Bonnie, the main character, is your typical rom-com heroine who is just plain unlucky. Of course, her ideal man is right under her nose, but she has to go through some stuff before she actually realizes this. The humor is straight from a string of well-known romantic comedy movies, but Bonnie is such an adorable character, it doesnt really matter what inspired her antics in this story.I was adequately impressed with Liz Appels writing (considering shes a self-pub), and I enjoyed every minute of this lighthearted romance novella. I will most certainly read more of her books and stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BIJYZR1M8SE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KZGYN8#wasThisHelpful","R3BIJYZR1M8SE9","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is my first Jennifer E. Smith experience, and will most certainly not be the last. I actually enjoyed this story a lot more than I initially thought I would, you know, seeing as its a romance and all. But what a beautiful romance it was! It was balanced perfectly and did not overshadow the development of this lovely cast of characters.I loved how the author didnt describe any of the characters  or had them think of each other  as cute or hot. Those are two words in the YA and romance genres that time and again make me gag. I mean, with a little creative effort on any authors part, there are so many imaginative and alternative ways to describe a love-interest. Jennifer E. Smith proves my point with her inventive ways of sketching these two main characters and how they perceive each other.Also, this romance doesnt follow the usual plot formula. It ends in such a way where anything can still happen for Lucy and Owen. I think the reason I enjoyed this story so much is because I didnt know how it was going to end for them, and also because, through Lucy and Owens travels, I got to visit parts of the U.S. Europe, Scotland and London.Overall, this was a delightful read and I was wholly enveloped in this poignant romance that took me places and allowed me to get to know two striking characters. I was also impressed that unlike most YA novels, this one didnt get anywhere near a high school, and just goes to show that love can happen outside of the confines of a classroom. I wish more YA authors would be this creative with their setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3YUT1282A7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316254770#wasThisHelpful","RN3YUT1282A7Y","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Set in the mid nineteenth century during the California gold-rush, Walk on Earth a Stranger is a captivating and often touching read. After her parents' brutal murder, Leah Westfall is forced to leave her hometown of Dahlonega, Georgia, to escape her uncle, Hiram. Hoping to meet up with her longtime friend, Jefferson McCauly, she heads west with thousands of gold seekers and pioneers with only her horse, Peony, for company.A true page-turner, Walk on Earth a Stranger is definitely among my favorite five books for this year. This book gripped me from the very first page where it is revealed that the main character, Lee, has an unusual supernatural gift. From there on I simply immersed myself in the adventures of Leah, her horse, and her best friend, Jefferson.The characters in this book are realistic, endearing and definitely the kind of people one wants to continue reading about. Leah is tough and gutsy, yet, deep down she is still the lady her mother wanted her to be.Jefferson is a bit more of an enigma. With his Native American heritage, he is often bitter about other people's attitudes regarding his ethnicity. He and Leah make a wonderful team when they are working for the Joiner family. Together, and knowing each other's ways, they perform several rescues during the hard journey to California.What struck me was the staggering amount of research the author must have put into this book. Vivid descriptions of life in a travelling wagon train put me right there with the families as they journeyed across prairie, desert and mountains. Romance is only hinted at throughout most of this story.For a stimulating, gripping and deeply touching read, I recommend Walk on Earth a Stranger as an absolute must-read.

"Full of dark twists and even more twisted characters, Horns is a captivating and sometimes scary read. When Ignatius Perrish wakes up with horns growing out of his temples, he knows that he must have done something really bad the previous night. When, subsequently, he starts getting confessions of terrible thoughts and sins from everybody he meets, he knows that the devil must have a hand in his change.From the captivating start to the very realistic and satisfying end of this book, it kept me enthralled all the time. Despite the fine detail, numerous back stories and lengthy visits to Ignatius's mind, I never found my attention straying.The main character, Ignatius, or Iggy, as we get to know him, is a truly good person with a couple of realistic personality flaws; a good guy who really tries to combat the torrent of evil that grips hold of him once the horns have appeared. Even then, and despite the evil thoughts and confessions he picks up from the various people he encounters, he still tries to do the right thing.This book really makes one think about the dual nature of most human beings. Through Iggy's eyes we get to see the hatred lurking in the minds of his own family, the sinful thoughts of the local priest and the tormented insanity in the mind of a good friend. We walk the past with Iggy while he hunts through the minds and thoughts of others as well as his own, seeking the truth behind the murder of his beloved Merrin.For a thrilling, often frightening read that will make you think deeply about the secrets and motives of others, I recommend Horns as a very, very worthwhile read.

"Deeply touching and most certainly one of the best books I've read so far this year, Still Alice brought me to whole new insights about Alzheimer's. Alice Howland, with her teaching position at Harvard and her PHD in cognitive Psychology, is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at the age of 50. Apart from her husband and three children having to deal with this, most importantly, she must deal with it.At the start of this book the reader is given a look into the still healthy mind of the main character, Alice. She is a busy, widely traveling professor with a busy social life and a passion for running.Once the Alzheimer's symptoms begin to show, the reader is already familiar with the person and the psyche of Alice. This makes Alice's journey into the confusion of Alzheimer's just so much more gripping and poignant.The medical detail of Alice's treatment, the tests she has to endure and even the hope given by drug testing on her brings a wonderful realism to this story. What really touched me is when Alice wished that she could have rather contracted cancer as in that case she would have a fighting chance. She sees cancer victims as heroes while Alzheimer's victims are simply insane people best locked away and forgotten by society.For a touching and, in many ways, an eye-opening read, I recommend Still Alice as a must-read.

"Bordering on horror, The Boy Who Drew Monsters, is a gripping and often scary read. While Jack Peter Keenan draws Monsters with an almost manic urgency, his parents, as well as his friend, Nick, is drawn into the nightmare depicted by said pictures.Despite the wonderfully clever plot, the vivid descriptions of both nature and the monsters and the lifelike characters, I found this book somewhat depressing. All the characters seem to be stuck in their past, their regrets, or the world of Jack Peter's imagination. There is absolutely no humor to break the dire atmosphere of this story.The characters, though lifelike and fleshed out, are difficult to identify with. Jack Peter's apparent instability is masterfully depicted while leaving the reader with numerous questions as to whether he is truly insane, extremely intelligent, or perhaps supernaturally gifted. I actually found myself slightly afraid of this enigmatic main character.The final pages of this book hold a clever surprise. Its a surprise that gives the tale an oddly satisfying end. The descriptions of nature and, especially, that of winter in a winter bound coastal town in Maine, are richly vivid, placing the reader right there in the middle of the drama surrounding the Keenan family.A suspenseful and often frightening tale, I recommend The Boy Who Drew Monsters as a worthwhile read.

"The Weight Of Blood is another book that will most certainly make it onto my best reads for 2015 list. After her best friend, Cheri, had been gruesomely murdered, Lucy is determined to find the killer as well as the secret behind her own mother's strange disappearance when Lucy was just a baby.This is undoubtedly one of the best books I've read in a long time. The story gripped me from the word go and kept me captivated throughout. As it is told from alternating points of view it gives the reader a thorough picture of what was truly happening in and around the little Ozark town of Henbane.The true magic of this book, however, lies in the characters. Not only are they well fleshed out, they are real people; people with strengths and weaknesses. Even the worst villain in this tale has a couple of redeeming qualities.The main character, Lucy, is a normal teenage girl who has to live with a difficult, somewhat alcoholic father. Though she is determined to find out what happened to her friend, Cheri, she isn't all tough and all successful like so many unrealistic heroines.The background against which this book is set is realistic and, in itself, a captivating world of small town politics, family secrets, under the table deals, and poor but warmhearted people.For a deeply touching and often suspenseful read with a healthy dose of romance, I recommend The Weight Of Blood as a must-read.

"Set in Paris, France, Die for Me, with its unique take on the undead, is a captivating tale of heroism and love. Having tragically lost her parents, Kate immerses herself in books and art. That is, until she meets Vincent and her life changes from the aforementioned passive world to one of adventure and romance.Though truly a comfortably paced and relaxing read, this book held my attention all the way. The paranormal theme of undead revenants is skillfully worked into everyday life as we know it, thus making it just so much more believable.Kate is a realistic and well fleshed out main character. She is tough and capable when necessary, yet feminine enough to stir the protective instinct of, not only Vincent, but also that of others, including her elder sister, Georgia.The male main character, Vincent, is a lifelike and believable character with an old-world charm. Despite his long life, rather sad back-story, and dangerous and extraordinary calling, he is a sensitive and thoughtful person; very much any young girl's dream.Filled with heroic deeds, suspense and a healthy dose of romance, I consider Die for Me a very worthwhile read.

"Though lengthy, The Wise Man's Fear grips the reader's imagination all the way. Continuing his tale begun in The Name of the Wind, Kvothe takes us back to The University, to the court of the Maer Alveron, to the fighting school of the Adem and through numerous bandit hunting and roadside adventures.Having read and enjoyed The Name of the Wind, I looked forward to reading The Wise Man's Fear. I was slightly disappointed. This book, though written in beautiful prose and with wonderfully imaginative descriptions, is extremely long. Even though I read it over a period of time, at times I just wished the story would get a move on.Probably because of the finer detail in this story, as well as the length, one gets to know Kvothe very well. A well fleshed out character, Kvothe is a sensitive, romantic soul and certainly a hero, with several glaring personality flaws; making him a lovable and realistic main character.The world building in this book is even better and more brilliantly inventive than in the previous book. Here one can truly lose oneself in the fantasy realms and Kvothe's adventures.If you read The Wise Man's Fear at leisure, it has a treasure trove of adventure, romance and lots of magic to offer.

"Im curious: is this the same Sarah Lotz who wrote the unforgettable novel, The Three? It sure doesnt read as though it was written by the same author. I am shocked at the terrible, stilted, and unnatural dialogue between the characters! And whats up with psychic, Celine Del Ray, starting every second sentence with, Know this.? Good grief it was annoying!Overall, I think this book had a great ending. Much like Lotzs previous novel, the excellently written and well plotted, The Three, but still different. I liked the idea on which this story was built, and I enjoyed being part of the panic the passengers felt while being stranded in the ocean with the cruise ship falling apart around them. I really got into all of it and felt the fear and desperation of the characters. I also enjoyed the different points of view of the many voices that tells the story, and I felt the Suicide Sisters were a unique addition to this story.Day Four most certainly has its strong points and its weak points. However, for me it didnt hold a candle to The Three. It just wasnt what I got from the fitting cover and synopsis. So by the way, although reference is made to the aforementioned book, this one can still be read as a stand-alone. I have mixed feelings about Day Four, but it certainly wont deter me from reading another of Lotzs future books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZYTCSY5CRDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1444775367#wasThisHelpful","R1TZYTCSY5CRDC","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed The Kiss of Deception, I really looked forward to reading The Heart of Betrayal. I wasn't disappointed at all! In fact, I honestly think The Heart of Betrayal is an even better book than The Kiss of Deception.Having always believed the Vendans to be barbarians, captives, Lia and Rafe are in for a few interesting surprises. While Rafe plans an escape and Lia hopes to be saved against all odds, both prisoners must play their respective roles to gain the advantage of time and avoid being killed.A page-turner in the true sense of the word, I simply couldn't put this book down. The excellent world building combined with extremely lifelike and colorful characters, makes reading The Heart of Betrayal a feast.As Vendan politicians, the Komizar and his Rahtan hover, ready to pounce at the slightest wrong or traitorous move from our two main characters, the suspense builds to nail biting proportions. The last part of this book is fast moving and filled with scenes that will have you holding your breath.Although she is a princess, Lia is tough, intelligent and capable enough to hold her own in dangerous situations. She is an excellent actress, cleverly deceiving the Komizar into believing her a willing captive.Rafe, our other main character and truly a prince at heart, has an equally difficult role to fulfill. The third key character, Caden, though a little more in the background in this book, has to deal with inner turmoil, division of loyalties and a heart that wants to go its own way.Despite my aversion to love triangles, the triangle in this book keeps a low profile. At least Lia knows to whom her heart belongs.I highly recommend The Heart of Betrayal as a thrilling and captivating reading experience.

"The first thought I had after finishing this book: Please tell me theres a third on the way! Then I discovered that there will indeed be a third book, and I gave a sigh of relief.You know, it very seldom happens that I give the sequel to a much-loved first book in a series, five stars. Nine out of ten times I find that the second book hardly ever lives up to my expectations. I am so incredibly relieved that it wasnt the same for this book. I had high expectations for The Invasion of the Tearling after I finished the first book, and my expectations were met in spades!Unlike with The Queen of the Tearling, the sequel moves from YA into New Adult territory. If it had followed the expected and typical NA plot formula, this magnificent novel wouldve probably left me disappointed. Johansen cleverly steers away from the overused NA plot formula and gives the reader something fresh and different, with only a few elements of the aforementioned genre, such as profanity and adult themes, but without it becoming crude and distasteful. It worked perfectly well for me, and actually it was the next natural step to move into this genre, as Kelseas character grows in leaps and bounds.From countless glowing reviews on the blogs I follow, I wasnt sure whether I was going to enjoy Lilys story. Surprisingly I did, and found that it is as much an integral part of the Tearlings history as Kelseas character is to the survival or destruction of the Tearling.Overall, this was a glorious read and even though it took me nearly five days to work my way through it, it was well worth every minute of reading time. I would love to shake Johansens hand and thank her from the bottom of my heart for steering clear of the romance backbone countless authors cant seem to do without for their novels. It takes a truly talented writer with one heck of an imagination to create a story of such epic proportions, and Johansens got it down pat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNOZ5FIKLKMMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0593073118#wasThisHelpful","RNOZ5FIKLKMMO","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In short, this book is about many things. Every reader, I believe, will take something different away from it. Im not going to go on my usual spiel about the characters, plot, world-building, etc. Brutal Youth is not just about the students, but also about their parents and the teachers at St. Michaels. The two points that stood out for me the most were that the good guys dont always win, and that the best revenge you can get is making people see the worst parts of themselves.Overall, this is a great read and if youve read Some Girls Are by Courtney Summers, Id also recommend this novel, proving that its not just girls who have it hard at school.Hopefully Breznican wont make us wait long for his next offering!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZCWP9APZ5FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067898#wasThisHelpful","R2OZCWP9APZ5FN","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love books featuring strong, butt-kicking protagonists, and thats just what this book is. Apparently this is also supposed to be an epic romance novel, but fortunately for me, the romance didnt overshadow the story and pretty much remained in the background. Even though the romance plays a small part in this story, it took me by surprise and was not predictable in any way.The majority of the characters in this story is strong and performs their parts with passion. However, the winning formula that makes this book a hit is the political intrigue and royal court conspiracies. That is ultimately what kept me reading. Grave Mercy might be specifically for a YA audience, but I would also recommend it to older readers who enjoy historical fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQ6X3VB239J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054762834X#wasThisHelpful","RYQ6X3VB239J5","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Landline did, most unfortunately, not live up to my expectations. When I read about communicating in the past, I thought, WOW! Sadly the book didn't deliver.Georgie has to stay in LA while Neal and the girls visit his mother in Omaha. A similar separation happened years ago. Suddenly, when Georgie uses the old landline rotary phone to call Neal, the past and the present become entwined.The idea of a specific kind of phone and phone call taking the characters into the past, is very inventive and imaginative. That, however, is where my fascination with this book stopped.Throughout the story the reader is immersed in Georgie's doubts, self doubts, fears and uncertainties. She seems, quite understandably, thrown into turmoil by suddenly encountering the Neal of their youth. It takes her rather long to start making positive decisions about said development.The two positive points in favor of this book is: the clever plot and the truly excellent dialogue. The end is unpredictable and thus urges the reader to continue turning the pages.For those who like books about relationships with lots of dialogue, Landline may be a very worthwhile and relaxing read.

"I recently finished Some Girls Are by this same author, and if I have to compare this novel against that one, I think Some Girls Are is much better. Or at least, I enjoyed it more. Cracked Up To Be has much going for it and also features a strong protagonist, but the massive amount of angst was just too much for me. I did like how it featured friends who cared for our leading girl and parents who were worried about their daughter, as well as educators and a principal who did their best to accommodate her wish to graduate. Also, the romance takes a backseat and is surprisingly unpredictable, and that always scores a lot of points with me. Overall, a good read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1XTJCN0QPL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031238369X#wasThisHelpful","RA1XTJCN0QPL2","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im convinced a staggering amount of research went into writing this story. Im seriously impressed. Mark Watney is a phenomenal character, not only for surviving on Mars, but mostly because during all that time at deaths door and with the odds stacked against his survival, he remains optimistic and does so with an incredible sense of humor. Needless to say, even though sci-fi isnt one of my preferred genres, Im really happy I read this book and I wholeheartedly agree with every glowing review it receives.

"A very relaxing, yet highly exciting read, The Burning Sky, with surprises round every corner, is the kind of book you won't be able to put down. Young Prince Titus must protect the greatest elemental mage of his time, no matter the cost. If that means making a girl pose as a school boy during Victorian times and in Victorian England, so be it.I very almost didn't read this book. When it started with fire magic and elixirs, I thought, 'oh no, not another one'. Fortunately I persevered and was pleasantly surprised!The world building in this book is absolutely stunning. On the one hand we get the highly inventive mage realms and Atlantis, and on the other the perfectly normal Victorian England. The mage realms, especially, is incredibly well described and imaginative. The historically accurate descriptions of Victorian England balance the abundance of magic and paranormal phenomena in the mage realms.The characters, though not anything extraordinary, are well fleshed out and lifelike. However, this book is first and foremost a romance novel in a fantasy setting. The romance is skillfully and tastefully written, with the hero and heroine as the perfect romantic couple.Still, for me the true magic of this book lay in the imaginative world building and the numerous surprises said world holds for the reader. The Burning Sky, with its flying chariots, magical beasts, princes riding to the rescue and its very ordinary cricket,  is most certainly an enjoyable and worthwhile read for both romance and fantasy readers.

"Ive read the controversy on some of the blogs I follow about the parent who made a fuss about this book being on her daughters recommended reading list by her school and then got the school to remove it from the list and replace it with another book. Being naturally curious, I wanted to know whats in this book that could upset a parent so much as to do something that drastic. Now after finishing Some Girls Are, I can see what that mother might be distressed about, but I still dont think its fair to make that decision for every student and their parents.Some Girls Are is definitely not an easy read. Ive read countless YA novels in which the protagonist is a bully or is being bullied, but never has it been anything as disturbing as whats happening in this story. This is more real, more raw, and unbelievably terrifying. Mostly so, because this is really happening to our kids in our schools. Whether we want to know it or not, this story tells it like it is and the author isnt sugarcoating it.There is no solution being offered in this story and wont enlighten teens who are being tormented by their peers on how to deal with it. That is not the point of this novel. The point here is just that it happens and this is how far kids will go without considering the consequences. I like Regina. I like that she fought back. At first I thought it is just a story about a bully being bullied and her getting what she deserves. But it really is more than that, and at times I had to sit back and take a few deep breaths before continuing reading because the tormenting and revenge also took an emotional toll on me as reader.Overall, I think this is a good book to be on a high school recommended reading list, and even better for parents to read as well and to discuss the realities of bullying and being bullied with their child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28I51YGMK1Z9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312573804#wasThisHelpful","R28I51YGMK1Z9G","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cant say Im particularly a fan of Shania Twain, but Ive heard her music playing on the radio over the years, and I especially enjoy one of her songs, Ka-ching. The only reason I picked up her memoir is because I always enjoy a good rags to riches story, and this one did not disappoint.In fact, Shania Twains autobiography gave me a deeper insight into what its like for children who are neglected by parents who selfishly had more children than they could afford. It just cemented my opinion that most of the worlds poverty can be attributed to people irresponsibly having more children than they can care for. Sad to see is how she justifies the neglect by her mother and the domestic abuse by her father. I guess no matter what, most of us refuse to see our parents through anything other than rose tinted glasses.After finishing From This Moment On, I feel that Shania Twain deserves all the good things that come her way. Having grown up the way she did, making all the sacrifices she did, and working her behind off for her dream and achieving all that she has, she is more than deserving of the good life she is living. Im not saying this as a fan (because Im still not), but as someone who made the journey through Shanias life story by way of her memoir, and as a wife and a mother who has also suffered betrayal and divorce.Although much of this autobiography is Eilleen reflecting on her life and writing this book as a way to heal, beyond her sad childhood and painful divorce, there isnt much else in here that havent been publicized in the media over the years. True Shania Twain fans wont find much new in here, but others, like me, would come to know both Eilleen and Shania Twain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHFIU2CXS47R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451620748#wasThisHelpful","R1KHFIU2CXS47R","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the blurb of Evidence of Things Not Seen, I was quite excited. Disappearances, particle physics and parallel universes are themes bound to attract my attention, but, sadly, I was quite disappointed. Tommy Smith disappears, maybe into one of the alternate dimensions he believed in, and a whole lot of people confess that, yes, he was weird but likable.Firstly, I don't even see this as a novel but rather a collection of short stories centered round a specific setting and basic plot. Because all the characters make one or, if you're lucky, two appearances, I simply couldn't identify with anybody.The theme of rape and abuse, especially aimed at women, seems to repeat itself over and over until I felt like this book was only reflecting the negative side of life.Fortunately, the individual stories - some in first person and some in third - were told in an entertaining and often captivating way. The characters in each section are adequately developed and descriptions are vivid and lifelike.The end is more or less satisfying.This is a worthwhile read if you're into really sad and often violent personal accounts of rape, drug abuse, ruined marriages and general unhappiness. Do not expect much in the way of paranormal.

"The Movie of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl would hopefully and most likely be better than the book. As I wasn't too impressed with a few things in the book, I would very much like to see said movie. Greg Gaines unwillingly supports his very sick childhood friend, Rachel, and changes his status at school from mainly unnoticed to unpopular.This book actually starts off with a few chapters of wonderfully witty humor and Greg's insights regarding the various social groups and hierarchy within the school. Unfortunately, his attitude towards Rachel, who is suffering from cancer, started putting me off. Add to that the constant use of four letter words and, one third into the book, I couldn't wait for it to just be over.As a main character, Greg Gaines is a disappointment. His rebellious attitude combined with his constant crude thoughts and dialogue was extremely off-putting. I most certainly wouldn't want him to be a role model for my kids. His irritation with Rachel and her illness further alienated me.His friend, Earl, is even worse with regards to crudeness, but, Earl's attitude, at least, redeemed him. Unlike Greg, Earl is sympathetic towards Rachel and genuinely tries to make her last weeks a pleasant experience for her.Having now completed my rant about all the negative points of this book, I can add that the style in which it is written is unique and kept me turning the pages. Despite the crude language, the humor is clean and truly tasteful.I hope I'll be more impressed once I get to watch the movie of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. If you want to read it, at least the humor and the alternating writing styles of lively prose and movie script makes it worth the read.

"I cant explain why, but Im not a fan of anthologies. No particular reason; Im just not. I picked up this anthology of short tales only because the proceeds for the sale of this book go towards a charity I feel strongly about.In short, all these stories are well-written and have depth. Every novella is identifiable by each authors unique voice and writing style, telling a story based on some or other superstitious belief. My two favorites are without a doubt The Gift of the Were-Magi by Mari Mancusi and Bloody Mary by Dianne K. Salerni.

Jane is most certainly a character of another color with her outrageous scheme to fake a nine-month pregnancy with reasons only she can justify and accept. As can be expected, her impulsive plan snowballs out of control and hilarity ensues as she stacks one jaw-dropping lie on top of the other.Though the ending disappointed me so much I actually reconsidered my intended five-star rating, I noticed from the synopsis of Crossing the Line  the next Jane Taylor novel  that the conclusion is not where this story ends. Naturally, I now want to read the next book to discover what happened after the point where the story left off.The writing is superb and the characters have enough depth not to be stale.

"Set in the harsh world of social workers, child abuse, and irresponsible parenting, Little Mercies is a captivating and touching story. As a social worker, Ellen Moore changed many lives; rescuing both children and parents and often annoying said parents. When she slips up and makes a near fatal mistake, the world is out to lynch her. Yet, even while she is in the depth of trouble as well as despair, she still can't resist saving a street wise girl named Jenny.This absolutely realistic novel looks into the world of poverty, child abuse, neglect, alcohol and drug abuse and mothers who simply do not care enough about a child to make the wise move to leave the aggressive husband or boyfriend.The two point of view characters, Ellen and Jenny, are lifelike and fleshed out. However, I thought Jenny had the more developed and outstanding character of the two. She is cynical and almost hard for her ten years and she is a really smart kid. She faces betrayal and disappointment several times, yet, except for a few tears on one occasion, she moves on with her next plan of action.The change in POV, often at crucial times, certainly encouraged me to keep reading. This is truly a never-a-dull-moment read with some nail-biting suspense towards the end.A touching and often enlightening tale, I certainly recommend Little Mercies as a very worthwhile read.

"Auracle is one of the best YA novels I've read in a good long while and will definitely be going on my favorite reads for 2015 list. Astral travel is cool, handy and exciting, yet, Anna finds out how it can also be extremely dangerous, especially with dead enemies in the vicinity.A truly good story should hook the reader from the start and this is what Auracle did for me. Anna popping out of her body and over to an erupting volcano most certainly got my attention right away. From that point on there was simply no let up as one exciting, suspenseful and often touching incident followed another.The characters are the kind of young people most teen readers would be able to relate to. Anna, the main character, dreams of going to the places to where she astral travels. Yet, in her daily life, and especially in a crisis, she is level headed and can think on her feet.Rei Ellis, the other main character, is the kind of guy of whom most young girls would dream. Loyal, physically active and attractive and, on top of all that, a gifted guitarist and singer, he most certainly has the attention of all the girls.Unfortunately, Anna and Rei's troubled friend, Seth Murphy, has to suffer the attention of equally troubled but beautiful Taylor Gleason. Taylor, the selfish, yet deeply unhappy, antagonist in this story, does inspire some sympathy from the reader.With its excellent plot and brilliantly alive and solid characters, Auracle is a stimulating and often suspenseful read. Although the romance is limited, it is tender and tastefully written. Auracle is most certainly a must-read suitable for young adults, but, can definitely also be enjoyed by older readers as well.

I didnt much like the main character, Libby, but I honestly think the reader isnt meant to like her. About 25% into the book I realized it doesnt matter whether I liked Libby or not, the storyline kept me captivated and I found it very difficult to put this book down.

Sometimes it seemed that he was without a doubt the one who murdered his family, but then there were a whole lot of chapters in which it looked as though he couldnt possibly be the killer.

"I have some mixed feelings about Lost and Found, and as I dont even know where to begin Im going to jump right in and share my likes and dislikes about this mystery adventure.The story didnt hook me straightaway. That only happened around 67% into the book. Some of the main issues I had were that the characters were rather bland. I didnt like that Blake is a hotheaded character. It wouldve made sense maybe if I knew why he was always being short-tempered. It felt as if from the minute we meet him, hes angry and his outbursts unpredictable. Julia is a much better character than Blake, but even so, I struggled to find a connection with her or any of the other characters. I did, however, like that Julia is one of Laferneys better female characters than, say, the one in his previous novel, Jumper.  Julia seemed more the type of girl I would like to have as a friend.Blakes grandfathers dementia constantly threw me off balance and by the time he disappears, it was more a relief than a sad occurrence. You know, coming to think of it, I recently finished a book by Ransom Riggs, titled Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children, where the grandfather in that story also has dementia. The difference is that that character was far more believable and likable because he didnt resort to below-the-belt or toilet humor to bring the point home to the reader that he suffers from dementia. After reading that book, it was unfortunately a lot harder to sympathize or connect with Blakes grandfather.It seemed that every character that wasnt in the protagonists corner, were portrayed as immature and dumb. In my opinion, thats no way to portray your antagonists. Its like saying to your readers theyre not bright enough to figure out by themselves who the bad guys are. Thats probably not what the author intended, but thats sure how it made me feel. Take for instance schoolyard bully, Kevin. Ive seen this type of bully/antagonist in Laferneys previous novels. The same can be said for all the bad guys in this story who are older than Kevin. They all seem to have the behavior of a mentally challenged ten-year-old. Because of this and the fact that a lot of focus was placed on Kevin and his fathers behavior in the early chapters, it was easy to spot from early on who the culprits were going to be in the end, and thus it came as no surprise (except for one, but by then it no longer mattered).There arent many surprises in this story, even though there are a ton of clues leading up to the eventual find  which turns out to also not be surprising or revealing much. The one treasure Blake and Julia uncovers is so unlikely, it wasnt even believable, and more so because it is never explained how it came to be in Blakes familys possession.What I enjoyed about this book was the fast pace. That also means there was a ton of info dump with few to no breathers in between. For many avid mystery readers this would not be a problem, though some, like me, prefer our mysteries to be uncovered gradually and with little breaks spaced in to get to know our characters and their surroundings better.What was a huge plus for me was the sweet and subtle romance between Blake and Julia which I think the author timed perfectly well. I also enjoyed reading the Authors Note at the end which gave me insight into his research and which parts of the story are fictional and which were based on facts/truth. The dialogue in the beginning of the story is a little stunted, but towards the middle it smoothes out and adds depth to the protagonists voices.Overall I feel this is a clever YA mystery with lots to offer its most curious readers. The topic and setting has clearly been well researched and the clues  as confusing as it might be at times  serve their purpose to bring the characters to their intended destination. The writing is typical Laferney and the author sticks to the style he is known for best, which means if youve read any of his previous novels, youll feel right at home settling into Lost and Found.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GW84VQKT76OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692424679#wasThisHelpful","R3GW84VQKT76OK","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"High fantasy with a liberal helping of Roman empire, An Ember in the Ashes is going to the top of my list of favorite books read so far this year. Although they come from completely different backgrounds and have different missions and goals, Laia and Elias keep crossing paths. In the end Laia is placed before a choice. Can her choice help both people she needs to save?Where can I start my rave about this book. Firstly, the world building is absolutely brilliant and highly believable. Although the fictional empire is based on the Roman empire, it is still unique enough to stand as a universe in its own right.The characters are fleshed out and often very realistically flawed. As the female main character, Laia, is a girl after my own heart. Courageous and tough, yet sometimes naturally swayed by emotion, at seventeen she is already proving that she could become what her mother was, The Lioness.Elias, except for his very normal moments of wanting to jump ship, is the ultimate hero. Even when certain death awaits him, he refuses to cross certain lines or sacrifice his personal values.Other wonderfully crafted characters like Helen, Cook, and Izzi, make this an  unforgettable reading experience.The author is a master at creating the kind of situations that put me, for one, on an emotional roller coaster. The hints at romance in this story are kept low key. Although magic and the paranormal feature strongly, it is incorporated in natural and believable ways.For a read that will thrill as well as touch you deeply, I recommend An Ember in the Ashes as an absolute must-read.

"The ending of this story left me elated and satisfied, but the journey I had to undergo with Reece, Cathy, her family, and other key role players to get to this wonderful finale was harrowing and painful.  I thought I had heard and read enough to understand the extent abusive parents will go to to damage their own flesh and blood, but this book made me realize that I had no clue.I could almost not fathom a mother such as Tracey and for a while there thought the author was exaggerating about how terrifying and massively disturbed Tracey is, but once all the distressing details came together to form a bigger picture of Reeces home life before he was removed from his mother, I had to accept that the world is filled with such monsters.The sadder truth is that there are parents doing even worse things to their children than Tracey has done to Reece and his siblings. All I can say is that Im grateful for foster parents such as Cathy who take these children into their homes with love, patience, understanding and compassion, and give them a fresh start to a new life. I have a seven-year-old son and it pained me to read this book, knowing I would never in a million years do to my kids what Tracey did to hers.Thank you, Cathy, for sharing this story with us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R3RP8JWN46BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=000736296X#wasThisHelpful","R3R3RP8JWN46BC","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I can almost not believe this book was edited and published by a leading publishing house.Confessions of a Teen Nanny is really easy to sum up: shallow girls, party, make-up, party, hair, party, kissing, party, clothes shopping, party, makeover, party, hormonal boys, party, underage drinking, party, more underage drinking, party, nude poolside party, drug abuse, party, boy drama, party, party, and...oh yes, party.And then there were also several inconsistencies and unlikely scenarios, plus the real biggie where an eight-year-old is soundly asleep while a whopper of a party is raging outside her bedroom door. The book should have been more accurately titled, Nannies Needing Nannies, because these atrociously forgettable characters spent an entire novel living it up and fighting about boys, and very little of what they were getting paid to do.Let me put it this way: if youre expecting another Nanny Diaries, youre going to be severely disappointed. At least it is a short and quick read, for which youll be thankful you havent wasted a lot of time on.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADLE86843II1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060731788#wasThisHelpful","RADLE86843II1","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After much thought, I think the reason I enjoyed this book a tiny bit less than I did the previous one, is because I went into These Broken Stars with low expectations (and was pleasantly surprised), and I expected far too much from This Shattered World. Dont get me wrong. This was a really fantastic story, but it missed a lot of the wow that blew me away with These Broken Stars.Jubilee and Flynn are two magnificent characters, yet there interactions and eventual romance didnt interest me as much as Lilac and Tarvers did. The story only hooked in the last sixty or so pages. The world building, though, is what got me through to the end. It wasnt as intriguing or mysterious as the planet Lilac and Tarver got stuck on, but Avon is a dark, dreary and swampy place  the perfect setting for madness and the whispers to flourish.The ending was heartwarming and the perfect conclusion to a story that couldve gone the other way. Overall, a wonderful read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK0MNVW8MWC4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K29D3G2#wasThisHelpful","RK0MNVW8MWC4B","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thrilling and often frightening, Through A Mirror Darkly is one of the  most memorable books I've read so far this year.  Although the four  novellas that make up this book, can be read as stand alone stories, the  combination of all four tell of a town, Clifton Heights, the strange  things that happen there and its supernatural connection to a legendary  world; the world of Carcosa.While the first three stories are definitely written in the supernatural thriller genre, the last story falls solidly inside the horror genre. The incorporation of the King in Yellow, Carcosa and Lake Hyades brings a hint of legend and mythology into the book.The characters, some of whom are mentioned in more than one of the  stories, are fleshed out and highly realistic. In every story the main  character has to face a trial, real or psychological. Where the MC in the  first story has to confront real demons, the MC in the final deals with  demons of the psyche and imagination.Through A Mirror Darkly presents the reader with hours of  never-a-dull-moment reading, some depth and enough horror to cause a few  nightmares.

"The first thought that came to my mind the minute I finished this book was that the book summary sounds much more intriguing than the book really is. As you continue through the chapters, layers and layers of secrets and deceit are uncovered. It all seems like an elaborate set-up for a good mystery, and at the speed the suspense keeps building, one would naturally expect a big twist with a couple of surprise reveals. But no, what you see is what you get and the conclusion doesnt offer anything you havent suspected along the way.Also, Tom is the sort of character reminiscent of the leading investigator in a Michael Robotham novel. The only difference is that Robothams main characters are so much better and more believable. I also didnt think much of Olivia towards the end, but she really proved how infuriatingly dumb she is in the last few chapters. She had an opportunity to get away from Robert and run for help, but instead she stands there waiting for him to complete his search of the house for their children. She turns out to be THAT character in movies where the woman tries to be the hero and does the opposite of what the authorities, who are trying to help her, tells her to do.Robert isnt much better and doesnt stand out in any way besides being an underdeveloped antagonist who apparently doesnt have one shred of humanity. Even the worst obsessed psychopath or serial killer can at least be charming, or friendly, or loves puppies  but not Robert. Hes just all teeth and claws and angry revenge and blah blah blah. Im sorry to say, but he was a really boooooring character to read.This is the first book of Abbotts Ive read, and as its not the first in this series, I didnt feel Ive missed out on not reading the previous books. Sleep Tight does well as a stand-alone. Though I wasnt particularly impressed with this book, I will someday give one of her other novels a last try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AG3PAQI0RSRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0957652232#wasThisHelpful","R1AG3PAQI0RSRC","A2R53V98P2T4Y4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R53V98P2T4Y4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive promised myself I will never start a review with Oh my gosh!. Im totally breaking that promise. OH MY GOSH!!! This book changed my life! No wait, dont look away, let me explain! It seriously did. It made me realize that there are others in the world, who are JUST. LIKE. ME! That might not seem like much of a revelation to you, but if you could understand how hard Ive been trying all my life to be normal and just fit the hell in, youd understand what an incredibly amazing eye-opener this has been for me. This is so my kind of humor and it makes complete sense to me because, in reality (okay, more in my head than in reality), Im just as kickass crazy, socially awkward, and not accepted universally by those who consider themselves sane.I mean this in a good way.No, seriously, dont call the cops.I can basically describe this memoir as one long running thought process with no end in sight, except when you get to the end of the book and you grudgingly realize it had to end sometime.

"Despite its daunting length, The Name of the Wind is a gripping novel that absolutely held my full attention right up to the last word. Kvothe, a legendary wizard who poses as an inn keeper, tells his tale to a professional story writer, Chronicler. This tale takes the reader on the road with a performing troupe, into the dangerous back streets of a more or less medieval city, and on to a university for wizards.Although this book is comfortably paced and written in beautifully descriptive prose, it is never boring. Where action, intrigue and suspense leaves off, brilliant characterization takes over.With his failures as abundant as his successes, unlike the perfect wizards - think Gandalf and Merlin - Kvothe has numerous flaws in both his character as well as his judgment. Naturally, as a young boy he makes mistakes; yet, as an older and more experienced man and wizard, he still has moments of doubt.All the other characters are fleshed out and realistic. At first Kvothe's nemesis, Ambrose, comes across as not such a bad fellow. Unfortunately, our first few encounters with said nemesis are extremely deceptive.From a dragon who is addicted to a drug, to creepy supernatural spiders, this book is filled with interesting and thrilling paranormal phenomena and lots of awe inspiring magic. The bit of romance that surfaces here and there in Kvothe's tale is rather poignant.If you're looking for a story that will completely take you out of your daily life into a world of old-fashioned living and magic, The Name of the Wind is the book I would recommend.

"Five years after facing off against the dark sorcerer Arcannen, Paxon Leah, sworn protector of the druids and now known as the High Druid's Blade, faces his greatest challenge.Aphenglow Elessedil, Ard Rhys of the druid order, has passed away.  But Paxon has no time to mourn, for in a distant corner of the Four Lands, the magic of the wishsong has been detected.  Now, Paxon and his druid companion Avelene have set off to find the source of the magic.The source turns out to be Reyn Frosch, a young traveling minstrel who plays music in taverns and inns.  One evening, a stranger happens to hear Reyn's music.  The stranger is none other but Arcannen.  He promises Reyn that he will help him control the wishsong.  Enlisting the help of Lariana, a young, attractive and persuasive girl, they set to the task of training Reyn.But the training is just a cover for a much larger scheme that will involve many others.  And by now, Paxon and Avelene have discovered that Reyn is the source of the magic and are coming for him as well.  What is about to ensue is a dramatic showdown where many will fight and die.I'm a big fan of Terry Brooks, and I've read all of his books.  I especially liked this one.  The story of the wishsong has appeared in many of his other books, and it serves as a good backdrop for this story.  The character development is very good and the story slowly builds throughout until the final battle at the end.

"On December 21, 1943, Leon Crane and the rest of the crew of his B-24 bomber took off from Ladd field in Alaska.  The purpose of their mission was to run tests on the propellers of the plane.  The mission ended in disaster; the plane crashed and Crane was the only survivor.  In this book, author Brian Murphy describes the flight, crash, and Crane's struggle to survive.Crane managed to bail out of the stricken bomber, but he was not nearly prepared for what he was about to endure.  He had forgotten his cold-weather mittens, and all he had of consequence with him were 40 matches and a boy scout pocket knife.  For the next 81 days, Crane somehow managed to survive in Alaska's harsh wilderness.  He used his parachute to sleep in and carefully rationed his matches for making fires.  Fortunately, he stumbled upon an abandoned cabin which contained food and other useful items.  It wasn't until much later that he came upon a person living in the wilderness who was able to help him get back to his base.""81 Days Below Zero"" is a harrowing tale of endurance and survival.  The book not only tells Crane's story, but also that of crash investigators that searched over the plane years later.  These investigators were also able to discover other human remains within the wreckage and have them positively identified.  This book serves as a testament to Crane's struggle to survive, endure the unendurable, and emerge healthy and strong.

"In early May, 1942, the American and Japanese fleets met in the first carrier battle of the Pacific war in the Coral Sea.  The oiler USS Neosho was part of the American task force.  It was her job to provide oil for the ships as well as aviation gas for the carrier planes.  After topping off the American ships, Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher ordered the Neosho and escort destroyer USS Sims to sail out of harm's way away from the coming battle.  What happened next can only be considered pure bad luck, for the Japanese planes, in their search for the American carriers, stumbled upon the two American ships.For most of the day, the Neosho and Sims were attacked by scores of Japanese planes; the pilots who mistook the Neosho and Sims to be an aircraft carrier and cruiser.  The Sims sank shortly after being attacked, while the Neosho remained on the surface for four more days.  Many men jumped overboard after claiming to have heard the order to abandon ship.  This order was never given.  The actual order was to prepare to abandon ship.  Nevertheless, scores of men jumped overboard into the oily, flaming sea.  After four days, rescue finally arrived, but not before many men perished in the sea.Author Don Keith has done a very good job of telling the story of the Neosho and Sims.  The Neosho, survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor, was truly a ship that wouldn't die, as evidenced by her remaining afloat for four days.  She finally succumbed to shell fire from a rescuing destroyer.  This book tells a harrowing tale of survival on the high seas and the heroic efforts of the U.S. Navy to locate the survivors.

Cabrillo and his crew become entangled with a Venezuelan admiral intent on sinking their ship.  The female  admiral is in possession of stolen American technology known as Piranha; a small undersea craft which can drill perfect holes in the hull of a ship.  The admiral received her technology from a traitorous American weapons designer.

Determined to see both Vader and the Emperor dead, Cham and his female Twi'lek fighter Isval, have set a trap.Vader and Palpatine's Star Destroyer is ambushed by the freedom fighters.  Soon, the Star Destroyer is nothing but a smoking wreck, and Vader and Palpatine barely escape.  Their only chance is to head for Ryloth.  Once there, the duo is determined to wipe out the uprising once and for all.  But there are other forces at work.  The terrain is inhospitable and the freedom fighters are stronger than first thought.  Plus, the relationship between Vader and Palpatine is in question.  Traditionally, a Sith apprentice has killed his master in a bid for power.  Vader is still having remembrances of his earlier life as Anakin Skywalker.  Will he strike out against Palpatine?  What will happen to them on Ryloth?I'm a big fan of the Star Wars novels, and ""Lords of the Sith"" is very good.  Author Paul S. Kemp has written an interesting story that is loaded with action and adventure.  He has done a good job of developing the relationship between Vader and Palpatine, while at the same time planting a seed of doubt about how things will eventually turn out between them.  The development of the other characters, especially Cham and Isval, is very good, too.  Don't miss this very good addition to the Star Wars series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BV68PYV3UOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511441#wasThisHelpful","R29BV68PYV3UOY","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On April 16th, 1945, the crew of the destroyer USS Laffey were informed that their ship was being moved to radar picket station #1, north of Okinawa.  This station was the closest picket station to Japan and, therefore, the first station that Japanese kamikazes would see on their flight to Okinawa.  Over the preceding days, several American ships had been sunk or severely damaged while serving at station #1.  The men of the Laffey knew what they were sailing into; an inferno of steel and pilots willing to dive their planes into American ships.  For eighty minutes on that fateful April morning, the crew of the USS Laffey faced over twenty individual kamikaze attacks.  ""Hell From The Heavens"" is their testimony.Before that April morning, the USS Laffey had served with distinction in the U.S Navy.  Commissioned in February, 1944, the Laffey fought in her initial battle off of Normandy during the D-Day landings.  She provided fire support and anti-submarine protection.  Next, the Laffey moved through the Panama Canal to the Pacific, where she served in the Philippine campaign and as a carrier escort for raids on the Japanese homeland.  Led by Commander F. Julian Becton, the Laffey had become a well-seasoned veteran.Becton and the crew took their assignment to radar picket station #1 as they had in the past; they were prepared to do their best in the task assigned to them.  But nothing could have prepared them for the onslaught they were about to face.  Over the course of eighty minutes, the crew shot down several attacking Japanese planes, but several got through to crash into the ship.  Aside from the kamikaze attacks, the Laffey also sustained bomb hits as well.  Over thirty sailors were killed and many others were injured, but the ship would not sink.  Despite being hit by no fewer than six of the attackers, Becton and his heroic crew would save their ship and ultimately return to the United States as heroes.Author John Wukovits has written a wonderful book about one of the most famous ships in the U.S. Navy.  He starts with the commissioning of the Laffey and continues describing the other campaigns she fought in.  The sections devoted to the kamikaze attacks are loaded with stories of individual heroism as the men struggled to save their ship.  Included throughout Wukovits' narrative are numerous quotes and remembrances from the Laffey's crew members.I give this book my highest recommendation.  John Wukovits has written a fine tribute to one of the U.S. Navy's most memorable ships and her fine crew.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R290ELTT2GKP88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306823241#wasThisHelpful","R290ELTT2GKP88","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On December 7th, 1941, the Japanese attacked the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor.  In the aftermath of this attack, President Roosevelt wanted to strike back at the Japanese.  Nuisance raids were being carried out by American forces in the central Pacific, but Roosevelt wanted more; namely, a strike against Japan itself.  In ""Target Tokyo"", author James M. Scott takes the reader on that fateful and historic mission.In the early months of 1942, eighty American volunteers, led by Col. Jimmy Doolittle, began training for a spectacular raid; they were going to fly B-25 medium bombers off the deck of an aircraft carrier that had steamed to within 300-400 miles of Japan.  After the attack, the planes were to fly to China and land on Chinese airfields.  As history has shown, it didn't work that way.The task force was discovered by Japanese picket boats while still some 700 miles from Japan.  Doolittle wasted no time and launched immediately.  The bombers arrived over Japan and bombed targets in Tokyo and surrounding cities.  Actual physical damage was slight, but the psychological impact on the Japanese was tremendous.  Now the pilots and crew faced the dangerous task of flying to China with little fuel.  But thanks to a 25 mph tailwind, the planes made landfall, except one which diverted to Russia.  However, the planes were unable to land so the crews were forced to bail out.  This began an odyssey of evasion and survival for the fliers as they attempted to make their way to Chungking and freedom.""Target Tokyo"" is destined to become the definitive account on the Doolittle raid.  Masterfully written, this book takes the reader from the attack on Pearl Harbor through the planning and execution of the raid on Tokyo.  But the story doesn't end with the raid.  Author James M. Scott also discusses the capture of two of the B-25 crews by the Japanese along with the saga of the crew who landed in Russia.  Also, Scott  describes the terrible revenge attacks unleashed on the Chinese by the Japanese, which included the destruction of entire towns and villages along with over 250,000 civilian deaths.I give this book my highest recommendation.  ""Target Tokyo"" is a fine book about America's first strike against Japan","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVFNC4JHFOZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393089622#wasThisHelpful","R3UVFNC4JHFOZQ","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the early days of the Pacific War, the Japanese captured many American civilian workers.  These people had been employed as nurses or with the Pan American Clipper seaplane service, among other positions.  Now, with Manila in the hands of the Japanese, these civilians were rounded up and placed in camps.  For the next 3-plus years, these civilian workers would face the wrath of the Japanese.Civilians were supposed to be protected prisoners under the international rules of war, but this meant little to the Japanese.  In places such as Cabanatuan and other camps throughout the Philippines, the Japanese began a plan of starvation and intimidation upon the prisoners.  The American civilians interred at Los Banos faced similar repercussions, not to mention that the population at Los Banos also included women and children.General Douglas MacArthur personally authorized a rescue mission to be carried out by the 11th Airborne division to free the prisoners held in Los Banos.  These men, with the aid of Filipino guerrillas, launched a three-pronged attack from air, land, and sea.  They succeeded in freeing over two thousand civilians.I found ""Rescue At Los Banos"" to be an informative and interesting book.  I've read books about the raid on Cabanatuan, so I was somewhat familiar with this topic before.  However, I was unaware that Los Banos contained civilian POWs.  I was shocked at the conditions these men, women, and children were forced to live under.  If not for the 11th's attack, many of these people would have starved to death or been killed outright by the Japanese.I give this book a high recommendation.  General Colin Powell has referenced the rescue at Los Banos as a perfect attack.  Author Bruce Henderson brings that attack to life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGVL2V77R8JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006232506X#wasThisHelpful","R3HGVL2V77R8JW","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On May 1st, 1915, the luxury liner Lusitania left New York bound for England.  On board were hundreds of passengers, including many women and children.  Despite warnings placed in the New York newspapers by the German government, the Lusitania set sail. Germany had declared the waters around Great Britain to be a war zone and promised to sink any vessel entering them.  Less than a week later, the Lusitania would be on the bottom of the ocean, and over 1000 passengers would be dead.  In ""Dead Wake"", author Erik Larson not only describes the terrible sinking, but also gives the reader a view of the world 100 years ago.In 1915, the United States was still neutral; unwilling to become involved in the European war.  Great Britain longed for the assistance of the Americans.  The American President, Woodrow Wilson, had just lost his first wife.  But soon thereafter, he had found companionship with Edith Galt, who would later become his 2nd wife.  In Germany, Capt. Walther Schwieger prepared to take his submarine U-20 to sea in hunt of enemy shipping.The Lusitania sailed on, oblivious to the knowledge the British in their ""Room 40"" had acquired about German submarine activity along their planned route.  It was a recipe for disaster, for on May 7th, 1915, the U-20 fired a single torpedo which struck the Lusitania.  In just eighteen minutes, the ship sank, taking over 1,000 passengers with her.  Many others died from exposure or injuries suffered in the attack.  U-20 made good her escape.""Dead Wake"" is a well-written account of one of the great maritime disasters of all-time.  Author Erik Larson does a fine job of informing the reader about the sequence of events leading up to the sinking, including the German warnings, the information gained by the British about German submarine activity that wasn't shared with the captain of the Lusitania, and the terrible aftermath of the sinking, including the infamous Zimmerman note.  Written with a style that alternates from hunter to hunted, this book does a fine job of describing the tragic loss of a great ship.

"At the turn of the 20th century, oil was king.  Led by such men as John D. Rockefeller, oil became a commodity that men fought and killed over.  Rockefeller, head of the Standard Oil monopoly, is being investigated by Isaac Bell of the Van Dorn detective agency.  What begins as an investigation turns to murder when a hired assassin starts targeting opponents of Standard Oil, many of them independents hoping to break Standard's grip on the oil industry.Isaac and the others from the Van Dorn agency are soon looking for the assassin.  Their pursuit will lead them to Kansas, Texas, and across the Atlantic Ocean to Russia.  Meanwhile, the assassin is still at large.  Having had his best witness killed by the assassin, it is up to Isaac and his fellow detectives to solve the mystery before the assassin destroys Standard Oil and John D. Rockefeller himself.I'm a big fan of the Isaac Bell series by Clive Cussler, and ""The Assassin"" in a fine new entry to the series.  As with the earlier books in the series, Cussler concentrates his story during an actual time frame in American history.  The story is exciting, and the characters are well-developed.  There are many twists and turns along the way, and the reader must pay close attention to the story.I highly recommend this fine book.

"By January, 1945, the powerful Russian army was making its way across Poland and into Germany.  During this time, the Nazi prison camps located in Poland were discovered and liberated by the advancing Russians.  The stipulations of the agreement at Yalta that was signed by the Russians and the United States stated that all liberated POWs must be treated humanely.  The Americans followed the rules while, by and large, the Russians did not.  The Russians viewed POWs as cowards, and many were left to survive on their own.  In ""Beyond The Call"", one American airman does what he can to help these forgotten men.Captain Robert Trimble was a pilot in the Eighth Air Force.  He had just finished his thirty-fifth and final mission when he was offered a new position.  On the surface, he was given the task of locating American aircraft forced to land in Poland, making necessary repairs, and flying them back to American lines.  But the mission turned out to be much more than that, for Captain Trimble soon found himself helping POWs find their way to freedom under the noses of the Russians.For several months, Robert worked to help as many prisoners as possible.  Ultimately, he would help hundreds of men and women, both POWs and refugees, find safety while at the same time staying one step ahead of the Russians.""Beyond The Call"" is a good book.  I've read many books about the air war over Europe, and the added element of espionage makes this book even more compelling.  I was unaware of the POW situation in Poland before reading this book, and I find it appalling that the Russians treated their allied POWs in such a disgraceful manner.  It took men like Captain Trimble to risk their lives to go in and free these prisoners and refugees.""Beyond The Call"" does a good job of describing one of the lesser-known elements of the war in Europe.

"Louis Zamperini is an American icon.  From Olympic athlete to prisoner of war to born-again Christian, Louis has inspired people with his straight-forward attitude towards life and others.Louis was a self-proclaimed rebel as a child.  He would steal and otherwise cause problems wherever he went.  But thanks to the encouragement of his older brother, Louis fell in love with running and soon became a world-class athlete.  He went on to compete in the 1936 Olympics.  When World War II broke out, Louis became a crew member on a B-24 bomber in the Pacific theater.  His plane was shot down by the Japanese, and Louis survived over forty days adrift in a raft.  Picked up by the Japanese, Louis was interred for two-and-a-half years in a Japanese POW camp, enduring physical beatings from the guards.After surviving his time as a POW, Louis returned to the U.S. and got married.  Shortly thereafter, while attending a Billy Graham sermon, Louis gave his life to Jesus.  For the rest of his life, Louis lived his life for Jesus.  He also carried the Olympic torch on five separate occasions.  But perhaps the most remarkable of all: he forgave all of the guards who mistreated him.""Don't Give Up, Don't Give In"" is not just a biography.  Rather, it is a blueprint for living a productive, happy life.  Louis is remembered as a happy, resilient person.  Much of his successful living can be attributed to his salvation, but he also lived life with a purpose; to help others and glorify God in everything he did.  He succeeded.I highly recommend this fine book.

"In the near future, a terrifying world-wide pandemic is taking place.  Millions of people are being infected with a deadly disease called ""the Gets"".  It starts out slowly; people forget minor things, but as the disease progresses, the disease grips the people more tightly.  People begin to forget how to function completely.  There is no cure: or is there?Miles below the surface of the Pacific ocean, in the deepest part known as the Marianas Trench, a possible cure may have been located.  Ambrosia is the name, and a massive underwater lab has been built to harvest it.  Luke Nelson has been summoned to fly to Guam and catch a boat to aid his brother Clayton, who is already below in the lab.  Riding to the station with Lt. Alice Sykes in a sophisticated mini-sub, they hope to harvest the ambrosia and bring it to the surface.  Luke is suffering from recurring flashbacks to the abduction of his young son Zach as well as the terrible treatment he and his brother suffered at the hands of their mother.Upon reaching the station, Luke and Alice discover that things are not as they should be.  As time passes, it becomes clear that there is something else under the eight miles of ocean; a presence so evil that any living thing will be lucky to escape alive.  It's a race to see if Alice and Luke will ever make it off the ocean floor and back to the surface.I read Nick Cutter's previous book, ""The Troop"", and I found it to be pretty good.  ""The Deep"" is not on the same level.  The book is loaded with flashbacks and journal entries that take away from the flow of the story.  Plus, the character development is somewhat lacking, and the ending is predictable.  That said, there are some truly scary passages, and the reader does get a sense of what it would be like to be trapped underwater with no communication ability with the surface.

"In 1942, the United States began preparations for the creation of the Eighth Air Force.  Over the course of the next three years, the Eighth would grow from relative obscurity into one of the largest fighting forces of the war.  Employing thousands of men and aircraft, the Eighth developed the premise of daylight precision bombing as opposed to the British doctrine of night time area bombing.  One of the groups in the Eighth was the 303rd bomb group, and ""Hell's Angels""  tells the story of the group's formation until their last mission in April, 1945.The 303rd consisted of a cross-section of members from across the country.  Some were farmers, some were laborers, and many were still in their teens.  As the war progressed, these young boys honed their skills and became one of the most successful bomb groups in the Eighth.Author Jay A. Stoudt has done a masterful job in describing the 303rd bomb group.  Loaded with first-person accounts from the members themselves, the reader gets a true sense of what it was like to fly a B-17 or to fight off attacks from German fighters.  He describes what it was like to be crammed inside the ball turret and what it was like to be shot down and captured.  Not only does Stoudt discuss the actual missions flown by the 303rd, he also discusses the human element of war, such as the loss of a bomber on their 35th and last mission, or the horrific sight of two B-17s colliding in midair.I've read many books about the air war over Germany, and ""Hell's Angels"" is one of the best I've read.

"Marine doctor Joe Rush is headed to the Arctic.  The high-powered nuclear submarine USS Montana is afire and adrift.  Many of the crew have already died, and the survivors are encamped on the ice near the submarine.  Now, Joe and  2 squads of Marines are headed to board the only American ice breaker in the Arctic in hopes of reaching the stricken submarine.Upon arriving, Joe learns that there's much more to the Montana; not just the fire, but something else.  Something has caused the surviving crew members to become violently ill, and the source is on the submarine.  Joe not only has to deal with a stricken submarine, but a potential lethal medical outbreak.  And, to make matters even worse, a Chinese submarine has surfaced and is poised to blow the Montana out of the water.  Joe and his crew must find a way to not only save the Montana, but to prevent a possible pandemic of global proportions.I'm a fan of Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler, so I was interested in reading ""White Plague"".  Overall, I thought the story and character development was good.  Joe Rush is a Marine who has his own demons to fight while at the same time maintaining control in order to save the crew of the Montana.  Other characters, such as Joe's sidekick Eddie and assistant deputy secretary Andrew Sachs play important roles throughout the book.  The action starts immediately and doesn't stop until the end of the book.  I'm looking forward to more books in the Joe Rush series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSAU9YJP2T7MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425276325#wasThisHelpful","RSAU9YJP2T7MR","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most people who were alive in November, 1963 can remember where they were and what they were doing when it was announced that President Kennedy had been shot.  For those of us like myself who were not alive in 1963, Bill O'Reilly's book ""Killing Kennedy"" does a good job of describing the events of that tragic day.Not limiting themselves to Kennedy's assassination, O'Reilly and co-author Martin Dugard describe Kennedy's time aboard PT-109 during World War II and how he managed to save his crew members after the boat was sunk by a Japanese destroyer.While serving as President, Kennedy faced many challenges, including the Bay of Pigs disaster, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the escalation of the Vietnam War, and the birth of the Civil Rights movement.  These events are detailed throughout the course of the book.Paralleling Kennedy's time as President is the story of Lee Harvey Oswald, an American citizen who has immigrated to the Soviet Union.  Throughout the course of the book, O'Reilly paints a collision course between Kennedy and Oswald that will reach its tragic conclusion in Dallas on November 22nd, 1963.I found ""Killing Kennedy"" to be an informative and interesting read.  I was not alive in 1963, so I've had to rely on books for information about the Kennedy assassination, and this book does a good job of providing information about the events leading up to and the assassination itself.

Author Drew Karpyshyn has written a masterful epic fantasy that keeps the reader hooked throughout.  The characters are well-developed, and the story is loaded with action and adventure. New characters are introduced that blend in nicely with the story.  I've read many other fantasy authors, including Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan, and the Children of Fire series ranks right up with Shannara and The Wheel of Time.

"On December 9, 1945, the car that U.S. General George Patton was riding in collided with an American truck.  Patton was left paralyzed.  Twelve days later, Patton died.  Over the years, theories have emerged as to what really happened to Patton.  In ""Killing Patton"", authors Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard attempt to explain the truth behind Patton's death.Not limiting themselves to the circumstances behind Patton's death, O'Reilly and Dugard explain the war in Eurpoe from the autumn of 1944 to the German surrender, focusing on Patton's famed Third Army.  From the rescue of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne to the crossing of the Rhine, the Third Army established themselves as the tip of the American spear.  It is believed that the Third Army could have raced straight into Berlin, but Eisenhower put Patton on the defensive.  Still, Patton and his men distinguished themselves over and over again.The authors point out that there were strange instances leading up to Patton's death.  For example, a Spitfire tried to shoot down a plane Patton was flying in.  Then, there are reports out that the Russians wanted Patton killed.  Finally, the tragic car accident ended up taking Patton's life, but was it really an accident?I found ""Killing Patton"" to be an informative and interesting book.  I enjoyed reading about Patton's heroics on the battlefield, and it was sobering reading about the General's untimely death.  Was Patton killed or was he simply involved in a tragic accident?I highly recommend this fine book.  Patton was one of America's finest fighting Generals, and ""Killing Patton"" describes his heroic actions on the battlefield as well as his tragic death.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RI3M1X30DKQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080509668X#wasThisHelpful","R3RI3M1X30DKQD","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Kanan Jarrus has managed to survive; not by using the Force, but by staying one step ahead of everyone else.The planet Gorse and its companion moon Cynda contain large quantities of an element needed by the Empire to run its star fleet.  Enter Count Vidian, an Imperial supposedly acting on orders from the Emperor.  Vidian believes that the best way to secure the needed resources from Cynda is to destroy the moon and harvest the remnants from space.  But is this true?  Others, including Captain Sloane of the star destroyer Ultimatum, believe that Vidian might be wrong in his assessment.  Throw in a beautiful female Twi'lek, an unscrupulous mineral miner, and a tech-savvy Sullustan and Vidian will soon have all the problems he can handle.  Will Vidian succeed in destroying Cynda, or will the small band of misfits stop him before it's too late?I'm a big fan of the Star Wars novels, and ""A New Dawn"" is a good addition to the series.

Janus tries making off with the treasure , but the Fargos foil the plot.  This is just the beginning of an ongoing confrontation between Sam, Remi, and Janus that will traverse the globe from Spain to Canada to Laos and Mexico.Upon discovering the perfectly preserved Viking ship sitting in ice in Canada, Sam and Remi discover that some of the treasures on board contain inscriptions suggesting they came from the pre-Columbian period.  Learning that these treasures could have been from the Toltecs, Sam and Remi deduce that the Vikings were trading with the Toltecs.

"By July, 1945, Japan was on the brink of collapse.  Her navy was at the bottom of the Pacific, her air force was nowhere to be found, and an American blockade stopped virtually all shipments of goods.  However, Japan refused to surrender. In this book, author Paul Ham contends that the Japanese would have eventually surrendered without the use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.This question is open to debate.  It is true that Japan was on life support by the summer of 1945.  However, The Japanese vowed to fight on.  Any talk of surrender by the Japanese had conditions attached (no occupation, Japan would try her own war criminals, retention of Emperor).  The Allies at Potsdam insisted upon unconditional surrender.  It is true, as the situation worsened, that Japan sent out peace feelers to the Russians, hoping they would mediate a negotiated surrender with the Americans.  Hopes of this were dashed when Russia declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945; two days after the Hiroshima bombing.This book does a good job of describing the use of the atomic bombs vs surrender by blockade and conventional air strikes.  Ham believes that Japan would have surrendered by December 1945 due to the acute lack of food.  It is difficult to say.  Granted, the atomic bombs killed thousands of civilians, but they gave the Japanese a way to surrender while ""saving face"".Ham's book definitely will stir up debate as to whether the bombs were necessary to end the war.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSLO469E51Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047110#wasThisHelpful","R2QSLO469E51Z1","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the American bombing campaign against Germany in World War II, the Eighth Air Force, or the ""Mighty Eighth"" was the glamor outfit that garnered much of the attention.  However, there was another American bomb group stationed in Italy as well.  This group was the Fifteenth Air Force.  It didn't grab headlines like the larger 8th did, but this group made an important contribution to the defeat of Germany.Stationed in Foggia, Italy, the Fifteenth flew missions against Europe's ""soft underbelly"".  Oil refineries were the primary target of the Fifteenth, and these airmen made several trips to such flak-infested areas as Ploesti with the goal of knocking out Germany's synthetic oil production capabilities.It fell upon the Fifteenth to carry out these missions, for the Eighth aircraft could not reach them from their bases in England.Besides hitting oil targets, the Fifteenth also participated in raids on Germany as well as targets in the Balkans.  Often living in the shadows of the larger Eighth, the men of the Fifteenth nonetheless proved to be a vital element in the defeat of Germany.""Forgotten Fifteenth"" is a fine book about one of America's lesser-known bomber groups.  These brave men distinguished themselves time and again, flying dangerous missions over flak and fighter infested targets.  This group produced many fighter aces as well as famous bomber pilots such as George McGovern and Lloyd Bentsen.  The men of the Fifteenth never received the recognition like their brothers in the Eighth did, but their efforts proved monumental in the defeat of Germany.Author Barrett Tillman has done a fine job of describing the formation of the Fifteenth, along with the missions flown.  He describes in vivid detail how these brave flyers struck at the heart of such targets as Ploesti and Vienna.  He also describes some of the more obscure aspects of the Fifteenth, from weather recon flights to efforts to bring Allied POWs safely home.  I've read other books by Tillman, and ""Forgotten Fifteenth"" is just as good as his earlier works.  Readers of the air war in Europe will definitely want to read this book.

"On an autumn weekend, five boys and their scoutmaster head to Falstaff island for a camping trip.  Leading the group is scoutmaster Tim Riggs, who works as a general practitioner doctor.  The boys are friends from school; Ephriham, Max, Kent, Newt, and Shelley.  The agenda includes camping out in a cabin and going on long hikes, but unfortunately for the group, that's all about to change.On the first night, an unexpected visitor arrives at camp.  Wild-eyed and voraciously hungry, this man is about to unleash a horror so terrifying that it will render the group spellbound and fighting for survival; for inside this man is a bioengineered nightmare that will spread fear and terror throughout the camp.  Plus, there is other involvement as well from other sources, including the military, who has gotten word of the goings-on on Falstaff island.  Now, the boys must fight for survival against an unseen enemy that its threatening to take over their bodies and minds.  Will any survive?It took me a while to really get into this book, but the story does pick up eventually.  I thought the premise and background for the story was well-conceived, but the character development is somewhat lacking.  The five boys are stereotypical teenagers: the jock, the nerd, the outcast, and the ""best friends forever"".  Even scoutmaster Tim's character is pretty predictable in his actions.  This being said, I did like the bioengineering aspect to the story, as well as the involvement of the military in isolating the island.This book has some definite scary parts, but there are lulls, too.  I do think fans of horror fiction would enjoy this book, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZDS4S514CIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717710#wasThisHelpful","R1CZDS4S514CIP","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Om May 16, 1943, a force of 19 specially-modified Lancaster bombers took off from their base in England.  The target was the German dams located in the industrial Ruhr valley.  Carrying specially-designed 4-ton bombs that were designed to skip across the water, the goal of the mission was to destroy the Mohne, Eder, and Sorpe dams.Conceived by Barnes Wallis, the idea was to destroy the dams.  The resultant flooding would overwhelm the surrounding countryside, which included power plants, industries, and homes.  Originally shot down by the higher-ups, Wallis persisted in his arguments.  Eventually, his plan was approved and work started on the special bombs, which were code-named Upkeep.Guy Gibson was selected to form the special squadron which would carry out the raid.  A veteran of many missions over Germany, Gibson was the perfect selection to head up the attack.  Soon, the squadron was selected and training begun.Over the course of several weeks, the squadron grew together into a well-formed fighting unit.I found ""Dam Busters"" to be an interesting and informative read.  Having read little on this particular raid, I was impressed by author James Holland's thoroughness in covering every aspect of the attack.  Included in Holland's work is the early discussions about the feasibility of such an attack, Wallis' belief in the bouncing bomb, the construction and testing of the bomb itself, and finally, the discussion of the raid.  Each area is fully explored, and the reader gets a true feel of not only the raid itself, but everything that led up to it.I give ""Dam Busters"" a very high recommendation.  James Holland has taken one of the great surprise raids in the war and brought it to life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LB0PMGATJ4WT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802121691#wasThisHelpful","R2LB0PMGATJ4WT","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On September 1, 1944, an American B-24 bomber was shot down over the Palau islands in the Pacific.  Three men managed to bail out before the plane crashed.  The others perished in the crash.  In ""Vanished"", author Wil S. Hylton tells a remarkable tale of one man's journey to discover the remains of the plane and the men entombed within.Pat Scannon is the name of the man responsible for the search.  Over a period of many years, Scannon and his crew of scuba divers, sonar experts, and scientists made several visits to the Palau islands in search of the missing B-24.  Each time Scannon and his crew went to search for the plane, obstacles kept appearing.  But Scannon didn't let these obstacles deter him from his ultimate goal of providing closure for the families of the crew members.  In a story that reads like a novel, Hylton describes each of Scannon's visits and the results obtained.Not just focusing on the search for the missing plane, Hylton also vividly describes the brutal action that took place during the time of the B-24's disappearance.  The Palau islands were viewed as a potential staging area for attacks by the Japanese against MacArthur's drive to retake the Philippines.  This point is hotly debated, as many saw the Palaus as an unnecessary operation.  The battles fought here, especially on Peleliu, were some of the bloodiest of the war.  Bombing missions were ordered to neutralize the islands.  The missing B-24 was shot down on a mission over these islands.I found ""Vanished"" to be an excellent read.  The story of Scannon's search for the missing bomber is riveting, and each trip Scannon made is described in great detail.  The discussion about the Palaus campaign is told in frightening terms relating to tremendous casualties suffered on both sides.I recommend this book to readers of World War II history and to those who enjoy books about searching for missing relics.  The story is gripping and the end result is uplifting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAA4KRLENJZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594487278#wasThisHelpful","RZAA4KRLENJZV","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone knows that, on December 7th, 1941, the Japanese Navy attacked the American base at Pearl Harbor.  Numerous ships were sunk or damaged, scores of planes destroyed, and over 2,000 people were killed.  But what led Japan to take such a drastic step to start a war that they had no hope of winning?  Eri Hotta attempts to answer this question in ""Japan 1941"".One could argue that World War II began when Japan invaded China in 1931.  From that point forward, Japan was under scrutiny from the rest of the world, including the United States.  By 1941, Japan was suffering from sanctions, including an embargo on oil and scrap metal from the United States.  War with the United States was a distinct possibility.But what of the preparations for this war?  Hotta argues, rightly so, that the Japanese were unprepared to fight a successful war against the United States.  The industrial might of the United States would overwhelm Japan.  Japan, in the words of Winston Churchill, would be ground into dust.Despite the vast difference in industrial might, many Japanese felt that war was the only answer.  Others believed that success could be achieved through negotiation.  It was this constant bickering and interservice rivalry that ultimately doomed Japan.  Hotta states that none of Japan's top leaders had sufficient will, desire, or courage to stop the momentum for war.  The attack on Pearl Harbor can be viewed loosely as a tactical success for the Japanese.  But the result was a strategic nightmare, for only 6 months later, the Japanese advance was stopped at Midway.I found this book to be an informative narrative about Japan's preparations for war in 1941.  The narrative encompasses all major aspects of what the diplomatic and military situation was like for Japan from the time of the invasion of China up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Although somewhat difficult to read due to all of the names, the book nonetheless contains a wealth of information about Japan's preparations for war.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8QJPXE19U3OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594017#wasThisHelpful","R8QJPXE19U3OF","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  ""Parkland"" explores the chaotic four days in Dallas through the eyes of the hospital workers who worked to revive JFK and later Lee Harvey Oswald, the Secret Service workers who were charged with protecting the President, and family members, including Oswald's brother Robert and his mother, who were forced to live with the repercussions of the actions of others.The film begins with Kennedy's motorcade proceeding through the streets of Dallas.  Kennedy is shot, and the Presidential limo speeds toward Parkland, where the only doctor initially on duty is a resident (Zac Efron).  The staff members of parkland fight heroically to save Kennedy, but to no avail.  Next, the movie proceeds to the events concerning the Secret Service, including the seizure of the Zapruder film and the struggle to have Kennedy's body released for the flight back to Washington, D.C.  The viewer also gets a look at the brother and mother of Lee Harvey Oswald.""Parkland"" is one of the best movies I've seen.  The historical timeline is accurate, and the scenes in the Parkland operating room, while most definitely graphic, are historically correct.  The acting is top-notch, and Billy Bob Thornton, James Badge Dale, and Zac Efron all give first-rate performances.

"One morning, Ingatius (Ig) Perrish wakes up from a night of drinking and ""doing terrible things"".  But waking up with a hangover is only the beginning, for Ig soon discovers that he has grown, of all things, horns!  At first, Ig believes he is imagining the horns.  But he soon realizes they are real.Ig has been wallowing in grief since the death of Merrin Williams, his girlfriend.  Merrin was beaten, raped, and left for dead.  Everyone in town believes that Ig is responsible and the only reason he's not in jail is his family's wealth and influence.But the horns have powers far beyond anything Ig could have imagined.  Just by touching someone, he can learn their innermost secrets, fantasies, desires, and wrongdoings.  Ig hopes to use this power to find out who really killed his beloved Merrin.This is a wonderfully developed story that is packed with terror, humor, and a true, down-to-earth love story.  The reader will truly experience all of these emotions during the course of the book.  It's easy to sympathize with Ig; the grieving soul left behind after the unsolved death of his girlfriend.  On the other hand, as the story progresses, Ig transforms into something truly scary.  But, even during his transformation, his goal remains to find who killed Merrin.I've become a fan of Joe Hill's work, and ""Horns"" is a cleverly-developed story that is exciting throughout.

"Joe Hill has written a scary and terrifying book about vivid imaginations and pure evil.""NOS4A2"" is the story of Victoria McQueen.  During the course of the story, Vic goes from a young eight-year-old to a grown-up woman.  But one thing remains constant throughout: her connection with Charles Talent Manx.  Charles rides around in a 1938 Rolls Royce Wraith.  Through his imaginations, he transports children who are unhappy or hurt to a magical place called Christmasland, where it's always Christmas.  But Manx is not the nice person he seems to be.  In reality he is a cold-blooded killer and kidnapper.Vic herself is kidnapped by Manx, but she managed to escape.  Now it's her twelve-year-old son Wayne who has fallen into Manx's clutches.  The only way Vic can save Wayne is to use her own imagination and retrieve Wayne from Christmasland before it's too late.This is the first book I've read from Joe Hill.

If you like suspenseful, scary stories, then don't miss this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DXI5KJ4N4LWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062200577#wasThisHelpful","R1DXI5KJ4N4LWY","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Death Star has been destroyed.  Now, Princess Leia and her band of Rebel comrades have begun construction of a new secret outpost known as Echo Base on the remote ice world of Hoth.  But the base needs supplies for construction, so Leia and Han Solo have set up a rendezvous to acquire them. But her ship comes out of hyperspace right into the arms of a waiting Imperial corvette.  Was she betrayed?  If so, by whom?  Leia's damaged ship managed to escape from the Imperial corvette, but what she comes across after exiting hyperspace is even more disturbing; a gunship is attacking a merchant freighter.Disturbed by the actions of the gunship, Leia learns that it is in fact crewed by survivors from Alderaan.  Being Alderaanean herself, Leia is determined to find out why this gunship would be attacking a merchant vessel.  What she finds is a ship crewed by pirates.  Now, Leia's job has become one of not only acquiring supplies for Echo Base, but finding a way to help the crew members of the gunship.  The Alderaaneans are in debt to a mysterious pirate leader, and Leia has set her mind to helping them while possibly recruiting them to the Rebel alliance.  Will she succeed?I'm a big fan of ""Star Wars"" novels, and I found ""Razor's Edge"" to be a good book.  I enjoyed watching the development of Princess Leia from a diplomat to a very capable fighter.  Of course, having Han Solo and Chewbacca around means that there will always be plenty of action.  I felt the story was well-conceived, and I enjoyed the actions of Han and Leia vs. the pirates and Imperials.  I hope the next book in the series is as good as this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZRXHLF7UZPPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545249#wasThisHelpful","R1ZRXHLF7UZPPG","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"R.L Stine has been scaring children for years with his ""Goosebumps"" series of books.  Now, it's the adults turn to be scared, and ""Red Rain"" does a masterful job of doing just that.Lea Sutter is a travel writer who writes a blog about interesting places to visit.  Her current destination is the island of Le Chat Noir.  While on the island, a devastating hurricane strikes, killing dozens and destroying numerous buildings.  Lea herself is injured, but it's the two twin boys who emerge from the rubble that catch Lea's attention.  Lea had always wanted more children than the two she and her husband Mark have, so she makes the impulsive decision to adopt the boys and raise them as her own.Needless to say, her husband is not enthusiastic about welcoming two new children into his family.  Plus, he's unsure about how his children Ira and Elena will react. Mark is struggling with bad press about his new book and does not need another distraction in his life.  At the beginning, the twins seem to fit in.  Appearances can be deceiving, for soon after their arrival, the twins begin stealing items from the home and doing other nasty deeds.  But these are only a prelude, for as the story goes along, it is revealed that the boys are definitely not the little angels Lea thought they were.I found ""Red Rain"" to be an excellent book.  The story is definitely loaded with terror and suspense, and the characters are well-developed.  Stine also displays a sense of humor in the book with the constant banter back and forth between the two police officer characters.  The ending has a twist as well.I've never read R.L. Stine before, but I will again.  Hopefully, he'll have another new adult novel out soon.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPMKMRYG9IUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145163613X#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPMKMRYG9IUU","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sam and Remi Fargo are vacationing in Mexico when a violent earthquake rocks the region.  The Fargos remain in the area, providing medical assistance to the injured.  While there, they come across a volcano; but it's what's inside the volcano that is truly amazing; for inside the volcano is an ancient building containing the remains of a mummified man.  But even more amazing is the discovery of a Mayan codex.  Soon, Sam and Remi have shipped the codex back to the United States and are on their way home.Upon returning, they are approached by Sarah Allersby, a wealthy English heiress who has an interest in the codex.  Rebuffed by the Fargos when she expresses a desire to purchase the codex, Sarah leaves, but this initial encounter is only the beginning, for Sarah soon becomes obsessed at possessing the codex and will do everything in ther power to acquire it, including murder.  Will Sam and Remi survive?  Who will end up with the codex?I've become a fan of Cussler's Fargo series, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""The Mayan Secrets"".  The story is good, and Sam and Remi always keep the action moving.  The other characters introduced in this book are very good, too, especially Sarah Allersby and the two thugs who work for her.  The ending is a bit of a surprise, too.I highly recommend ""The Mayan Secrets"".  It is a worthy addition to the Fargo series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UN0Y4GX69UXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399162496#wasThisHelpful","R1UN0Y4GX69UXT","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Obi-Wan Kenobi has come to the desert planet Tatooine as an exile.  After Emperor Palpatine's Order 66 to exterminate the remaining Jedi was issued, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and the remaining Jedi who weren't killed went into hiding.  Kenobi chose Tatooine to oversee Anakin Skywalker's (now Darth Vader) son Luke.  He hopes to remain isolated in his efforts, but things have a way of changing.The Oasis is a small general store and livery located in the sands of Tatooine.  Run by Annileen Calwell and her children, the Oasis serves people who need supplies, animals, or alcohol.  Orrin Gault, a moisture farmer, frequents the Oasis.  He is also the head of the local militia which protects paying customers from the dangerous Tuskens.  One day, Obi-Wan, now known as Ben, rescues Annileen's daughter from an encounter with the Tuskens.  In the days and weeks that follow, Ben's desire to remain hidden is tested, as he becomes close to Annileen.  But danger lurks as well, not only from the dangerous Tuskens, but from a secret that Orrin is hiding which could jeopardize not only his mission to protect Luke, but to the other locals as well.  Not willing to stand by and watch innocents harmed, Ben must rely on his Force training in his never-ending fight for justice.I'm a big fan of the Star Wars novels, and ""Kenobi"" is one of the best I've read.  From the very beginning, the story explodes and keeps the reader interested throughout.  Author John Jackson Miller has done a fine job of developing Ben's character as he struggles to contain his ever-growing feelings for Annileen.  Orrin's betrayal is also a highlight of the story.I give ""Kenobi"" my highest recommendation.  Full of action from beginning to end, this book is the perfect addition to the Star Wars novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUAFUP299XTJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345546830#wasThisHelpful","RUAFUP299XTJP","A3KY68OTSNHM3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KY68OTSNHM3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jessye Norman.....What can I say that has not already been said about this truly fascinating and vocal treasure...one of the greatest to ever grace the operatic stages of the world, and also, naturally, of the recording studioLong have I followed this amazing woman from what seems an explosive appearance into super-stardom and her long ride at the crest of the waves throughout these many years of her career.I have long loved this great super-talented and gracious truly beautiful lady and the many great excursions she has taken me on through her recordings and videos of both operatic productions/recordings, and also for her solo recital work.....simply one of the best (but I bet you already knew that, right?).The history and history-lesson(s) she presents to us here in this book are so truly needed today and to be re-viewed and re-minded for us, and for those who were not around when Jessye's (and my) formative years and beyond were happening. Wonderful indeed, to reflect on just ""how things were"" back then, and how she came through it all, etc., got her education, and made the absolutely-correct choices in moving forward, and along the way became the very great lady that she is....truly she stands with Marian Anderson (her hero) and Leontyne Price as the three greatest Black Operatic Singers from the USA to grace the stages of the world! This is a great biographical book and a must-read for any opera lover.If I were to say anything in the somewhat negative of this book I would have to say that I at more than a few points felt like she was presenting points sort of like ""I did this"" and ""Then I did that"", etc. Now, please bear in mind that I read the pre-publication galleys and things may have been corrected for the final print version (so I'm just saying) but I still would highly recommend it to you whole-heartedly....a ""must read"" from a very gracious honest and lovely lady who just grows and grows more gracious and lovely every day!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y32OXWGXZTQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544003403#wasThisHelpful","R2Y32OXWGXZTQ2","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I LOVE this book! Sherri Gragg has the gift of being able to put this all together with such loving and tender and enlightening touch, words and expression! This lovely book has remained on my nightstand now for many months, and frequently before ""putting out the light"" I spend some time reading/re-reading Gragg's ""Call to Linger in the Savior's Presence"" before sleep. Sometimes because I ""need to"" for one reason or another as in the case of a bad or stressful day, and other times ""just because"" before ending my day...good news is indeed good news after all!Presented as a short piece of scripture followed by a recommendation to read a particular passage from the Gospels and then Gragg's thoughts/interpretations/expressions, this is a warm and very gentle and personal view into the Life, Deeds, Teachings and Thoughts of Jesus. I find it one of my favorite books after the New Testament (and the rest of the Bible) and some of my other volumes regarding scripture and historical writings and documentation(s), etc.  As I said earlier, it is, indeed, a very lovely and moving, touching, greatly uplifting and comforting book (for me) to have on my nightstand to close out my day with these wonderful entries assembled and written here by Sherri Gragg. I highly recommend it to you and am positive that you will also find it becomes one of your favorite daily pleasures to read from.~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J7QDSU7WMLK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400323460#wasThisHelpful","R3J7QDSU7WMLK8","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An especially enlightening and enjoyable little book (under 220 pages) about ""walking"" and its ""purpose"" or usefulness in the creative lives of famous philosophers, thinkers, teachers, poets, etc. throughout our relatively recent and not so recent past.First, I cannot believe how many people have ""torn this book up"" with their reviews! My honest hope is that you will overlook these and read some of the 4 and 5 star ones....they are the folks who have understood and relate to the author's intentions! I cannot imagine that the average perspective reader will not come away from this truly wonderful educational/enlightening experience laid out for you by Mr. Gros and not think themselves the better for having read/experienced this lovely book!Walking....it's pace, the determination put into it, the steep rugged terrain walk, the easy lazy stroll, etc., on and on are gone into here with interesting, informative and delightful examples of what each meant to famous men during their creative productive lives in our past.Others have written much, so I will keep this review rather brief, but urge you to read this really enjoyable book. Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Rousseau, Thoreau, and Travelers-By-Foot to Santiago de Compostela all would recommend you read it, as well as many Strollers in the Public Gardens of the 1890's would also!

"In these times today, it is hardly likely that there is another book so vitally important to (1) Parents (2) Students and (3) Teachers and the people that will influence the school kids ""here and now"".....  Let's not kid ourselves, these times are indeed hard for all involved with these young people and how/what to do with them (as things currently exist) in their close personal/educational surroundings. Someone needs to stop the crazy merry-go-round that our young people are caught up on from the pushing/pressure of their parents, the same from their peers, and certainly sometimes from the very ""wise"" educators that supposedly should be ""inspiring"" and ""stretching"" them and their minds.What I find truly amazing is just how many people here have given this book a thumbs down... It seems the parents themselves (today) were also caught up on this same merry-go-round and for some reason could not/cannot separate the ""necessary"" from the ""not"" that David McCullough, Jr. here was/is trying to point out/instruct them on about what is wrong with their children's ""lives"" that they are directly responsible for!Education...and the resultant ability/knowledge to go on about and direct one's life and future in the world (both business-wise and other-wise) is what should be most important during these 12 years of formal education, but most particularly the last 4, above everything else. Correct mind-set, learned ability to continue pushing themselves to know and do more ""work-wise"" sets them right upon the path to continue with this very drive and desire to excel, push through and succeed. This is necessary during these last 4 years...it sets them up for furthering their learning in advanced education beyond high school, and for these very brief 4 years it certainly must take precedent over nearly most other things in the student's life.But....what do we get generally now-days?....Pressure from the parents for extra outside interests like sports....one of the most intense competitive activities that exists today......pressure and added stresses, etc., placed on their children to ""be sports stars"" or ""heroes"" etc., and to the point that ""every-one's"" lives that are directly involved with the student are caught up (again) on this ""M-G-R"".....  Further, parents today more than tend to direct every aspect of the student's life and activities (as if it were Their Lives instead of their child's) to the point that the child literally is short-changed on education and over-loaded with ""other stuff"" that simply is not ""all that important""....  Johnny will soon learn that his Baseball or Football Letter is one hell of a lot less important that developing his ability to continue ""thinking through"" and ""pressing forward"" when it comes to a particularly challenging problem or aspect of his job when perhaps that particular problem might be putting his future on the line....I have read many many of these reviews here, and frankly I find the ""whiners"" with their ""I got bored"" or ""I couldn't figure out what he was trying to point out"", or ""whatever"".......obviously they were not concentrating on and/or trying to absorb what Mr. McCullough, Jr. was (quite) clearly presenting to them! Honestly, as I said earlier, this is perhaps the most important book today that should be read by parents, students, and their teachers......and, Even Better, would be for them to read it and discuss it in a group surrounding (perhaps one night a week until they are finished with reading it and then a final ""summing-up"" meeting......  Truthfully, this sort of solution/answer is perhaps the best thing that ""Johnny"" could have happen to him before it comes to his High School Graduation.....Now, the ""Brilliant"" that I lead my heading off with....  The commencement address that Mr. McCullough, Jr. gave in 2012 at his school's graduation ceremony is just that....Brilliant!  I have read these 8 pages at the end of the book numerous times and unfailingly marvel at the true brilliance of McCullough's words and can only wonder just what the effect of them must have had on that audience, and how the very air in that hall or space must have been charged/changed by the time he had finished speaking! I cannot imagine ANY parent not wishing and hoping for the author to be their son or daughter's teacher/mentor in high school (or somebody comparatively like him). This point was particularly touching for me as I was a near-failing student at 9th grade, but for an excellent English teacher and a very astute math ""genius-type"" instructor who both saw me and understood my problem and took to me and coached/guided me, pushed me if you will, to become a high-honors graduate at the end of those 3 years....forever am I grateful and thankful for these special people who watched out and over me and taught me to drive onward and be productive, astute, and successful throughout this remainder of my life, even today, forever pushing onward, striving to ""know"" and ""do"" more these 50 years later!This is what this book is about (amongst other things also) and important it is! Parents....read this book, disentangle yourselves with your own ""personal"" interest(s) that you place on your children, stop orchestrating and organizing every aspect of their lives! Allow Johnny or Jill to stumble some...they will learn SO much more by/from doing so. Their ""glory"" in the athletic/sports/or whatever else activities that deeply cut into their learning time is SO short lived, SO superficial even just a few months after graduating, versus the importance of their preparation learning while in class and developing these skills that they will need/use every day of the rest of their lives simply makes no sense. David McCullough, Jr. is one of the most respected educators in the country and his long successful career and brilliance at what he does is no accident....believe me! He worked for that, he pushed, he studied and learned just how/what to be/do to become the superlative educator and public citizen of Wellesley, Massachusetts and I guarantee you that every ""teacher"" that has read this book ""wishes"" that he/she had written and delivered the commencement address that David McCullough, Jr. did that day to the graduating students of the Wellesley High School where he taught! (Imagine, for a moment, what effect ""their teacher"" must have had on them that day as he stood before them and delivered his ""benediction"" to them)!One last thing in wrapping up.....do not be put off by the ""so called negative"" reviews here. The issue is your child and his readiness and preparedness for ""life beyond the popularity of high school"".....this is no laughing matter and is indeed very serious. Read this book for yourself, urge your child/children to read it, and inquire if perhaps their teacher(s) might have also read it and talk openly, discuss, the point and purpose of this amazing book. It is Important. It is Relevant! It is Worthy of your time, your child's time, etc. You may never read a more helpful eye-opening book that may/will affect your or your child's life and future!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2238B054V03DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006225734X#wasThisHelpful","R2238B054V03DI","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The folks at Integrated Marketing do the cook/chef/food lover a great service with the trilogy of this guide andFresh Produce Guide (2012) and The Art of Selecting & Serving Cheese (2011) (The Art of Selecting & Serving Cheese (2011)).All three of these books, taken together, make a great cornerstone/helping hand in one's kitchen.This meat and seafood guide presents more than 120 cuts of Beef, Veal, Pork, and Lamb, plus Chicken.

"As other reviewers here before me have stated, I also first saw this book in an older edition at my local grocers and inquired of the manager if he could order me a copy of it and I pay for it. He checked and got back to me and told me that he had found it here on Amazon, and in a newer edition. I immediately ordered myself a copy.This book along with its companion volumes (see below) are Kitchen/Cook/Nutritionist references of great value to anybody involved with food, whether you be the chef or just one of the many who simply enjoy food and care to know more about the things you either eat or are perhaps inquisitive about adding to your diet.The edition at my grocery was loose leaf and had much larger photos and printed matter, which makes sense considering the use that it serves in the produce department where folks can quickly locate and read about whatever it is they are checking upon or about while they are in the process of shopping. This edition is updated and although the information is presented with the smaller photos and typeface, for home use it is much more usable because of its size and the presentation is just fine for your frequent checking upon of items in your more relaxed environment where you can spend more time researching. It is lighter which is great for frequent handling and also fits on a shelf much better than the grocer's edition would. Also, it is spiral bound rather than loose-leaf so it is much more rugged in its construction giving it a longer life-span than the 3-hole punch would offer.This informative book is definitely a ""Five-Star"" reference work that you will be very glad you chose to add to your shelves! If you check the photos of the listing above you can get a really clear idea of what this book contains and how it is presented, etc. As a life-long publishing/printing master, I can assure you that this is an A+ volume of ""knowledge"" & ""information"" that will be of great use to anyone wishing to know more about the fresh fruit and vegetables that you ""already know"" and also the range of items that you may not know about, or are ""curious"" about that are readily available for you to try at the grocery.As a further bit of information for you to consider, the following are two further items that you should seriously consider adding to your order.....The Art of Selecting & Serving Cheese (2011) (The Art of Selecting & Serving Cheese (2011)) and Meat & Seafood Guide (2012) (Meat & Seafood Guide (2012)) are both very highly recommended for your referencing over 100 cheeses (and also olives) from all over the world, and also for information on over 120 cuts of meat(s) and also poultry and seafood.Trust me, you (as I do) will find this Fresh Produce Guide one of the best investments you will ever make for a reference on food items, along with the two further companion volumes I suggest.

"One of the finest discoveries so far this year!At the beginning of the 19th century, the guitar began to be taken more seriously as an instrument and pieces written for it began showing up....luckily for us!The only one who's work I was familiar with here, naturally, is Diabelli. Thus, when one ""takes a chance"" (I loved the cover art at first sighting), and an album ""comes up with"" such delightful pieces/music as this one it is very special even from the first listen and through repeated visitations!All three pieces are true, pure, delights to listen to. First, the sound on this cd is beyond reproach, crisp, clearly captured and projecting ""presence"" with excellent dimension. All three instruments are carefully miked so that we clearly hear the ""air"" around the flute (beautifully played by Stephanie Hamburger), the ""bite"" on the strings of the bow on Christian Euler's violin, and the rich quality and ring of the strings on Maximilian Mangold's guitar. I would almost declare this as a ""Great Demonstration Disk"", but will refrain from doing so, although recommending highly for sound and great musicianship on the part of the three players.All three pieces here were previously unheard by me, and I came away from them with ""pure delight"" in my heart and in my brain. All three works are bright and for lack of another word, perky! They are light and easy-to-listen-to, almost ""demanding"" to be played again and again! This disk has rarely been out of my player since I received it and I recommend it highly to chamber music lovers, especially small trio pieces. It is always so wonderful when you make a new discovery like this!It is sad there are no sound-bites here for you to listen to. I wish Amazon would provide them for all recordings.In closing, this is truly an album to enjoy....again and again, and I guarantee that it will be a favorite of yours as it has become one of mine....enjoy it!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GKX3I0GS88BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AE3FBQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GKX3I0GS88BT","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously never heard of Xue-Wei, and I came upon this recording through a discussion group here on Amazon from a post by another listener/member. What a lucky spot of coincidence that I caught that post!I had to buy a used copy as it is (sadly) now out-of-print.The recommended piece here was the ""Serenade Melancolique, Op. 26"", a very rarely performed piece of Tchaikovsky's first performed in 1876 in Moscow, featuring Brodsky, and dedicated to Auer. What a shame this piece seems ""lost"" as it does. Probably it's short duration is the biggest thing against it, sadly.The Violin Concerto is very beautifully executed by Xue-Wei, rivaling any other's efforts that I have ever heard, and I have listened to dozens of recordings over the years. I will stay away from giving a ""best"" to this recording, as I will stay away from throwing a ""best"" out to any other performer's efforts also. What I will say is that this is a beautiful, warm, excellent performance by Xue-Wei, rating with any ""top favorites"". I would now NOT want to be without this recording, if that helps your making a decision about this recording.The Serenade is a pure delight, like some wonderfully rich exotic chocolate treat, or a truly fine rare wine, seldom experienced by many and perhaps for some a ""never heard it"" which needs to be remedied. There are a few other recordings available by other players, I know that Heifitz recorded it with Ormandy, and also, I believe that Itzak Perlman recorded it also, perhaps a few others also.The sound on this recording is just beautiful, warm, rich, clear, very well captured. I would not give a downgraded opinion as to the mastering or re-mastering for this disk.As I rated this ""treasure"" above, easily deserving 5-Stars without question at all!Now, the sad part.....out of print at the moment, very hard to find copies of. My suggestion to you, however, is even if you have to fore-go purchasing some other recordings that you have been wanting, it is worth seeking out and paying a ""reasonable"" used price for...as I said, I would not wish to be without this recording, it is indeed very special and worth having in one's collection.I do know, though, that ASV has a 2-disc set of Xue-Wei playing violin concertos Great Violin Concertos which I am sure is excellent (I might even acquire it for the other works on it) but it does not include the Serenade Op 26, Valse-Scherzo Op 34, or the Melodie Op 42 here on this disk.Easily Recommended, but hard to find, and of course at ""collector's prices"".~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MESDWJ94N8RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I572L2#wasThisHelpful","R3MESDWJ94N8RX","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This two-for of Wagner Overtures/Preludes holds a rather high spot in the pantheon of Wagner records, and I wish to draw your attention here as I only stumbled upon it by accident.Wagner lovers, this is the ONLY place, other than the Big Anniversary Boxed ""Ring"" (Solti/Decca, released last year as a limited edition) where you will find a copy of ""Kinderkatechismus"", nearly unknown even to Wagner enthusiasts! This very short 2'24 piece played by members of the Vienna Philharmonic is (to me) a wonderful ""gift"" from Decca/Elequence to those who deign to purchase this set. The piece is charming, and interesting naturally, as it is a ""personal piece"" written NOT for public performance, but for his family. The title  in English: ""A Children's Catechism for Kosel's Birthday"".....Kosel is the nickname Wagner had for his wife Cosima. In it's original form, it was performed by Wagner's children, accompanied by piano, on Christmas Day 1873. Later Wagner scored it for a very small orchestra and added an instrumental postlude taken from the very end of the recently completed ""Gotterdammerung"".  The Album is Worth it's price, alone, for this piece, and as I have never seen this anywhere before, I would suggest you obtain a copy asap if you're a curious or completest collector!Another ""Surprise"" bonus is the recording of Wagner's ""Faust Overture"", also rather unknown. Here we are presented Edo de Waart's recording with the San Francisco Symphony and it is very good.This album is sort of a ""smorgasbord"" of recordings by Zubin Mehta, Edo de Waart, and Sir Georg Solti, and it is easily recommendable for the two rarities contained within it.For a Wagner-lover, this album is a no-brainer!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18A11S25SQ765/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SO7J1Q#wasThisHelpful","R18A11S25SQ765","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really one scary story (written by Allison Littlewood, whom I am not familiar with) that will surely push you through what you may consider your ""comfort level"" to shattering new heights of terror.Cass and her young son, Ben are journeying towards a new place, a new life, after her husband Pete has been killed in Afganistan in a battle. Distraught herself, and little Ben now bereft and lost--sunk into harrowing solitude--she has decided to go back to the little village of Darnshaw where she spent part of her youth.Caught in a driving, and blinding, snow-and-ice storm as they cross the moorland heavy with fog, they are presented with eerie events that bring an uncomfortable itchiness to Cass and a moody short-tempered reaction in Ben. Out of seemingly nowhere a figure appears, knocking at the car-window...it is an odd-acting woman named Sally who has broken down a ways back. They pick her up as she also is headed for Darnshaw and give her a ride back into town.They locate the old mill that has been recently converted to apartments, where she has contracted through an agent to rent one of the units. The place is deserted except for Cass and Ben, even though she was told by the agent it was full-up and this unit was the last available. It is late, they are tired, unnerved by the drive through the storm and the strange circumstance of Sally (Cass had not seen any broken-down, abandoned vehicle along the road she has come to realize), and the total oddness with things at the mill. Now, she is unable to sleep for a strange scritchey-scratching she feels is coming from the wall of her room.Take it from me, things can only get worse!In the coming days Cass and Ben meet a few towns-folk, all remotely strange, the teachers and principle of the school that Ben attends, the snow, meanwhile piling up deeper and deeper....no-one plowing, things getting stranger, like a tension-set screw is being silently turned, ever tighter and tighter. Communication, in or out of Darnshaw, has been cut off now...no cell or phone service, roads unpassable, no mail, and no internet connection...everything with the outside, now shutdown! Ben has become an abrasive, unruly, thoroughly changed foul-mouthed brat...and we see that Cass is incapable of handling the situation. Through it all, the towns-folk just seem to carry on, everything normal, as expected here in Darnshaw.Things begin to unravel, and we find that Cass was not Cass when she lived here previously, that something unpleasant and misunderstood happened...but what exactly went on? She cannot remember exactly, it seems. Family stuff, her father, something strangely wrong, the church...it was in the church...I will stop here with descriptive ""tweaks"" to you, not wishing to deliver up any kind of spoiler. (I do not believe in spoiling a prospective reader's full enjoyment of a good book or movie).This story begins right on page one with an uneasy scratching, an itching, under your collar (so to speak), and continues at a harrowing, breakneck speed, building to breath-taking unbelievable terror. Unrelenting terror like you cannot imagine snuck upon us here, by Littlewood, and thrust into our faces!I recommend this book to you highly if you are a horror-book fan of Steven King, Koontz, Peter Straub, and others like them. Several passages here literally left me ""dumbstruck"" with the level of uneasiness, fear, chilling revelations, relentlessly sweeping me along to it's conclusion. What a scary thrill-ride this was!Two reservations...1) This book is Definitely Not For Children...they are definately not equipped to deal with descriptions and events presented here!2) Although one gets to the point where you ""just can't take any more"", there are a few more pages presented by Litlewood that do not live up to what has happened before. This is unfortunate for it feels like a let-down, not exactly anti-climactic, but like perhaps extraneous to this book--better saved, perhaps, as an intro or foreward to a sequel.However, enjoy this...it is one scary journey here in Darnshaw!~operabruin","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZ7DP2W2DBUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623650224#wasThisHelpful","R3BZ7DP2W2DBUX","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I get too far here with this review, I need first do a test featuring footage of the baryton so you may see and hear what a beautiful instrument it is (even if it is now quite unknown). If this link is not removed, then, you will see and hear the instrument...[...]Well, as I thought, amazon has removed the link. So, try this, then...copy and paste this in search window at head of pageRoland Hutchinson and the barytonWhen listings come up look for youtube and click that. Hutchinson gives a wonderfully informative overview of this beautiful instrument.This is an enormous set of 21 cds of the trios that Haydn wrote for Esterhazy, who loved the instrument and played as an amateur for personal enjoyment with his friends and to entertain guests. His skills were nowhere capable of realizing full use of the instrument, and Haydn (who it seems, with all honesty), was simply incapable of writing anything that was not wonderful, brilliant, or perfectly fitting for its intended venue and musicians. By Haydn's other works (for professional public performance by highly skilled musicians), then, at first, one would expect these small pieces to be shallow or two-dimensional. They are not such, but rather display incredible breadth and variation. They are anything but boring or flat.The Esterhazy Trio (I will return shortly and augment here) are captured in a delightfully warm environ, and very cleanly and crisply recorded. I would expect at first hearing many will find the baryton strange, which is perfectly natural...it is, of course ""unheard for over two centuries"" more or less. However, the ear quickly finds unusual beauty and sonority in this instrument's tone and the spread derived from the vibration of the strings under the board, occasionally plucked, and thoroughly enjoyable.That having been said, though, 120+ trios, to sit down and play one's way through would not be suitable at all...it's just too much, and, indeed, these pieces were intended to be played perhaps one or two in an evening as diversion or light entertainment from the events of the evening's setting in Esterhazy's day. At this writing I have listened to the first 4 disks completely and spot-checked several others and come away thus far with great interest, pleasant surprise and truly have enjoyed everything I have heard. This is though, for me, quiet-time, restful reflective-time music...best enjoyed with the lights low, a glass of light wine or a small brandy, with no diversion, that one may be ""sung to"" by this amazing lost instrument. I would say perhaps they would present several weeks or a couple of month's listening enjoyment by the finish-up, and would honestly expect if listened to at that rate two complete play-throughs plus occasional single disk plays a year will give any Haydn fan well more than this box's cost returned many times over. This is great music by one of the greatest composers and it should be heard and enjoyed. And, so, I hope that I have made a case here for your enjoyment into another exploration that will bring great satisfaction to you.~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325CZ3M2LBJDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P4KG1S#wasThisHelpful","R325CZ3M2LBJDA","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Way to go, Dennis McFarland!I am a staunch Civil War fan, and for good reason, really. It was an evolutionary necessity for this country. It is the only war fought on our soil as ""The United States"", even though at the time ""United"" is a misnomer. For sheer terror and horribleness it was shocking in it's brutality and the sobering numbers killed. It is single-handedly this country's greatest piece of history.With ""Nostalgia"", McFarland has given us, perhaps, the finest novel of the Civil War since Steven Crane's ""The Red Badge of Courage"". This book is so very finely crafted, and thoughtfully written, that it will stand out with you both while reading it and afterward, as you think back on it, savoring it's human richness, both for the characters and also for the ""photographic brilliance"" that the author creates (of) the Virginia Wilderness on those early days of May 1946, and also (of) what it was like to have been there (on the 4th, 5th and 6th) fighting and coming under fire, ball and shot literally peppering tree-trunks and whizzing overhead as a sideways ""rainstorm"" literally stripping those trees of leaves and branches...not to mention the mowing down of so very many men and boys, commanders, and horses...so much fire that the forest would actually catch afire and blaze uncontrolled burning soldiers to death if trapped in it.Summerfield Hayes has joined up in the Union Forces. He is 19 and untried at anything that could prepare him for what is now to come. He has led a life of leisure in Brooklyn with his older sister since they were orphaned, living in the family home with the staff who have stayed on in their capacity as when their parents were alive. Summerfield's great love in life is baseball...and he is good a the game.In Army training during downtimes Summerfield and his buddies play for sport and to relieve the tension of ""waiting"" for orders. comradery develops to fondness and love for each other of course, and it's a bad recipe for walking into the brutality that awaits them. This is an extreme, and painful, journey that Summerfield is on and acceptance, action, terrifying horror, shock, and fear place him on a knife's edge. We are with him witnessing the trial of those battles, but more, afterward, as he struggles to survive, alone and left for dead seeking help and safety. Then we watch the true aftermath, something new and misunderstood (as it still was up until recently), ptsd, crippling and preventing communication, cognitive thoughts, even ""reality"" itself.One of the absolutely crowning pieces of brilliance in this story is the inclusion of Walt Whitman in the capacity he served in the field hospitals around DC. Further, one is truthfully presented with ""just how things really were in these dirty ramshackle, amateur staffed ""death-houses"" where questionable treatments hourly added to the death toll.The characters here are beautiful, breathing people that one comes to feel deeply for as men and also for their situation(s) , for there is more than just ""recovering"" (if one actually did), questions regarding one's status and its consequences. For Summerfield it is a terrifying trial and ordeal.And afterward, the true aftermath, Summerfield's further recovery to re-adapt, and the final moment (for me) of a most brilliant touch that will surely hit you in the heart (especially guys) and perhaps even move you to tears. What a truly wonderful book this is from McFarland, a book that I would consider ""required reading"" in that if you miss this you have missed a truly fine reading experience...and a truly presented slice of the Civil War and how it affected many, unconsidered until recently just ""what the matter was with them"" and why recovery was at best questionable.""The New York Times"" has designated this wonderful book as one of the 50 best books of 2013 and I Agree Completely!-operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H54YS5B05HCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908348#wasThisHelpful","R3H54YS5B05HCS","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an avid reader, and my interests are all over the entire list of genres. Further, James Rollins has been a favorite of mine for a great many years. Thus, I was eager to receive and read this book. Rebecca Cantrell I am totally unfamiliar with, but see that she was a student of Rollins previously.With that being said, I first was a little disappointed before starting the book that it is part of a series, and while I am not one to ""jump into something like this (not from the very beginning of the tale(s))"", I did so as I have an obligation to review here.What I did like about the book:Very fast-paced and edge of your seat thrilling as all of Rollins' books are, so I was pleased from that aspect of it. Further, there are many aspects that really held my attention, as in the creation of the creatures that the villain (sorry, not into spoilers, so will leave the name out here) devises and constructs to protect himself and also threaten or kill his adversaries with. I found this very captivating and thoroughly chilling....a Very Nice Touch, for sure. There is a scene in Stockholm that takes place in the night in a fascinating Ice Sculpture Garden-Maze-Castle that captivated me also (throwbacks I guess to a Sherlock Holmes story not by Doyle, and also reminiscent of ""The Shining"", and in a different medium in one of the Harry Potter stories). This ""set-up"" or ""foil"" always grabs me and fuels my imagination...every time. Something back from my childhood or something maybe?What I did not care for here:First, I have been an early ""Christian"" religion enthusiast for a great many years. While I am not interested in ""organized"" religion as such, and seem to have or desire no affiliation to any modern church per se, I am always eager and hunger for more knowledge of Jesus's time itself, when he was here on Earth, and that of his direct followers before they were put to death by the powers from Rome because they would not profess as the Romans did and demanded they do (enough said, ok?). So, with the coming of Constantine, all interest in this subject simply ""stops"" for me.Ok, having given you this much information and how I feel about that, I now come to this book, and as I said (while I find much of it very interesting, fast paced, etc., I cannot bear to see Fantasy/Horror/etc. mixed up into a soup such as this one is here. Vampiric characters and ancient Seers, phantasmagoric happenings with animals, etc., is not a mix or combination that appeals to me at all....somehow I feel that religion and these dark creatures and beings from the night or depths just don't gel. I hated that aspect of the book and many times almost threw it across the room in anger. However, my obligation was to read and review it, so here I am doing my job.The two star rating:Because of the great parts of the book, I cannot give it any less than 2 stars, and in fact those parts actually rate higher award. But, because I was so totally thrown off (repulsed?) by the mixture of religion with the evil elements present here I cannot fairly give three as that is a rating of ""I Like It"" (and I didn't).I never deliver up spoilers (do NOT believe in destroying a potential reader's ability to enjoy something by doing that) and so I hope that I have not given away anything that will take away from someone's enjoyment. Also, though, I do hope that I have made a clear enough statement that clearly explains my dissatisfaction with this book.My views of course are just that, how I saw this book. You should perhaps also read other reviews here as most seem to think it is excellent...then you will probably be better able to make a decision as to whether or not you wish to read this. There are SO many other, truly great books out there to enjoy that this one seems unworthy in comparison.~operabruin","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU7R2O3Q336C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061991066#wasThisHelpful","RZU7R2O3Q336C","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure when I picked this knife out, but having experience with Coast's flashlights (excellent, indeed), I took a chance on it. When it arrived and I opened the (deluxe presentation-type box) and saw it I thought ""it's too big"". Not really. Although I have very small hands for a man, this seems to fit perfectly in my grip. It also is quite light, and I like that, too. The action is smooth and easy, again great for a small hand (a 66-year old one, too) and I have no problem with it fitting in my pocket (not sure which pockets others are complaining about here). The balance is great, so it feels right, and natural, in my hand.While I no longer do anything much in the woods and forests, I still have uses that this knife will be handy and just right for here around home, whether in the workshop or working with my craft projects.Others here talk about durability factors, but I see no reason this knife will not serve me just fine for many years.

Now that may not sound startling to you, but (this time) it has been in place since 2006.I was curious you see, when this product was offered for me to try, so I ordered it.After waiting a week, ""thinking about it"", you know, I just ""clippered"" it off (except the moustache), spent a few minutes as I looked at it asking ""why""?, and then lathered up this Nivea product, and ""shaved"".First word....""wow"".

"Suave has been around ""forever"" of course, and for good reason.I must say that I am ""death"" on any product that smells like perfume or ""flowers""......I don't know if most other guys feel this way or not, but I assume they probably might. Colognes, etc., anything with a ""fragrance"" turns me off for two reasons, one is that I am sensitive to these smells, and the second is that I just do not want to smell like I am ""prepared"" or whatever you want to call it.I wear NO scents at all, ever. I keep myself clean, naturally, but no longer feel a need to ""deodorize"" myself. Thus, when I find a product with a light, clean, next to nothing scent, I like it! This is one of those products.My hair responds well to it, sparkling white and clean, stays in place nicely without anything to hold it, and best of all, there is no ""perfume residue"" wafting from me after showering, etc. Further, my beard likes it too! Fluffy, again, sparkling white, shiny, staying in place with just a simple combing, and again, no breathing ""perfume residue"" all day either.It lathers really nicely, rinses out completely to a really nice ""squeak"", and it also comes in the ""landmark"" Suave ""easy for a man to hold"" container.Give it a try yourself, I bet you're happy with it too!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLASRXRL5RDZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTBZHCA#wasThisHelpful","RLASRXRL5RDZ1","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have sported ""fur"" on my face for the better part of the last 50 years. Mutton-chops, gottee, van dyke, full beard, moustache, stubble, etc., I have exhibited them all.Throughout all this I have naturally had to struggle with taming what manner of fur I was sporting at any given time. From brushes, combs, etc., and I must admit, some strange ""control"" products also (yuck). I also on a few occasions have owned a Beard Comb, although I have not used one in later years when my beard was halfway to my belt. Recently I decided to ""clean myself up"" so to speak, and shaved most of it off, beginning with stubble again, and now sport a carefully groomed short beard and moustache. When Vine offered this Baxter Beard Comb, I quickly ordered one.This, hands down, is the finest comb of any sort that I have owned in my entire life. I kid you not. It is heavyweight. Every tooth is polished to a smooth tip for comfort. I'm delighted.What can I say next? Well, I am about to order myself a whole collection of Baxter of California combs in various sizes!Good Product!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HOATU7I7E4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079K7IZE#wasThisHelpful","R29HOATU7I7E4U","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loving tuna as I do, I was quick to order this product when I saw it on offer here.Recently I had seen another brand similar to this in my local grocery and had tried that (although packed in water) but was eager when I saw this one to try one that was packed in olive oil.This has got to be the best can of tunafish that I have had in a very long while. (Remember when tuna was a ""solid"" round ""plug"" of sturdy meat?) Well, here you go, again, baby! Solid, clear tuna, in healthy-for-you olive oil, versus ""salt"" water....ugh! In these days of now living and trying to eat more healthily I eagerly come back to tuna in oil as it used to be in my childhood, before we were begun being fed a regular ""salt"" diet from food processors, etc.Flavorful! I tried a bit right out of the can first just to see just how good it might be. And It Was Good! So good, in fact, that I skipped mayonnaise altogether and just added chopped onion and celery and a dash of pepper. I even skipped making it into a sandwich and simply ate it right out of the bowl with some whole-wheat toast....spectacular. As plain as that!So, do I recommend you try this yourself? What do you think? Do you see the 5 stars above!?Another ""plus"" for this product also....13-cents from every can sold goes to support the World Wildlife Fund. It is Sustainably harvested, and supports marine conservation and improvement projects. How can one not feel good about that?!If I am unable to find this product in my local grocers, then I will just have to start a new thing for me, ordering staples from Amazon...I don't want to go back to that other tuna!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JGW7B503OQIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6A7UU6#wasThisHelpful","R3JGW7B503OQIJ","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How many ""scary"" books have we all read, huh? One person's ""scary"" is not necessarily anthers! But that said.....This is One Scary, heart-thumping, piece of work, from first time out Elizabeth Heiter! I am most eagerly awaiting her next book.Like myself, I bet you will not be able to put it down, and that you just may find yourself getting back up in the night in order to read further into this terrifying story.Evelyn Baine, like others before her, knows how to think like a serial killer, enabling her to get ""into the head"" of a stalker and killer. We are introduced to the ""Bakersville Burier"", killer of young women, who murders, rapes, horribly bruises (through some unknown process), carves them up, and then buries them in the woods up to their neck, leaving their heads and faces exposed....""why""?Evelyn has become a profiler for the FBI because of an incident from her childhood, an incident that has seemingly ""forever"" marked her, unable to recover. She has been assigned to this case, to figure out who this killer is and why and what he does to the victims, all young women. Carefully working the case, as she approaches her auto one evening, she feels a sting, becomes overtaken and blacks out, waking up to a scary situation, deadly situation, with terror like she has never even dreamed about before.Heiter leads us through a maze of eerie, breath-holding tension(s), attacks, further murders, past murders, leads and dead-ends until she brings us right up to that one last night, the night that we have known was coming all along since the beginning. Here we are, seemingly in the same space as Evelyn and this unknown person, capable of the most unspeakable acts and abuses imaginable. He's here, you can hear his breath, feel his presence...That's it, I will not deliver up a spoiler ever. I do not believe in that sort of thing. Why would anybody steal these scintillating terrifying moments from a prospective reader?As you can see, I highly recommend this truly scary book to you. It is just ""the best""....do get it and read it for yourself....if you dare!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVF4EXCEXQJKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778315843#wasThisHelpful","RVF4EXCEXQJKP","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From one who is really not too ""religious"", although I do consider myself Very Deeply Spiritual, and a believer in the Man Jesus.First, praises to Jay Parini for writing this most excellent text....it is so wonderful. I cannot imagine anybody not being engaged and moved by this beautiful 152 page dissertation regarding Jesus.Before I really begin, let me tell you that there will be further books from Parini in this ""Icons"" series covering, I believe, the Apostles, etc. Surely this series will become a great measuring-stick during our times, opening up the biographies of these men.After my statement above about not being religious, I mean, of course, ""steeped in dogma, etc., and rigid belief without question"". That does not make me a ""non-believer"" in Jesus himself, Jesus the Man. For those who wander outside church rigidity to read the words of the Buddha, Confucius, and others, one finds that the teachings of Jesus and these others follow nearly identically to a remarkable degree. I look at Jesus as a very great teacher, educator, and through his teachings, the world came out from the dark days of ""an eye for an eye"" etc, ""slay your enemies"", etc. to ""Love Everybody"" ""Treat them as you yourself wish to be done by"", etc.Parini presents Jesus to us without all the trappings that have been hung on him down through the ages, and shows us the human Jesus, what he said, what he stood for, how he lived by his words, and urged us to do so also. He also knew of course that his time was short (perhaps even much shorter than the Bible would have us believe) and he definitely knew that he would be put to death because of his teachings, teachings that would create great ripples through the traditional Jewish faith who controlled everything in his times, for fear of, and willingness to ""play it safe"" to the Roman authorities.He gives us logical, believable, explanations of events and things, enabling us to look ""under"" the ""magic"" or ""mumbo-jumbo"" if you will (I do not mean this in a mean-spirited way, folks, just as an expression). Everything, presumably, was perhaps pre-calculated by Jesus beforehand, or perhaps just as it was happening, and it all makes sense. The kind of sense that a brilliant teacher, educator, friend, etc., who wanted to take us and show us how to escape the many ""terrors"" (if you will) that humanity was under during those times. To free us up, to show us that we were worthy, we were honorable, etc. He taught us to be humble, honest, non-judgmental, and even to the point that we all do indeed bear our own cross in life until we are set free (in death) yet with unfailing belief.My words here may not be what you personally need to get you to pick up and read this book. Please, then, do not be put off by them. Read another's review here, maybe that will spur you. No matter. Whatever. But do, please, read this book. You will look at Jesus, again, with a new(er) set of eyes, see him perhaps in a slightly different light, but in a beautiful new way.Then, you, like I, will eagerly await the next volume in this wonderful new series.Thank you, Jay Parini, you have done all of us a great deed in presenting ""Jesus: The Human Face of God"" to us for our enlightenment and enjoyment.~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H804GONZPXCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054402589X#wasThisHelpful","R1H804GONZPXCS","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neil Swidey in this documentation of tragedy in the Deer Island Sewage Outfall Tunnel under Boston Harbor on July 12, 1999, takes rightful place in literary excellence giving us the bare-bones, unadorned story of this horrendous accident 9.5 miles out deep under Boston Harbor.His ""forward"" introductory tells us the situation that day as DJ, Tap, Hoss, Billy, and Tim worked out at the end of this completely black unlit hole under the harbor, with no fresh air, only their backup oxygen apparatuses and that ominous length of hose snaking from the Humvee back there in the dark leading to them. It was a recipe for tragedy and of course it Happened.We are ""hooked"" here at this point, 11 pages in.Flashing back six years, we are then presented with ""back-story"" on these men and how they came to be here in this situation under Boston Harbor that day. We (or at least I) have great interest and feeling for these men once we understand who they are, what they do, and the level of dedication and sheer mental-physical determination that it surely must take to do this sort of job for a living....I cannot imagine it, period! God Bless the Boys who do these jobs (like firemen, etc.) because the majority of us cannot even think about doing this....these guys? They get the job(s) done.We discover, as always, that ""powers that be"" through arrogance, willfulness, lack of concern perhaps, create horrendously grave circumstances through this ""negligence"" (shall we say), and repeated notations of problems make no difference and create no changes in approach to more safely getting the job done more safely. And so, ""Mr Everyday Average Guy"" becomes the victim of the errors that those in charge are responsible for.July 10th 1999, things go terribly unwell down in this ominously scary column so very far out and so deep under the Harbor. Nobody listens to their concerns, their fears. Tuesday, the 11th, things become even more scary to these brave men, but again no addressing the issues from the guys in charge. Wednesday, the 12th, back under again, hopelessly trying to get the plugs removed that will allow access between the tunnel and the volume of the Harbor so the waste can disperse out to sea, we get the final tragedy that now takes the lives of two experienced, brave deep sea divers, nearly claims the other three (less than seconds before it would have been to late, saved only by a ""chance"" happening), and the horrifying experience of desperately trying to get to help before it is too late. As always with this type of story, it IS to save two lives, and also to SAVE three others from debilitating injuries that they desperately struggle with. Three great added tragedies played out in the days and years after this ""Perfect Storm"" re-imagined and re-lived, but this time Under the Sea.I cannot recommend and urge you to read this wonderful book enough. It is a story that needed to be told. Needs to be read. Needs to be remembered as do these brave men (and those others who had died on the job on the tunnel before them, in the beginning stages of the tunnel).It is painful (tears frequently were running down my cheeks while reading), it is graphic (as was the tragedy that day for these men, I am sure), but it needed to be told, and Swidey has done a remarkable job in doing it. Generously annotated and full of information to clarify things for us (the average every-day person not familiar with this kind of work project, etc.), it is for me, one of the finest, interesting, and moving books that I have read in months.You are recommended to put this on your ""to read"" list!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IRNFGN4EOH35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307886727#wasThisHelpful","R1IRNFGN4EOH35","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In its third incarnation, Rose Myers' ""Graphic Designer's Guide to Portfolio Design"" gets better so I award it 4 stars.The very toughest thing that I ever had to do while in Computer Graphics Courses from 1997-98 and (advanced) 2001-2004 was attempting to create a portfolio of my work. There is no simple way to do this, and as every artist or designers style and output is different, so too I feel the portfolio should also beone size does not fit all which I believe you understand.There is much covered here in this 300 pages of text, studded with photos, illustrations, tips, advice, and comments from professional designers. It presents a great overall view of creating a gathering and ordering of ones work suitably for presentation to get professional results. Therein, to me, lies the largest part of the problemgetting through all this on your own. Not easy for a newbie, manageable for a designer of some experience. I honestly have not seen any perfect text for this that many can easily get through the first or second time around at it. (As I said above, personally, I found it the most difficult of jobs).Ideally, I would say that this book is good enough to be a textbook that would be the support of a physical course in portfolio design. Under the physical presentation of a skilled professor or graphic technician, this book becomes a strong support in learning to create the vehicle for presentation of your work.Chapters include:1, The Portfolio Process2, Planning Your Portfolio3, Traditional Portfolio: Resume, Cover Letter, and Business Card4, Traditional Portfolio: Design & Art Projects5, Digital Portfolio: CD-ROMs, DVDs, and Web Site(s)6, Digital Portfolio: Technical Elements7, Design Phase8, Working With Type9, Maneuvering Around Your Site: Navigation10, Web-Based Portfolio: Web Page Design11, Web-Based Portfolio: Technical Elements12, Multimedia & Your Interface13, Designer Checklists14, Using Social Media to Land a Great Job15, Taking Interviews & Presenting Your PortfolioAfter reading this TOC list, just try to imagine fitting all this onto 300 pages in a manner that the majority of folks could manage to get through easily and clearly understood. This is the Crux of my notations abovea go-between (professor or tutor) helps immeasurably for the majority of folks trying to weather their way through this in a manner that is easily understood and that they can maneuver through with a sense of confidence.Rose Myers has great knowledge, and gives much advice, showing numerous examples through illustrationsbut, as I said, I do not personally or professionally feel that one text can completely present this process. I recommend this book, but further I recommend or urge the prospective Portfolio Designer locate a class or a tutor to make this process bearable to get through without pulling out all your hair or chewing your nails down into the quick!Lastly, as with all Wiley publications that I have ever had exposure to, this volume is of excellent quality, from the dull-coated paper used for the text (no glare, important for someone staring for hours at printed pages), excellent solid perfect binding, and a durably heavy coated cover make this a text that should last the user a long time through use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R112R4FI8QRQVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118428145#wasThisHelpful","R112R4FI8QRQVD","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personal thoughts regarding seasonal music....Holiday albums, or Christmas music, however one chooses to refer to this seasonal genre is a strange piece of the musical spectrum. This music holds a very specific emotional, even familial, tie to the greater part of folks. The ""old"" songs seem to always hold sway over anything new that comes along. So, the old carols, chants, ancient-leaning instrumented, the Bing Crosby, Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Perry Como, Peggy Lee, etc., on and on recordings always trump newer efforts.Yet, it seems that every 8-10 years there is a new piece or song that strikes like a lightening-bolt and wakes us all up and grabs us by our heart, ears, and/or other pleasure-sensing organs, and we take this new piece into our collective ""loved"" seasonal music, sort of like binding a new chapter into a treasured old book of love.Silver Bells, Do You Hear What I Hear?, Christmas in Dixie, Little Drummer Boy, are examples of this. Occasionally, a real out-there entry takes hold also, like Feliz Navidad, or (lord help us all) Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer sidles in and takes a place amongst all the old treasures. Most, though, just get one season or less of airplay and then are lost to the great majority...they just cannot hold up to our favorites from years gone by. I attribute this mostly to the fact that the Holidays are so emotionally charged that the older always bring fond memories of loved ones now gone or still with us. The new has no connection to us like the old ones have.Review:I got a text from a cousin to go to the link she sent, taking me to youtube. What I was seeing and hearing literally sat me down with amazement. Great musicianship and talent will always get my undivided attention, but what I was not only witnessing that, but tremendous creativity, ingenuitive thinking, and an amazingly creative team effort, together to create and deliver up something so different, original, marvelous to see and listen to that I was nothing short of transfixed by it. This was what is the opening track on this album, a mind-boggling rendition of Angels We Have Heard on High. The ingenuity and creative talent to execute this amazingly complicated ""arrangement"" is breathtaking to watch. Ribbons of horsehair from a cello bow, pieces of paper, tapping with fingers and little hammers, etc., all need to be witnessed to appreciate what these 4 men are doing...hearing is wonderful, seeing it is mesmerizing.

"(First, an overview regarding these reviews here.)I am always amazed when a product receives review ratings all throughout the spectrum. In the case of Frances Mayes' memoir it certainly divides these numerous readers into clearly defined blocks.Some complain that it does not follow the movie! This, to me, is a thoroughly invalid point as the movie was made from the book and came much later, and is the item at fault for not following the book!Others state what a boring piece of crap this book is. Obviously they have never been involved with restoring a very old house (so cannot begin to understand what Mayes is relating) and especially the problems that must be overcome when that particular old house is halfway around the world, and further, the fact that one would be dealing with workmen who speak another language!In the case of one reviewer here, the reader believes she read a novel, so perhaps she thought what she was reading should have been exciting, glamorous, etc. Well, a memoir, by its very nature of course, is seldom those.*****My review,I had purchased this book some time ago and as is sometimes the case one thing leads to or away from intentions. In a recent move this past summer I un-buried this forgotten little book from ""someplace"" in unpacking and sat it on a stand near my bathtub. As I suffer from back problems and take warm soaks frequently, it was natural to spend those times with this book.First I would urge you to not be too much put off from reading this lovely book by those reviews that the reader found boring, artificial, etc. Of course, if you know nothing about restoration and renovation, etc., then you may not find this book as entertaining as someone who does. This book is Mayes' memoir of those years that she and her husband spent shuffling from their California home during semester and summer breaks from teaching at UCLA and the high hills of Tuscany to oversee and work on the historic old home they bought there and all the shared details of those efforts. Interspersed with these events and memories are those little excursions throughout the countryside and surrounding towns and villages and what they experienced and the people they acquainted there. (Many here I guess found this boring, sadly missing the point.) Coming from an earlier time, with different values perhaps, I found this book simply lovely, very fulfilling, and especially so for the little memories it pricked from back across my own past and experience. In many ways, I guess, it just happens that the things she relates here touched me personally which naturally created a richer experience for me in reading her efforts.Her prose is lovely, descriptive to the point that you can see and smell the dust, the foods as she walks past or perhaps into local restaurants or taverns. Or clearly allowing you to see or smell the flora and fauna of the surrounding hills and countryside, or literally ""putting you there"" with her and her husband as they snoop through antique shops or boutiques in search of furnishings, etc. Simply stated, this is an especially wonderful documentation of the times and efforts that Mayes, her husband and family and friends and new Italian acquaintances spent there on the hill renovating and putting their magnificent ""ancient"" Tuscan home back into it's former shape.The book is lovely, just lovely. I highly recommend it to you...it is very special and totally worth your time.You will also find many recipes enclosed within it's chapters, and not for nothing, food does, indeed create further interest and her sharing these points in time give you a sort of bit of personal time with her in that enormous old high-walled space she called kitchen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LQLV35LNWMNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811808424#wasThisHelpful","R1LQLV35LNWMNC","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without doubt, this is the single greatest addition to my large music collection that I have added in the last year (maybe longer).For some reason I am not remembering owning any Steinberg recordings years ago on LPs, yet knowing his reputation, I find that hard to believe. Yet, coming to this set, and listening for the past couple weeks or so, I do not recollect hearing these before either, so I come to write this review with totally ""new"" eyes and ears, if you will.Impressed? Yes, indeed, So! As I said to a friend regarding the Beethoven symphonies enclosed here, it was like hearing Beethoven (again) for the first time! Is this really possible? I do not rightly know, but I DO know that I return over and over again to listen to these pieces and am thoroughly struck and captivated by them under Steinberg's hand.Every entry on these 20 discs is thoroughly enjoyable and a special satisfying pleasure to listen to and I most heartily recommend that you add this set to your collection as these recordings stand out against nearly all others and give you a great look into this great interpreter of our musical giants that further enhances your enjoyment of their works, and also will bring you to love this man's genius for interpretation and insight, and make you ""wish for more""!Surely one of the finest additions you could wish to add to your collection.

"Normally, I go through the day with ""average"" or ""every-day"" items and find them usually satisfactory....it is just how I am and how I keep on my budget, so to speak.I selected this Baxter Badger Brush through the Vine program, and am SO pleased that I did!Over my many years I have used many shaving items from many genres, be they blades, electric, aerisol lather,  soaps, etc., and brushes. I have used many!What a beautiful item this brush is! It is sleek, neatly designed and shaped, and well balanced for holding and working with in your fingers. The bristles are soft, smooth, and flexible with just enough ""spring"" in them to create a great lather and work it over our face comfortably and smoothly. Luxurious? Yes, Indeed, it is, and it is wonderful to wake up in the morning and start the day with this beautiful luxurious shave brush...I leave my bath with a happy smile versus my previous ""sigh"" or somewhat underwhelmed and ""not closely enough cut"" feel of my face, knowing by noon I will look like I did not shave this morning. Not with this brush! It retains enough moisture to evenly spread and work the lather in and that helps a great deal, guys, as you know if you use a brush...nothing works like one, and this one is really fine, indeed. You will not be disappointed in the least, it is a totally well-worth-it investment--an investment in your face and how well you look every day.I would urge you to invest, additionally, in a truly good first-class soap to create your lather, and of course a brush/razor stand so that you leave your brush hanging vertically, extending its shape and useful life, and also its beauty. As I said, waking up and getting to use a luxury item first thing in the morning is wonderful and Does guarantee a smile on your face to begin your day with.As you can see here, I am not the only guy granting 5 *s to this fabulous shaving brush....order and enjoy!

"The ratings here don't lie, of course!Crystal Gayle....what to say! Hasn't it all already been said by many over and over throughout the music world? Talented, Beautiful Beyond Words, and, best of all, Low-Key....no razzle-dazzle ""big deal"" showmanship for her...truly a real class act for this woman!Just for the record, this is what wikipedia says about her: ""Crystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb on January 9, 1951) is an American country music singer best known for her 1977 country-pop hit, ""Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue"". An award-winning singer, she accumulated 20 number one country hit songs during the 1970s and 1980s (18 No. 1's on Billboard and 2 on Cashbox). Also famous for her nearly floor-length hair, she was voted one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world by People Magazine in 1983. She is the youngest sister (by 19 years) of singer Loretta Lynn and a distant cousin of singer Patty Loveless. Crystal Gayle has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, near Loretta Lynn's star.""Here we have Crystal's Christmas Album, ""A Crystal Christmas"", and as many others before me have stated, it is surely one of the very finest Seasonal Albums to come along in a Very Long Time.Also, as others before me have said, this is a Laserlight reissue of the original album (which I believe is now out of print), and it is far less expensive than ""collector's prices"", sounds just as good as the original release, just a minor re-arrangement of the song layout on the disc and the substitution of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" for ""Christmas In America"" which I would guess may involve copyright stuff.

"For those of you who are my age, or near it, you undoubtedly must remember the DixieBelles for their fun, raucous, thoroughly enjoyable toe-tapping songs full of humor.The 1960's were truly great years for memorable tunes, singers, and also groups that will carry on into the millennium ahead of us. For me, the 60's were where I discovered Bobby Darin, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Buck Owens, Brenda Lee, Connie Francis, The Supremes, Peggy Lee, Dean Martin, Joan Baez, The Beach Boys, Beatles, Kinks, Rolling Stones, etc., on and on with so very many more great artists and songs. The 70's, 80's, 90's, etc., of course, each had their ""new"" discoveries, etc., but somehow the 60's hold pride of place as my musical ""sweet-spot-in-time"".The Dixie Belles were an American girl group briefly popular in the early 1960s. Their best-known single, ""(Down At) Papa Joe's"", hit #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 late in 1963, and the follow-up, ""Southtown U.S.A."", hit #15 early in 1964. Both these songs were produced by Bill Justis, and released on Sound Stage 7 Records, a division of Monument Records under the directorship of Fred Foster (no relation, btw).On record (at least for their first single, ""(Down At) Papa Joe's""), The Dixie Belles were in fact all members of the all-white Anita Kerr Singers. However, an all-black touring group was assembled for publicity, promotion and live dates; this touring group may also have sung on some of the later recordings credited to the Dixie Belles.Based in Memphis, Tennessee, the Dixie Belles touring group had all previously sung backup in various capacities. Several members had been in The Tonettes, who recorded one single for the Stax Records subsidiary Volt in 1962.A full-length Dixie Belles album was released, but a third single (""New York Town"") failed to hit the Hot 100, peaking at just #119 on Billboard's ""Bubbling Under"" chart. Shortly thereafter, their contract with Sound Stage 7 ended and they never released another single.Several members of the touring group later turned up in The Charmels, a group that recorded four non-hit singles for Stax between 1966 and 1968.If you are ""hungry"" for some down-and-out rollicking FUN music, then by all means, take my advice and order yourself up a dose of the DixieBelles....you won't regret it!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YEO94CRBTW9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000938#wasThisHelpful","R2YEO94CRBTW9U","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right off the bat, I am a Devoted Coffee Drinker, probably I could be considered an addict!I just love it when Vine offers a product like this for us to try. Surely this is the finest and best way to get a good item like this great coffee the circulation and attention that it deserves, so that we may then ""safely"" order it and know we will be enjoying it.My personal favorite coffees are usually Sumatran, Kenyan, Ethiopian, Somalian, Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and Indonesian-Javanese grown beans. Occasionally, there is Kona, sometimes a Yukon blend. As most coffee lovers know, each of these are truly unique unto themselves, and each is always a welcome change that will bring a satisfied smile to your face...every time!This coffee is sure to please even the most demanding drinker. It is dark and rich, full-bodied with a mellow overtone to it. Smooth certainly would describe it also. It ranks right up there with the finest imported brands of beans.I grant it 5-stars easily--as it is that good. Would I order it regularly? You Bet! (and I will be ordering it frequently here....there is always something truly special when you get your mail, and it contains a pleasurable treat like this.)If you are a coffee drinker, I highly recommend this truly great Ethiopian to you.....you'll surely enjoy it!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLNIHP3ZRUUOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CFMTT6#wasThisHelpful","RLNIHP3ZRUUOP","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***First, (some personal thoughts and recollections) that day....November 22, 1963. It was one of those rare days that (unfortunately) get imprinted onto our cogitative memory like 9-11-2001, or myriad other things that for one reason or another we always remember. I have never forgotten that day, nor that moment, (having just returned from lunch with my high school sophomore classmates to Miss Curtis' homeroom and waiting to go to the first afternoon's class) when our principal, John Abbott, came over the intercom with the news from Dallas.  I do not believe that any of us actually thought what we were hearing was true. We were young, untouched by any kind of tragedy in our lives, and thus, it had some kind of unreality; difficult for us to absorb. I was left simply not knowing how to act, or react, to this news, and still remember that all I could muster was a smile (to my horror), but truthfully, I did not know how to act or react, nor what I really was feeling at that moment, trying to process something unimaginable to my young self. Much later I would learn that usually response to this sort of thing is either tears or a smile (or something like it) is quite normal. This was the United States, this just couldn't happen here. We were dismissed and I remember the walk home from school, through town, seeing people everywhere, all asking or declaring what had happened, or how, in Texas, so many, many, miles away, just an hour ago. And, then, of course, the uninterrupted broadcasts of never-ending coverage from the saddest possible news and images to scenes of unbelievably and outrage that were still playing out there in Dallas, Texas, throughout that sad weekend.Time, of course moves on, and with that time, things settle out, become sifted to their proper level of importance or memory to the times. It takes this time for history to sort itself out.***""Killing Kennedy"" review:Last year I bought ""Killing Lincoln"" as I have had a life-long interest in both the man and the Civil War and it's times. Of course, with a lifetime of prior readings and studies, I knew the story inside out (I thought). Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard certainly had to have done their homework very well and have produced one of the finest books I have ever had the pleasure to read about Lincoln and his times. It is a magnificent achievement, and if you have not read it, I heartily recommend it to you for your enlightenment. It moves in real-time and is so clearly written and articulated that you literally feel that you are ""there""....which I have never experienced before. That book can be found by clicking this link: Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination that Changed America ForeverAs I was finishing up ""Killing Lincoln"", I saw the announcement for ""Killing Kennedy"", and thus since it was relevant to my or ""our"" time, I pre-ordered it here and awaited its publication and release. Other life obligations prevented my reading it until about two weeks ago, but I must say it, also, is one of the finest-told (presented), in ""real-time"" again, ""endings of Camelot"" that I have read, and as with Lincoln/Civil War, I have read many about Kennedy, Cuban Invasion, Missile Crisis, Cold War, etc.Again, O'Reilly and Dugard have done incredible homework and worked diligently to piece together this riveting account, hour-by-hour, of the assassination there at Dealey Plaza that ""last"" sunny autumn day of the Kennedy presidency, and the shattering destruction of ""Camelot"" as we were just coming to know it. The back story is clear and concise, seemingly not too long, but neither short-ended with its presentation of relevant facts, etc. I was quite fascinated by revelations of JFK and Jackie's ""private life"" in the White House vs. their ""public life"" that we of course always knew about.Of course, we all know the story, (again, it seems), intimately from the ""over-and-over"" of all the intervening years and the countless ""theories"" that have come about. I greatly admired O'Reilly's avoidance of these theories, directly, in this presentation of this sad and tragic piece of American history. Mention of all those who have been accused over the years of having had a hand in this brutal killing, but O'Reilly leaves that information ""just there"", which I was pleased and impressed by.Details, yes, there are myriad details concerning many things that have not been exactly presented in the ""full light of day"" so to speak, and they speak much here in this fascinating account of Jack, Jackie, Bobby, even the rise of Teddy, and more; --revealing and personal insights into their lives, personal and public, shining new light onto and into their situation during JFK's ""reign"" as this country's chief executive.You will get insights into the introductory chapter(s) of the Viet Nam Conflict, the Mafia, Marilyn Monroe, the Lawford's, Onassis (and how he first came into the picture), Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Greta Garbo, Lyndon Baines Johnson, Adlai Stevenson, Lee Harvey and Marina Oswald, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the CIA, the Secret Service, and the police force there in Dallas that day. And, of course, the last character in this story, the strip-joint operator, Jack Ruby. There also are wonderful ""afterwards"" to all concerned characters here in this ""Saddest of Stories"".This, of course, has always been one of the biggest and so-called best stories of the past century, and O'Reilly and Dugard have magnificently re-told it here, enhanced greatly by details and information that we have not previously been exposed to before. Because of the news-coverage and the immediacy of the electronic age that was just coming into being, the notoriety and instantaneous presentation of events, both tragic, horrifying, and ceaselessly amazing to us, the people who either were there that day in person or were there because of television, it will long remain in the memory of the history of the citizens of the `60s and too, the history of this country and of it's leaders and the movement just out of sight of us as ordinary citizens.This surely is a ""must read"" book for every person in this country who lived during those days or who is interested in this country's history, both in and of itself, and also of it's leadership over the years. I cannot recommend Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard's magnificent presentation to us of ""The End of Camelot"" (as we knew it) highly enough. You are SURE to love this book!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVCPK77W9HS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805096663#wasThisHelpful","R1QVCPK77W9HS6","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A thoroughly enjoyable book for ""wanna-be"" writers and also just for the memoirs between Kidder & Todd over all their years together as writer & editor.I was taken in immediately with the winning description of ""The Atlantic's"" offices in 1972's Boston, and delightedly swept along through the friendship and working relationship between Tracy Kidder and Richard Todd through the intervening years. Educational and enlightening, solidly helpful to those seeking to perhaps become non-fiction writers (or fiction writers also, for that matter, as they offer good solid advice and examples), or just for the warm and fuzzy relationship of these two guys working together.A thoroughly enjoyable and very special book! I highly recommend it to anyone seeking writing advice, or those just looking for a warm remembrance between two friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164XGZKEZRN5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069750#wasThisHelpful","R164XGZKEZRN5V","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many here reviewing this chair mention how difficult it is to assemble...I had absolutely no problem with this, but I have assembled many pieces of furniture, and I guess one gets the hang of this sort of thing, like any ""learned experience"" so to speak. However, as with most of these items, I quickly switched to my own tools vs the wrench supplied to my advantage...you may wish to do likewise.Also questions regarding the durability of the ""leather""...this seems to have become the norm for this type chair. Have no fear, it is durable and I cannot imagine that it would not hold up through normal use. As for the strength of the plastic parts, I am 245# and have spent some time sitting, rolling, raising and lowering, etc., and I cannot imagine that even someone approaching 300# would have reason to worry.Over the years I have ""gone through"" several of these type chairs (and stools) and can honestly say that 4 out of five have been great...one with padded arms had them split from my resting my arms and elbows on them. All of the others served me well, usually 4-5 years of 8-10 hours a day. My last one is now 8 years old and is still solid, but the inner padding of the seat has finally gotten tired, and so I ordered this item as a replacement.This one is very comfortable, fits to and supports my back very well, rolls smoothly and just seems to fit my body better than most chairs that I have owned.I would easily recommend this chair to anyone for its comfort level, and its stability, my perceived sense of its lasting durability, and for its really good looks.

"I love it when someone can re-tell a piece of history that we all have lived with for 50 years and leave you thinking ""I wonder....."" ""What if.....""When was the last time you were drawn in completely and carried along by a story?.....Particularly an old story, endlessly investigated, theorized, wondered about, argued over, covered up, interfered with, etc., to the point where you come to not really believe anything is the truth. Stephen Hunter succeeds here with this book, and when it's all over, you get left to mull ""Hmmm, I wonder...""When this happens, the author has succeeded at his job and Hunter scores a big one, again, with this fascinating, incredible re-telling of the assassination that imprinted November 22, 1963 in all our minds the way 9/11 would mark us 38 years later. Well constructed, certainly researched and with enough ""believability"" to keep you glued to this story as Bob Lee Swagger struggles to figure it all out. ""What really happened at Dealy Plaza that day, and who was behind it""....the very same thing we all are still asking ourselves after all these years. We probably may never really know, but will forever keep asking ourselves.Stephen Hunter is a truly great storyteller. He and Dennis Lehane have entertained me a great many times with their exceptional works. Unless you just can't stand to hear or read another word about the JFK assassination, I highly recommend this book for your reading pleasure...it's fascinating, it's exciting, it's gonna make you go ""I wonder...""~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWY0FQCKZDUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145164020X#wasThisHelpful","R1YWY0FQCKZDUW","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Norma Deloris Egstrom.... from Jamestown, North Dakota...What a ride this great artist and lady had from destitution, abuse, neglect, etc., finally through association with Benny Goodman, emerging as Peggy Lee, and the world of music sat up and was changed forever.No matter what song, or genre, she dabbled in, she got right into the heart and soul of her subject and literally, completely, made the song her own. She was also a songwriter as well as an artist when she wasn't lighting up the stages or recording studios. Immortalized, surely, for her work on Disney's ""Lady & the Tramp"", unforgettable as the voices of the Siamese cats.Her lengthy time at Capitol, then Decca for a time, and back to Capitol, produced a seemingly endless stream of lovely truly ""hit"" albums. She was at the top of her game, always, teasing depth and meaning from everything she sang.In 1972, she decided to tackle ""pop"" if you will, a fair step away from her jazz, blues, swing, and torch-song norm. The result was this album, sadly under appreciated at the time of release, receiving little airplay, etc. It is, today, arguably her very finest album, and I agree with that rating. When it was released I fell completely under her spell all over again, and literally played my first lp to death.Sadly, it would be her last work with Capitol Records and her contract was ended, as so many others had happen to them (particularly Connie Francis), out of nowhere ""ka-boom"", you're all through, ""Goodbye"". She never regained her momentum, although she still recorded several really good albums for various labels, and of course she still toured and appeared frequently to the delight of her millions of devoted fans. Age, Time, and Illness finally prevented her from working which was a very sad thing, and then, God Bless her, she was gone from us, a great light gone out. The last time I felt that sad at the passing of a singer was when Nat King Cole passed away.Fortunately she was such an avid and active recording artist, and we are left with the hundreds (seemingly) of her beautiful albums...what a gift to us and all the world to enjoy!When Capitol was releasing their ""Two For"" cd issues, ""Norma Deloris.........."" was paired with her ""I'm a Woman"" album. I knew ahead of time by a year or so and eagerly awaited it's long desired release. Imagine my shock and unhappiness when I played it and found out that it ""Was Not"" the original album! Tracks that were out-takes or alternatives were substituted, leaving myself (and I am certain) all her fans heartbroken at this error. I have dearly wished for this misfortune to be corrected, and At Last, fortunately, it has happened with this corrected, completely remastered MP3 release here. I am not a ""download"" type guy, preferring to be able to physically hold, see, and read cd releases, and can only hope that Capitol will release this as such. It certainly will give me reason to re-purchase this album ""one-more-time"" because it is so very special, and so very wonderful.I hope I have not lost you with this lengthy review and narrative history. What I wish to say is that I am literally completely blown away by this ""restored"" reissue! I have never heard a remastering of any recording that has come up so chrystal-clear, so immediate, so very ""fresh"" that you would swear you were hearing Peggy Lee live, truly! I am not sure what has been done to the sound from the original masters, but this issue is, TRULY, a MUST-HAVE for anyone's collection.If you are not familiar with this album, order and download it, you will not be disappointed, in fact, you will hear Ms Lee as you have never heard her before! Those who are familiar with this album need to also order and download it...you, too, will be completely won over once again, and in beautifully remastered fidelity.Peggy Lee, Norma Deloris Egstrom, from Jamestown, North Dakota, her finest album, reconstructed, for us to once again enjoy...thank you, Capitol Records.~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R337DF8JT7UJI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EOH7DK#wasThisHelpful","R337DF8JT7UJI4","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album (origionally two seperate lp releases) houses my ""first"" Petrouchka and my ""second"" Le Sacre Du Printemps recordings.At the time of his Petrouchka, Boulez was setting New Yorkers back in their seats (when they weren't angrily dissing him) and afterwards here, he showed us just what the Cleveland could do under his direction. From the early to late '70's, just approaching his middle age in years and his coming of age in composition, he was the ""Bad Boy"" of classical both on the page and on the podium. New Yorkers eventually drove him away (what a shameful loss to themselves and music in general).Today, he has mellowed and tempered his interpretive delivery, and has slowed his concertizing and is concentrating again on composition. Some will probably say ""Oh God!"" while many will be saying ""At last!"" i am of the latter...but this extraneous material to this review, though relevant and informative.I was totally mesmerized and put under the spell of Stravinsky with this recording of Petrouchka, totally and endlessly fascinated with it. I have never heard another recording that can dull it or acceed to greater heights, as to ""replace it"" so to speak (and I have many on my shelves). Remastered, this edition reflects the dynamics of the original lp and is one of the greatest Stravinsky recording efforts ever done. Columbia's technicians and engineers were doing their best work here. Everything about this recording simply sparkles, dazzles, and crashes to display and reveal the greatness of Stravinsky to the fullest level.Le Sacre, again, knocked everything before it back a few notches. That said, I came to appreciate the work only after a great many listenings and years of trying(s) with many recordings. Eventually, Boulez and the Clevelanders finally clawed their way to the light and this work became epitomized with/by this recording. Again, the fidelity of this remaster surpasses the first cd release and is truer to how I remember the lp release.As another side note, I find Boulez's later DG recording of these works very interesting to listen to, showing us his later, truly mature thoughts about them very enlightening indeed. However, these earlier Columbia efforts are the ones you want ""first""!My most urgent recommendation to anyone, either looking to become acquainted with these works, or seeking great readings of them, would be to not hesitate...they are both stellar and uniquely, unforgettably, top-drawer all the way around. They belong in every Stravinsky fan's collection, too good to miss!What could be better? Well...one could wish for a SACD remastering of them, couldn't he or she. Let's hope it happens!~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YC7MYH8ASB4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002A2M#wasThisHelpful","R2YC7MYH8ASB4S","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The by-line on the reverse of the case reads ""Spiritual & Traditional Christmas Celebrations from the Famous Mountain Regions in Austria"" these few words alone should be tweaking your desire to hear for yourself, I would think!Twenty-four of the most delightfully played seasonal pieces are captured here for one's listening pleasure, each like a sparkling diamond lying on snow, as so often seen by us when the sun shines on last night's new flakes. From simple harpsichord, small string numbers, flutes and whistles, accordians, solo or small-group vocals accompanied by simple instruments, etc., one truly feels the delightful simple pleasure that citizens from this beautiful area deliver and also receive in the pleasure of playing these lovely gems. I have never known anyone who does not receive the greatest pleasure and enjoyment from small intimately delivered secular tunes and melodies.The entirety of this album is filled with richly fulfilling music that will become not only a ""seasonal delight"", but for many, I bet, a frequently-played album throughout the year.Others here before me feel the same way as I do, eagerly urging you to add this delightful collection of songs and tunes to your personal library.~operabruin","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QX8N7IXSTF0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001VDA#wasThisHelpful","R1QX8N7IXSTF0D","ASLHDTUUMOH7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLHDTUUMOH7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Upon receipt, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the cheap plastic tray.  I never expected it to be such a flimsy product, especially since I'm big on using Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it's not going to last too long.  The clips from the chain were pretty difficult to snap on, I didn't think the plastic would survive the snap, but all 3 did.I waited until the Orioles showed up and immediately put this feeder out.  That was 2 weeks ago.  I filled the container half way, to test the waters, and hung the feeder from a shady tree.  I have plenty of birds in my yard; woodpeckers, cardinals, titmouse, nuthatches, chickadees, sparrows, robins, orioles, hummingbirds, starlings, goldfinches, mockingbirds, on a daily basis.  I have a suet feeder on a pole, that I now fill with seed cakes, that is the current favorite by all above mentioned birds.  For 2 weeks, I sporadically checked this feeder.  I had never seen one bird visit.  I had noticed the jelly dropping from the 3 drain holes in the orange plastic tray.  The ants were thankful for that.  I went out on the deck last night and heard unusual noise; sure enough, the local gimpy raccoon (has a bum leg) was tossing & turning the feeder.

"I've done so much damage to my skin, since I was young & stupid in the 80s, not caring at the time about using sunscreen, just wanting that fast color.  Now that I've learned my lesson, and have the pale skin to prove it, I really wanted that little hint of color, without doing further damage.  This lotion is really a good product.  I'm sensitive to smells, and this Suave doesn't bother me like lots of other self tanners and/or lotions.  I used it sparingly for a few days, and noticed a gradual hint of color.  No streaking, no Jersey Shore cast orange, just a nice, subtle glow.  As gardening season is upon us, I'll definitely be using this to enhance any color I might get from being outside.

"I'm torn about this Flantern.  As compared to my Rayovac Sportsman LED Lantern (SE3DLN), the weight alone makes it more desirable.  I'm not a fan of LED lighting in general, I'm going to use the Rayovac, which is easier on my eyes.  It's been especially useful as a flashlight lately, since I'm using it to look out on the deck at night for a stray cat that's been visiting.  The range is much nicer than some of my current flashlights, and very bright.  I'm not fond of the position of the on/off button when using the flashlight; it's annoying to have to find the button.  On a regular flashlight, it's generally right there for your thumb to find, not on this.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to use and charge the flashlight, but an insert of some sort describing the product, would have been nice.It's a nice device to have handy in case of a brief power outage.

"Having been a fan of T-fal (cookware) for about 20 years, I was anxious to try this popper.The stainless finish is attractive.  The popper itself is rather low, much lower than my Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper, White.  I did like that this T-fal has an on/off switch, which the Presto PopLite doesn't.  The measuring cup is ""built in"" to the top of the domed lid.  The one thing I didn't like about this popper is that while it's popping, it shoots rather fast/hard into the bowl.  Many popped & unpopped kernels ended up bouncing out of the bowl and onto the kitchen counter.  I never had this happen with the Presto.Once done, there were only a few unpopped kernels left in the unit itself, but way to many in the bowl, along with the bunch that were launched out of the bowl during popping.  The removable dome was ridiculously hot, even after a few minutes, but this works extremely well for the melted butter, much better then the Presto PopLite.Combined, Presto's height & popping capabilities along with T-fal's look & on/off switch would make one heck of a popper.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLF64F2VPMJPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FB4UPFK#wasThisHelpful","RLF64F2VPMJPM","A1RFZGWX46N8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFZGWX46N8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't wait to get this on my new Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX, since the device itself it so thin and fragile.  I inspected the case, only to find out that I had no idea on how to open it.  The instructions that came with the Otterbox are a waste of paper.  Thankfully, there's a online instructional video on Otterbox, probably because of all the complaints.[...]  (((My link to the OtterBox instructional video on the OtterBox website was removed by Amazon, so you'll have to search yourself, sigh.)))Once viewed, it was a breeze to open, insert the Kindle, and get it all closed up.  Everything snapped in place nicely.The case itself is rather heavy, imo.  But, it adds a sense of durable protection.  The on/off button on the back of the Kindle is a rather odd place to put the button, but Otterbox seems to handle that obstacle pretty well.  Sometimes the depressed button will not turn the Kindle on or off, and it takes a bit more exertion to get it to work. The screen protector plastic works fine with the touch screen and hasn't been the least bit quirky.  Both my Kindle screen and Otterbox protector plastic were prefectly dry & clean when assembled, but when the screen is dark, I see a few swirls here and there, but not enough of a bother to make me disassemble it. The Kindle charges fine with the case on; there is no interference with the cable and the case, unlike other devices.I applaud Amazon for making the Kindle so thin, but I like a device with some bulk to it, so I that I don't think it's so fragile.With this case on, it feels sturdy and protected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QLLI7YTO1YFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZTJKI#wasThisHelpful","R2QLLI7YTO1YFQ","A1RFZGWX46N8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFZGWX46N8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I really like the taste of the orange ones (kind of orangy peachy) and the red (berry/cherry?) are just alright. A definite plus is that it is stated that they have 'no artificial flavor, no preservatives, no milk, no lactose, no soy, no gluten, no wheat, no yeast, no fish, while my other gummies are made in a facility that creates products with most of those ingredients.

"I'm not going to blow out any windows with this speaker, but as far as compact speakers sound, this one is pretty good.Right out of the box, I plugged it into the wall adapter via the supplied USB cable.  I turned the speaker on and a tiny blue light flickered.  I was able to pair my lousy LG Extravert phone up to it without any problems.  I was able to play whatever music I had on my SD card.  It sounded okay, better than some other compact speakers I had tried in the past.  I brought it outside to see how it would work while I'm out and about in the yard.  Placing the speaker on my deck, I began to walk away.  After about 30 feet, it started cutting out and getting choppy and continued throughout my brief walk to about 60 feet, where it got so choppy that I turned to walk back to it.  I placed my phone 40' away (yes, I measured it with the tape measure), then went over to the speaker and dialed my phone from the landline.  The music indeed stopped and gave a series of chimes that alerted me the phone was ringing.  Although the product booklet states that I would hear my phone's ringtone, I did not. I was able to answer my phone from the speaker by hitting the Play/Pause button.  There was an annoying echo, but that could've been because I had the phones & speaker so close to each other.I let my daughter borrow it while her & a friend were goofing around on the laptop, since they were listening to their music.  The music sounded substantially better through this speaker, using the supplied 3.5mm jack.I went back outside and attached it to my Sansa Clip MP3 player, using the 3.5mm jack, and it sounded great.  Same music that was on my phone, but sounded MUCH better coming from the MP3 player.

"I jumped at the chance to try and test this smaller camera bag.  It's a little bigger than I expected.I'm not particularly thrilled with the odd angles of the zippered side compartments.  If something small, like an SD card or battery gets into the lower corner away from the zipper, you really need to dig & push to get down there.  A half zipper going from left to right instead of bottom to top might be more functional, but that's my personal preference.My first choice for this camera bag is for my GoPro and it's accessories.  One side pouch contains quick-clip and an additional mount.  The other has an extra battery and car charger.  The main compartment contains the camera (in it's housing & mount), the battery charger, and the usb cord.  There's still room to spare.  I could easily fit the few other clips & mounts that I have for it.Another older camera I have is a Fuji Finepix 3800.  I put my Sanyo Eneloop battery charger at the bottom and the camera on top of it, and extra batteries in both side pouches.  Perfect fit.2 more of my larger cameras fit into this bag, the Kodak Easyshare Z5010 and the Sony DSC-H200, both with room to spare.  The bag is way to large for the smaller cameras, like the Sony DSC-HX30V, or any pocket cams, although it would fit quite a few pocket cams.The reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 4 was because of the lack of padding, on all sides, especially the bottom.  With the snug fit of the Fuji and charger, I think it would be safe to assume that a fall from just a few feet onto concrete might produce some damage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NX2XMO0Z95FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHT6CRC#wasThisHelpful","R1NX2XMO0Z95FT","A1RFZGWX46N8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFZGWX46N8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:46 MinsI jumped at the chance to try this camera via the Vine Program, to use for snow sports (skiing, snowmobiling).  Since it's not the season yet, I am testing it as a dash cam.  I initially mounted the first flat adhesive mount onto my dashboard, directly in front of the steering wheel.  Considering this camera is a wide screen, it just didn't work as planned.  After a few days, I used a hair dryer, I heated the mount, and after a few minutes, it easily removed from the dashboard without leaving any marks, stains, or residues.  I mounted another just in front of my cd drive, which is centered and at the top of the dashboard (2014 Ford Escape), and it does not interfere with putting in or removing a cd.  Much better; I now get almost the entire windshield view, but unfortunately, part of the dashboard as well.  Tilting the camera upright helps a bit, but makes for an odd video.  I tried to eliminate that by purchasing the GoPro Helmet Front Mount, but the video was extremely shaky & noisy, moreso than with using the standard mount that came with the camera.The menu is kind of confusing for a newbie, but after time, it's easy enough to figure out.  The still shots I did manage to take while driving, were pretty clear and nothing seemed out of focus.  But although I pressed the button quite a bit, it only managed to take a few shots, much less than I thought I took.  At one point, I kept pressing the button, only to have one jpg show up on the card.  The housing itself it kind of hard to open; I managed to break a few nails, but with time, I got the hang of it, even managing to snap it off, but eventually got it back on.  The seal seems tight, after about 20 openings/closings of the case.  I tested it the hot tub, and it was indeed watertight.  The daylight video itself was surprisingly grainy, something definitely not expected.Right off the bat, I installed at 16gb SD card, but that quickly filled up, after what seemed to be only a small amount of time.  So I purchased SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A), and haven't had it fill up, but then again, I'm pretty good about offloading & freeing up space.  A long trip would require multiple cards for sure.I also purchased Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for GoPro HD HERO3, HERO3+ and GoPro AHDBT-201, AHDBT-301, AHDBT-302, since the battery definitely needs recharging after a few hours.  The original battery that came with the camera didn't initially fit, but after some shoving, it fit & charged.  The replacement battery fits inside the camera perfectly.The one major issue I have is that I wish it had a LCD viewer on the back of the camera.  Whether using it as a dash cam or snorkeling, I'd like to see that I'm at least pointing it in the right direction, and not too high or too low or at an off centered angle.It takes a nice video and the coloring is beautiful, but I look forward to testing it out on the slopes.  I'm not sure what type of mount I will go with, most likely a chest harness, since I don't wear a helmet.EDIT:  Another small thing that bothers me is why it doesn't have a tripod mount built directly into the bottom of the camera?  Yes, I know there's an additional mount (GoPro Tripod Mount) that can be purchased that can be used when using the case, but what if you just want to use the standalone camera without the case?  It certainly couldn't have hurt to put one on the camera itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBMV2D5L8UEBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3F0EIU#wasThisHelpful","RBMV2D5L8UEBC","A1RFZGWX46N8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFZGWX46N8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a big water drinker, so I jumped at the chance to try this additive.  I've been a fan of the Mio Fruit Punch (the only flavor from the line that I can tolerate) for quite some time now, but it's still not enough to get me to drink more.  I had high hopes for this, upon opening the envelope (it smelled sweet & fruity), but it kind of reminds me of Alka Seltzer.  It's rather foamy/fizzy while shaking, but did seem to dissolve rather quickly.  Adding it to 12oz of water (as instructed), I simply couldn't drink it.  It has a nasty initial taste, almost like that uncoated aspirin that sticks at the back of your throat.  I added another 4oz back to the bottle (it was initially a 16.9oz), but it is still undrinkable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CORGCE000WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJUHAW2#wasThisHelpful","R13CORGCE000WF","A1RFZGWX46N8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RFZGWX46N8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like a few other posters, I purchased this to raise Black Swallowtail caterpillars/butterflies.  I have a large deck railing planter that I filled with parsley.  Towards the end of the growing season, I had a butterfly leave me a bunch of eggs.  Having an excessive parasite problem this year in my current screened in butterfly cage (to many holes/gaps), I needed something large & enclosed in a pinch.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I laid the hamper on its side and slid the planter(s) in, and it's PERFECT.  I ordered 3 in all, so that next year, I have a few habitats handy, which may just replace my cage.  I might just need a few more ;)EDIT:  I now have 6 of these hampers, and they're perfect if you have the space and area outside to use them to rear caterpillars/butterflies.

"As a side sleeper, I prefer a softer mattress, but the memory foam and the cooling action gel in this mattress definitely helps.  The cooling action gel foam makes it sound as if the mattress will be cool to the touch, but that is not the case.  Rather, there is a less of a heat build up as your body lays in one spot.  You can test this out by lying in one spot for several minutes and then move off the spot so that you can feel the how hot heat signature is left behind.  In the case of this mattress, it was very slight.  This reduction of a hot spot is one of the five key points of being an official NSF mattress.  Read the Amazon product description for all five of the key points.  Another NSF key point worth mentioning is for the mattress to minimizes impact from partner movement, and I can confirm that this feature is implemented very well in the Northlight mattress.The mattress is constructed with high quality although I had a lot of loose threads on mine.  No biggie but it did surprise me for this price point.  The mattress also has some really nice side handles that are more firmly secure than traditional mattresses.  Backed by a 10 year warranty and the official mattress of NSF, this mattress should do you well if you take care of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MEQ5FK6NT2T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO0RRBY#wasThisHelpful","R1MEQ5FK6NT2T5","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably the lightest and most compact air pad I've ever used.  As a side sleeper, I was skeptical at first that there would be enough padding.  When fully inflated, however, I felt comfortable.  Rocks and uneven ground might be a little more noticeable compared to a thicker pad, so scout out a good camping spot.  I am also considering taking this bag to the office for power naps and since I can easily lock it in a cabinet.The material seems very strong but I've had other air pads leak over time -- even indoor air pads.  These general occur at the seams.  Conveniently included in the carrying bag is a repair kit.  The sleeping bag and repair kit do not come with paper instructions but most people will be able to figure it out.

"Nice glove that works as advertised.  The concept is the same as the Ove Glove Oven Mitt, and use can use this glove for the oven too.  Keep in mind that although this glove does reduce the heat, it does not eliminate it.  So for a really hot grill, such as running on high heat, you may be able to keep your hand there for 10-15 seconds instead of say 2-4 seconds.  Where the glove excels is more at normal cooking temperatures.I'm 6'3 and this gloves fits me fine, note, so it may be a little big for someone with very small hands.  I also think that the black color is a good idea as it hides normal grilling grime.  Anyone that has a white Ove Glove knows how quickly it can show grime.Finally, I want to mention price.  If you look at one of the top competitors, the Pitt Mitt, it runs about $5 cheaper and is slightly longer protecting more of your wrist area.  In my own informal heat test, both the Pitt Mitt and the Grill Gauntlet performed the same in terms of heat resistance.  Since I recommend getting two gloves, one for each hand, at this time I'd recommend the Pitt Mitt instead since it is more affordable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R648VFS0ILBEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0L5NLM#wasThisHelpful","R648VFS0ILBEE","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He worries about people dying, for example.

"A book full of award-winning recipes with most having a gorgeous picture next to them.  Most if not all of these recipes use ingredients you can find at your local grocery store, thankfully.Only about 20 pages of this 192 page book focus on grilling techniques and tips.  However there are a few tips also in some of the recipes.  I was hoping for more tips and tricks to be honest.  A good example is that the author goes into detail about the Minion method, but a few pictures could have helped out a lot.  Another small gripe is the the book uses a too small of a font.  On the plus side, the book uses study paper and the binding seems solid.  I don't anticipate this book falling apart in the kitchen or around the grill.Although I wish this book had more secrets and tips, the recipes seem to make up for this.

Obviously this item is for someone who is going to process a lot such as someone who has a citrus/apple tree or who makes a lot of french fries.  Sadly, instead of doing any one task excellent, it simply does all three average.  For citrus, it doesn't get as much juice as it should.  For apples and potatoes, it struggles with larger variants.

"Quality product here.  All the plastic parts are strong, thick molding including the belt clip.  The belt clip does seem to rotate but it takes a lot of torque to do so.Operation is simple -- slide your thumb or finger under the flap and push.  Some sprays make you rotate a lever or do some intermediate step, but this Sabre professional sized model is really a one-step operation.  This is important because when you are under stress, you can't always operate something slightly complicated.I tested this outdoors.  Indeed, the orange liquid shot to 15 feet.  Another reviewer claimed 20ft but for me that would have required arching it higher.  By time the liquid hits 15 feet, it is well spread out.  Upon smelling the liquid up close, it wasn't strong at all to my senses.  I've seen cases where someone accidentally deployed mace, and in those cases, I could definitely smell a strong odor.  Maybe it is a plus that it doesn't emit a strong odor but rather does the pain upon direct contact?  For this test, I didn't apply it to directly to my body.  My furry animals though could definitely smell the liquid and backed away when I put them near it.  I'll trust other reviewers who claim this burns on humans rather painfully upon contact.This review is for the professional size.  This size is not really intended for pockets or keychains.  Sabre does offer a smaller model.  The negative of the smaller model is that it holds less liquid, shoots only up to 12 feet, and has a slightly more complex operation (but if you dry-fire practice, you'll get good at it in no time).  It'll probably come down to personal style.  Do you like items fasten to your belt/pants/shorts or do you prefer stuff in pockets/key chains?  Both sizes get the job done.Also, the product says not to use on humans.  For me personally, as a backup, if a human is physically threatening me or putting me in an uncomfortable position, I have every right to use this product to defend myself.  If I am wrong, then we'll let the courts settle the matter (if it gets that far) later in a more calm environment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5TOWJ77GI4O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AU6J68Q#wasThisHelpful","R5TOWJ77GI4O3","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use ear plugs/filters to reduce noise at the office as well as when I go shooting so I've tried various brands and solutions over the years.  (And just to be clear, these are not recommended for shooting although they might be an option for .22 caliber that produces about 130 decibels.)These ear filters advertise a 12 decibel reduction which may not sound like a lot, but it actually is when you consider that the decibel scale uses a logarithmic unit.  In other words, 90dB is 10 times louder than 80dB rather than just +10 louder.  So you are getting at least a 10x reduction in audio with these DUBS filters.These filters pop right into my ear with little fuss unlike foam ear plugs.  Of course, everyone has slightly different shaped ears so the fit might slightly vary but based on the numerous reviews here, this fits the vast majority very well.  After wearing these for more than an hour, you might notice slight discomfort but this is really true with every in-the-ear item I've ever worn.  The DUBS filter has some of the least discomfort I've felt in such products so that is good news.  Eventually you just get used to these being in your ear and somewhat forget they are there.Although these can be used at concerts, if you are an audiophile, you may be disappointed in how they do strip away some of the richness of the music.  It's a slight muffling or distortion however vocal are still very crisp and you can still easily have a conversation with these.  I should note that I'd rather have some slight muffling then to having ringing in my ear after the concert.For the record, I tested these with my audio system blasting various genres of tunes (concert simulator).  I also tested this in conversations, with an extremely loud alarm system, and just every day life.PROs=====+ Easily slide into ear with snug fit+ Comfortable+ Vocal audio still clear and crisp+ Nice carrying box+ Doesn't require a batteryCONs=====+ Strips the richness out of musicOverall, I highly recommend these for anywhere you want a general noise reduction but still want to communicate with people or hear various sounds.  To be clear, they won't do magic like selectively eliminating barking dogs or deliver perfectly volume-reduced concert music.  But they will lower the general volume around you with only slight muffling (i.e., not sounding like you are in a tin can).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FBHO4KJN98UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW1IZ5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3FBHO4KJN98UM","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't see many Black & Decker coffee makers these days despite all the sales they do on Amazon, but I do remember several years ago of having an excellent coffee maker from them.  Across the board, their coffee makers are averaging 4+ stars on Amazon.  It's nice to be reminded that they are indeed a force in the coffee maker market.This unit uses a basket style filter (not a cone), and has many of the features you expect for this price range.  Namely, brew strength selector, water window, digital controls, programmable, and auto shut off.  Some notable features it has that you may not find on many other makers is 1-4 cup brew option, even stream shower head, wide-mouth carafe (for easy cleaning), and a display for the amount of time since the coffee was brewed.  Most importantly, though, is the included carafe.  We really like to keep our coffee hot, and with traditional glass coffee pots, we ultimately ended up having to pour the coffee into a carafe anyway.  Now, we can skip that step.The coffee maker has excellent usability, intuitive icons, and easy to use.  The display does not light up however but there is a nice light when the program is set.  The Sneak-A-Cup feature is also very slick as you can pour yourself a cup during brewing.This coffee maker is perfect for those who want less clutter in their kitchen by not needing an extra carafe.  It is also perfect for those who like to keep it simple.  One downside though of the carafe is that you can't brew another pot until you finish the existing pot.  By having an extra carafe, you can pour the pot out and then start another one.  So for households with multiple people that drink a lot of coffee, this maker may not be the best choice unless you buy a separate carafe.  Finally, the maker comes with a 2 year limited warranty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A1S0CZ3K9GRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I3V0#wasThisHelpful","R2A1S0CZ3K9GRM","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Offered in three different colors, the Allen Sports JTX-1 is an excellent child jogger or trailer.  The shocks and smooth tires make for a pleasant ride.  The product description says this is a 2-in-1, but I haven't tried the trailer option (no do I plan to).  I only have interest in the jogging option or the stroller option.  Note that there is an option for a front two wheel stroller accessory but I find the front one-wheel included feature perfect for my needs.There are a lot of conveniences as well with the JTX-1: foot brake, front wheel lock (so that it doesn't swivel), push button rear wheel release, three season cover, padded handle, etc.  It would be nice if the cover offered UV protection or if there was a netted version for warmer weather.  For some southern states, our morning temps can get warm quick (but still safe for the baby) so it would be nice to have air and sun protection.I would have like to have seen more storage space for when in stroller mode.  You've seen how big baby bags can be, so it would be nice to be able to hold as much as that.  I know this is primary for jogging, but I love dual purpose items especially for an expensive item like this.Finally, this product is so new that you won't find a product video or manual on the Allen web page.

"This mouse is highly configurable but in a very easy way as it comes with very intuitive software.On the hardware side, it is very light weight and feels great in the hand.  The cable is a braid, soft material that bends easier than your typical mouse cable and is very resistant to tangles.  Some velcro is included to bundle up the cord when transporting.  The multiple lights on the mouse look slick, and each can be configured to a different color.As for configuring/programming the mouse, the amount of options is staggering.  For starters, you can create different profiles that can easily be switched to and from.  You can also setup macros that it will save.  The macros can include all sorts of traits such as delays, keystrokes, clicks, light color changes, application launches, etc.The DPI is adjustable of course.  And there is a slick option known as ""sniper"" mode where you can toggle less sensitivity for those sniper moments.If all of this sounds complicated, it's not.  That's a credit to Corsair with their software.  To see the software in action, check out the tutorials on their web site or YouTube by Googling the following keywords: Corsair Gaming SABREAnd although this mouse is designed for gaming, if you run non-gaming software that involves repetitive key/mouse actions, consider this mouse an option to make your life easier.Finally, this doesn't work well with Mac and Linux.  It's a Windows mouse -- but maybe someday they'll expand support","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WO6NRJC31B65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHJYXO4#wasThisHelpful","R2WO6NRJC31B65","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simple and affordable, this is a budget level food processor.  The container is made of plastic, and it does feel a bit cheap in construction but will likely give you a few years if you take good care of it.  Contains a course/chopping blade plus another dual purpose blade that does grating and slicing.  The dual purpose blade requires you to flip it to alternate between its two modes.Instruction manual is very clear and simple.  It also have a nice trouble shooting section.  I'm new to food processors, so the tips on refrigerating cheese and water-heavy vegetables for 30 minutes beforehand to stiffen them up for the processor was appreciated.  For soft cheeses, it recommends putting them in the freezer for 30 minutes.  Simple tips that I may have not thought of on my own.We are still playing with our processor.  We had a few times where we had to stop the unit and move some of the food around to get it to chop right.  We'll experiment a little more to figure out what we are doing wrong.  Overall though it has done a very good job on many of the recipes we've tried.  We'll update this review as we use it more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZJ0LINW8RKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHLN7K2#wasThisHelpful","R1QZJ0LINW8RKR","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my taste buds, almost all top brand coconut water tastes good to me.  I did try a side by side taste test with C2O vs Zico (bought from Costco).  The C2O has a slightly sweeter taste, and thus is was no surprise that C2O has 12g of sugar per serving (8oz) compared to Zico's 9g per serving (8oz).  But this can vary -- looking at the Zico on Amazon, it has a serving size of 11.2 ounces with 14g.  Doing that math, that means Amazon's Zico has 10g per serving (8oz).  The amount different is so small that I don't really think about it.  I just buy a reputable brand that is on sale or the cheapest.  If you want a slightly sweeter taste, get C2O over Zico.I do recommend the pure coconut versions over any that have a mixture of fruit in it (i.e., pineapple + coconut). The other fruits overpower the light coconut flavor in my opinion. I also prefer cans over the paper cartons as I like that sturdy feel. I took a star off this review since I think the current price is a tad high.Also, the shipping box used for these was packaged incredibly well.  Thick cardboard separated each can protecting it from dents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29RJ0R2J4ZG2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM9HN0#wasThisHelpful","R29RJ0R2J4ZG2P","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most badminton sets are ""portable"" if you do not mind setting up the stakes and have soft ground available.  Setting up a conventional badminton set at the park can take about 5-7 minutes with stakes.  The Zume set can be setup in two minutes -- so just a little time saved.  So really, this Zume set is more convenient for playing on hard surfaces or for cases where no adults are available to setup the net.  And the down side is a less stable net and a less official net.The plastic poles feel cheap and susceptible to bending the first time someone crashes into them.  The racquets also feel cheap and likely to bend/break if accidentally striking the ground or concrete.  Still, the cleverness of the set is impressive.  It is recommended to put a heavy item, perhaps a rock, into the base to weigh it down a little.  Overall the set feels more like it should be priced at $40 rather than $60 at the time of this review.Some of the reviewers have complained that the net is not wide enough.  When setup, it measures roughly 138 inches wide or 11'6"".  Regulation is 20 ft for comparison.  This net is for casual fun and not for a official badminton tournament so don't get caught up too much on regulation width.So, buy this set if you don't have soft ground, want children to be able to set it up, playing in compact areas, or only play badminton casually.  I DO NOT recommend this set if you have competitive boys who crash into things as they will likely accidentally destroy this net and the racquets.  There are more rugged options out there -- and yes, they will involved stakes.  Plus a more traditional net is taller reducing the chances that someone will debate you whether the birdie went over or under the net.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4EKDRR0KRATO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFY9EYU#wasThisHelpful","R4EKDRR0KRATO","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a bare bones digital scale that gets the job done.  If you don't need all those other measurements such as BMI, body fat, bone mass, etc., then this Taylor scale should be considered.Just stand on the scale and it automatically comes on.  That sounds obvious but a few years ago several digital scales required you to tap the scale first before standing on it which I found annoying.  Once you step off the scale, after a few seconds the scale with automatically shut off meaning it is likely going to be a few years before you have to replace the batteries.Speaking of batteries, the product description on Amazon states that a lithium battery will be included.  Actually, two AAA batteries will be included so I suspect that is a mistake in the description.The scale has a nice clear display, increments in 0.2 intervals, handles up to 400 lbs, and has a 5 year warranty.  Take a look at Amazon's top 20 selling digital scales and then compare it to this one in price, longevity, and features.  Since the digital scale market is very competitive, you'll come away with a great scale one way or another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMS0LE2K7PV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EA9ET5O#wasThisHelpful","R3RMS0LE2K7PV2","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but I am not getting any extra shine when using this product.  I tried it on laminate flooring as well as ceramic tile.  For comparison, I applied the product to an area next to an area that I cleaned with only water.  After letting the product dry, I could not tell any difference in shine between the Mop&Glo area versus the area cleaned with plain water.  I even tried shining a flashlight at different angles over the Mop&Glo area but still didn't notice any difference.Also, despite having 20/20 vision, reading the back label was very difficult due to the very small font.  There is plenty more space on the back side of the bottle so I am not sure why this company printed such a small label.After reading some of the horror stories here on Amazon about how difficult it can be for people to remove the wax build up, I have to wonder if such a product is worth the trouble.

"This is the perfect racket for the table tennis enthusiast as it is priced reasonably yet still offers great features. The level of control from the soft and lightly sticky pad is amazing. And the nice, deep thud the ball makes upon contact contributes to the level of control. Construction is high quality and very solid. Grip is very good although I find the handle a bit small, but consider that I am 6'3"" tall. However, every racquet I've tried thus far has a ""small"" handle.No instructions provided on how to clean the racquet which I find strange.

"For the price, these are solid training gloves.  They also fit very well for my size -- I'm 205lbs and 6'3 in height. The stitching and workmanship all seem very solid, but let's see what they look like in six months.  The gloves are easy for me to put on and pull off, and the strap is designed in such a way that I can unfasten them while wearing the other glove.  The strap also has a wide and long band of velcro on it -- these are not going to come loose.Immediately after opening, I examined the gloves for loose threads or other manufacturing defects.  None detected.  I did notice that the tip of the thumb has a piece of leather connecting it to the glove I assume to restrict movement so the thumb doesn't get bent backwards.  On another pair of gloves I have, that strap is much further down the glove allowing the thumb to move a little more than this pair.  I'm not sure which is better but I wanted to point that out since none of the pictures on the product page show this.I've tested these gloves on a punch bag and they felt excellent by dampening the blow.  However, I am not an aspiring boxer (or a boxer, period) so I am just giving the average Joe opinion here.  I use the gloves to do basic self defense training and to get a workout.  The only minor complaint I have is that my hands started getting warm when wearing the gloves.  In other words, there isn't much ventilation that I could find but this could be normal.I look forward to seeing if these gloves can hold up.  If I notice some premature wear and tear, I'll be sure to update this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFKBOYBOE61S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMVX0GY#wasThisHelpful","R2SFKBOYBOE61S","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I open the product, and the setup was rather intuitive and simple.  To my surprise, no instruction pamphlet or page was included.  Instead, instructions are briefly printed on the side of the box.  The full instructions are on the web (http://us.focusrite.com/get-started/itrack-pocket).  For quick instructions, though, I found the instructions on the box rather lacking.  For example, my friend and I debated for a few minutes as to the purpose of the red light.  We thought it was indicating good audio rather than clipping.  A better solution would be a label next to the light reading ""Clip"" or mentioning this on the quick instructions would have been helpful.  The good news is that the full instructions and the introduction video online are done very well.For some of our initial recordings, we were getting a small amount of background static.  This went away when we picked some different amps, but according to the online troubleshooting (aka Answerbase), we should have been in airplane mode to reduce interference from Bluetooth and perhaps Wi-Fi.  The four amp options, by the way, are ""none"", V-AC, Brit, and Twin.The iTrack software is slick and pretty straightforward as well.  Our biggest complaint is that some of the fonts are really small and the buttons could also be larger.  We also had trouble turning the virtual knobs (e.g., reverb).  If anyone knows the secret to consistently getting those controls past the midway point, please provide a comment to this review.  Also, be warned that if your iPhone has a case it will likely not fit on the iTrack stand until you remove the case.  But know that you do not have to necessarily put your phone on the iTrack so that shouldn't be a deal breaker.Overall, this product does what is says it does -- and it does it pretty well.  Guitar recording is very clean and vocal recording is adequate for a quick tune.  If you are on the fence, check out the video at the link I posted near the top of my review as it has a seven minute video that goes over the product in better detail than the video on this Amazon product page.  You can also read the manual at that same site in multiple languages and/or play with the free app from the iTunes store (search for ""Focusrite by iTrack"") if you are curious about some of the more advanced features.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LOFRP5D67DOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB42FTG#wasThisHelpful","R1LOFRP5D67DOE","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up front, at this price range (roughly $40), you can find other hand crank radios on Amazon that include solar power, weather radio, and cell phone charging options.  Furthermore, other hand crank radios have digital tuner which makes tuning easier and more accurate.On the plus side, this guy is small and has a loud speaker for its size.  The speaker though becomes distorted at half way up on the volume.  Controls are intuitive and ergonomics are good.  With one minute of cranking, you get up to 10 min of radio and up to 30 minutes of flashlight.  The light is not that bright, and it does not cast a well distributed light.  Hand crank is similar to other hand crank radios -- somewhat cheap and could be broken by a child cranking too hard.  Included instructions are very well written and clearly explain each feature.Skip this radio.  At this price range and for emergency situations you need more features and better features.

"I've now owned an Oral-B tooth brush for two years, and there is no going back to regular toothbrushes. The thoroughness of how these clean and how smooth your teeth feel afterwards will convince you after using it the first time.Using this toothbrush is intuitive and easy. You set the mode you want and guide the head to the targeted area. You brush each area for about two minutes, and then the toothbrush buzzes to signal that you should move to the next area. When you are done, you rinse the toothbrush and place it back on the stand. And you can share the toothbrush by giving family members each their own head. Oral-B provides colored bands for each head so you can tell the heads apart.Charging this device is very easy and kid friendly due to it using inductive (wireless) charging. You can easily go a few days before needing to charge again, but for simplicity, I just put it back on the stand after every brush.Now, about the new feature. We are now getting to the point where more and more products are trying to integrate with the web or smart phone. In this case, I'm not so sure it is worth it. I see my dentist every six months, and they tell me already where I need to do a better job. This toothbrush isn't smart enough to compete with my dentist and my dental hygienist -- at least not yet. If this toothbrush told me that tartar was building up in certain sports or could clearly tell me which spots I was missing, then it would be much more useful. The best use I can think of for the smartphone feature is if you wanted to monitor your children to see how well they were doing. Other than that, it is kind of a fluff feature.If Oral-B were to make any improvements, I'd like to see a version of the toothbrush that doesn't allow for gunk to get inside it which then runs down the body of the brush. I have to clean my toothbrush about every 1-3 months. To reduce the amount of gunk, I've learned that if I keep the toothbrush running while holding it under running water helps. Further, don't just clean the head -- clean the entire tip otherwise gunk runs down past the brush head. I'd also like to see a better solution for cleaning a person's tongue. The small head struggles in that department so I keep a traditional style toothbrush around for that job.In the end, I love Oral-B toothbrushes, and I have even have bought some for other people as gifts. If I had to start all over, I would simply just get the Oral-B PRO 3000 and put the extra money into more heads. However, if you have people in your house that have sensitive gums or if you want to monitor how often and for how long children are brushing, then the 5000 is a very good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBV20R8OLLC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8ODHOA#wasThisHelpful","R2LBV20R8OLLC4","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note this product never mentions if it is specifically for women, so this test is being done on a male's face (that's me). Further, I've never used a mask on my face before so I am coming into this test fresh.In the short time I've been testing this, I've been only applying it to the left half of my face. After about three applications, I've noticed no difference between the left and the right side of my face. This includes monitoring my pores, skin tone, wrinkles, etc. I'll keep testing and report back.The clay smells slightly minty (even though mint isn't present) combined with smells similar to lotion products. I find the smell pleasant. The texture does feel clay like and it quickly dries on your face after applying it. I don't plan on getting it on my clothes but the manufacture states it can stain clothing. And there is a slight tingle sensation shortly after applying the mask.Removing the mask is slightly more tedious than I thought it would be. It takes me several rinses to get all the gray residue off. But I can live with this if the product works.The manufacture also states you should avoid the sun while using this product and for a week afterwards. This is due to the product containing alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). I've been wearing sun screen to counter this affect.For now, the jury is still out so I'm giving this four stars for now.

"We are a big video gaming family, and it seems our boys are frequently on an X-box 360, smartphone, our tablet playing away.  However rarely are they playing educational games so I was happy to see this Leap Frog system.  The challenge though is how to make educational games fun so the kids stayed engaged.Setup was pretty straight forward even for non-technical people.  Thus far I have only used the quick setup guide but there is another more in-depth manual I'll be looking at here soon.  The hardest part is with lighting as other reviewers have noted.  The camera requires a lot more light than say an Xbox Kinnect.  We had to turn on all the lights at night time plus bring a floor lamp over to the area to help out.Navigation on the screen is a breeze and intuitive for children and adults.  They also use large fonts and, often, use instructional voice prompts to assist.  Although our kids followed a lot of the instructions well, they couldn't always figure things out so having a parent around initially will certainly help.  Case in point is getting the child to position himself in front of the camera so that his body fills the calibration silhouette.  Our four-year old bent his body down instead of moving backwards to get the video setup phase to pass.The controller is easy to operate on has less buttons than a standard video game controller.  This is perfect for keeping it simple for kids.  The controller, though, feels a little flimsy so I'm hoping it can withstand abuse from kids.  Thankfully the controls are cheaper than most video game controllers.Game play is designed to get kids in motion which is great for the over-weight epidemic in the USA.  Many games integrate the kids on the TV which really gets kids exited and laughing.  The Xbox Kinect has games that do this as well but the Leap Frog system is designed from ground up to be for kids and to be educational.LeapFrog supports Internet connection which can then report statistics back to the company.  From there, after you register at their site, you'll get some reports about how your child is doing.  This feature looks promising.We'll report back here shortly on how our kids are doing.  We also might order the Spiderman game so they have a ""cool"" but still educational game to play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T34BM0NE3X3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR2Q0LY#wasThisHelpful","R3T34BM0NE3X3N","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diono does a great job on the Amazon page here describing all the features so I'm just going to append to that my own observations.I was pleased to see all the padding and the memory foam seat as we are the kind of family that often makes six-hour drives. Our kids don't regularly complain about the other car seats but it is nice to see Diono trying to make the seat as comfortable as possible.Even though Diono advertises this seat as having a thinner profile, just know that it still is rather heavy likely due to the steal frame. And as you can see from some of the negative reviews, people with different vehicles have had different results with this seat. That's just a reminder to be prepared to keep the packing box in good shape in case you need to return it.In hindsight, I think I am leaning more towards having two car seats for a child as they grow up instead of this style of the Diono Rainier. So one seat for the infant phase and then one for the non-infant phase. Why? Because I think I prefer the type of car seat that acts as a carrier as well and/or can be plopped into a stroller. It just seems easier especially for when an infant is already sleeping when you are ready to pull the baby out of the vehicle. Although eventually buying two car seats might be more expensive, at least you don't have the costs of buying a separate carrier. I prefer convenience and space saving over this all-phase Diono Rainier.Still, the Diono Rainier is a great car seat if you don't mind having an extra carrier on board for infants.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DKZ1OMROQ9TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISS2QIK#wasThisHelpful","R1DKZ1OMROQ9TH","A1RF9YK4BK5TRH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RF9YK4BK5TRH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The intent was to use this receiver with some older speakers. What attracted me to this particular one was the decent price and the micro-usb power source (my receiver has a power usb out and hence it could also turn on/off the bluetooth receiver).The receiver is very compact, and it paired rather easily. The problem is very, very poor range.  Music would be very choppy between 4ft and 8ft, and it would completely cut out at about 8ft or so. Also, even if within the OK range, just siting in front of the phone (the source) would render the sound very choppy.I tried my older Amazon Basics Receiver and that one had no such issues. As such, this receiver is not working as intended, and a $2 cable could replace it if the working range is less than 4ft. So 1 star it is then...","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGBOJ4U22HQF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OBCAW2#wasThisHelpful","RGBOJ4U22HQF2","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were very active in our kitchen before and eat very healthy, but we were still purchasing a few of processed items (healthy, but processed nonetheless). Since switching to Paleo we completely eliminated processed foods, and this has opened new opportunities for us. One of these is making our own chocolate and other cacao treats. So we purchased Navitas Naturals Cacao Butter and Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder and made our own chocolate, nutella, avocado chocolate mousse, Paleo bars, etc. But it seems as they needed a bit of pizzazz...Enter the Viva Labs Cacao Nibs! These things are great! The crunch! The taste! The flavor! Outstanding! And no, I have not received them for free in exchange for a review. Nope. This is how good they are! And just for a bit forget about how healthy these things are for you; all I am saying is: pizzazz, welcome!We have since used them in all the above mentioned treats, we added them to hot chocolate, to the kids' ""cereals"", and to other beverages. We have used regular cacao powder in the past, but these nibs just give them that ""je new sais quoi"". And they are even good the way they are, so we just sneak a teaspoon once in a while...This past weekend my kids wanted a quick chocolate fix, so I made them my version of Mexican chocolate: a few cacao nibs, a touch of raw honey, just enough cacao butter, and a hint of cinnamon, all crushed for about a minute in my mortar - I had to make another one of course! And then another one, but this time I skipped the cinnamon and added a couple of roasted hazelnuts for my lovely wife: oh boy! Let's call it rustic nutella, or whatever you want, but it was definitely delicious. And of course I had to make another one... Note to self: next time double the quantities...Needless to say, highly recommended for their taste, crunchiness, flavor, and value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38S92PC60D9NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW81YM#wasThisHelpful","R38S92PC60D9NL","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased this coconut oil for its price. This oil was at the time of my purchase a very good value at less than 40 cents per ounce, or 50 bucks for the 128 ounces container. After reading all the reviews I was expecting a very good oil in a pretty hard to open container. I found the exact opposite...The container is extremely easy to open. After receiving it I was expecting to have to cut the entire lid. Before I started doing so I just took a flat screwdriver and I was able to pry the rid right off. I put the lid back on and then took a few pictures, this time with cutting a bit from the lid as instructed on the lid - see all the pictures I posted. After taking the bag out, I just cut the bottom and the entire content just slid into the container effortlessly. A bit of oil remained in the bag, but that was pretty insignificant and I was able to warm it up a bit and squeezed it in the container. I maybe lost a few pesky drops that didn't want to come out of that bag.The problem that I have is the taste. This oil is not very good. Maybe we have been spoiled by extremely good oils - we tried a few and settled on the Nature's Way Extra Virgin Organic Coconut Oil which is about 55 cents per ounce. The Nature's Way is creamy (at same ambient temperature) and the taste is just perfect, as it smells like fresh coconuts. This one, the Native Forest, has a different texture, almost glassy (it doe not scoop as nicely as the other one) and it smells too toasty, almost rubbery or plasticky... While I can easily take a spoonful of the Nature's Way the way it is, I cannot do so with the Native Forest...I wish I could have tried a smaller quantity before committing to such a big container. But it is what it is now, and we use this one as moisturizer, hair treatment, etc. and reserve the honors for ingesting to the Nature's Way. For the price it was a pretty good value, but now that the price is up I probably won't buy it again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWU45ENF2DHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4F83N8#wasThisHelpful","R1PWU45ENF2DHW","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A friend recommended this for our kids a while back, and we got it from iHerb. While it might be good, we avoided giving it to our kid, as it contains 3 ingredients that I would avoid:- xanthan gum. While deemed somewhat safe, there are some worries with feeding it to infants, and they seem to relate to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants.- potassium sorbate. It is a skin, eye and respiratory irritant, but the worst is that it is deemed to be toxic to human DNA, basically causing damage in DNA.- sodium benzoate. This is pretty nasty. It seems to deprives cells of oxygen at DNA cellular level. The biggest issue is that when combined with vitamin C (also found in this vitamin) it produces benzene! It might produce levels below those considered dangerous for consumption, but I did not want to risk it with my kid.I am no chemist or scientist, but these put enough doubt in my mind not to use it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CIFMLZBMINSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OYMHKI#wasThisHelpful","R1CIFMLZBMINSC","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We also got a pretty good deal on the Roar (a little over 120 bucks), so we might be sticking with it for a while...I never had all these speakers at once in my house, as we ended up returning them after comparing them individually to the one we had in the house - the Roar. So I cannot really comment on how they all compare, just how they compare against the Roar mostly.I am not too sold on this Sharkk. In fact it was not that good. I believe it was much weaker than the others we tried, but definitely much worse than the Roar. The sound is not impressive at all, actually is not even decent. It is loud, if that's what you are looking for, but it has very, very hollow with very limited range.

"We believe this mix is almost spot on. The pancakes are really good. Mix it with egg and some oil (we use either coconut or ghee) and you are good to go. The taste is great for a Paleo product. It is NOT however the regular pancake taste, as the coconut is pretty easily identifiable. Mouth feel is a bit different too, as they will have a bit of a grainy texture. But, my kids (8 and 6) are now demanding I make them these pancakes instead of the regular ones, so ""On The Go Paleo"" hits the right spot. And we were not expecting them to be exactly like the regular pancakes either.But it is bit on the expensive side. You need 1/3 cup of the mix, 1 egg, 1/2TBS oil and 3 TBS milk to make three 4"" pancakes, or at least that's what they promise. I always double the quantity and I get 4 pancakes (maybe just a tad over 4""), so the entire package should yield 28 pancakes. But when I put 1/3 cup of mix on my trusted scale, it told me it is a little over 40g, not 34g as specified. So the package has in fact almost 12 servings x 2 pancakes = 24 pancakes. But this is nitpicking...Still, I have to recommend this mix as one of the better ones.

"These ottomans are pretty good quality compared to others in the price range (and I tried a few). They arrive completely assembled. The little ones fit inside the large ottoman, and do not have any storage themselves. This is a bit of bad design for two reasons: it would have provided additional storage even if they are fairly small; it would have provided some additional rigidity as they are the weakest link in this set - when I put my 185lbs on one of them it almost caved in (if you read the reviews for other colors you'll find out that they break pretty fast.) Also from those reviews I found out that the lid handles from the large one will eventually come out or break, and some people even cut them from the beginning to eliminate those floppy things...So while they have very good stitching, they seem well constructed and the materials used seem pretty good in quality, we ended up returning them. Why? Because the color is completely off! We bought two of them and both were the same purplish gray, almost with brown tones. Very strange color.

"I bought this fan about 3 years ago. It has been working great for me. My original review went under the VenTech IF6 fan, but this is the one that I received (Amazon either recycled the ASIN or something else happened...)I made the mistake of building my own kitchen island, and our cooktop is on it. I have vaulted ceiling so I thought the best option is to route my exhaust through the floor. Now, I could have bought a downdraft unit, but noooo, I had to build my own... (well, to my defense, the island design would have made that downdraft installation almost impossible, as it is a two-level island). So I bought this puppy and ducted my own exhaust with the Speedi-Products EX-WCHD 06 wall cap (ASIN: B0085KZOQW, btw, a great wall cap - I just glued a washer to the damper to stay closed better.)Take note that this fan can get loud as it gets busy at sucking the food out of the pan when I'm cooking something... So I tried slowing it down a bit. Amazon's matchdotcom engine mates this with SE Electronic Stepless Speed Controller, but I don't know about you, but I don't really like that thing hanging on my newly remodeled kitchen's glass-tile-with-natural-stone-and-sweat-and-tears-and-a-piece-of-my-finger-backsplash. I also tried a regular Home Depot-purchased ceiling fan controller (this fan is not drawing a lot of amperage), but there it was, the unavoidable hum. I tried another type (forgot what type) and it worked just as an on-off switch. Then I tried it with the Leviton 6637-PW (ASIN: B000U3HXF2) and it works perfectly! Excellent speed control rated for 5-Amps too (much more than the fan's 1A)! Designed for this type of motors! Fully adjustable (the top and bottom of the slide action)! It can work as a 3-way fan control as well! It looks excellent! It integrates perfectly with our other Decora (or something-something) switches! It can cook diner! It can wash and put the kids to bed! BUT IT IS BLOODY EXPENSIVE!!!But I digress... this is an excellent fan, and if you can slow it down a bit, it is golden. It has been working for 3 years now, and it is so efficient at removing the food odors out of the house, that I have the neighbors complaining about my mouth-watering cooking odors now... Oh well, you can't win...The mounting bracket can be a pain, as it is very short and provides no access from the fan side to screw or bolts you might use. So I needed to have this fan bolted to a 1.5""x1.5""x16"" piece of wood and screwed that one into a joist in my crawlspace. Well, of course it vibrated. So I put some foam (2 pieces I cut from one of those interlocking mats) between the bracket and the piece of wood, and between the piece of wood and the joist. Better, but still some vibration can be felt through the floor upstairs. So I replaced about 1 foot of the solid duct for both inlet and outlet with flexible aluminum duct (the more rigid one) and I cut two 6"" pieces of strap from an old ratchet tie-down, screwed the ends of the side of the joist, and screwed the piece of wood to the middle of it, so basically with the fan left dangling about 1/2"" from  the joist. VOILA! No vibration!Anyway, I have installed a filter that fit perfectly my two-level kitchen island - do a search for Broan filter 97015843 or Broan RMDD4804 (this is the hood that uses this filter) and look at the pictures in the search results (they were about $100 for a pair, but I used only one and kept the other one for when I (if ever) selling the house). I installed tile on that small backsplash and used the Kerdi corners around the tile, which are almost identical to the filter's edge material. At full force the air movement through filter is very loud!Now, the downdraft is not as efficient (in general, not this particular one), and I noticed that when used at high RPM, it ""tilts"" or sucks the fire a bit (I have gas stovetop) towards the intake. So, the plan include now moving this fan into the attic with a new glass or stainless intake mounted on the cathedral ceiling (basically an island hood with all the ""guts"" removed and cut to install flush with the ceiling, or built from scratch to look like a Best Cirrus CC34E6SB, or a Gaggenau Vario AC402, or a Futuro Futuro Skylight IS54SKYLIGHT, or my own design) = yet another project!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UF9RYIS39YON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LCEUEK#wasThisHelpful","R1UF9RYIS39YON","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great shower head. Very inexpensive, but very good quality.Things I like:The quality is very good. The chrome is spotless (and I got two of them, both work and look perfect.) It also looks very good. In fact, I have in my bathroom all Hansgrohe and Grohe fixtures and in all honesty this is very much up there (I have tried a Hansgrohe shower head and I actually like this one better.)It is very light (this is all plastic) and easy to maneuver because of this. There are positive stops for the function selector which will click when in each position. The selector works very good and there are no leaks from the nozzles that are not used.The chrome finish cleans pretty easily, easier than my old shower head, and I believe easier than my Hansgrohe and Grohe fixtures (my bath is finished about 3 months ago, so all my fixtures are new - age cannot be a factor here.)For me is not that important, but they came in a very nice black box with good padding and protection.OK, so it looks good and it came in a nice box, but does it work well? YES. We like it! We used to have one shower head that would concentrate all water in just a few very fine nozzles and would spray in a pretty narrow pattern. Because of it, the skin would hurt, and instead of a shower I would feel like I was at an acupuncture session! I could actually hear my skin cry! This Lordear is so much gentler and wider, without sacrificing pressure. It has 54 nozzles used for the shower function, and probably because of it it feels more like a rain shower. The other shower head it replaced had less nozzles but probably with a bigger diameter so it always felt like the water pressure was never good enough. The Lordear is feels much better in this case as well, and even though this shower head is gentler I do not have the feeling that it is underpowered, making pretty good use of my fairly low water pressure (about 40psi or less.) In both installations I removed the pressure regulator / filter (the orange piece in the picture - very easy to remove), but I did not notice a drastic difference in water flow with it installed.Things I don't like:OK, so it looks good, it came in a nice box, and it works well. But is it perfect then? Not really. For starters this is a pretty large shower head (not the whole thing, just the spraying part), and pretty flat. As such, it feels a bit awkward when using it. Maybe I was too used to the old one, and it is just a matter of getting used to this one now. But, I cannot detract any stars here as I it is advertised as a 4inch shower head, and it is very light and pretty maneuverable as such. And the spray pattern is nice and wide.Also, I know maybe it's just me, but it would have been nice to have the middle function as the rain shower. We never use the massage function (which is in fact not the best, as it doesn't pulsate - it just concentrate the water in the middle 10 nozzles), so we have to keep the selector at all times all the way to the left (and it goes about 40 degrees or so). We knew about this from one of the product images (and product construction required probably to have the middle function as the one that combines the other two), but in my opinion it would have been nicer. To be honest, we would have liked this shower head with just one function - the rain shower - and as such, no selector.Finally, more nitpicking - the handle is very square. It is easier to hold the shower head at a desired angle because of it, but it would have been nicer to have the handle maybe tapered and more rounded towards the hose connection. It would have looked much better and more cohesive with our shower bar, or any shower holders as I have not seen a lot of then square.  But again, I know about it from the picture so I cannot take any stars here as well.Nonetheless, none of these detract from the fact that this is a great shower head, and a very good value (we paid about 15 bucks for each.) Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEDYJ6MGB7TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LX1AB5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UEDYJ6MGB7TL","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is indeed a very quiet fan. Even at full 150CFM. This quietness is a great feature, but can be a detriment too: my lovely wife had to make me aware that certain noises are now easier to hear from outside of the bathroom now! Well, I guess you can't have it all...Anyway, there are a few issues that you need to be aware of:#1First of all, the picture on Amazon's website is not the correct one (see the picture I uploaded). They show the FV-05-11VKSL1 model that has a 4 inch or 6 inch connection. The FV-11-15VKL1 model has only a 6 inch connection, so if you have a 4 inch duct you need to get a 6 to 4 inch reduction. You might get into some issues with a reduction, as explained below under #3.#2Installation wise - the instruction manual has a pretty good number of pages on explaining how to to install this fan in a new construction. And then just a page on how to do a retrofit. It is lacking here some information that I believe it is of importance - the fact that the housing splits in two parts. This is actually useful info to know even when you have access from above.If you use this in a new construction, just follow the instructions in the manual (easy to install before the drywall is up). However, in a retrofit things are a bit different for one major reason: you cannot insert this fan through the hole in the ceiling (the electrical junction box as well as the exhaust connection protrude significantly.) This fan can be fully installed from below IF (I repeat), only IF you can take the old fan out from below. Makes sense, but in my case I was out of luck, as the wise guys that built my house 30 years ago never thought that maybe, just maybe, one might need to replace that junk they put up there...Also, this fan is a little larger, so you might need to cut a bit of the drywall. After the hole is prepared, the support system can be installed from underneath through the hole (it bends in such way that you can get it up easily). It needs to have the two supporting brackets at the edge of the hole (placed directly on the drywall), as the fan will have to be bolted onto it. There is another issue here: if you have strapping on your ceiling (like I had) you will not be able to screw this system into the joists as instructed, as the screw holes will be too low. But there are other holes that you can use (not ideal, as the ones they recommend would have provided more rigidity to the entire support system).As mentioned above, the housing splits in two sections (the galvanized part with the electrical box and duct connection slides up and separates from the housing) - see the picture I uploaded. These are held together by one machine screw inside the fan housing. There are also 2 electrical connections between this two sections that need to be disconnected. After splitting, you can do the electrical and connect the duct much easier, as this section is very light. Once this is done, place this section up inside the hole in the proper position (flush with one side of the hole), then slide the black fan housing into it into the hole and into the galvanized section. There are 4 screws that will screw this housing into the supporting brackets. Replace the machine screw that joints the two sections together, and reconnect the 2 wires between them. Then install the LED bulbs and place the grill. DONE!#3This is a bit irritating. I bought this fan for its 150CFM capacity. In my case, I cannot use it! It might be my duct, but nonetheless, I wanted to share this, as it is a function of the fan involved here.I installed this during the winter. So even though I wanted to use the Speedi-Products EX-WCHD 06 (ASIN: B0085KZOQW) as a wall cap I couldn't as I cannot climb on the house right now. So I though I will re-purpose my old gas boiled vent stack (not used as I have an on-demand unit now). So I used a Fantech RSK-6 damper (the one on the fan is pretty bad) (ASIN: B000VMHYH4) and connected it to the vent stack. Well, when I put the fan on 150CFM, it will work a bit, stop, then start again, then stop again, and so on. I thought I have a defective one. But now I believe this is a ""function"" of the fan, as it's ""SmartFlow"" technology senses resistance in the duct and it tries to adjust the air flow... So I had to reduce the speed to 110CFM and it works properly. Now I have to wait until I install the wall cap in the spring to see if this is an issue with the fan or my stupid vent stack (probably not able to discharge properly that much air).So, to get back to that #1 issue with the picture, if you need to reduce the duct from 6 to 4 inch you might run into some problems with this ""SmartFlow"" (assuming this is the problem in my case, and not my fan being defective)...Other thoughts on this fan:- The LED bulbs are very nice, but I would have liked a light a bit cooler (it is more towards warm) and a bit brighter, so I might look in the future at some adapters and some corn LEDs;- For how much I paid for this thing, the grill could have been nicer - it is OK looking, but just OK, as it does not have a premium feel to it;- I did not use any additional sensors, as I have this installed with a Lutron Maestro MS-OPS6M-DV-WH (ASIN: B004P2C73M); They might be useful, and certainly this is a nice feature of this fan.- Finally, this thing has a slow start, so slow that when I turned it on after installing it I though it is not working!All of the above considering, this is a very nice fan, very quiet and very efficient. Would I buy it again: I am on the fence, as this thing is very good, but very expensive. The ducted 120CFM (Panasonic FV-10NLF1 ASIN B000EDOHBQ) which I have in my downstairs bathroom is less than half the price (it would involve finding alternatives for the light though).Hope that helps. Good luck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18K5G5QR3FCDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JALSABG#wasThisHelpful","R18K5G5QR3FCDG","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great fan! I recently built a new bathroom and used this for the exhaust. It has been working flawlessly for the past 4 months or so. The bathroom does not have windows, so this is the only way to eliminate moisture - it is quiet and efficient!I paired it with a Lutron Maestro MS-OPS6M-DV-WH, a Fantech PBV4 intake (I cannot see myself paying that much for the Panasonic one), a Fantech RSK-4 damper and a Speedi-Products EX-WCHD 04 wall cap. It works perfectly! Not a spec of moisture on the mirror ( I forgot to turn it on one time and it fogged up instantly), and takes care of the nasty fumes immediately (I have 2 young kids, not that what I do smells like roses...)I did not use the brackets they included as they wouldn't have worked in my case (see pictures on how I installed it.) I also installed a connection box and run conduit from the fan to that box. I used aluminum solid duct and this thing sings!

"This spout is very nice quality. It is very solid, with a nice chrome finish. I installed it about 4 months ago and no issues since.The main issue with this is installation: it is very finicky about how deep your drop-ear is. Within 1/8""! Of course that in my case I needed a 1.75"" nip....le (Amazon will take down this review if I use the appropriate term for that short pipe), which is impossible to find (at least to my knowledge. So I had to make my own with two 1/2"" to 3/8"" reducers and one 3/8"" nip...le. That did not decrease the flow at all (the inside diameter of the spout is the same as the 3/8"" nip...le anyway), and it allowed me to have the flange perfectly flush with the wall.BTW, it looks great next to my Hansgrohe 04353000 valve, the Hansgrohe 04354000 diverter, and the Artos F902-7CH shower outlet (highly recommend this one - great quality, cheap, and it looks very, very close to the Grohe spout, which is the main reason I bought them). Also looks very close design wise to the Hansgrohe 28631000 Unica shower bar, as well as the Gatco Channel items.So highly recommended, but installation is problematic, so 1 star deducted for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVXQGJX35WRGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090ACC48#wasThisHelpful","RVXQGJX35WRGX","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far one the best shower outlets I tried, and I tried a few of them. It is a solid chunk of brass (not like the plastic-fantastic Grohe or Hansgrohe shower outlets), with very good quality chrome finish. The flange is also solid, and stays perfectly close to the wall. I installed it about 4 months ago and no issues.It comes with a brass pipe nip...le (Amazon will take down this review if I use the appropriate term for that short pipe) already installed but it was a bit short for me, so I used another one (btw, it is a pain to get it out, as I thing they used some thread sealant that pretty much glued them together, but since it is all brass, I was able to use a bit of force and get it out).More, when compared to other fixtures (such as the Grohe tub spout I installed) the installation design is much better and easier, as the flange has about 1 inch of space where it could be positioned, so it is not so finicky about how deep is your drop-ear.It looks great next to my Hansgrohe 04353000 valve, the Hansgrohe 04354000 diverter, and the Grohe 13274 Concetto tub spout (actually, this one looks very, very close to the Artos, which is the main reason I bought the Artos). Also looks very close design wise to the Hansgrohe 28631000 Unica shower bar, as well as the Gatco Channel items.For the price I paid (less than 25 bucks) there is no other better value, and it has a much better quality than other ones at least double in price, even from big brand names. So highly recommended if it fits in your design!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HE9KVCZ1LCHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXTPG5M#wasThisHelpful","R2HE9KVCZ1LCHG","A26R8BWL2F05HU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26R8BWL2F05HU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am slowly working my way through the entire Sidestreets series and, for the most part, I find all of the books pertinent and spot on.Love Hurts is no exception - yes, the entire story is very quickly told and settled, but that is the business model on which these books are based.What I liked very much about this story is that the main character does not take forever to realize what kind of situation she is in.  Granted, she does a ""bonehead"" move towards the end of the book which causes a chain reaction, but overall, I thought the story and the main character were portrayed realistically.Another great book in the series.

"I love Isabelle Lafleche's books. I discovered them, by sheer fluke, a few years ago and as soon as I started reading J'Adore New York, I was hooked.J'adore Montral is the newest member of the family, unfortunately, it is, at this point, a short story, but nonetheless, I was thrilled that a) Isabelle was offering us something new in the series and b) the setting is my hometown.Catherine is back and so is Rikash (I love him, although I always think his name is Rishkah) and they are spending some time in Montral, enjoying a Dior event at one of the classiest places in town. Of course, Catherine cannot stay out of trouble and soon finds herself caught up in a situation that made for some entertaining and fun reading.Even though this is a short story, Catherine`s style, class and intelligence still find their way into the story, I loved that Isabelle kept Catherine honest and true to herself. Of course Rikash was as always, funny and scary - every time I read a passage involving him, I feel like I am looking at a speeding train that may or may not stop in time - its wonderful and adds a little bit more spice to the story.Let`s face it - Catherine and Rikash are great together and THEY are the story - oh let`s not forget the glamorous Dior - never far from being a central character and in this story, beautiful Montral is front and center.Isabelle is a Montrealer - which makes her Montral based story authentic. Her descriptions of the stores, of the food and of the 'style' of Montral are spot on. Making this an even more entertaining read for me.I need this to come out as a full book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J72ZM6EO44AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZT6AJTW#wasThisHelpful","R2J72ZM6EO44AD","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When you order these, you actually get 4 separate air fresheners and the idea of basing their scent on the seasons is genius.  The fall or autumn one is my favorite followed by the winter one.  It so happens that I also love those two seasons and both the air fresheners reminded me of that particular season as soon as I opened it.I know people seem to be using them for their car, but I actually used mine in my house - one closet and three rooms and I love the scent - not too strong.  Its always a bit of a mystery when you are trying a new product similar to this as to whether you will end up with some cheesy, overly strong freshener, but not the case here.Once the freshener starts to fade - I plan on using these for my drawers.Love this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7REQF31DTGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHD563Y#wasThisHelpful","RR7REQF31DTGE","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of this series - I find the books brave, timely and honest.Skank takes a look at how quickly things can unravel, especially if you are a young adult going to high school.While I did not hate this book, I felt nothing for the main character, which is not a good thing for me.  It means there is something about the character that feels under developed or that the story was simply not ""arced"" properly for me.I had mixed feelings about the relationship between Ariel and her mom.  Its nice to read a YA novel where the daughter is not at war with her mother - or that the parents are simply a nuisance within the story.  However, in this book, the mother is more like a friend than a mother - which, at times, left me screaming ""helllloooo mommmm can you pick up on your daughter's cries for help?"".Overall, it was an okay read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QSQ46RUP317J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1552777154#wasThisHelpful","R1QSQ46RUP317J","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book started out really well for me, the story was engaging and I was all in. It kind of started falling apart once ""the main event"" happens.I could see the entire scenario playing itself out and yet, even at the height of the ""problem"" the author never portrays her main character as being that much in turmoil - as a matter of fact, nobody around her really seems to be all that surprised or mad or anything really at the end result.  Sure, the Highley throws in a ""desperate act"" - but to me, the whole thing felt too forced to be all that intriguing.I do like the author's writing style though and I would have gladly read this story without all the ""detours"" that were not necessary.

"I have never been a huge fan of Laverne and Shirley but I have always enjoyed Cindy Williams, which is why this book look so inviting to me.Having said that, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book..  Did I love it?  No and the reason for this is that I found this book incredibly vanilla.I am not sure if this a trend these days as I have read a few others in this ""genre""  for which I have the exact same comment.This book was fun to read because Williams has some funny anecdotes about some of the biggest tv celebrities., including Andy Kaufman.  She has a fun way of writing that makes you feel as though you are actually living the whole event right with her and....she is funny.  However, my beef with this book is that she just does not go into enough details about most of the things in her life.  For example, she talks about Laverne and Shirley and then, poof in less than two sentences, she tells us ""by now I have married...:  Really?  Two paragraphs ago you were telling us about Laverne and Shirley and now you are married?  Not one mention of her even having a boyfriend up until this point and never again after that.It felt as though she skipped over some huge points - mainly in her personal life and that is simply not acceptable if you are writing a memoir.  If all you wanted to talk about was your career then that book should have been written and NOT called a memoir.Additionally, after I read the entire book, I had absolutely no idea how Cindy felt about Laverne and Shirley, Penny Marshall or almost everybody else she mentioned - except Ed Begley Jr.  She does not write, at any point in time, about ANY of her feelings and emotions.  She is never mad, sad or thrilled.I didn't hate this book, but wow, was it lacking as a ""memoir:.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DBMS3EUADMSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630760129#wasThisHelpful","R2DBMS3EUADMSF","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was worried about the way the author was incorporating the recovery aspect of the storyline, however, as I kept reading, I found a delightful, funny and at times, a little bit ""out there"" type of read.I guess you would expect that from an author who ""infiltrates"" her main character into a rehab, all in the name of ""the guy"".Ultimately, though, what this story is about and what Lola discovers - life lessons about growing up and finding out a little bit more about who you are and what you mean to the world.Very well written, engaging and entertaining - a little out of the box, but it works here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSYOUJ5VWTRHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622667859#wasThisHelpful","RSYOUJ5VWTRHA","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly enjoy reading this author's works. She writes realistic stories that are both sad and uplifting without going over the top silly.The Truth About Us is basically a story about two young adults from very different worlds who want to come together despite everything. This book touched on a lot of emotions for me, at times, I found myself rooting for the characters and at the same time, I kind of saw why they could not be together. Its always a good sign for me when a storyline tears me in two - challenges me to think about a situation and question ""what would I do if it were me?"".Very well written - I love that Gurtler uses day to day dialogue and does not fall victim to the ""high prose"" that many authors tend to do - if you have dialogue or a scene to discribe - don't take 10 pages to do it in.I also enjoyed how none of the adult characters were particularly nice or were being portrayed as ""knowing everything"" - especially the moms of both of these characters and I won't even get into how much I disliked the dad in this one.Excellent reading and excellent writing.

"We entertain quite a lot and nothing is more annoying than going back and forth to the fridge with the wine bottle because you don't want to keep the wine because it gets warm. I have tried other types of wine chiller before and they have been such a pain (or simply didn't work) that I almost gave up...almost, until I discovered the Vinomio Wine Chiller.Firstly, it is incredibly easy to use (which is great because I am horrible at inserting part A into Part B, etc. The instructions, which are included in the box (which looks very pretty actually) are simple to follow, as I soon discovered during out last dinner party.I have a fear of opening wine bottles because I always make a mess of the cork, but once my boyfriend tackled that job, I took the wine chiller out (as per the instructions) inserted into the bottle and wow! worked like a charm. The bottle(s) stayed on the table, my guests served themselves easily and happily and the wine chiller did a perfect job of keeping the liquid at a perfect temperature, despite being on the table for hours.The Vinomio Wine Chiller was also a joy to clean - no fuss and no muss and I even keep it in its original box for safekeeping.I am so happy with this product and I have bragged about it to my friends.

"** spoiler alert ** I have read all of Patterson's Alex Cross books and, for the most part, have truly loved them. I just love Alex Cross, which is why I was so happy to read this one. I consider my once a year Alex Cross books as a huge treat.Unfortunately, this one left me ""meh"". While its not horrible, its fairly boring focusing solely on Cross trying to save his family (left off from the previous book).What works, for me, when it comes to Alex Cross is that he can be incredibly analytical and its a treat to read his exploits as he follows the clues and tracks his prey - they never stand a chance. Except that in this one, Cross is reduced to reacting instead of planning and using his intelligence. I don't like that Alex Cross.Additionally, this book pushes a little too much when it comes to certain things - at times, its just not credible, especially the scene when he has to ""rescue"" himself. There is almost no mention or presence from Sampson and everything is about his family, which I find tedious even when the story is great (which it is not here).Finally and this is MY BIGGEST beef with this one - Patterson uses silly ploys to lure his readers and then, chooses to PLAY IT VERY, VERY SAFE. This book could have had a saving grace - the author could have taken a chance and really done something daring which would have moved the story forward greatly for this book and for the others which will follow - except he went and played it safe - what a bore and a total let down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13JCAOXK093C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031621096X#wasThisHelpful","R13JCAOXK093C4","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have neck problems and when I travel I can really feel the pain.  I have been searching for a neck pillow that will both offer comfort and relief and this pillow is the answer.Firstly, it looks comfy and classy. Some pillows i have looked at have given me the impression that they will rip apart as soon as I use it more than once.  NOT the case here - its sturdy, flexible and cosy looking.Secondly, it vibrates!!! and it even has various settings, depending on what you are looking for.  For me, I always put it on full vibration massage to soothe my neck.I have used the pillow at home (watching tv) and while I am travelling and it works perfectly for any circumstances.I love that it only uses two batteries, which means no plugs or expensive charging issues.Overall, this is a wonderful product and I am thrilled to have it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KTMMSP00B811/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY0J536#wasThisHelpful","R3KTMMSP00B811","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy reading novels that act out some of the ""real"" life situations that I would have liked to have happen to me.Granted, I am not a kickboxer (not even close) but I have always wanted to know what it would be like to somehow get thrown into the world of celebrity, without actually having to act, sing or anything like that and this book does a fantastic job of showing us just how an ordinary girl can find herself wrap up into a world that is overwhelming and so obviously not real.Author Hantz portrays her main character as a down to earth girl who reluctantly finds herself the ""double"" for the it actress of the moment.  Although she doesn't want to be in that place, she quickly gets engulfed and this is where the story line turns very interesting to me.Becoming a diva, pushing away friends Liv and Matt and starting to buy your own press, these are the steps that Abi suddenly goes through, without even really noticing it (in the beginning) until she realizes just what she is doing and just how much the world she is now in is sucking the life out of her.I admit, there is no new ground covered here, but the story is quick, fun and engaging which made this book a great read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUJHGLFZKTVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622662628#wasThisHelpful","R3NUJHGLFZKTVQ","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I had to write a very short review of this book it would be ""wow"".  I absolutely loved this book.  I am a huge fan of  ""stranded in a disaster/mother nature goes nuts"" type of read (yes, I know its not an actual genre, but I just made it up LOL).Pandemic is THE perfect read for anyone who is looking for that creepy yet hopeful plot line where you know that everything written on the page is VERY plausible, while, at the same time, hoping (praying) that it never actually happens to you and just basically stays on the written page.Author Ventresca does a terrific job of introducing her characters and setting up the premise before throwing the reader into a catastrophe that is all too real.  Unlike many dystopian type books - there are no zombies, undead or walking corpses and this was such a relief.  Rather, this book is a story about what happens if we are hit with the next powerful plague, something as seemingly insignificant as the flu.The book pulls no punches and nobody is sacred, in fact, I felt for the main character Lil who will have to go through so much and may not in fact survive it all (no spoilers sorry!).Written extremely well without being gross or too detailed, this book kept me reading page after page, in fact, I found I could not put it down, especially once people start to get infected.I love the resilience of the main characters, even when they are asked to make some very tough choices and this book made me do some serious thinking about what kind of person I would be in this type of emergency.  I also like how Lil learns some very important lessons throughout the storyline.The only two things that were a bit of an irritant to me where the Mr. B. plot line which may have worked well in the beginning of the book, but dragged the story down a bit after that, especially when Lil keeps the whole situation a secret, way past when it should have been.  Also, the whole ""relationships""  thing with two of the characters was not necessary to the story as I kept asking myself ""really, that's important at a time like this?"".Otherwise, the author hit it right out of the field with this one and I was so mad when I kept seeing the % on my Kindle inch its way up and up - it meant the end of an absolutely terrifying but brilliant book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OMMJJ3AQVEJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628736097#wasThisHelpful","R3OMMJJ3AQVEJY","AAR8E3JF9K93P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAR8E3JF9K93P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having read a shred about Ronald Knox's becoming Catholic, I wanted to read more. Looking through Amazon, I found this book. I ignored the title ""as apologist"", and the subtitle, which seemed to unnecessarily alienate potential readers. I was drawn to it by it's being on a trusted publisher (Ignatius Press), and by the quote from Thomas Howard saying that you'd have to read a shelfful of books by and about Knox to find what you can find here. Howard hit the nail on the head. That's exactly right. Having said that, what about the subtitle and title?The subtitle comes from a four line poem, reprinted in the frontspiece of the book, uncredited. Inside you find out it's a poem by Chesterton titled ""Namesake"", which explains everything. If they'd said that at the outset, one wouldn't wonder about the ""Popish Creed"". On the back it says that Father Walsh did his dissertation on Knox. This book reads like that dissertation. It's very well researched, and very intellectual, like a dissertation. Thomas Howard likes it because while his own apologetics are like those of Knox, very homey, his writing style in some books is above many readers' heads. An English major like me finds Howards' ""On Being Catholic"" dazzling, but a friend preferred his ""If Your Mind Wanders at Mass"" because it was much simpler (and almost makes the same points). As C. S. Lewis points out in his book about reading, ""An Experiment in Criticism"", there are various kinds of readers. What Walsh really does in this book is offer the reader a sort of map of how to get around in Knox. I'm trying in this review to offer a way to get around in Walsh, so a different sort of reader (a more casual one) can discover Knox.Someone may say, ""the more casual reader can just go find a more casual book to read"", but I don't agree. Here's why. You have the same problem with any prolific author, say G.K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis. No one knows where to start or what to read. A well-researched book like this one can help one find the trail. This is an apt metaphor, as Walsh titles a chapter ""Seeking the Treasure"". The casual reader can use this book as a map by simply noting the layout of the book. The casual reader will enjoy the first parts, because they are arranged by ""Before Conversion"" and ""After Conversion"". This is the same way that Newman laid out his autobiographical ""Apologia Pro Vita Sua"", and makes for delightful reading (we'll get to Newman in a minute).The other thing to note is the ""Contents"" page which begins the book Why? Because Walsh reprints the text of some rare ""Conferences"" given by Knox on pages 132, 148, 185, 202, and 235. However, nothing tells you you're reading a ""Conference"" when you get to these pages in the book, except for these bits in the ""Contents"". The treasure is buried in the book. On page 15, however, Walsh provides a very helpful list of abbreviations for Knox's various books cited in the text. This will prove helpful to the reader who may decide to read more by Knox, and also indicates the dates of publication. This is very helpful with the ""Conferences"", talks given earlier to students at Oxford and elsewhere, but only published later.If the ""apologist"" in the title is throwing anyone off, that comes from a line from St. Paul, ""Be ready to make a defense (or apologia) for the hope that is in you."" It's sometimes translated ""answer"", since it doesn't mean to apologize as if you're sorry, and there's nothing defensive about it.  Walsh makes the point that Knox didn't only pile up intellectual arguments, but rather gave homey metaphors drawn from English life. As most readers know, C.S. Lewis also did this, and some of Lewis' best-known ""apologetics"" came from Knox. Walsh has another book about the two authors' friendship. Thomas Howard's books also strike this friendly, homey note, but for US readers.Now for Newman. I had stayed away from reading Newman, because even though I had first year Latin, ""Apologia Pro Vita Sua"" is a forbidding title. However, it simply means ""Apology for My Life"", and turns out to be written in English, some of the best written and easiest to read English I've ever encountered. Reading the Knox quotes here, Knox seems to be the same way. But Father Walsh's book is not written that way. It's written, as I've noted, as a dissertation. People interested in ""Knox's apologetics"" (which I'm not), may find plenty of brain food here. I simply find the two writing styles clashing. Walsh writes in the chapter called ""Experience, Reason, and Authority"" ""The wave of experience dashes us up against the rock of authority; the system or creed that emerges dashes us back on the waves of praxis."" What? Fortunately he then quotes Knox, who simply says ""Don't be the kind of Catholic who slinks off to Mass"".I don't know if I've rescued Knox for the general reader. My main impression on reading this book is that I wish Ignatius would simply reprint all the Sheed and Ward published titles by Knox (they have begun to bring some back into print). Although Father Walsh's style here is more scholarly than popular, that may be what he was hoping for all along. Thomas Howard is right. You don't have to be interested in either apologetics or ""the Popish Creed"" to meet Knox here, and that is a treasure worth digging for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G4Z0NE3XWIIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586171216#wasThisHelpful","R3G4Z0NE3XWIIZ","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My title might seem a bit odd. Having joined the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal men's service organization, I was interested in this documentary about its founder. I had read the book Parish Priest about Father Michael McGivney, but that doesn't mention Knights until 200 pages in, and I thought this DVD might be a bit more to the point. But in a certain sense it's not, because Father McGivney did so much more than that, and most of it before founding Knights. This documentary runs almost an hour, but it seems a lot longer, having no commercials. Other than that, it's like a History Channel TV show. There's running narration, and brief interview bits, but most of it is a dramatic reconstruction of 19th century life, with a huge cast. For this reason, it's quite engaging and gripping.This video dates from 2008, although the packaging of this edition is from 2014. I bought it in a Catholic book store for the same price Amazon has it for, as I write. Amazon may lower it at some point, of course. It seems like it was shown on TV because it starts with a teaser about Father McGivney's cause for Sainthood (which won't interest non-Catholics), and the narrator does a lot of foreshadowing as if approaching a commercial break. But on the video, the story is seamless. You could watch this as an interesting documentary about the plight of immigrants in the 19th century, particularly Irish immigrants, or about the related topic of the state of the Catholic Church in New England at that time. Or as a history of the Knights. There are no extras on the DVD, but you can select between four languages: English, Spanish, French, and Polish.About a million immigrants fled the potato famine in Ireland, mostly to the eastern US. This got them even more hated than they already were, and Catholics viewed with even more suspicion. Two things happened around then in the 19th century in the US. A lot of religious movements were started, and a lot of secret societies began. Sometimes the two were related. It's no accident that nearly all of the US presidents were Masons, and sometimes you had to join a society like that to get a good job. Immigrants, especially Irish ones, worked at hard, dangerous jobs, and the breadwinning father often died young. There was no universally available insurance. Masons, for example, were also an insurance, known as a death benefits, group, for their members. Knights was started for two main reasons. First, to provide an organization that was not a secret society for men that would affirm Catholic values, and second, to provide for widows and children. Thus it is that Knights still offers insurance today.Knights sometimes gets a bad rap today as a drinking club, or an organization with its own agenda that doesn't support the priest or pope. Every stereotype might be true in some cases, but where Knights councils follow their founder's vision, the members can provide greatly needed support and assistance to the priest, the pope, the parish, the wider Church, and the community. If anything would make a man want to join the Knights, it's this video, which shows how he takes his place in a great legacy, and why Knights are proud to regard Father McGivney as the Father of us all. Only one thing about it is misleading. For a man said to be always laughing and smiling, in his portraits he looks somber and sad. This is because of the 19th century view that you ought to look dignified in a portrait. It's the same way with Chesterton's portraits from the same time.  (Note: parents should watch this video first before showing it to their kids, as it shows a man being hanged).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDY1MTYQE4DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU27CRI#wasThisHelpful","RSDY1MTYQE4DP","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got the AquaSpa, I found the instructions confusing. However, it's actually very intuitive, both to install and to operate. Someone handier than I am won't need to read this, but I'll give  step by step operation, and installation, as well as answer a couple comments.I replaced a massaging showerhead that was supposed to make low water pressure seem higher. This new showerhead (the large head), has a built in flow restrictor to save water (the instructions say how to remove it if you have low water pressure). I left it in, although I thought I'd have to go back and take it out to get more pressure. But I didn't have to, because even on the lowest setting, this showerhead has more pressure than the one I had before.As for installation, you don't need any tools, as you simply hand tighten the pieces in place. First, you unscrew the old showerhead. Then you slip the plastic lock nut on the pipe, slip in the thick rubber washer, and screw on the new piece that looks sort of like a sausage. What's the lock nut for? You screw this down on the sausage piece. Plumber's tape is supplied, but you don't need it unless this fitting leaks. Then you simply screw in the large showerhead. Now you test it. Turn the lever on the left side of the water diverter (the thing that looks like a sausage) to the left so it points down. Turn on the shower and you can test it for leaks. It probably won't leak. If it does leak, unscrew the diverter, wrap plumber's tape around the threads on the pipe coming out of the wall, and screw it back on. You probably have a normal pipe with about an inch of thread showing on the end, sticking out of the wall. But if, for some reason, you had just a few threads showing on the end of the pipe, you simply leave off the lock nut, and there's an included thin rubber washer you can use to make it fit better. That's it for the large showerhead. Right there you've got a great, six position adjustable showerhead.What about the handheld shower? Two small rubber washers are tied to the flexible, metal hose. You slip one washer in each end of the hose, then screw one end into the sausage thing, and the other into the base of the handheld shower. That's it. The right side of the sausage thing holds the handheld shower. If for some reason this slips (mine didn't), you tighten it with a screwdriver. Turning the lever on the left side of the sausage to point to the front selects the handheld shower. On the base of the handheld shower (by the hose) is a lever which selects the inner or outer ring. Why? You can shower with either one, but if you snap one of the two brushes into the handheld showerhead, and select the outer ring, the water will spin the brush. You start it rotating by turning the lever on the back top of the brush. The purple brush has rounded massaging nubs. The green brush has softer brush ends. I never thought I'd figure it all out, but one shower and I did.The water has to be flowing through the outer ring of the handheld shower to rotate the brush. If you pull the brush too hard, and it separates from the brush holder, it easily stretches back on (you can also clean it this way). You can also turn a dial on the face of the handheld shower to switch from power spray to pulsating massage. All of the controls are easy to operate because they click into position. For instance, the large showerhead has a lever which clicks between six positions. The rightmost is economy rain, which is stronger than my previous shower head. Next is a mist setting, which can simulate a steam room. The other settings include massage, rainfall, and various combinations.The reason to only hand tighten is because the pieces are made of chrome-plated PVC pipe. They don't look like metal, although I find the entire AquaSpa attractive. The entire assembly is very light, so it doesn't stress the connecting pipe. With the handheld shower in place, it looms up high over the pipe, which is not a problem, but a bracket is available to mount it down by the tub, and you could use either the handheld or the large showerhead by themseleves. I found the rotating brushes good for rinsing my short haircut after shampooing, and the mist setting warms up your face for shaving. With my former showerhead, I always regretted that the water pressure was so low. With AquaSpa, I look forward to a shower.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0965UCASRPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUTV2VS#wasThisHelpful","R2T0965UCASRPP","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading the cavils against this Bible in reviews here, I determined to see it before I bought it. I did see it at the Alleluia Catholic Book Store in Mill Creek WA yesterday, and then I bought it. Here's why. I had the Ignatius Study Bible New Testament, which I cannot recommend too highly, but due to all the introductions and notes (which are excellent), Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: New Testament it's as big as a phone book. I wanted to get the entire Bible as well, mostly to read the seven books in the Old Testament which are no longer in Protestant (non-Catholic) Bibles. Protestants call them the Apocrypha, although for no good reason, as I'll explain below.But back to this Bible. Physically it's only about 3/4 inch thick, and an attractive 9 X 6 inch paperback. I skipped over it in the Book Store, thinking it must be a study Bible with only Psalms in it, since it's so thin. The cover matches the New Testament study Bible, except that it's sort of deep wine red rather than dark brown/ black, but both are far more attractive than they look in the photos. Someone complained that the paper is too thin and you can see right through it. Lots of Bibles use what is called Bible paper, which is very thin. It's possible this is a bit thinner, and yes, you can see partly through it. I don't find it distracting, but no, you don't want to highlight or even underline in it. Wait until the Study Bible includes the New Testament (or it's published separately) for that. But for careful reading, I think this Bible is excellent. I have a Harper RSV study Bible which is very large, but this fits easily into my pack. Someone said Esther and other books were missing in their copy. That must have been a mistake. They are fine in mine. I'm very pleased with this Bible. In the back, it has the same sixteen pages of color maps that are in the Ignatius New Testament study Bible. It's a very easy Bible to read, as the pages are in two columns. The only ""helps"" are the standard RSV-style footnotes.The RSV (Revised Standard Version) is the best ""modern"" translation. This Ignatius edition is based on the RSV-CE (Catholic Edition), which was British and dates from 1966. However, it takes into account all later Bible study and second edition means some of the archaic language has been changed from the O.T. In short, the perfect Bible. On the Protestant side, the ESV is also based on the RSV, and therefore I'd say it's the best Protestant Bible. Greek Translator Richmond Lattimore did his own New Testament without verse numbers, so it reads like a book The New Testament . It's also based on the RSV. What about the seven books? Did Catholics add them? No. The apostles read the Greek version of the Old Testament, called the Septuagint, which included these seven books. They are even quoted some of these seven books in the New Testament. Also, they were originally included in the King James (Authorized Version) Bible of 1611. In the preface of a Protestant King James Bible, it claims to be from 1611, but the seven books were only taken out of the edition of 1625. Interesting Bible trivia. Is this what people mean by the ""Apocrypha""? Yes and no. Sometimes they mean any ancient books that were left out of the Protestant Bible. Only the seven ""extra"" books included in the Catholic Bible are considered by Catholics to be the ""canon"" of Scripture, regardless of whatever other books may have been floating around at the time.By the way, this is an officially approved Catholic Bible, and the one used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The New American Bible is still used in the Mass, but I wish it were replaced by the RSV. Also, for Protestants who read the NKJV (New King James), I dare you to read this RSV and compare the two for understandability and readability. The RSV is also beautiful for flow. St. Paul's letters really read like letters. To my mind, this is also everything Protestants are looking for in a Bible. Someone might want a pricier or fancier edition, and these are available. It would be wonderful to see it made into a big family Bible/ coffee table edition with beautiful color art prints as well. It's very expensive for a publisher to make a Bible translation, and they have to change 15 per cent of it to copyright it. Ignatius did not copyright this one. The copyright is still held by the National Council of the Churches of Christ. Ignatius put all the work in, but they don't get the money back. The reason is they don't want to arbitrarily change wording just to get a copyright. They have done excellent work from, to my mind, the best translation, the RSV. This is, I would say, a Bible for everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PEALSS3RG19Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586177702#wasThisHelpful","R2PEALSS3RG19Q","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had just read Father Charles Connor's ""Classic Catholic Converts"" Classic Catholic Converts, when I  came upon this book. How do they compare? Father Connor is an historian, and provides fewer but longer portraits. This book, ""A Century of Catholic Converts"" covers more stories, but some are as short as a page and a half. Given that people like to read at different levels, in different ways, and all that, I still have qualms with this book. The format of it seems ridiculous.Why? Each section or chapter starts with a very brief summary of the decade, which is so brief as to be misleading, and to sometimes give a slanted view. It seems like a collection of cut and pasted headlines. This allows the author to refer to these events in the converts' stories. But, as Chesterton said, ""anyone can believe anything in any era"". The decade has nothing to do with it. Also, some of it is so one-sided as to be wrong. The author mentions the Progressive movement, but surely the spirit of the entire century is Modernism. The book gives tacit assent to this by the cover picture of New York, showing Modernism's triumph in the skyscraper, and the dazzling, deco Chrysler Building.The second bothersome thing is that each convert's story starts, for no discernible reason, with a summing up paragraph. Why not just start the story? Thankfully, the stories themselves are not written in this breezy journalistic style. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the two books draw from some of the same sources, so there is some overlap. Both books focus on well-known people, which of course is one of the big draws for readers. However, everyone has a story, and I find those just as fascinating as these better-known ones. Marcus Grodi, host of ""The Journey Home"" on EWTN, has gathered these in a fascinating volume called Journeys Home Journeys Home, while Grodi's own story is included in A Century of Catholic Converts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17CWSPO3PIPYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931709017#wasThisHelpful","R17CWSPO3PIPYZ","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Father Charles Connor is my favorite television personality to watch. He's an avid reader, well-informed, and a fount of knowledge. But more than that, he's so excited that he gets ahead of himself. So I wondered what his writing style would be like in this book. This book dates from 2001, and on the back it says he had a show on EWTN called ""Historic Catholic Converts"". I've not seen that show (or maybe it's a series), but I wonder if this book is made from transcripts of the shows. One reason is the order of the chapters, which I'll go into later. Also, I actually would rate this book 4.5 stars were that available, simply because some of the writing is not too clear-- I'd say Father Connor gets ahead of himself, as in the parts on Newman, which covers two chapters, and because sometimes it seems like a show transcript. However, this is one book that would be delightful to read on a Kindle, and I did read the first chapter that way. There is at least one minor error, a misprint of the title of Chesterton's novel, ""The Ball and the Cross"". Those tiny cavils are more than made up for by Father Connor's excitement, evident on every page. If you think history is dry as dust, you haven't read (or heard, or watched) Father Charles Connor.One great thing about this book, as opposed to a TV show, is the bibliography and footnotes, which beckon to avid readers thirsting to explore further. More on the Newman part. These two chapters cover, first, the Oxford Movement, also known as the Tractarian Movement, of which Newman was a part, and then Newman himself. One reason these chapters are not quite clear is that the author doesn't tell the story smoothly, start to finish, as he tends to with the other converts. This is because he's an expert on Newman, and can't quite make it simple enough for a Novice reader. This is because you have to know about the English Church to understand the situation and significance of Newman's becoming Roman Catholic. However, I found Newman's own account in Apologia Pro Vita Sua to be lucid and enlightening Apologia Pro Vita Sua (A Defense of One's Life) (Dover Giant Thrift Editions).The chapters are as follows:1. Elizabeth Ann Seton2. The Oxford Movement3. John Henry Newman4. Rose Hawthorne Lathrop5. Ignatius Spencer6. Orestes Brownson and Isaac Hecker7. Robert Hugh Benson and C.C. Martindale8. Edith Stein9. G.K. Chesterton10. Jaques Maritain11. Karl Stern12. British and French Literary Converts, including: Maurice Baring, Sir Arnold Lunn, Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, Leon Bloy, and Paul Claudel13. Ronald Knox14. Dorothy Day15. Converts of Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, including: Horace Mann, Bella Dodd, Louis Budenz, Fritz Kreisler, Heywood Broun,  and Clare Boothe Luce.16.

"I'm not completely sure what the point of this book is supposed to be. It's from American Atheist press. ""Atheist"" merely means ""non-theist"" and theist is already a vague word. In this case, it might better be called ""Angry Atheist press"", and who wouldn't be angry, defining themselves in terms of what they don't believe? If the point of this book is to expose the ""God of War"" of the Old Testament as a pretender and an also ran, in this the author succeeds admirably. What is the slaughter of 70,000 compared to the massacres  wrought by atheists in the last century, who at a stroke slew millions? Hitler, Stalin, and Mao come to mind, for starters, and they were mere humans. Then again, if you think the universe is really a meaningless accident, you have no basis for ethics or morality, so who's to say they were wrong?Paul's own story is also curious. He says he started, as we all do as an atheist, then he was a Catholic, then a  ""born again"" Christian and then an atheist again. This is like saying a frog starts out as a tadpole, but then grows to a frog. The author seems to be saying it's better to remain a tadpole, or return to being one. Perhaps he grew very fast and is on his second childhood, or has been ""born again"" as an atheist. No wonder he seems angry, watching the other frogs hop away, who seem to have no desire to join him.If I detect in this book a mocking tone, it's also not surprising. It must be annoying to think there's no meaning in the universe when everyone else thinks there is. Like everyone else, atheists sometimes feel a sense of wonder and gratitude, and the worst thing, as a former non-theist, G.K. Chesterton said, is that there's no one to thank. And it must be annoying watching the other frogs hop away, who consider the tadpole stage not the end, but the beginning of their journey.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4FL74LNSFQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1578849225#wasThisHelpful","R3D4FL74LNSFQT","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am here reviewing the Dover Giant Thrift paperback edition, which I highly recommend. I note this as this review may show up under some other edition. The Dover paperback is priced at $5 US on the back, and is over 300 pages. It's a very clean reprint of the 1908 Longmans and Green British edition, and includes numerous notes and letters in the back, as well as Kingsley's attack on Newman, which prompted his apology.I became curious about Newman because so many people mention him on ""The Journey Home"", a show on EWTN, as being instrumental in their spiritual journeys. Also, there's a video of Malcolm Muggeridge in which he and his wife, Kitty, are reading Newman aloud MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE Also, the Newman centers for Catholic students at universities are named for Newman (although it conveniently sounds like New Man).What I did not think is that this book would be easy reading, as most works from 170 years ago are not. The back cover remarks of Newman's ""flowing prose and conversational style"", and believe it or not, it's true. This is one of the most delightful books I've read in a long time. I knew very little about the Anglican controversies mentioned, but Newman reveals more about them as the book goes on. Also, the names and places are all unfamiliar, but they also are in a fantasy novel. It will sound odd, but this book reads like science fiction, not in the sense of unfolding a plot or story, but because of the imaginative way in which Newman writes, and his felicitous turns of phrase. For that reason, when he drops in a slogan of his day which his contemporary readers would understand, those are so dated that it rarely makes his point clearer now.There are a few brief Latin quotes, not translated into English, but other than that, it's quite smooth going. Every now and then he lifts into amazing prose like this idea of the Catholic Church as ""a vast assemblage of human beings with wilful intellects and wild passions, brought together into one by the beauty and Majesty of a Superhuman Power-- into what may be called a large reformatory or training school, for the melting, refining and moulding, by an incessant, noisy process, of the raw material of human nature, so excellent, so dangerous, so capable of divine purposes.""This book makes Newman's views very clear. Why he became Catholic (and resisted doing so for so long); his attempts to chart a Via Media (Middle Way) in the Anglican Church, and how, in his view, he failed; his part in the Tractarian Movement, and the resulting controversies. The irony is that he didn't want to be followed or imitated, but after he converted to Rome, a great many Brits followed him into the Catholic Church.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E5PW7FLUWES8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486442136#wasThisHelpful","R1E5PW7FLUWES8","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mid- '80s series is often dismissed as an ""Undersea Smurfs"", but it's not. Both Smurfs and Snorks have this in common, however, like Tintin, they were both Belgian comics. Snorks starts with an odd, heavy backstory about Captain Ortega's ship being attacked by pirates. A sailor finds his journal in a monastery, in which the captain tells of tiny undersea creatures, the Snorks. The rest of the show is much lighter, but it continues among other oddities. Realistic-looking fish swim by the cartoon characters, and sometimes attack them. In the last of the 13  episodes in this set, a whale is mistakenly called a ""killer whale"", slang for an Orca, but they might mean simply that the whale is a killer, since it attacks another whale. Each episode consists of two cartoons. The set includes two one-sided discs, with no extras. Another oddity is that the Snorks sometimes glimpse humans, or vice versa.Their own world is very well realized, with a full cast of characters. They can be jet-propelled using the snork on their heads, in the manner of a squid. Allstar, the main character, has a faithful doglike pet octopus, Occy, voiced by Frank Welker, who also voices Tooter, a character who communicates by means of sounds, in the manner of Gerald McBoing Boing. The full cast is rounded out, somewhat like the Flintstones, and played against dazzling, bright undersea backdrops. The characters are well-drawn, well-developed and likable, with the exception of Junior, the mayor's son, who is sort of like Reggie in Archie comics. His schemes are foiled in ways that arise naturally in the stories, and the good nature of the other characters wins the day. All in all, this is a delightful series, far above most cartoons of its time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RESRETGNKJD7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009H3LNF2#wasThisHelpful","RESRETGNKJD7I","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The BBC need not wait for Father Brown to consign it to hell. I'll do it now. They've ruined everything innocent they've touched. Blandings, a travesty of Wodehouse, the new Dr. Who with all it's trickier than thou tired ulterior motives and not so hidden agendas, and now trashing Chesterton's sleuth, Father Brown, with unwatchable, unthinkable, unimaginable rubbish like ""The Hammer of God"". Chesterton wrote plenty of stories. It's not necessary for the worst writers of today to write others, nor the worst directors to dirty them up, nor stick in their trashy anti-male biases. Nor is it in any way an advance that they have found their way behind a camera instead of on a shrink's couch or at a confessional where they belong.One had hoped that the BBC might at least make an attempt at this series. ITV/ Granada managed to make out a decent two seasons sometime back. But then they don't have endless post-modern axes to grind, and they may know what the present BBC staff does not, that decadence makes bad art. As the real Chesterton said, ""Art, like morality, consists of drawing the line somewhere,"" a bit of wisdom apparently lost on the BBC. Malcolm Muggeridge long ago forecasted the direction they would take in Christ and the Media Christ and the Media, but they seem determined to far outrun him over the Gadarene slope. Despite the fact that I love watching Top Gear, I'd never watch BBC America, because like so many American channels, its directors seem incapable of drawing the line somewhere. Fortunately, anyone literate can simply read the real Father Brown stories (and the many novels and mysteries not featuring Father Brown) by Chesterton, and avoid the BBC's failed versions altogether.

"Why did I name this review 'Thank You Jeeves'? Because I imagine that lifesaver bringing self this book on a salver, somewhere near the end of an imaginary novel in which I've had the ghastly task of wading through numerous Wodehouse bios by critics who don't ""get it"". Jeeves pulls yours truly from the muligatawny by bringing in this work by Mr. Green. ""Thank you Jeeves,"" I remark, cleverly providing the book title, ""you are a lifesaver"".Critics are forever attempting to dissect Wodehouse like some museum piece, claiming to unearth endless mysteries. But to anyone who's read and keeps reading Wodehouse, which is to say, likes reading him, the biggest mystery is how the critics seem to just not get it. The best example is the McCrum bio, of which it may be said that the tone is nothing like a Wodehouse book, and its author seems to be always looking over his shoulder at his other little playmate critics in the schoolyard, which alone accounts for such a blinkered bio. Wodehouse would more charitably say that with a Scottish name, McCrum probably got his disposition from wrestling with the harsh realities of St. Andrews and his times of testing on the links. But back to B.G..I wondered what earned the subtitle ""A Literary Biography"", and it is simply this. This is a book for those who already have read, or rather immersed themselves in Wodehouse. Mr. Green feels free to drop names constantly, but the lineage of these names lies in the novels. Or short stories. Or musicals. Or somewhere.That already will stave off those who are saying ""Wodehouse who?"" but there's a bit more. Mr. Green is, I surmise, British, and his book uses British spellings, which will fascinate Wodehouse readers who track down the British editions. But where other biographers try to simplify their endless arguments and discoveries into facts, facts, and more facts, Mr. Green goes the other way. He has a great many unknown facts at his fingertips, but he uses them to effortlessly springboard into the novels, there to find parallels with bits in Plum's life, but far more often to exult with the reader in what he finds there. I really thought I had read all that could be said about the Berlin Broadcasts, but no, I found more here. Green somehow manages to quote and cite far more interesting critics with far more interesting quotes that have escaped the other biographers I've read.That said, I ought to give a word of warning, that this book is harder to read than a Wodehouse book, even though at times it almost seems to be one, so lyrical is its prose. In its favor, I merely note that it is well worth reading. The Epilogue closes with a quote from Frank Swinnerton, which seems a decent summing up of Wodehouse in his era (and continuing into ours) ""in a period when laughter has been difficult, he has made men laugh without shame.""Not that I think everything else on Wodehouse is bad. I don't at all. Donaldson's is a very decent biography, and one of the first P.G.Wodehouse: The Authorised Biography, also the brief one by Connolly P.G.Wodehouse: An Illustrated Biography, and Jasen P.G. Wodehouse: Portrait of a Master. Malcolm Muggeridge has written of him in numerous places, including ""The Wodehouse Affair"" The Most of Malcolm Muggeridge. A decent short introduction (under 90 pages) is given by Warren Wind The World of P.G. Wodehouse, not to mention the not-to-be-missed guide by Usborne Plum Sauce: A  P. G. Wodehouse Companion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GW5AA2ZJ6I95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0831768630#wasThisHelpful","R1GW5AA2ZJ6I95","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never thought I'd be awarding this sort of movie five stars, but this is five stars. The characters are not cardboard cut-outs. The various stories intertwine as in a novel, the photography is excellent. There's even a bit of cinema verite, with the band Newsboys playing themselves. I thought the philosophy part would be a bit hackneyed, or at least simplified, but it's really not. I've read the books mentioned, and the film's writer did a good job representing those philosophies. Before I read Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion, I assumed there were some rather good arguments against the existence of God. Reading it convinced me there weren't any, or if there are, Dawkins is unaware of them.The striking similarity of the Genesis creation story and the Big Bang has been previously pointed out by astronomer Robert Jastrow in God and the Astronomers God and the Astronomers (New and Expanded Edition). Philosopher Richard Purtill, author of Reason to Believe Reason to Believe: Why Faith Makes Sense thought it was a good film, and pointed out that if Steven Hawking is an atheist, it might be noted that in occupying the chair of Sir Isaac Newton, he is occupying the chair of a theist (Newton believed in God). The film also alludes to the fact that if agnostics were earnest in the last century, in this century, atheism is often adopted out of convenience or as a default position (as when students signed the statement in the philosophy class in the film.As for the extras on the DVD, they include two excellent music videos, and a bit on students' right to religious freedom on university campuses, something also addressed in the earlier documentary with Ben Stein, Expelled Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. While it's not a point by point rebuttal, David Berlinski's book The Devil's Delusion The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions is an engaging discussion of some of these questions, and plays off of Dawkins' title. Philosopher Peter Kreeft has written numerous books, but a few are highly readable explorations of basic philosophical questions, such as The Best Things in Life The Best Things in Life. An extremely readable book dealing with some of the science surrounding the Big Bang in relation to the existence of God and similar questions is The New Story of Science The New Story of Science.Mortimer Adler, editor of the Great Books, offered a proof of the existence of God in How to Prove There Is a God: Mortimer J. Adler's Writings and Thoughts About God, but admitted that once you've done that, it's still only a philosophical proof. Philosopher Anthony Flew, the last century's most celebrated atheist, one the other hand, gives a readable and engrossing account of his conversion in There is a God There Is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind, and finds in this realization, as do characters in the film, a cause for celebration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CFY9MCAGGHHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD5HFJG#wasThisHelpful","R3CFY9MCAGGHHI","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know who this book is for. Post-literates (people who don't choose to read) won't read it. There are some thought-provoking questions at the end of the brief chapters, but Turner rightly realizes that they need some back story. The problem with media criticism is one encounters media in the middle (which is what it means), immediately and now, when to get any grip on it one needs to go back to its beginnings. A Canadian Catholic named Marshall McLuhan already said all that in the '60s, but he did so in a way that was sometimes confusing and complex. Unpacking his short, pithy quips leads to much longer studies like this one.But it's not really a study. Turner is at his best relating his personal stories (which he could do forever as he knows everyone), as he does in his best books like The Gospel According to the Beatles The Gospel According to the Beatles and Imagine Imagine: A Vision for Christians in the Arts. He can't simply do that here because it's an InterVarsity Press book. Therefore it has to be about some mix of culture and faith. The chapter on ""popular culture"" in the Bible seems to interrupt the book, although it's actually quite good. The Bible doesn't say a lot about what we now consider popular culture, he says, the reason being because it's only existed since the dawn of what McLuhan calls ""the electric environment"".I would consider this book an impossible one to write, especially the way Turner breaks it out into different media-- movies, advertising, fashion (which I would not think of including), when it seems to me certain forms of pop culture have more in common than not. He's certainly right to warn the innocent of ulterior motives of writers, hidden agendas in movies, that music is made for money, and the rest of the dark side of being on the receiving end of pop culture. Perhaps for that reason I preferred his book Imagine, about being on the giving side of pop culture. But there's something else here. It seems to me that since the writing of that book and this book, Turner has become untethered. He continually refers to his church, but it doesn't seem to make any difference. I would call him a post-Anglican, except that's just a stereotype I may have since he is British. He may have never been Anglican. But, as many others of us have done, he seems to run up against the problem of being your own pope.He quotes the right people, like Malcolm Muggeridge, but fails to mention MM's book, Christ and the Media Christ and the Media as a brief but incisive (and shocking, because unexpected) exploration of the same topic. He asks about ""good and bad"" in relation to pop culture, but knows full well that has been simply explored by Francis Schaeffer in his booklet, Art and the Bible (InterVarsity Press) Art and the Bible (IVP Classics). Visual art has been explored by Turner's friend and fellow Brit, musician and poet Steve Scott, in Crying for a Vision Crying for a Vision and Other Essays: The Collected Steve Scott Vol. One. The websites to explore seem to be almost randomly cut and pasted from the Internet, and the entire book has a rushed feel to it. I wondered why Turner would use one of the worst Bible translations, the NRSV, when the RSV is one of the best, but one finds out as one reads along. The RSV is not lost in the modern world, however. It is the foundation of the ESV, and the Ignatius Catholic Study Bible is based on the British RSV.I don't know if other readers will consider this book rambling. It sort of is, but that's the part I like. It's somewhat Steve thinking out loud. Although he confesses his diffidence and misgivings in the introduction, he pretty much opts to charge in, full speed ahead. This produces chapters that seem too telegraphic, sprinkled with anecdotes which seem too few, with overarching conclusions that seem too broad. But there's almost no way to start media criticism except with a question. There's no way to climb a mountain except with a first step. And part of the illusion of media is to seem so massive and all-encompassing, so impenetrable that it becomes synonymous with reality. Turner helps us at least notice the man behind the curtain. And that's a start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P97NTSWXX7VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=083083768X#wasThisHelpful","R2P97NTSWXX7VK","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why did I give the first Alice Faye box set four stars and this one five? No real reason. Maybe because there were four films in that set and five in this one (which seems like a better deal), or maybe because I like these somewhat better. Maybe they could both average out to four and a half. Once again, I give Leonard Maltin's views from his Classic Movie Guide (this is the edition I actually read, but there is a later, expanded edition) Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide, followed by my own impressions.Rose of Washington Square. B&W, 1939. LM says, ""so-so musical"", and gives it two and a half stars. I sort of agree and sort of don't. LM has watched lots of musicals, but I never tire of them. This is a musical within a musical (as so many of these films tend to be), this one set in the '20s during Prohibition. Alice Faye is fantastic with Tyrone Power, and it's great to see William Frawley from I Love Lucy in this film.Hollywood Cavalcade. B&W and color, 1939. ""Colorful film starts out fun"", says LM, giving it two and a half stars. Why B&W and color? Because the setting this time is 1913, the beginning of slapstick comedy (and the end of it). LM thinks the slapstick was well done. I didn't really, but then there's so much great stuff from Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and others of the silent era that can likely not be bettered.The Great American Broadcast. B&W, 1941. LM says, ""Entertaining...bright cast"", giving it two and a half stars. My own view is that John Payne is fantastic, while Jack Oakie falls somewhat flat. But there are plenty of other acts that more than make up for it. Alice is the bombshell at the birth of radio, or rather of radio as a means of entertainment, but it's a very visual film.Hello Frisco Hello. Color, 1943. LM did not like this film, calling it ""a hackneyed musicomedy...a big comedown from earlier musicals for this trio,"" and gave it two stars. Perhaps so, but I liked it immensely. John Payne and Alice Faye are once again amazing together. What more do you need? The setting this time is the gold rush, and it does sort of seem like a comic western. Similar ground was worked later by Disney in The Happiest Millionaire Disney 4-Movie Collection: Classics (Gnome-Mobile / Darby O'gill & Little People / One & Only Genuine Family / Happiest Millionaire).Four Jills in a Jeep. B&W, 1944. LM gives it two and a half stars and says, ""some good musical moments"". Phil Silvers for some reason overacts, unlike when he later played almost the same role in Sgt Bilko (the Phil Silvers Show) Sgt. Bilko: The Phil Silvers Show-50th Anniversary Edition. This film introduces Dick Haymes, who would go on to star in such xlnt films as St. Benny the Dip Classic Comedy Triple Feature, Vol. 2 - St. Benny the Dip / Behave Yourself / Topper Returns, and her plays a singing soldier. In this film about the first female USO performers, both Carmen Miranda and Alice Faye reprise their best songs from the other films.This box set holds five one-sided discs in snap cases, with one booklet for all five films.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3J1GGNBP08G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018RKEQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3J1GGNBP08G","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having come upon this set in the manner of one watching Turner Classic Movies, having no idea of who Alice Faye was, but hoping for some light entertainment, I can say I was not disappointed. I cannot add any bio. or tech. detail about the actress or these films, so I merely note Leonard Maltin's reviews in his Classic Movie Guide Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide and give my own brief impression.Lilian Russell. LM calls this a ""strained bio."" and gives it two stars. It's in black and white, from 1940, and carries a disclaimer that this is the best print they could find. It's the only one of these films that seems chopped up and the only one I didn't watch all the way through.On the Avenue. B&W, 1937. LM calls this a ""tasteful, intelligent musical"" and gives it three stars (the highest rating of the four films in this set). I'm inclined to agree. It's also full of catchy Irving Berlin tunes. Many reviewers say Alice Faye has an amazing voice, and I'm inclined to agree. Her singing style seems effortless and unforced, with her staring straight ahead. It's very compelling and refreshing after so much overdone singing in so many musicals.That Night in Rio. Technicolor, 1941. LM calls it a ""Standard Fox musical of mistaken identities,"" awarding two and a half stars. Perhaps so, but I found it rather decent and amusing. After all, aren't all of Wodehouse's novels the same story? Yet the endless variations are endlessly compelling. And Carmen Miranda is a ball of fire. Don Ameche plays his two roles rather well as well.The Gang's All Here. Color, 1943. LM calls this a ""visually dazzling wartime musical"", and gives it two and a half stars.Well-packaged with four one-sided discs in individual snap cases in a box set, with individual four page booklets on each film, and extras (most of which I didn't watch). There's also a second box set, this one with five Alice Faye films (see my review) Alice Faye Collection 2 (Rose of Washington Square/Hollywood Cavalcade/The Great American Broadcast/Hello, Frisco, Hello/Four Jills in a Jeep) (Full Chk Gift)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHWWT7PKI2I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K7VHMS#wasThisHelpful","RJHWWT7PKI2I7","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How can it possibly be that a collection of the most intriguing British writer of the 20th century could rate less than five stars? Merely due to, as another reviewer has already noted, the lack of attribution, which means where something is from. The reason the Internet is largely a random rumor mill is due to lack of attribution. Without knowing where something comes from you can't track it down, and whoever wrote or said it can't be held accountable. That probably seems neither here nor there, but this book provides a very concrete example of why it matters.It is simply this. The form or layout or style of this book varies slightly entry to entry (day to day), but for the most part it runs something like this: A Bible verse, then a tiny shred (from Chesterton),  followed by a larger shred from Chesterton. The Bible verse, we are told, comes from the King James (Authorized) version of the Bible (probably from 1611 or 1625). However, the interesting front note advises us that verses marked NKJV are from the New King James Version, the copyright for which happens to belong to Thomas Nelson publishers, who also published this book. That's a very convenient thing to do, and is often done, and it's not a problem. We are told where in the Bible each verse comes from, in other words, its attribution. You can look it up yourself, if so inclined (and you might be, because the Shakespearean language of the KJV is very beautiful, and the NKJV brings it a bit up to date by dropping out the ""Thees"" and ""Thous"").So you'd think or hope that the Chesterton quotes would likewise be traceable and can be tracked down. Alas and alack, no such luck. The tiny quotes under the Bible verses don't even say they're from GKC (I read about a dozen before I realized they were). The larger shred says what it's from, but not when. Unlike the Bible quote, the GKC shred doesn't cite chapter and verse. In short, you can't track it down. And the effect of a book like this is to make you want to track it down.If you're an absolute beginner regarding Chesterton (which is how we all start), this might be OK. But a great many readers drawn to this book would not be. Someone who has never spent a day or an hour with Chesterton probably would not want to spend a year with him, although he does have a way of drawing one in. Chesterton was so prolific, no one can read all of Chesterton. At least that's the view of the man who tried to do so, Dale Ahlquist, who writes and hosts a TV series on EWTN about Chesterton called ""The Apostle of Common Sense"", of which about four seasons are out. I have the same complaint with that show, that tantalizing nuggets are dropped right and left, with no way to pick them up as we are swept by on a whirlwind tour that leaves the viewer dazzled and dazed.Realizing this, Alquist wrote a book with the same title which considers some of Chesterton's 100 or so books so that the reader has a place to start G. K. Chesterton:  Apostle of Common Sense. He wrote another one full of brief quotes considering Chesterton's ideas Common Sense 101: Lessons from Chesterton, and then a third one looking at various aspects of his thinking The Complete Thinker: The Marvelous Mind of G.K. Chesterton. In each of these he provides a framework around the quotes and relates them to his own journey.Is that the only way to start? No, not at all. Ignatius Press has set itself the possibly impossible task of publishing all the Chesterton in collected volumes, and they have quite a few out. Shoot for the moon, as they say, and if you miss, you may fall among the stars (which you wouldn't because stars are further out than the moon, but you get the idea). I discovered GKC in college in a book of non-fiction essays, of which his was the most intriguing, and which I never forgot. It was called ""On Lying in Bed"", and there are numerous collections of his essays, like this recent one, In Defense of Sanity: The Best Essays of G.K. Chesterton.However, almost no one would pick up an essay collection by an unknown writer right out of the box. A great many people (I know one) likely come upon GKC through his novels and short stories, particularly the Father Brown mysteries, which were made into British TV shows in the mid-seventies, and have been so recently again by the BBC. I can't even begin to link to all of them. Arguably, if you did come across a particularly engaging, enticing or challenging quote in this volume during your year with Chesterton, the longer bits have at least the name of the book or article at the bottom. And if the downside of the Internet is its lack of attribution, the upside is that it will probably put you, as in a Father Brown mystery, on the trail.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CU52FRTKKJ4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595554939#wasThisHelpful","R3CU52FRTKKJ4M","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw Roy Schoeman on ""Journey Home"", a TV program on the EWTN network. Many guests have interesting stories about their spiritual journeys, but few are as articulate, literate, and at ease telling them. Especially since the second half of the show has viewers call in or e-mail questions which, I should think, would be somewhat unnerving. But Schoeman also turned out to be the author of a book called Salvation is From the Jews which I had just read, with the intriguing subtitle: ""The role of Judaism in salvation history from Abraham to the second coming"" Salvation Is from the Jews. That sounds like a long period of time. Does he skip over the ghastly anti-semitism of some places and times? No, he does not. There is a chapter on the roots of Nazism for example, also documented in this book by another Jewish author The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII And His Secret War Against Nazi Germany.So I was very excited to find Honey from the Rock, and to hear about more people's journeys, but it wasn't what I expected. The first two accounts are from the 19th century, and the first one, that of Alphonse Ratisbonne, Schoeman himself translated from the French. Both of them are painful to read due to incidents of anti-semitism. But both are also amazingly supernatural. Over half of the writers in this collection are from the current era. When I had nearly finished the book, I saw one of the authors on the Journey Home TV show, which could date from some time back, as EWTN re-airs shows from the past as the program is so popular. The host, Marcus Grodi, also has compiled some of the stories in a book, Journeys Home Journeys Home.I would say this book is directed toward Catholics due to the subtitle: ""Sixteen Jews find the sweetness of Christ"". And they may find it eye-opening, as I did. However, it could just as well say ""the sweetness of the Messiah"", because ""Christ"" isn't Jesus' last name, it's the Greek word for Messiah, and both words mean ""anointed one"". If the name ""Jesus"" is a stumbling block, it could be Joshua, as it's the same name, or in Hebrew, Yeshua. That's one thing I learned in this book. Nearly all of the members of the early church (which means assembly) led by St. Peter (the first pope) were Jewish. Mary and Joseph, both Jewish, were both descendants of King David, so their son, Yeshua, was in that lineage. I could go on all day about the numerous fulfilled prophecies, but the sixteen authors in this book put it so much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OIH19KVYDVL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586171151#wasThisHelpful","R3OIH19KVYDVL8","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""hard choices"" of the present era are those forced on Americans by H. Clinton. She is not making them, we are. All of the bad ideas the current president has put into place are actually hers. His first day in office he put into action her agenda, which had been fought down, voted down and turned down many times before. Her vastly unpopular FOCA bill which, for instance, every Catholic congregation wrote against to their representatives and congresspersons, was systematically put through in pieces as riders on other bills, beginning with the children's health act.She is also behind the HHS Mandate. Mandate, mind you, as in mandatory. Not voluntary. Not voted in. Mandated in the fashion of a totalitarian government. Never mind that it's anti-conscience, anti-life, anti-choice, anti-freedom. If H. Clinton can force through a bill, as she has been doing ever since the Clinton's law practice in Arkansas, she will. If she can blackmail world leaders in an official capacity, she will. If she can send up a smoke screen to cover it all in this book, she will. Don't make it worse by giving her money for her book. She doesn't need it. She's already found numerous ways to take your money from you. The current president merely obliged.When Planned Parenthood gave her its Margaret Sanger award, she perhaps didn't know that the founder of PP was anti-Jew, anti-Black, and anti-Catholic. Maybe they didn't know. Maybe they don't care. Maybe it means nothing to them that Sanger traveled to Germany and gave her approval of the eugenics program that led to the Final Solution, and which PP carries on today. If that seems entirely in conflict with her supposed Methodist faith, maybe again H. Clinton simply doesn't care. After all, Nancy Pelosi doesn't seem to know what it means to be a Catholic, or not the sort that listen to the pope.The saddest part of it may be that she pretends to represent women, despite the great number who see through her machinations, and expects them to support her. Certainly the vocal ones in the media seem to, but then reporters are seldom mistaken for deep thinkers. It seems like a million years ago when Bill Clinton was in office. At that time the leading atheist of the day was so anti-Clinton that Christopher Hitchens wrote an expose of them No One Left To Lie To Publisher: Verso. Apparently there are plenty of people left to lie to. For some reason, although she's managed to do everything up 'till now without a popular vote and by simply forcing her way through, she can't seem to just take over the country. So there's talk of her trying to run for president. That's one bad idea the people will have a chance to veto for reasons you won't find in this book. And it's an easy choice.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPCJ01CR6TE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476751447#wasThisHelpful","RSPCJ01CR6TE4","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chesterton wrote the first Father Brown story in 1911. It was the first thing he wrote that clicked with the British public. The amazing thing is that 100 years later, it's still clicking. This series aired on PBS Mystery! in the states forty years ago. Just now have the two series been collected by Acorn Media into one four disc DVD set. Unlike a great many shows from the '70s, this one is still eminently watchable. One reason is that it was set in the 'tens and 'twenties, and thus has a period look. Another reason is that Chesterton is his own animal. This series tantalizingly draws one in, and makes one want to read the stories. Penguin released its five individual Father Brown paperbacks in a box set in 1982, featuring Kenneth More from this series as Father Brown on the covers. These four one-sided discs are the same ones that appeared in the two disc individual sets for season one (purple) and season two (green).My favorite episodes in this series are those with Flambeau, because I think he and Father Brown make good sidekicks. But I confess to being very taken with Chesterton's short stories  that don't feature Father Brown. These include Four Faultless Felons Four Faultless Felons, The Club of Queer Trades (which may not actually be mysteries in the strict sense) The Club of Queer Trades, The Poet and the Lunatics The Poet and the Lunatics: Episodes in the Life of Gabriel Gale (Dover Books on Literature & Drama), and The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond (Dover Books on Literature & Drama). Of his novels, my favorite is The Ball and the Cross The Ball and the Cross. Second probably The Flying Inn The Flying Inn. Orthodoxy, which reads like a novel, is, in my view, one of the best non-fiction books ever written Orthodoxy.There aren't many other authors from a century ago one can easily read, or who move so seamlessly to television. As of this writing, I've not seen the new BBC Father Brown shows, and cannot vouch for them, but this shows that in these 13 episodes from forty years ago, which only covered about one fourth of the Father Brown stories, Kenneth More has whetted viewers appetites for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUH3A4OO767JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYZ0ZLS#wasThisHelpful","RUH3A4OO767JF","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost called this review ""After Alwyn"", as Red Alert came out after Malcolm and Alwyn had gone their separate ways, both continuing to make amazing music and follow their callings. First, about M and A. Their two records were truly amazing. Fool's Wisdom is an eternal gem from the Jesus Music/ Calvary Chapel era that I and about a million other people will always love Fool's Wisdom Wildwall. The next album, Wildwall, isn't overall as strong, but it has a couple amazing songs, first and foremost, the anthemic ballad, ""England Goodbye"", which is almost like Barry McGuire's hit ""Eve of Destruction"" written by P.F. Sloan. Larry Norman produced an album of Alwyn Wall Band, and in the little-known double Myrrh sampler album, Jubilation, there's a Norman song called ""Dear Malcolm, Dear Alwyn"". See how witty that Wildwall title was, combining the names of Malcom Wild and Alwyn Wall, with the refrain, ""the writing's on the Wildwall""?But I digress. Maranatha (or some associated label imprint like A&S) released a stellar sampler album called ""Back to the Rock"", certainly rockier than the series of also good Marantha! albums, which introduced Malcolm and the Mirrors, along with other artists such as the Altar Boys and Undercover and Leslie Phillips (AKA Sam Phillips) to the wider world beyond Southern California (thank you from the other 49 states). Another album that did that was ""What's Shakin'"" a new wave sort of sampler on the MRC (Ministry Resource Center) label released in the mid-80s. That said, the subject matter of this disc is still unique. The title song is about Cheyenne Mountain, the failsafe missile base set up as a US defensive during the cold war. My favorite song on this disc is ""She's Going to Go Through Changes"". This is one of those Maranatha discs that seem to be different on side A and B, and some people may think the new wave on the flip side is too subtle and restrained. But so was most of the early new wave introduced on ""Night Tracks"" on Ted Turner's Superstation, and on fledgling MTV.Anyway, this is, to my mind, another great album lost in time, and one which I greatly wish was on CD (a slightly later technology than records). If the world ever gets tired of decadence and glitz and overproduction, it might for some reason enter some post-apocalyptic phase where it longs for something innocent, and in that empty space can hear again simple, creative artists in a fresh and new way. Or, if you don't want to wait that long, you could hear it now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M24TJIPP5SBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YP1SD4#wasThisHelpful","R1M24TJIPP5SBS","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This hardback is really an 82 page essay (93 counting the index). This is the only reason it gets four stars. But that's not a fault. ""Lightly"" is the style of PGW, and the right style for a bio of him, not, in my view, like McCrum's, which is anything but light, and in my view again, completely misses the Wodehouse sensibility. If you miss that, you've missed it all, and I'm quite certain that's why we read him. If you like reading brief books anyway, if you love the form of the essay, if you want a well-written book you can read in one sitting, or a couple if you like to lounge with a libation, Wodehouse style, as you read, here you go. Don't pay too much for this book, but if it's the sort of book you like, don't miss it either.Well, are there any other good, and a bit longer bios with the Wodehouse sensibility? Luckily, there are. Donaldson's, Jansen's, and Connolly's are all highly recommended. My edition of The World of Wodehouse, published by Hutchinson in 1981 (reprinted from 1971) has a red cover with a black and white picture of PGW in one of the cars he crashed (he drove no better than some of the characters in his novels). The red cover looks rather better than the one shown here. Since Wodehouse's own stories and novels kept being collected in volumes with titles like ""The World of Jeeves"", this book is easy to miss in the plethora of similarly-titled collections. Here are some links for some of the above-mentioned books, not that I'm suggesting paying a ridiculous price merely because they may be out of print. P G WODEHOUSE - A Biography; P.G.

"There are three ways to view this 350 page, hardback, color-drenched, oversize coffee table book. One is as a dazzlingly attractive, endlessly fascinating art book, all the better because so much of it will be familiar to anyone who's ever had the good fortune to see Rocky and Bullwinkle, George of the Jungle, or even Quisp or Captain Crunch on TV, which is at least a million of us. The second is to read the captions under all the pictures, which will make you wonder about the amazing talents that produced this amazing art. The third is to read the book, which I might term ""The Writing About the Art of Jay Ward Productions. Coffee table books are usually quickly-produced, cut and paste productions, you note. Yes, but as anyone who had the good fortune to read his book ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" knows, not when the author is DVC.DVC is a one-man Wikipedia. He doesn't just edit these books, he writes a compendium of tributes to the unsung heroes behind the scenes, and sings them in an ecstatic, enthralling way. Not only animators, but designers, layout persons, directors, and artists. He also explains the difference between theatrical animation and TV cartoons, and the difference it made and makes. The only other book I've read that deals with the exigencies of TV cartoons this well is Joe Murray's Creating Animated Cartoons With Character. See also my Amazon Guide, which I'll write after this review, because this new, stripped down way to write reviews on Amazon doesn't seem to let you link to other products, like Joe Murray's book. I think I'll call it a guide to Darrell Van Citters, although I don't pretend it will be exhaustive, as his work is everywhere I look.I merely note that since the Magoo book, published only last year, is already being scalped for ridiculous amounts on Amazon, it's time to republish it at a reasonable price. So, you cartoon buffs, get this book now at Amazon's great price, which will enable Oxberry Press to republish the other book. Win, win. And here's a third win. At a time when major publishers insist they need to make their coffee table books in China, Oxberry managed to create this one in the Great White North, aka Canada (Dover Press even manages to make their books in Canada's southern neighbor, the USA).

"In his excellent book about reading, An Experiment in Criticism An Experiment in Criticism (Canto), C.S. Lewis made an argument that there are different kinds of readers. Whether you view this as three or five stars will depend on what sort of reader you are. This is the Lewis for those who read The Discarded Image The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature (Canto Classics) and his volume on sixteenth century literature English Literature in the Sixteenth Century. Lewis was chair of Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge, and in a certain sense, these reviews center around classical and English literature, but at one remove, with Lewis reviewing someone's book on an Arthurian tale. What's interesting about this is it puts you in Lewis' own milieu, interacting with the authors and ideas, through books, of his day. It's also interesting to note who published these reviews. Many were in the Oxford Magazine or ""Theology"". The new essay here was written for T.S. Eliot, editor of ""The New Criterion"".This essay makes some interesting points, and seems to me to go with The Abolition of Man The Abolition of Man. although I found it more readable than that book, which always seemed to me to be an answer to a controversy I know nothing about. Fortunately, Cambridge Press/ Canto has enabled the ""Look Inside"" feature, so a prospective reader can scan the contents. I was interested to read reviews of authors I've read other books by, but I'd have liked Lewis to have reviewed other books by them, such as George Steiner's ""In Bluebeard's Castle"" and Denis de Rougemont's ""Love Declared"". General readers may enjoy the four reviews of his friend, Tolkien's, books, and some, like me, the reviews of Charles Williams' poetry. The best writing on that, however is the preface from ""Essays Presented to Charles Williams"", the entire book being well-worth reading Essays Presented to Charles Williams.So now we come to more likely readers for this collection. Those who are reading Milton, or the same person writing about Milton whom Lewis here reviews. Or Spenser, or The Odyssey. Almost everywhere Lewis lets drop a brief, perceptive comment that readers will find invaluable. Another invaluable thing is the nearly forty pages of notes in the back. These would be more helpful as footnotes (and less likely to be missed), but they add immeasurably to the reviews. I have trod softly in this review, my only goal being to dissuade a certain sort of reader who reads Lewis for the stories or apologetics, and to persuade another sort of reader who favors the academic side. As an example of the second sort, a philosophy professor, on hearing I had obtained this volume, immediately asked to borrow it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZGT9M5F331U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107639271#wasThisHelpful","R26ZGT9M5F331U","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a novel by P.G. Wodehouse, Bertie Wooster refers to ""hymns, ancient and modern"". This reminds me of when Larry Norman said that the musicians of his time may be writing the hymns of tomorrow. His prediction has certainly come true in non-denominational churches which feature a worship band or team, and in Catholic youth Masses, not the sort from the '60s, but new ones called Lifeteen. However, most ""Jesus Music"" was not really that. What it was was very individual, finely crafted rock music, at least as varied and expressive as anything now, much less overproduced, overarranged, and overeyerythinged than is pop music today, whether it passes as country or rock.I still have this record, but I just played the CD in my car, because it's much easier to do. It's only new listeners who have revived the sensibilities of records (and more power to them!). I gave this a five, but anyone may disagree, because this music is so personal (not private but, individual), so, to my mind, artistic, and creative. When records existed, I only owned, and then played a few, and played them every day. This is another album that reminds me that the hippie lifestyle was about seeking. Almost everything was good about it, despite the fact that it is denounced today as hopelessly naive. I learn from the notes in the CD liner that Mike Johnson was involved with InterVarsity, a sort of college fellowship group attracting thinking people, with an emphasis on missions, and which still provides books through InterVarsity Press. Back to the CD. Let me say why for me it's a five.What it instantly reminds me of is one of the best albums of that era, White Horse, by Michael O'Martian White Horse, who was himself involved with another college outreach group, Campus Crusade. Both these groups predate the hippie/ Jesus Movement time, and had, if anything, a harder sell, to the ridiculous Esquire/ frat/ Playboy/ sexual revolution culture, the heirs of which run TV and most other media today (which is probably why most of it is so boring, uncreative, corporate, and a waste of time compared to the freshness of this music and this era. Like so many other groups and bands of the time, Mike Johnson was an original, and this is his best CD, in my opinion. It has two elements almost missing from music today-- he's an intellectual and the music is seeped in jazz. There's also the sort of loose, joyful playing that has been beaten out of anything tagged with the cookie cutter label ccm, which is why so many would dismiss this CD out of hand (guilt by association). The CD ends with an extremely decent instrumental jazz bit which I used to play everyday.This last cut puts it in the camp of the amazing creative mavericks who refused to play the ccm game, at least early on, like James Vincent, whose first album (the name escapes me) is a stellar example of this sort of creativity. Another name is Jeff Johnson, in his vocal albums, beginning with The Face of the Deep, continuing through Pilgrimage and the like. I also think of that unheard benchmark of amazing psychedelia, ""Awaiting Your Reply"" by Resurrection Band Awaiting Your Reply / Resurrection Band One song reminds me of Country Joe and the Fish (without the Fish cheer that begins their Woodstock set), leaning a bit toward Canned Heat and, yes, some Dylan.The other early releases on Born Twice Records show how incredibly varied this era of music was. They include three albums I had records of: Amaziah (formerly released on Tunesmith Records) Straight Talker; Daniel Amos' ""Shotgun Angel"" Shotgun Angel  which came out of the Calvary Chapel cornucopia of music, bands and creativity, the like of which has never been seen again; and Bill Mason Band's ""No Sham"" No Sham , an original British punk rock band/ album, the songs of which even how I could sing (as much as one can sing punk songs). If I had my druthers, I'd wish for someone to release even more obscure music, my favorite being Malcom and the Mirrors' ""Red Alert"" Red Alert, which also came from the Calvary Chapel renaissance. Will you be disappointed by this Mike Johnson CD? You might, for the simple reason that it doesn't sound like everything else. Some of us think that's a good thing. Anyone interested in the rest of the story might consider Mark Powell's excellent volume (great writing, bad publisher-forced title) Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music [With CDROM] (Recent Releases).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OOJ1JYR7UJQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GPDMFC#wasThisHelpful","R3OOJ1JYR7UJQV","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Walt Disney saw Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol, the first animated Christmas special, airing in 1962, he called up Lee Mishkin to tell him how wonderful he thought it was, and to say it would endure from generation to generation, to be watched with his grandkids and ever after. It's been over fifty years, and Walt's been proved right. The only thing that could improve this special would be to remaster it so the colors were as sharp and bright as half a century ago, and to provide interviews with voice actors and commentary by Darrell Van Citters, author of the definitive and delightful coffee table book that goes behind the making of the special. Done and done.This 2011 rerelease DVD edition, while very reasonably priced, includes all that and more. Darrell's book provides a marvelous addition, as two of the bonus features on the disc feature storyboards, along with the completed art from the show. Unfortunately, people are scalping the book on Amazon, at such a ridiculous price I can't even print it. One may have better luck with Van Citters' book on Jay Ward Studio art, which is just being released at the end of 2013.

"A great many reviewers have given this collection four or five stars. I was skeptical, but now I heartily share their views. Leonard Maltin, in his indispensable Classic Movie Guide Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide gives all six of these films 2.5 or 3 stars, well in the realm of an LM thumbs up. He and these other perceptive Amazon patrons have more than covered these films, so I will just make a few comments based on my own viewing.These films are part Vaudeville, part stand-up, part radio merging into TV, part sitcom, part play, part musical, and most of all,  vehicles for singing stars like Bing, and comic entertainers of the day such as George and Gracie, of whom I can never get enough. Here's my down and dirty shooting from the hip review. First of all, it's almost a no-brainer to get this collection, since here are six films, well-packaged, for less than the usual cost of one DVD. And little-seen films. But, I promised, and here goes. ""College Humor"" I didn't find very funny, but ""We're Not Dressing"" I did. ""Here is My Heart"" sparkles with Roland Young, not as comic relief, but an integral part of the ensemble. Bing, it seems to me, generally plays himself, as in the ""Road"" pictures, but in ""Mississippi,"" he doesn't. In fact, no one does in that film, made from a book, and in which the actors try to adhere to a story line, and which features, unfortunate roles for Black performers, including kids. ""Sing You Sinners"" is a quite decent little film, with Fred MacMurray and Bing as brothers, and Bing the slacker of the two. In ""Welcome Stranger,"" Bing adheres to the role of a doctor, but seems to still play himself. A good story in the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" vein, with some great songs like ""Smile Right Back at the Sun.""It's an understatement to say they don't make movies like this anymore, but why don't they? Because these are seen as too underbudget, unpolished, impromptu and naive. But I far prefer them over bloated big-budget blockbusters with a special effects budget in the stratosphere. These are also all-family movies. Finally, a reason to own a DVD player. Keep em' coming, Universal. Thank you, Bing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EH2OOEQMLV8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041T50J2#wasThisHelpful","R3EH2OOEQMLV8Y","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series is at once grand and a disappointment. Despite wonderful and unforgettable characters, particularly Beach the Butler, played by Mark Williams, and Freddie, played by Jack Farthing, and Lord Emsworth, played by Timothy Spall; and despite a seemingly unlimited repertoire of witty remarks, the one thing that can be said without fear of contradiction is that Wodehouse would not have written these scripts. What he did write were a series of light, winsome, innocent novels, and it would be sad if viewers of this series who were new to Wodehouse thought the show accurately reflected his Blandings series.For here you get the some bits of the novels, but what is missing is the light, winsome, and innocent, adjectives always applicable to the books. So, instead of getting humorous viewing for all the family, you get here the sort of thing that makes BBC America so unwatchable, and for all I know, the real version in the UK is somewhat worse. This is the main reason for buying a series like this on DVD in the first place-- to avoid the tiresome excesses of ill-advised programming on such channels. This series could be saved by a judicious censor, or by inserting a bar of soap in the mouths of certain characters at certain places in the shows, but barring that, I would give this series a miss.Unimaginable as it seems, for the second time, the British Empire, or the Commonwealth, or whatever it goes by these days, has proven that it doesn't get Wodehouse's brand of gentle slapstick at all. The first time was the ghastly affair of the Berlin broadcasts. The second was and is producing such travesties as this series. Particularly the sixth and last episode in this two disc set is virtually unwatchable and unlistenable. The good news is that there is nothing in the books with this sort of language anywhere. I merely note that, as Wodehouse has outlived many other bad writers, he will outlive these at the BBC or wherever they are who are writing, as Bertie Wooster would say, ""such bilge."" It merely remains to be said, as readers of Wodehouse already know, and which hopefully viewers of these shows will discover, but of which writers of this series are apparently unawares, that to enter the timeless world of Wodehouse's innocent slapstick, one need merely open the books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGA0QOUJ5HQZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7AM2WO#wasThisHelpful","RGA0QOUJ5HQZ1","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"French comics are readily available in German or Spanish, but few have been translated into English. Why? Certainly the enthusiastic reception of Tintin in English-reading countries bodes well for other European comics as well. Here is a case in point. This is one of a handful of Spirou and Fantasio comics to appear in an English edition, and only the second one by Franquin, so far as I know. The previous comic, ""Z is for Zorglub"" published in the US in 1995 by Fantasy Flight Publishing is sufficient, by itself, to establish his reputation as a brilliant artist and comics writer, and is now regarded as a collector's item.Spirou and Fantasio introduced the unique and lovable Marsupilami, a cartoon featuring whom made it to American shores in a much-changed Disney version as part of the short-lived Raw Toonage show. Twenty-two artists and authors have worked on Spirou and Fantasio, we are told in the back matter of The Marsupilami Thieves, and the characters have been reinterpreted as often as Mickey Mouse. Nevertheless, it's the Belgian artist Franquin who, for two decades drew and developed this trio, as in the present volume, published by Dupuis in French in 1954. I applaud UK publisher Cinebook for making it available in English, as they have other European comics, and hope they will extend their publishing venture to the entirety of Franquin's creative endeavors, including Gaston and his other characters. As for quality, The Marsupilami Thieves (Spirou and Fantasio No. 5), showcases Franquin's art in an oversized color paperback, with an engrossing story that will enthrall lovers of Tintin and other European comics. Thank you Cinebook for bringing Franquin to our notice and our shores.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGD4WYO5M4LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849181675#wasThisHelpful","R1IGD4WYO5M4LU","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With all the lavish, color coffee table books featuring these beautiful cars, why would you want this 200 page, 12"" X 8.5"" black and white paperback? Merely because, as the publisher notes in the 2009 671 Press edition, those books are written today, looking backward. This book collects articles from the '60s and '70s when the cars were new, looking forward.Author Martyn L. Schorr was formerly editor for Hi Performance CARS magazine, from which these bits were taken, along with SPEED, SUPERSTOCK, and SUPERCAR publications. That's about eighty articles, ranging from test drives to racing to performance packages to wing car stats.

"Last Gasp Press saved Michael Farr's Tintin: The Complete Companion, Tintin: the Complete Companion by reprinting it. Now they've done likewise with Farr's Tintin and Co. The 2007 UK edition from Egmont Press is a 130 page, 12"" X 9"", red-jacketed hardback, which matches Egmont's English language Tintin books. Every page has black and white photographs and color frames from Tintin adventures. One reviewer complained that probably everything in this book is in the Companion. Perhaps so. But they are not the same book at all.The Companion is arranged by the 23 Tintin adventures (and one unfinished one). This book profiles a dozen characters: Tintin, Snowy, and ten more. It must be obvious that someone reading all the Tintin adventures would next reach for the Companion. But to find out when General Alcazar made his first appearance, or Rastapopoulos his last, one need only consult Tintin and Co. Somewhat easier than leafing through 24 Tintin books.Someone who likes to dive deep can delve into one of the biographies of Herge. A more casual reader may prefer the Companion. But anyone who has seen the Tintin movie or one of the animated episodes will be fascinated by this volume, which serves as a graphic invitation to the books. Lay this book on the coffee table, and I defy your guests not to pick it up. As I write, a calendar of Herge's wonderful art graces the wall above my desk. This book overflows with such perfectly composed  still shots. Enjoyment of Tintin crosses the generations, and the many families who read his adventures together will also enjoy brushing up on the backstories and inspirations of Herge's famous creation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8PADCD0P871E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0867196904#wasThisHelpful","R8PADCD0P871E","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These black and white shows, dating mostly from the early '50s, rank among the most delightful TV I've seen in a long time. The price right now is nearly free for 38 episodes on 4 discs. Mill Creek has packaged the discs safely and economically in little paper sleeves that stack in the DVD case. The writing is simply wonderful. Witty, low-key, never snarkey. Devoid in every way of the elements that writers today feel are required in a sitcom, and which this show shows are not. Don DeFore is Oz's next door neighbor in the earlier shows, and he's a ball of fire. Many know about Rick Nelson's singing career, but David holds his own in the show quite well, and Harriet gets a lot of good lines and deadpan refrains. Since Ozzie was a bandleader, there's lots of music worked into the shows. Why not five stars? It could be five stars, simply based on entertainment value and enjoyment quotient, but these discs have not been remastered. Most shows are quite watchable, with only a few print problems. Shows also include commercials. The worst are for Listerine. The best are for Kodak (the later shows on disc four). Anyone who ever saw an episode will enjoy having this set, and some younger viewers may find themselves also drawn to the convivial Nelsons and the inviting Land of Oz.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAXTJ7KPYTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVIGF2#wasThisHelpful","RZAXTJ7KPYTX","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This claims to be an expose of a secret Jewish conspiracy to undermine civilization, but it was actually written in 1897 as an anti-Jewish tract, and is a hoax. No Jewish elders had anything to do with it. But, like the anti-Catholic novels of the same period, which inevitably featured Jesuits kidnapping Protestant children, it greatly influenced the popular imagination of the time. When it was exposed, not everyone got the word. Henry Ford used his fortune to print anti-Jewish tracts which were reprinted by Hitler. The Arab Radio and Television Network produced a 41 part TV series on the Protocols. But then, in 1999, Hitler's Mein Kampf (My Plan) ranked sixth on the bestseller list of Palestinian Arabs.It may be extremely tempting to conspiracy theorists like Texe Marrs to see in the Protocols some sort of prophetic warning about Soviet Russia, but if so, some questions arise. Why was the actual text originally a satire about Napoleon III? Why were Jews made the villains when it was changed by Pyotor Ivanovich Rachovsky of the Russian secret police? Marrs' view of the Soviet Union as a Jewish dictatorship also doesn't square with history, because the Soviets were highly anti-Semitic. Rather than ending the pogroms against the Jews before the revolution, the secret police continued them, as well as blaming all the problems in the new utopia on the Jews.Jews who were downtrodden in the previous Russian regime naturally looked for better conditions to prevail after the Russian revolution. Therefore, many became communists or socialists. But they were not alone in that. Walter Duranty filled the New York Times with false stories of how the Soviet utopia had brought peace and plenty, even while forced collectivization brought famine. The only journalist to tell the true story, and that for a left wing paper, was Malcolm Muggeridge. See his autobiography Chronicles of Wasted Time. The Soviet Union of that time was not definitively exposed until Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago The Gulag Archipelago.Chesterton apparently also believed the Protocols, although he was more concerned with Britain selling titles, making wealthy landowners nobility. However, once he saw through the propaganda, he became the first opponent of Hitler and a defender of the Jews, and used his journalistic column to urge Britain to fight Hitler, instead of giving up countries to him as a peace offering. See his autobiography from 1936 The Autobiography of G. K. Chesterton. In his book Orthodoxy Orthodoxy, Chesterton notes the contradictory arguments advanced against Christianity in his day. ""It began to seem that any stick was good enough to beat Christianity with,"" he writes. The alarms against the Jews of his time were similarly contradictory. On one hand, the Jews were capitalists in a worldwide conspiracy. On the other, they were the socialists undermining the capitalists. You can't have it both ways. At any rate, demonizing them in a fairy tale doesn't help anyone.What actually happened during the time Marrs speaks of, and the actual conspiracy behind the writing of the Protocols hoax is, however, far more exciting and convoluted than the so-called Protocols conspiracy could ever be. That story is told in numerous places. Two of the best books that deal with it are Salvation Is from the Jews and The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII And His Secret War Against Nazi Germany.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRTVUFCTASPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1930004567#wasThisHelpful","R1XRTVUFCTASPA","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you live in a two-plate state, as I do, you need a license plate in front as well as back. This black metal license plate frame perfectly complements the recent line of Dodge cars with black grilles and the double red hash mark accent. The only color accent on my silver 2013 Dart is the red hash mark next to the front ""Dodge"" chrome logo. So these plates blend into the black grille and echo the tiny red accent. I considered a ""Mopar"" plate, but the Mopar M is blue. Would look great on a Mopar 13 or blue-striped Dodge, but for my silver car, I went for the Dodge red accent.What about the back? One could put a chrome plate on a silver car, but I think it tends to clash more, since both the plate and car are shiny and reflective, but not the same shade.

"Nothing beats OEM Mopar parts. Like everyone else, I wanted to add sporty touches to my new 2013 Dart SE. The beautiful, six-on-the-floor manual shift is standard on the SE, and I wanted to edge toward the sportier touches of the SXT and Rallye models. But my mechanic smartened me up on this, and said to get the functional accessories first. You can get some beautiful, white letter aftermarket ""Dart"" logo floor mats, but get these instead (he said). Why? I asked. Because these rubber slush mats will protect the carpet and keep your new Dart new. Did I mention my mechanic is a genius? And totally right. Fortunately my sister had given me an Amazon gift card for my birthday which was burning a hole in my pocket. What better way to spend it than to protect my new Dart?I ordered these through Amazon from Avondale Automotive in Arizona, which has amazingly fast shipping, and these new Mopar mats are even better than they look in the photos. They are thick, heavy, grooved black rubber with ""Dart"" in raised letters on the front two mats. The mats fit perfectly into the hooks in the Dart carpeting, which keeps them in place. They not only feel great, adding a spongy, resilient surface to rest your feet on, but catch rocks, dirt, leaves, mud and snow, and look great as well. Noir on noir. It doesn't get better than basic black, which accents the entire Dart interior scheme. Sporty and functional.

"Check the Dodge Dart site, and it says that the 152 LED racetrack taillamp array is standard on the Dart GT, Aero (and Mopar 13), and available on the SXT, Rallye, and Limited models (click the link on the left side of the Dart site that says ""Compare Models""). So if you buy the bottom model, the Dart SE, like me, you don't get it. What do you get? The trunk reflector with the Dodge logo looks exactly the same but it doesn't light up. Who knows how much dealers charge for this array as an aftermarket item? It's not listed in the Dart accessories booklet. Or how much they charge to install it?The good news is that this is the original Mopar part. If you have a deluxe model Dart with trunk liner, you need to remove that to install it (instructions included). But for us with the bottom models (no liner), merely take out a few screws and the back bezel comes right off. Screw on the new one, and plug it into the socket on the right inside of the trunk. It's plug and play, and voila! The racetrack taillamp. I got mine from Amazon from Avondale Automotive in Arizona, which provided great service and quickly shipped this genuine, original, brand-new official Mopar part. This really is the distinctive design feature of the 2013 Dodge Dart, and once installed, it alters the whole look of the car, making it the Charger's little brother. This is a half hour tops DIY project (it took my mechanic five minutes to install).

Or the Garfield Twentieth Anniversary Collection 20 Years & Still Kicking! Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection. But there can't be. In both of those books, the cartoonists talk about their comics. This one was collected after the fact, after Jeff MacNelly died of cancer. But he and his cartoonist cronies saved us from another sort of cancer, the one that makes life a fate worse than death. You can't read Shoe without laughing, and without staring at the artwork. The first time I saw Shoe in the paper, I couldn't stop looking at it. That scruffy bird is perfect as an editor. I had a tweed jacket with pads on the elbows like the perfesser wears.And like those other books, there is some commentary and pictures, thanks to Susie MacNelly and the current creative crew that enables the Shoe to go on. Humorist Dave Barry needs no introduction, so he wrote one for this volume. Mike Peters, creator of the equally scruffy mutt, Grimmy, in true Grimmian fashion slips his foreword in the back. One could also argue that while the Calvin and Hobbes book named delves into ten years, and the Garfield tome scratches into twenty, this one dives into twenty seven. It does so in over 200 pages, featuring the glorious color spreads as well as daily strips. These Shoes are also nicely arranged, not simply jumbled together, by the decades in which they're drawn.One of the most popular Shoe series concerned Skyler accidentally, and repeatedly going to boot camp. First he thinks it's a free trip to Paris--make that Parris Island, USMC. Then he gets a summer job at the US Marine Corporation, which sounds like a Bayliner designer until you read the abbreviation. Turns out those were collected in a benefit edition for the Navy Relief Fund, but here we get a sixteen page sampling. All of the aforenamed scribblers were editorial cartoonists who parlayed their gifts into the funny papers, lucky for us. But Jeff's case was unique. Imagine winning a Pulitzer prize for editorial cartooning. Now imagine winning three! Somehow Jeff resisted the temptation to bask in the shiny, hifalutin' OpEd page, and instead stumbled into the comic section. This book would never have had such a funny title if he hadn't.My favorite thing to do is to sit down with a big comic collection like this and be amazed. To gaze at the seemingly effortless artwork. To read the brusque, apt, witty word balloons. To laugh over and over at the follies of our fine, feathered friends, Shoe and company. Or a six year old boy and his tiger. Or a hapless cartoonist and his fiesty feline, to name a few. Every day and moreso on Sunday, the newspaper testifies to Jeff's creative gift. Perhaps he continues to inspire Shoe's current creative team to bring a needed word to bedraggled humanity: ""lighten up!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36M4RZ61PP6XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0740746669#wasThisHelpful","R36M4RZ61PP6XX","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm reluctant to give this set five stars, as I think some viewers would instantly cavil. But I must say I found watching it extremely enjoyable. That apart, it's an whopping good deal: 40 episodes for under ten bucks. The four one-sided discs are held within the case in black paper sleeves, but this economical approach works and is safe for the discs. This was a DIC series dating from 1999, and the set also includes bonus episodes of Mona the Vampire, Sabrina's Secret Life, and Sabrina: The Animated Series, which was produced by Savage Steve Holland of Eek the Cat fame. However, in these series, Sabrina is a pre-teen, which is odd. A free Archie's Weird Mysteries comic book was given out in 1999 for Free Comic Book Day in which Archie asks Sabrina why she seems to be about twelve years old, instead of sixteen, as when she originated in Archie's Mad House comics The Best of Archie's Mad House. So what about the series?Archie's Weird Mysteries is quite different from the Filmation cartoons of the '60s The Archie Show: The Complete Series, Sabrina the Teenage Witch - The Complete Animated Series, which already veered somewhat from the comic books. But there've been a lot of changes in the comics as well since the '40s. I was curious about the Weird Mysteries series, which almost seems like Archie meets Scooby Do, but it's really rather clever. It's the stuff of which ""B"" movies are made, and they have that sort of story arc. Most episodes are self-contained but two three-parters rev back up on the fourth disc. As for the characters, Veronica is played a bit too arch, and there aren't enough shenanigans from Reggie. Jughead, however, comes into his own. For some reason, Archie's red jalopy has been replaced by a red sports car.The writing seems more like comics than cartoons. The dialogue is endlessly fascinating and witty, with parallels between the normal life of Riverdale's teens and the science-fiction happenings overtaking the town. For some reason, the shows open with a melodramatic summary of the upcoming adventure and are bookended at the end with Archie writing his ""Weird Mysteries"" newspaper column. An odd format, but it works, owing to the skillful writers. Archie and his friends are so personable and individual that they can take on such novel terrain. No wonder after half a century they're still going strong.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I6GW1EKUJYKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WDWBK6#wasThisHelpful","R2I6GW1EKUJYKX","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I approached this CD with trepidation. I'd loved the last album, Hi-fi Revival Hi-Fi Revival, and caught the Supertones' farewell tour at Mars Hill's Paradox theater in Seattle. And now a rumor that they'd reunited, and with the original members. Could it be true? Amazon had recommended this CD, and when it arrived, tentatively I slipped it into the car CD player. Right out of the box, the Morginsky magic. Mojo's quirky, irresistable lyrics, and his unmistakable rap style, drawing on its roots in Black Gospel preaching, so you can not like rap and still like the Supertones. On the second song, the horns are back. Just a  whisper, and then insistent in the lags in the line, so you can not like horns but still like the Supertones. By the third song, the band is back in form. Song four cools down to near acoustic as Matt sings of the true worth of a sister, a daughter, a mother. A song to sparkle on contemporary gospel radio.Even so, this CD might be four stars. The OCs have set themselves a stellar personal best in the past, and some pretty high hurdles for this album to leap. But then on ""Down to the River"" it all comes together in that unmistakable, unforgettable signature ska, edging the disc into five stars. The next song, ""All Glory"" blows out the speakers and now it's a six (and Amazon doesn't even have a six). Despite the change in line-up what this album most suggests is Chase the Sun Chase the Sun, when early on the band shed its initial Tooth'n'Nail alt superhero cover image to inhabit a Beach Boys SoCal scene in dapper suits and ties. And this on a Seattle label in the dressed-down Northwest. Sure enough, our instincts are right. ""It's a good day to be from California"" they sing in the very next song. California dreaming continues into the next almost acoustic number, ""Warmth of the Sun"". Matt kicks it up ""On the Downbeat"", with the Signature Supertones sound, reminiscent of Hi-Fi Revival. ""Fight On"" continues in that vein, about the fall of Babylon, a favorite topic of Reggae songs, but weaving in bits of the book of Revelation, and unpacking some ideas from ""All Glory"". The third cool down is ""Pretty Little Lie"", one of those likable Mojo autobio songs like ""Jury Duty"", which quickly revs up. There's a bit of laughing at the beginning of the last song, just so you know the band doesn't take itself too seriously, and which echoes the sort of live/ demo sense lurking at the edges of these crisply produced songs. Some songs also cut off abruptly instead of petering out at the end, adding to the live feel. In finale, as Matt deftly sampled St. Paul with lines from  Corinthians in the opening song, now he cools down the speakers with a smooth take on Psalm one and a well-known quote from Joshua.One reviewer remarked that this album is like the Supertones never left. But for many fans, their departure was very marked indeed, even if they ended on the high point of 2002's Hi-Fi Revival. It's been a long, cold decade, but now our favorite California band is back, if only for a visit, urging us to shake off winter, and again chase the sun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CROP64VNV644/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009H43YV2#wasThisHelpful","R1CROP64VNV644","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I hate a song that makes you feel like you're no good"" Mike Peters says at the beginning of ""One Guitar"". These songs, while not sidestepping sadness and tragedy, give you hope and make you feel great, as the blues and rock and roll have always done.Mike Peters has cancer, and has many times been given up for dead. The '80s roots punk band, the Alarm, has many times been written off. Somehow they are both back with a vengeance on Direct Action. Mike Peters has never sounded better or more alive. The title track sounds like a combination of the Clash and Declaration-era Alarm. The second song seems like it is the old Alarm. Is that Twist on drums? Is that Eddie MacDonald? There's absolutely no information in the scanty CD cover, so I don't know. Wishful thinking, probably, but whoever it is, they are crack players. Not to mention the production. The sound throughout is clear, clean, and crisp. The wonderful trademark harmonica is even back on some songs. Some songs also remind me of my favorite songs, like ""Transcendental"" on Mike Peters' solo album, Rise.In another way, this album sounds like Under Attack, Part Two Under Attack. That's another amazing rock album recalling the early Alarm except that then they only used acoustic guitars, and here there are some searing electric leads. It's almost like the Alarm are the last real rock band, as opposed to the pop production of bands on the radio, which has always been alergic to the Alarm. You run into people all the time singing ""Sold Me Down the River"" who think it's a great song, unaware that it's minor compared to some of the all-time great stuff they've done. We did see a few bits on MTV back in the day from Strength and Eye of the Hurricane. If the Alarm were just starting out on the IRS label today, you could launch them with nearly any song on this album. But that's the sad state of US radio stations, which must all be owned by a tone-deaf CEO or the playlists determined by payola. Nothing else explains how they can ignore an album like this or a real rock band like the Alarm. I know one place it will get played. In my Dodge Shadow, cranked to eleven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROAGHZQXP9NGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JU0X72#wasThisHelpful","ROAGHZQXP9NGR","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What could you possibly learn in a 94 page book? Not much if it's your typical, rambling eBook. But it's not. It's a straight-forward, no-nonsense, nuts and bolts guide. How could it be? Good question. For starters, vocabulary. High end and low end graphics programs have one thing in common: gobbledegook. No printed manual, an unhelpful help menu, incomprehensible menu choices in arcane jargon. How do I know if I want RGB or CYMK? Fixed or variable width fonts? Spot or bleed color? Vector or raster images? Save as jpeg or GIF? I need someone to tell me.Enter David Loeff. All that crazy vocabulary, he explains, isn't just the made-up tech talk of the day. He delves back into the roots of the ancient art of printing which-- who knew?-- still exists. Not only does he bring us up to speed. He also enables the little graphics guy like you or me to talk to the printer like a pro. Why do I need to? Because for big press runs, press printing is far cheaper than emptying cartridges on an inkjet. He also talks about layout so you and the printer are on the same page concerning your project.There's also some discussion of the role of the SoHo (Small office/ Home office) graphics person and a helpful bit on planning your project. There's a very brief discussion on programs-- MS Publisher (included with some versions of Office), Serif PagePlus (low end programs) up to Quark XPress and Adobe InDesign. After reading this book I went and bought Photoshop Elements 11 (which just came out as I write this review). The paperback is very inexpensive and excellently done. The eBook includes some inside color. Both are very easy to use due to Loeff's brilliant layout: words in the glossary in the back are bolded in the text, and defined in both places. You don't need to jump to the glossary in the back (but you can) when you encounter a word or idea in the text.

"This is the reason to get a Kindle-- or better yet a Kindle Fire, since this book is in color. It seems incredible that the best book I'm reading right now is a book about making books, but so it is. As a writer, I've often read other writers' bios and memoirs, always hoping to find a well-written one. This is it. Guy Kawasaki is often called the ""evangelist"" for Apple, and as a Mac user, I wish he'd hit on more that's specifically Mac, by that tiny cavil doesn't drop this book from five stars.In the jumble--plethora--tidal wave of books on self-publishing, this one stands alone. I've fleetingly read Kawasaki's blog, which is filled with so many revelations, life tips and plain good advice, and this is like it spilled into a book. That it's a book about making books-- writing about writing-- is a double irony. All books on writing are by writers. Who else has the bug? In the eBook age, a writer who wants to write fiction, and just get back to their novel, finds it nonetheless much more lucrative to kick out a little booklet about their ghastly adventures in the world of publishing--something every budding writer can relate to--and how they eventually won through (or wrote a book about it anyway).But whereas these novelists polish and preen their novels, massaging each sentence, carefully choosing each word, they crank out the despised non-fiction work as fast as possible. And it shows--in each misspelling and hastily scrawled sentence. The dutiful would-be writer reads on, looking for the golden road to success, jerking and bumping through the clunky prose.So why don't I spill the beans? What is the Kawasaki/ Welch secret? Why don't I condense three hundred plus pages into a brief summing up? Not so fast, pal. I'm enjoying this book. And I rather thought I would when I glanced through and saw all the quotes from writers sprinkled about. Guy and Shawn had me at the first quote from C.S. Lewis, and this book somewhat reminds me of Lewis' thoughtful, slim book on reading, An Experiment in Criticism An Experiment in Criticism (Canto). Second time through, I probably will click on some of the numerous links the authors have provided, because after all, like all writers, I'm interested in publishing books. But first I'm enjoying this delightful guide through the minefield.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GXHL9X1D945E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGFU5VS#wasThisHelpful","R2GXHL9X1D945E","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Within the slipcase lurk two stunning, oversize hardback collections of Mad Men era adverts. By my count, the teal '50s volume which features a perfectly-suited male on the cover, runs to 320 pages. The orange '60s volume, featuring an impeccably dressed female, clocks in at 400 pages, including the index for both volumes. The contents for both volumes is in the first book, with a brief (3 page) preface by editor Jim Heimann, ""Mad for Ads"" in English, German, and French. There's also a four page intro. by Steven Heller in three languages called ""Advertising in the 'Fifties: The Age of Affluence"". The orange volume includes a four page piece by Heller, ""So, What's the Big Idea?"" The endpapers on the first volume give a brief advertising timeline from 1945-1959, with the second volume picking up at 1960-1970. In between the 13.5 X 10"" covers are nothing but color drenched, full page ads from these two decades.So what's the problem? There isn't one, unless you already bought the numerous other Taschen volumes of ads from these decades. Even if you did (as I did), you may want this deluxe edition, if only for the presentation. The All American Ads volumes were even thicker than these hardbacks-- the '50s volume running over 900 pages All-American Ads of the 50s. There were also smaller, hardback editions in a series called The Golden Age of Advertising which were reprinted by Barnes and Noble, which I think are called Turtlebacks for some reason, but which tend to come up as ""unknown binding"" on Amazon. The '60s volume is about 350 pages The 60s: The Golden Age of Advertising. Some of these ads also showed up in the series of pocket-sized books in the Taschen Icons line.Mid-Century Ads collects representative samples from Heimann's enormous ad stock from the '50s and '60s, but Taschen also put out books on other decades of advertising. Arguably, this is yet another attempt to cash in on the success of Mad Men, but as media critic Marshall McLuhan noted in the 'sixties, the artists of the day were all working on Madison Avenue. These two volumes, and the variations referred to above provide an endlessly fascinating introduction to two very different decades, and the allure of their inimitable style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9C7ZFYJRUWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3836528347#wasThisHelpful","R1C9C7ZFYJRUWY","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems impossible that this film was by the director of Casablanca. There's nothing noir in it at all. Leonard Maltin, in his Classic Movie Guide, said it's ""unusually sentimental"" for a Wayne vehicle. That's not the word I'd use, but if he means it deviates somewhat from Rooster Cogburn, that it does. The title subtly suggests Bing Crosby's Going My Way (Going My Way (Universal Cinema Classics)), but it reminds me of another little seen gem, this one deviating a bit for Frank Sinatra-- A Hole in the Head (The Frank Sinatra Star Collection (Guys and Dolls / Hole In The Head / Manchurian Candidate / Sergeant's 3)). The tough guy in a sports setting also brings to mind another classic, Angels in the Outfield (Angels in the Outfield). All three are the sort of movies I love to discover, and this one has the added advantage of co-starring Donna Reed.Wayne is still the Quiet Man here, and his cool nonchalance gives the film a sense of style that high-pitched dramatics would not. In fact, there's a scene where his drama queen ex-wife pulls some over the top hysterics, and the cool rejoinder is ""stop overacting"". Wayne is equally at home on the football field and in the pool room-- equal parts Gipper and cool hand Luke. The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Charles Coburn as the quiet inferno, Father Burke, which reminds me of another wily priest in another little-seen '50s film, St. Benny the Dip (St. Benny the Dip), which only exists in poorly preserved budget editions unless Turner Classic Movies screens their pristine copy. This film in the John Wayne Collection (The John Wayne Film Collection (Without Reservations / Allegheny Uprising / Tycoon / Reunion in France / Big Jim McLain / Trouble Along the Way)) is also available in a slip case with five other films, usually for little more than the single price, but either way, fans of light, classic '50s comedy will call it a bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXNOTWVPNGFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O599X0#wasThisHelpful","R2NXNOTWVPNGFS","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a collection of fifteen shorts (or briefs) reaching from 2008 back to the second VeggieTales video. If you and your kids watched all those, you've seen all these. That said, they're put together with bridging animation, in this case, the sock drawer, which is full of shorts and briefs-- get it? I was happy to find this collection because I like to watch very very short cartoons, and only one at a sitting. I nearly never watch a full-length animated movie, but a notable exception was The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything (Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A Veggie Tales Movie (Widescreen)), the second VeggieTales movie after Jonah (Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie), which is so funny I watched the trailer for it, which begins this disc, over and over. The other treat they don't mention is a medly of bits from all the VeggieTales videos at the end of the disc, which is not only witty and entrancing but visually stunning. If your kids did watch all the vids, they'll probably shout out which story each bit is from.Anyone dismissing these tales as cartoons for church kids ought to watch one. At a time when nearly every kids' cartoon on PBS carries a moral at the end, these are teachy but not preachy. Watching the extras, I realized that the animators and writers are like those on any other cartoon. There's a feature on how to draw Paco the mule, which has a crazy expression, but it's no different than when Walt Lantz used to show how to draw Woody Woodpecker. There's a bit with animators talking about ""A brief history of the shorts"" and how they came up with (big) ideas. There are strange, crazy little absurdist bits, ""Archie's Oddities"" and ""Paco's Stories"" that are made-up tall tales for comic relief. There are humorous voice-overs of old black and white movie footage in ""Pa Grape's Home Movies"". There's nothing in those shorts to ""get"" and kids get that. Adults will love watching the hyjinx with their kids. Watch one a day and it will last about a month.

"How can you not love the boys from Bremerton? What other punk band combines Beach Boy harmonies, Monkees joviality, the freshness of Young Ones era Cliff Richard with an imperceptible nod to the Ramones? Someone said PWP combines the best of The Ever Passing Moment and Secret Weapon. How could it? But that's an understatement, because there's some ""Punk Rawk Show"" in there as well. The band has never been so confident. Glimpses of intelligence glint from the mike and guitar, and there's that incredible trademark double drumming. Mike Herera has one of the most versatile voices in rock, but here he outdoes himself. Beyond the experimentalism of their middle period, the band slips in the offbeat power chord here and there, but it works.""Responsibility, not quite yet"". This is the yet. Graduated from the school of rock and growing up. The boys from Bremerton shun candy-coated production and pop platitudes to deliver the goods. They're like your frat brothers, full of good advice that is hard-won, never descending into cliche. Their faith, hinted at by the title, is so deep it need never be stated, but wells up from the grooves. This is the album the band was always waiting to make. Somehow rootsy and rowdy, stripped down and intricate, practiced and effortless, all at the same time. This is what punk once was-- could be-- is again. This is three very happy dogs gone wild with joy.

Someone said it's a lot like The Grape Prophet The Grape Prophet. Maybe so, but without the distinctive piano on that album. I just named a handful of the best LSU albums, and any fan is likely getting excited.Song 4, ""My Redemption"" is my instant favorite, with the great refrain, ""I got my L.S. Underground."" But from the first song, any soldier will know that Mike Knott understands. Who cannot be moved by ""Child's Prayer"": ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, help my dad!"" How much more real that is than the tawdry OMG! of pop songs. It recalls the excellent Aunt Bettys prisoner's prayer, called, I think, simply ""Jesus"", Aunt Bettys which also reminds me of the 77s cover of Lou Reed's ""Jesus"" More Miserable Than You'll Ever Be. The last song can be taken two ways: ""(If God is love) what is love fighting for?"" I also love Knott's solo (and duo) stuff-- he has a warm, inviting voice beneath the screamo/ emo, and moves between both styles on this album. If he reminds me of anyone, it's Henry Rollins of Black Flag, who, like Mike Knott, is a guy who says what he thinks. Musically, it equals the heaviest LSU songs and is v. much the album fans have been waiting for.Knott has given us so much great music under so many monikers: Lifesavers, LSU, L.S.Underground, Bomb Bay Babies, Aunt Bettys. I first heard ""This is the Healing"" on a college radio station, and it changed my life forever. Mike and friends hope that this album will raise awareness of the plight of veterans, and will again be the healing.

Hopefully shows like Banana Splits are slated for later release.Some of these cartoons were shown on Cartoon Network's Boomerang channel, and on the ""Boomerang"" show on CN, and ran in various places in syndication since their original 1970's air dates. Critics are often dismissive of Hanna-Barbera's massive output, but you like 'em or you don't. Everyone has their favorites, and you tend to like what you grew up with. As a stalwart H-B fan, I welcome this blast from the past, even if my favorite H-B 'toons date from the '50s and '60s.

"Dr. Ian Hunter compiled this anthology not because there is any lack of writing from MM, but because previous collections mainly drew from his work in the '60s. Reading the best of these, ""The Most of Malcolm Muggeridge"", one can see why The Most of Malcolm Muggeridge. ""Tread Softly for You Tread On My Jokes"" is a UK version of The Most of MM with some of the funniest essays unaccountably left out Tread Softly For You Tread On My Jokes. Dr. Hunter is also the author of a collection of short, pithy bits from MM, The Very Best of Malcolm Muggeridge and a bio Malcolm Muggeridge: A Life. If a potential reader somehow fails to dip into the writings of MM, it will certainly not be the fault of Dr. Hunter.That said, how does the present volume compare to these other collections, and, if one has read the others, is there any reason to pick this one up? Things Past dates from 1978. The picture shown for this review is the US edition, but I read the UK hardback published by Collins,which contains 8 color plates of cartoons from Punch, the British humour magazine of which MM was previously the editor. The essays in this collection tend to be longer than in The Very Best of MM, but there are also short, one paragraph bits tossed in, perhaps as bon mots, or to break up the longer pieces. However, in both cases Dr. Hunter gives us only the most telegraphic bibliographical bits, confined to merely listing the source and date in the back of the books. I would far rather have this information at the end of each essay, as it seems to be extremely important when, where, and under what circumstances a bit of writing appeared.A very interesting inclusion is the new 1967 introduction for the rerelease of MM's book, The Thirties in Great Britain, which I found alternately riotous, probing and profound, and that's from a Yank who knows very little about the personages of the time or that history in the UK. My review title plays off of Chronicles of Wasted Time, the collective name for MM's two volume autobiography (now generally appearing in a single volume Chronicles of Wasted Time. Anyone who reads that diverting, entertaining and singularly enjoyable book will certainly be looking for more MM, and Things Past is as good a place to start as any.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GDC3ZSXJ9SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0688034454#wasThisHelpful","R13GDC3ZSXJ9SZ","A3QAQUUPFIARWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QAQUUPFIARWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My mother is no longer able to lug around a bucket of water in order to mop her floors.  When looking for an alternative, I found the Mopnado.  I had looked at some other brands, but wasn't sure of the quality of those products.  Some seemed very cheaply made.  I needed something easy for my mother to rinse and pull around the house.  When the mop came, I went over to put it together and then show her how to use it.  She easily attached and removed the mop head, and LOOVED the agitator and the spinner.  Their house has all wood floors, so she didn't want a lot of water on the floors.  After just a few tries, my mother was easily able to agitate the mop clean and then spin it to remove most of the moisture.  I went one day to clean house for my parents, and had a great time mopping with the Mopnado.  It was very easy to rinse and spin dry.  I didn't even use any cleaner at all, but the floors were spotless.  My mother called later to tell me how she had washed the mop head and was shocked at how white it came out.  Almost all of the dirt was removed.  This is a great mop, and it is well worth the upgrade to get the one with the stainless steel spin drum.  I am considering ordering one for myself now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8IG585US2SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5ZCPU0#wasThisHelpful","R1A8IG585US2SJ","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're wondering what to expect from this book, think of the original Conan books, but for kids.  I love the fact that the author chose to present this story as a graphic novel.  The black and white artwork is very well done, and really makes the action come alive.  While this is presented as a kid's book, I think the vocabulary and some of the action is a little too much for a reader younger than fourth grade.  There is no blood splatter, but this is about barbarians, so there is a lot of violence in it.  The perfect audience would probably be early to late middle school.  I hope this is the first in a new series, because I really enjoyed the story, and would like to read the further adventures of the Barbarian Lord.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVK0Z445R1VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547859066#wasThisHelpful","R2PVK0Z445R1VX","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to the Planet of the Vampires several years ago when it came out on a Midnite Movie DVD.  I was expecting a really cheesy film like most of the sci-fi produced during that era.  As I watched it, I was amazed at the similarities between it and one of my favorite sic-fi horror titles.  From the ""U"" shaped spaceship, to the call from an alien planet, to the way the exhaust from the landing spaceship pluming up around the ship.  If you haven't guessed, I'm talking about Ridley Scott's original classic, ""Alien"".  Even the design of the planet's surface is similar.  Now, I'm not saying that Ridley Scott completely copied this film, but it is evident that it served as an inspiration.  After all, while the images may be alike, the stories are quite different.  Actually, Scott claims to have never seen this film.  If you're simply expecting a good cheesy sic-fi horror flick, you may be pleasantly surprised as I was to find that it's actually quite a good film.  Aside from getting a really good film with this package, you also get a big upgrade from the DVD.  The picture is amazingly sharp and clear.  Considering this is not a major title, I was quite surprised to find a good handful of extras on this new HD release.  You get an audio commentary, some trailers, two short features titled Trailers from Hell with Joe Dante and one with Josh Olson.  While these are only about 3 min. each, there is a lot of information packed into them.  There is also a still gallery, alternate music opening highlights, original Italian opening credit, and the entire original shorty story by Renato Pestriniero.  With all of these features, it is now clear why the price is a little higher than I originally expected when I first heard this gem was coming to Blu-ray.  If you've never seen this movie before, and you like a good creepy, atmospheric film, I would suggest you check it out.  If you have the old DVD, then I suggest you use it as a coaster and invest in this upgrade.  If you're a fan of the film, you definitely will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJ55T2XO775J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBVLDIY#wasThisHelpful","R1YJ55T2XO775J","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won't go into the same thing about how this set is worth the price, but will focus on what you actually get here.  First of all the discs and booklet are housed in a very sturdy slipcase with the artwork from the Director's Cut on the outside.  The case also has a nice feel to it.  Instead of a shiny surface, which would show fingerprints, it's more of a matte finish.  Inside the slipcase are two blu ray cases; one for the Director's cut and the other for the Theatrical cut.  As is true with most Scream Factory titles, you have the option of choosing what artwork you want to show on the cover of both discs.  That's a feature I've always liked that about Scream Factory titles.  The bonus content on the disc with the Director's cut is about 2 hours of really good quality behind-the-scenes goodness.  That doesn't include the commentary track. The Director's Cut itself is worth the price to me.  This cut is a totally different film that the theatrical cut.  While some extended cuts just throw some extra scenes in, that's not what was done here.  Some scenes have been replaced or extended, and they really make for a more satisfying film experience.  It was so cool to see some new monsters that didn't make it into the original release.  The Bonus disc that comes with this version has a little over an hour of really interesting content. You get to see some deleted scenes, lost footage, stop animation footage, and an extensive stills gallery of artwork.  Inside the second blu ray case is the Theatrical version.  It includes the same quality of picture as the DC, and the only bonus content on this is the original trailer.  Now all of this alone would be worth the price in my opinion, but Scream Factory didn't stop there.  You also get a very nice booklet that has some really cool artwork of the main characters, and a very well written extensive essay about the history of the film.  The bottom line comes down to just how well do you like Nightbreed.  If you are a casual viewer, and just want a good horror flick, the single disc version should suffice for you.  However, if you are a big fan of the film, and have been waiting for a long time for this film to get the special treatment, then there is no question, you MUST get the 3-disc Director's Cut.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32L2JG17MQBK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMBUQPK#wasThisHelpful","R32L2JG17MQBK3","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously owned the U.S. version of the Universal Monsters collection on blu-ray.  When I saw this set offered on amazon.uk, I knew that I had to have it.  I sold my U.S. version, and eagerly awaited the arrival of the coffin.  What I wasn't sure of was what the insides of this collection would look like.  When it finally arrived, I couldn't wait to see what was in the brown box.  I quickly sat down and started to cut the security tape.  I pulled out the packaging, and there it was.  The gorgeous coffin containing the classic monster films.  After examining the artwork on the lid and the base, I carefully removed the lid.  It was a little tight, I think because it had rained the day it arrived, and the moisture in the air probably caused a little expansion.  I had wondered what kind of holder would be inside, and I was about to find out.  As it turns out, if you've seen the non-limited UK edition with the blue dripping down the top of the box, that's what's inside the box.  While I did like the book format of the disc holders in the US version, I have to say that I really like this better.  The discs are securely held in two-disc stacked plastic hubs that gatefold out with four movies on each side.  Now for the big surprise for me.  Also included in the box is a nice book detailing each film, and some really nice movie poster cards for each film.  What's on the discs inside seems to be identical to the US version.  If I had to find a negative for this wonderful set, it would be that the menus on the discs are not that good. It's not clear what each symbol stands for, outside of the play symbol, until you click on it.  While that is a minor quibble, I'm not sure why Universal chose to use such a simplistic menu style.  If you're thinking that this set looks really big online, that's what I was thinking.  I really didn't want a gigantic coffin to add to my collection.  Well, as it turns out, it's about the same height and depth of a regular blu ray box set.  If you don't already own this fantastic set, then this is definitely the version you want to get.  If you do already own the previously released US version, you may want to do what I did.  Sell my old set on Amazon, and then order this fantastic set.  When I ordered it, the UK website did offer the set at a lower price.  It was about $85 once you add s & h to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QTB4JKFJTEMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPDOI5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1QTB4JKFJTEMZ","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure you know by now that Joe Hill is the son of the master of terror Stephen King.  I think it's great that Joe is not resting on his father's laurels, but chooses to prove himself without dropping names.  I've enjoyed all of Hill's work, including his graphic novels.  If you have read his excellent horror romp NOS4A2, and you enjoyed it, then stop reading this and order Wraith.  Wraith is a fantastic graphic novel that serves as a prequel to the novel.  This is one area where Hill has really shown that he is more than just the son of Stephen King.  He has chosen to not only publish novels, but to also publish fantastic graphic novels like Wraith and his Locke and Key series.  Joe Hill has branched out and created some truly memorable works in horror fiction.  With the combination of the artwork in Wraith and the fantastic story, you have a truly delicious book to devour.  While it really is a prequel, I do think it's more enjoyable to read the novel NOS4A2 first, then treat yourself to Wraith.  If you're not familiar with Hill, just go ahead and order both at the same time and same some on your shipping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UUXBGE6DX8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613778988#wasThisHelpful","R7UUXBGE6DX8P","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a HUGE fan of Darth Vader, and when I saw this sticker for Mac, I had to have it!!!  After I had ordered it, I received a message stating that I should contact the seller if I wanted anything other than the 13"" version.  Unfortunately, I had been out of town, and did not receive that message until getting back home, and then realized it was too late.  I own a 15"" MacBook Pro, and just decided to wait until it arrived since it had already been shipped.  While I LOOOOOVE the sticker on my Mac, The effect works very well of creating the illusion that the Dark Lord is actually holding the glowing apple in his dark grip.

"When I saw that a 40th Anniv. Edition of this classic film was coming out, I actually held out for awhile.  I owned the previous Ultimate Edition of TCSM, and there seemed to be only a few extra features planned for the new release.  After Amazon dropped the price to $19, I thought ""What the hay.  Go ahead and order it.""  When it came in, there was one thing that I did NOT like about it.  It was the size of a DVD case, which means it really stands out when on the shelf with other Blu Rays.  But that is just a minor quibble.  I watched the movie, and thought, ""You know, this picture doesn't really look that much better than the other release.""  Immediately after viewing the new 40th anniv. edition of the film, I decided to pop in the Ultimate Edition Blu Ray and compare picture to picture.  As soon as the first title appears, I knew then that there DEFINITELY was an upgrade made to this film.  Those very first titles look more cream colored on the previous blu ray, while they were clearly yellow on the new one.  I also went back and forth on a few scenes, and there really is a difference between this new blu ray and the previous one.  Once scene where the difference is very noticeable is when the first victim is looking through the screen door to see if anyone is home.  In the new version, you can clearly see the individual squares of the screen, and the brown rust and dirt on it.  In the Ultimate Edition, that clarity is really lacking.  You don't see the details, and the color is really washed out.  So, even though this new scan might appear to still be very ""grainy"", if you compare side by side with the Ultimate Edition, you will be able to see the difference as I did.  Not only do you get a much better picture, there is also a 7;1 surround track, more commentaries, and a few more extra features.  One of those is the Hallowed Ground feature that has appeared on many horror titles lately.  My bottom line is, don't sit on the fence anymore if you're thinking like I did that this doesn't seem to be that much of an upgrade.  Believe me, it really is.  If you're a fan of the film, as I am, you owe it to yourself to grab this new version of this classic horror title while the price is still low.  Otherwise, grandpa may hit you with a hammer............","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8JEHRHW9YTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L22H2IS#wasThisHelpful","R2K8JEHRHW9YTC","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How many times have you ordered the ""special edition"" of a game only to be disappointed upon the release???  That has happened to me more often than I would like to admit.  Destiny is a title that breaks this mold.  The ""Limited"" edition of Destiny is truly a thing to be admired.  First of all, there is the case in which all the materials are enclosed.  when you take the slipcover off, you see the gorgeous artwork of the Limited Edition.  The Destiny logo is raised on the front cover and the spine.  The opening flap is held closed by an internal magnet.  Open the door, and you see the steel book edition of Destiny and the Journal style of other bonus items.  Let me just say right now, that the digital downloads alone are worth the upgrade to the Limited Edition.  You get the DLC up until next year.  The game disc is also enclosed in a very gorgeous steel book holder.  The booklet enclosed in the limited case is also very useful.  This details the weapons in Destiny, and describes all of the armory in the game.  I really like having a hard copy of this, because it allows me to compare the different weapons offline and determine which one would be best to have in my arsenal.  There are also some really cool post cards included from the different locations in Destiny.  Not sure I would ever really use these, but they are a very cool extra about the background of this game.  Destiny is truly an AWESOME game, and I feel it will make gaming history with its design and playability.  With the upcoming DLC, this seems to be a game that will continue to provide hours of entertainment far into the future.  I would greatly suggest spending the extra bucks for the Limited Edition.The Game Itself:I keep reading where people are comparing this to Halo and Borderlands. Having played both, I can see where the comparison could be true.  However, I think Destiny is better than either of those games.  These are the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen in any game.  As of this writing, I've only achieved Level 6, but even at this level there is a great array of weapons to choose from.  In Borderlands, you can't upgrade your weapon until you find the vending machine.  In Destiny, you are able to upgrade to another weapon at any time.  I also like how when you advance, and you no longer want some of the basic weapons, you can dismantle them anywhere in the game and receive credit.  Another thing that keeps this game from becoming boring or repetitive is the variety of environments in which you get to fight.  So far, I've only been to Earth, the Moon, and Venus.  There is a moment on the Moon where the big doors open, and a FLOOD of baddies come out and I simply thought, ""Oh S***!!!!!"" .  The bosses in this are pretty tough, and that's where being online all the time really pays off.  I'm not a huge fan of online multiplayer, but this is cooperative gaming in the story mode.  You are pretty much on your own until someone crosses your path and may or may not decide to follow you.  I've revived other players in my solo quest, without it disrupting mine at all.  When you come up to one of the really bad A****, having other players in your world REALLY becomes a benefit.  I can't imagine being able to kill some of these without the help of co-op online players.  It really helps to create the feeling that you're in a real environment with other real people helping in your quest.  I'm really stoked for all of the other things that are in store for me in Destiny, and I plan to play this game for quite awhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW2BX9E9EF7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH6CBA8#wasThisHelpful","R1BW2BX9E9EF7W","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some razors lose power quickly, and some don't pack much power.  Those items would not be something I would use to describe this fantastic razor.  First of all, it's cobalt blue (my fave color).  So it earns points for that right out of the box.  One thing that makes this razor awesome is that it has a lithium battery, which holds a charge longer than others.  Unlike other razors, this one seems to be packing some power under the hood by not slowing down in certain areas.  This razor handles easily, and provides a close and smooth shave.

I found this rack and it seemed to be similar to what they have. When I got it, I was surprised to find it actually was better than the one they got.  There is plenty of room on top for my Keurig brewer and enough room down the side for a couple of creamer containers and a sugar dish. As it turns out this rack actually holds more cups than theirs.

However, I must be honest and say that I had virtually no knowledge of Angel Island until I read this book.  This is a very interesting story of how immigrants from Asia came to the U.S. through Angel Island. This book seems to be targeted for upper elementary readers, so I was a little let down by the lack of any color in the book itself. All of the photographs were in black and white.

"I'm no gourmet, but when I do cook, I want a good piece of cookware with which to work.  Let me start with the things I LOVE bout this set.  I made mashed potatoes using the big pot.  In the past I would boil the potatoes, then strain them, then return them to the pan.  With this new pot, the lid locks on, and best of all, there is a strainer built into one side of the lid.  My favorite pieces of this set are the two pans.  The larger one is not as big around as most larger pans I've had, but it is deeper than average.  I really like having the extra depth.  This is my favorite pan for making mac and cheese now.  The pan and the lid both have some really useful features.  This is true for both pans, by the way.  The pan itself has two spouted sides to it, with one wide and the other narrow.  That makes it much neater when pouring liquids out of it.  What I really love is the design of the lid.  The lid has strainers on either side, one with larger holes and the other with smaller ones.  This makes it really easy to strain my pasta for my mac and cheese.  Instead of having the extra step of pouring it through a separate strainer, now I just hold the lid on while I strain it directly through the lid on the pan.  Now for the one negative thing about this great set.  The larger skillet is not completely flat on the bottom.  Now I do like a little curve along the edges of a skillet, but this one is more concave than it is flat. While this does make it easier to toss food, it also causes it to gather to the small flat area in the bottom.  This may just be a personal preference, and others may like this feature, but I did not.  It's not a big deal, and if I could give this 4.5 stars I would.  Bottom line is that this is a great set of cookware with some very innovative features to it.  Oh yeah, the cookie sheets do just what they should....turn out some delicious chocolate chip cookies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEY6STDSHSHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBBB316#wasThisHelpful","R3PEY6STDSHSHN","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just a couple of minutes after opening the box and downloading the app, I was off and running with the paint tools.  I've played around with some paint apps for fun, but always thought, ""Wouldn't it be cool if there was an actual brush instead of using my finger?""  Well, that's just what you get here, in addition to a stamper, airbrush, paintbrush, and a paint roller.  There are several digital color pages to color, or for the truly artistic, there are blank canvases available.  I will be using this in my 4th grade classroom, so I wanted to make sure it was user friendly.  Kids today are usually very adept at working with electronics, and I think this is a really kid-friendly kit.  The tools are held securely in a hard plastic case, and they snap in and out very easily.  I actually think a kid's smaller fingers will work better at removing the tools from the holder, because my fingers were a bit big to fit in the wholes.  Once you finish the painting, you have options to print it or email it.  The email function will be great in my classroom to save my printer ink supply.  Parents and teachers alike will love this mess-free way of allowing a child to get in touch with his/her creative side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BY971A4NYHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI6J1ZO#wasThisHelpful","R22BY971A4NYHZ","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When The Fog was originally released, I was not old enough to see it in the theater, so I had to satisfy my curiosity by reading the book that accompanied it.  I would later get to actually see it on network TV in an edited form, but it was so exciting to see on screen what had only been in my mind from reading the book.  Many years later, I was able to obtain a DVD, and that remained my touchstone for this film up until the recent High Definition release of The Fog on Blu Ray by Scream Factory.First of all, let me get it straight for anyone who has never seen this film.  This is NOT a slasher film at all, rather it is a classic creepy ghost story of revenge for a wrong committed by the predecessors of Antonio Bay.  Watching this in high def for the first time would provide many surprises for me.  Most of all, is the cinematography in this film.  Honestly, I had never noticed just how beautiful this film is until I saw it in high definition for the first time.  Some of the shots of the bay and the countryside just took my breath away at how fantastically they were framed.  The picture is so crisp and colorful, I couldn't believe I had never noticed this before.  If you own any previous versions of this film, throw them out, because this is the definitive version!!  The video and sound are presented in a quality that I have never experienced before in its other versions.If you're new to anything produced by Scream Factory, let me tell you that these guys know what they are doing, and they present these films in a way like they've never been before.  Not only do you get all of the extra features from the previous DVD, you also get some new extras like an interview with Jamie Lee Curtis and one by Dean Cundey.  Another new feature that has shown up on other ScIream Factory titles is the Horror's Hallowed Grounds featurette where we are taken to many of the current places where this film was shot.  You also get a new commentary from Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Tommy Lee Wallace. This commentary is very enjoyable, and these people have many interesting tidbits to share about the making of The Fog.  There is also a cool Easter Egg that really brings back memories for me.  Go to the special features menu and click ""more"" to get to the second screen of extras.  Arrow down to the word ""back"" and click right arrow.  You will notice a little cross on the tombstone light up.  Click it and you'll be presented to the way this was presented on its network TV premiere, which is the first way I saw this film.  This little extra really brought back memories for me.Bottom Line:  If you love this creepy ghost story, then you owe it to yourself to get this beautiful new transfer from Scream Factory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB33ZT3CT5AE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7E3EFU#wasThisHelpful","RB33ZT3CT5AE7","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK, let me say up front that my cat is VERY picky about his food and treats.  He didn't like these at all, but I wanted to be fair in passing judgement, so I let my neighbor try them with her cats.  I will base my review on the reaction of her cats to the treats.  The first thing she noticed was that the treats seemed a little large for cats, so she broke them in half.  She has six cats in her house, and all of them scarfed these down.  Eddie, who tends to not like treats, even gobbled one up.  I'm taking one star off for the size of the treat.

"Previously, I had ordered the Terro Fire Ant Killer, and had been very pleased with it.  So, I thought I would try this product out.  I've used different sprays inside my house before, and most of them require you to leave the area for awhile in order for it to air out.  For some reason, I've had an influx of spiders this year, but Terro took care of that.  I tried it out in the room that is most infested, the bathroom.  I sprayed around the entire room top and bottom.  While I didn't see spiders immediately succumbing to the poison, I also didn't notice any obnoxious fumes.  When they advertise this product as odorless, they are not kidding.  It left absolutely no scent whatsoever!!!  Don't let the fact that insects don't seem to immediately kill over dead fool you.  I've not had any spiders or any other insects in the bathroom since.  Now I'm going to spray my entire house with this.

"When I ordered this, I was just looking for a good ice tray.  What I got was much more than that.  When I opened the package and looked at the product tag, it is actually labeled ""Silicone Bakeware"".  According to the tag it is safe to use as cookware up to 446 degrees.  This got my mind to reeling as to what uses I might find for this.  Of course, the first thing I had to do was make some giant ice cubes.  One cube is sufficient for a tumbler, and two is plenty for a tall glass.  Because of their size, these cubes keep your drink cold longer than regular sized cubes.OK, so it works perfectly for ice cubes, what other things might I do with it.  I thought I would try making my own freezer pops.  It's really simple.  I mixed some fresh strawberries with V8 Wild Berry Smoothie and threw it in the blender.  I poured the mixture into the ice molds, covered with plastic wrap, and poked a popsicle stick in the center of each cube.  Once it freezes, pop them out, and you have a delicious treat for a hot summer day in Alabama.  I've also done the same thing with some of the v8 Splash flavors, and got the same result.The one thing I'm holding out on is cooking in it.  I'm afraid some residual taste would be let and might taint my ice cubes.  I think I will order another to use strictly for cooking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18EBKDIXXHJWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBGPCAY#wasThisHelpful","R18EBKDIXXHJWG","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a strange problem with the squirrels around my house lately.  While I love to watch the squirrels scamper around my property, I do not like it when they dig potted plants out, and I REALLY don't like it when they eat the back slats off my front porch swing..that's right they are chewing on the slats of my swing.  It took me awhile to realize they were the culprit, but they are literally eating the slats.  I tried spraying bug spray on them, as well as a couple of other home remedies.  Nothing seemed to work, so I thought I would give Deer Off a try.  My first major complaint is that even though I strictly followed directions on mixing it, when I tried to spray the product on my swing, it clogged after just a few sprays.  I got it unclogged, but it quickly did the same thing.  I thought that maybe I needed to use my big bug sprayer, so I mixed it up and tried it.  Wouldn't you know it.......it clogged up my sprayer also!!!!!  I then thought that I would try to just pour it onto my swing and porch, but it did nothing to keep the squirrels away.  This product is a major dud.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE4ILOLF51K2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016PABP2#wasThisHelpful","RE4ILOLF51K2X","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember waaaay back in my high school days when we all loaded up to go see this movie in the theater.  We were all scared out of our pants, and completely amazed at the special effects.  I mean, we sat there and actually watched these people turn into werewolves right in front of the camera....it was AWESOME!!  This was way before computer animation, so we had never seen anything quite like this before.  Over the years, I've purchased this movie at least twice, with the last update being several years ago.  I had feared that it might never get its turn on Blu-ray, that is until I saw a few months back that Shout Factory was going to be releasing it. Up to that point, the only other title I had in my collection from Shout was Phantasm 2, and I was totally satisfied with what they did to make it a special edition.Here's one thing that Shout has continued to do on almost every title I've since purchased from them.  They will create new cover artwork for the film, which I love.  But just in case you're not a fan of the new artwork, they also provide the original movie poster artwork on the flip side of the cover insert.  There are some titles where I like the newly commissioned artwork, but then there are titles like The Howling where I just don't think you can ever outdo the original work with the claws ripping through and you see the lady's mouth screaming through one of the tears in the fabric.  What I love about that artwork is it is not clear if she is being attacked by a werewolf, or if she is actually becoming one.  I'm so glad that Shout continues to honor the work done by the original artists, thereby giving me the option to decide which cover I go with.Now let's get to the movie itself.  It had been a few years since I've watched this film, so some of the frights still worked for me.  I turned the lights off and the sound up as the iconic scratch marks rip across the screen, which as the camera pans out you realize spells The Howling.  When the screen suddenly explodes, that got my adrenaline going, and now I was ready for the ride.  The picture on this is just absolutely beautiful.  I really have never seen such a clear print of this film.  The colors are really rich and vibrant, and the blacks have a good solid look to them.  If the picture doesn't blow you away, then the sound certainly will.  They have done a great job with the surround effects.  One of the things I had forgotten about this film was the music.  The way the organ is used really brings you back to the glory days of the Universal monster films, but then the orchestral score  is woven so beautifully  which helps create a really creepy atmosphere.  Listen for yourself, and I think you'll agree.The one thing I was afraid of seeing this in high definition was that it might make the special effects look a little less than pleasant.  That is not the case at all.  This still stands as a groundbreaking film in the use of special effects, and I think they hold up very well to some of the CGI crap I've seen.  The only scene where it really stood out to me was the one where the man and woman turn into werewolves in the midst of there loving by the fire.  The animation is much more apparent in HD, but it's not a big enough distraction to ruin the whole thing.  It is amazing how they managed to pull off the effects with what they had to work with back then.One of the things I really like about Shout is the fact that many times they will produce some new special features for these new releases.  But never fear, because the other features from the DVD are also included, some of which have had a visual upgrade since their original release.  The new features are really cool, and give us some fresh insight to the behind-the-scenes goings on during the making of The Howling.Bottom Line:  If you like a good old-fashioned horror film, then you owe it to yourself to get this movie.  If you already own the DVD version from a few years back, forget it.  The new sound and video upgrades are well worth a double-dip.  Not to mention some new special features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K48VH1AH7KJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNAE2AU#wasThisHelpful","R2K48VH1AH7KJA","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have about an acre of land that I have to keep up with.  Over the years, I have fought the never-ending battle with fire ants building huge mounds all over the property.  I've tried different poisons, and other ""home remedies"" that people had told me about.  None of these seemed to really work.  While it might appear the ants have been dealt with, it seemed they would simply move to another spot of land to build another mound.  Honestly, I had just quit fighting and let it go for the last few years.  Then I got this product in the mail.  It seemed easy enough, just unzip the bag and shake it on the area you wanted to treat.  One thing that's different about this product and others I've used is that this is not a powder, but rather has the constancy of ground corn.  I believe this is what keeps this from washing away even in heavy rains.  What I did the first time I used it was I carried the bag with me as I mowed my lawn.  When I would chop the top of a mound with the mower, I would stop on the next round and apply the poison.  I started using this about a month ago, and each time I would mow, I would notice fewer and fewer mounds in my lawn.  When I mowed yesterday, there was only one mound on my property.  I'm sure more ants will find their way onto my property, but now I'm armed with a sure fire way of getting rid of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IMEWWAK9P6IF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B1KGCO#wasThisHelpful","R1IMEWWAK9P6IF","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was one of the few in my high school Literature class who actually enjoyed reading Shakespeare's plays.  After being exposed to the Bard with Romeo and Juliet, I quickly began to read his other famous plays.  My favorite to this day is Macbeth.Since the original Star Wars came out in 1977, I was known as a Star Wars Nut.  A title I wore with pride.  Even though George Lucas has put out some of the fire I still hold for the Star Wars franchise, it still remains one of my favorite films of all time.  If only he would allow us to see the original cut instead of the horrible ""upgrades"" he's made.  But I digress..........When I saw this book on Amazon, I thought, ""Why didn't I see this long ago???""  Shakespeare and Star Wars are a perfect match for each other.  I've always thought the original Star Wars: A New Hope would make a great opera.  Can't you just picture it...Just as the Rebels are advancing on the Death Star, you hear the Ride of the Valkyries from Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen??  I never thought of what Star Wars would be like had it been written by the Bard, but the end result is actually quite charming.  The adaptation of the iconic scenes from the film really bring a smile to my face.  Luke and Vader really fit in well in a Shakespearean universe.  Luke really has a lot in common with Hamlet, and Vader could easily be the ghost from Macbeth.  Just as the Bard often inserted humor in some of his darkest plays, the same is true with this version of Star Wars.  Have you ever thought what R2-D2 is REALLY saying with all the beeps and whirs?????  Well he finally speaks in certain scenes in this book, and boy does he have a lot to say.  My favorite scene from this adaptation would probably be the conversation between the guards who enter the Millennium Falcon in order to scan it after our Rebel friends have landed the ship inside the Death Star.  If you ever wondered what went on inside the Falcon after the guards went on board, now you know...ha ha ha.  This book is only about 170 pages, and makes for a perfect summer read.  I read it in one afternoon, and I'm hoping the author will do the same to Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  Any Star Wars fan will greatly enjoy this adaptation.

"I have to admit that I had never used a product like this before on my lawn, so I was a little doubtful that it would work.  I had to wait for the ground to get warm enough in order for the product to work properly.  It was very easy to dispense, since all you have to do is shake the bag to spread it over the problem area in your lawn.  Of course I chose my dandelions, since that is specifically one of the types of weeds it claims to control.  I simply followed the instructions on the bag and sprinkled it in a few areas in my front lawn where I had patches of dandelions growing.  After waiting for the product to do what it says it will do, I was quite amazed at the fact that it really did control my dandelions without adversely affecting the grass around them.

"OK, I'll be honest right up front.  When this first went into publication in comic form a few years ago, I wasn't all that excited about it.  Adapting King's work visually always seems to be a problem.  I hold up the previous TV miniseries as proof of that.  It was OK, but some of the acting just left me thinking....bleh.  Some of the cover art I had seen for the individual comics in this series didn't do anything to make me change my mind either.  Over the years, I kept reading positive reviews of this series, but just wasn't willing to bite the apple.I found a used copy of this for a good price on Amazon, and finally decided to give it a try.  First of all, this is a BIG book and it's HEAVY.  The size of the compendium is a little bigger than the comics, so that in itself is a plus.  You also get two books; one is the graphic novelization of The Stand, and the other is The Companion to The Stand.  Let's look at them individually.THE STANDI've read The Stand several times over the years, so I am quite familiar with the story.  This graphic novelization of it is actually SUPERB!!!!  I was totally amazed at how closely it follows the text.  The text really feels like you're reading Classic King.  It is not verbatim to the original text, but it follows the mood and spirit of the original.  I have to be honest that one of my big misgivings about this was the artwork.  Of course, that was artwork that I had not actually ever seen.  I based my prejudice on the cover art that I had seen over the years.  Oh wait.....I think I remember an old phrase, ""Don't judge a book by its cover.""  That has never been more true than it is for this series.  The artwork that is INSIDE this compendium is truly breathtaking.  Some scenes are so bright and colorful, and yet some other more sinister ones are dark and threatening.  The characterizations are spot-on to what I pictured in my mind when reading the novel.  There was not one depiction that I felt was incorrect.  The artwork really helps me relate to the scenes and what the characters are feeling, just as King's text does in the novel.  I really felt as if I had read the novel again after completing this graphic novelization.  If you have misgivings as I did, put them aside and invest in this lovely work of art.  You will NOT be disappointed.THE STAND: COMPANIONOK, now I am a movie geek who LOVES the making-of materials for movies.  If you could care less about how this was made, then don't even bother getting this separate volume out of the case.  If you love learning how things are made, you are going to LOOOOOOOOVE this Companion.  This is not a very simple discussion of how The Stand came to be, but rather an in-depth exploration of every part of how this massive project came to fruition.  There are rough sketches, interviews, and character profiles.  One of the things I liked most were the maps that accompanied the journeys of some characters like Trashcan Man, or Stu Redman.  I'm a visual learner, so these maps really help me get a grasp on how the story moves across the country.  Each map is similar to those you might see in a history book where points of interest along the way are accompanied with text explaining what happened in each place on the map.  The wealth of information provided in this companion is truly astounding.  It alone provides HOURS of enjoyment to any serious appreciator of this important piece of American Fiction.OVERALL FEELINGSFirst of all, I ask forgiveness for the prejudices I had before actually seeing this compendium.  In my opinion, this is one of King's finest works of fiction EVER!!  This graphic novelization allowed me to experience this wonderful story from a new point of view.  The graphic visualizations and the text work together to create a totally new way of experiencing this tale in a whole new manner.  If you love the original novel as much as I do, trust me on this.....You do NOT want to pass up the experience of seeing The Stand play out before you in this gorgeous piece of art.  I am so glad I took the chance on this, and this is a volume that is now in a prominent position in my Stephen King collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RP5C119KW2KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785153314#wasThisHelpful","R2RP5C119KW2KZ","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years, I've used different after shave products, some just burned and dried my face out, and others left my skin feeling very oily.  For the last two years, I've been using Nivea after shave lotion, and have been very pleased with it.  I thought I would give this gel a try.  With it claiming to be ""chilled dn cooling"" I expected a strong cooling sensation as I have felt from other products that made the same claim.  I was quite surprised to find that this Axe product has a very gentle cooling feeling that makes my face feel nice and tight after a shave.  After applying the gel, the product quickly cools any irritation from a shave, and has no greasy residue.  It also has a very light scent that doesn't overpower the senses.

"I've been using liquid soap in the shower for the past few years, and have tried various brands, including Axe.  One I tried claimed to have a cooling effect on the skin.  It was not so much a cooling effect but rather almost a burning sensation.  I ended up throwing the whole bottle out after only a couple of showers.  Another one I tried did leave me feeling clean, but it also dried my skin out.  I was actually a little skeptical about this Axe product, because I had tried another Axe shower gel that did leave me feeling clean, but was more of a cologne than simply a soap.  The new Apollo shower gel is the perfect balance between leaving my skin clean without feeling dried out, and it has a pleasant fresh smell to it that isn't so overpowering that I can't wear my regular cologne.  This is a great shower gel that leaves me feeling refreshed, clean, and smelling great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NMBRXZBNRV5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO4E9L8#wasThisHelpful","R3NMBRXZBNRV5V","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INSIDE THE CASEI was quite surprised to get home and find my Avengers Collection waiting for me on my front porch...a day before it was released.  THANKS AMAZON!!!  Amazon did a great job at packaging this with one protective box packed inside another.  Once I finally got all the boxed open, I saw the shiny briefcase and the colorful Cover box.  As i was trying to get the briefcase out, I accidentally tapped a button, and the shield lit up on the front of the case.....very coooool!!  The case itself looks very nice, and is well-constructed.  Now I have the thing out of the cover box, and am ready to open it.  One minor problem here.  Instead of actual latches on the case, they just sort of snap shut. No biggie, but a minor disappointment.  I lift the lid, and the inside of the briefcase is flooded with a cool blue light, both on the lid and underneath.  The teseract is nesting right in the middle with a cool blue glow around it.  I take the cube out of the box, and notice it is plastic wrapped.  Once the plastic is off, I pull out the battery saver tab and sit waiting for something to happen.  There was no visible switch or anything, so I just guess that I must have to supply my own batteries.  I'll come back to that later.  The bottom part of the case has three-dimensional wires, and circuits, and key pads.  The movies are arranged with the 3-D movies on the left, and the 2-D movies on the right.  I thought that was a neat way to organize them.  The bonus disc is also on the right.INSIDE THE LIDThe lid has a very snazzy holder with the Avengers logo on it, and there are some folders enclosed here.  The first thing you see is a smaller black envelope with ""confidential"" on the front, and ""open immediately"" on the back.  Of course, I do as I'm told.  Inside is an odd looking lenticular sheet with a couple of black and white images in the corners, and some other open windows on it......hmmmm strange.  There is also a nifty little badge with a bar code on one side and ""Field Agent Access Code"" on the other.  There are no instructions as to what to do with this code.....hmmmm stranger. OK, if you want to know what this if for, keep reading.  However, if you would rather enjoy the fun of discovering what this is for, skip to after ""SPOILER ENDS""  OK.........SPOILER BEGINS!!!!!!!!  OK, if you don't care anything about figuring this out on your own, here's the skinny.  In the black folder, you will find a sheet titled Item 47 Recovered.  Now take your little lenticular sheet thingy and line it up with the two images in the upper left and lower right corners.  Through the little windows you will now be able to read the message that tells you where to go to input this code.  When you get to the site put the code in, fill out the information, and a 5 minute preview begins of Phase 2 of the Avengers Universe.  Let's just say, we're in for a FANTASTIC next couple of years with some AWESOME looking movies.  I'm sure there will be more on this site later on, but that's about all there is at this point...................OK, SPOILER ENDS.....................Now, back to the folders.There is a total of five separate folders.  * Black folder - This has some info about the Tesseract, along with some dossiers on Clint Barton and Black Widow.  Your certificate of authenticity is also in this folder, although it simply states ""One of a Limited Edition"" no number.  I really prefer a numbered edition, but that's just my preference.  There is also an instruction sheet for replacing batteries in both the case lid and the Tesseract.  *  Captain America - photo of Steven Rogers, various military documents, trading cards, and an interesting drawing apparently torn from a composition notebook.  *  Tony Stark - Newspaper article ""Who is the Iron Man?"", blue prints, Lots of other neat little items. (don't want to give it all away)  *  Bruce Banner - Newspaper article, lecture notes, and other cool items.  *  Thor - a yellow ID bracelet, strange drawings, drivers license (cool), and some other itemsSomeone spent some time to make all of the memorabilia in these folders look authentic.  If you're a geek for bonus features like I am, then you should enjoy thumbing through these folders as much as I did.  Oh yeah!!  I also found the instructions for how to activate the Tesseract....when all else fails....read the instructions.THE DISCSOk, now this is where I was a little let down.  I hate it when I sell all of my individual movies to fund purchase of a nice box set like this, only to find out that not all of the bonus features were ported over.  This is a problem only for Iron Man and Iron Man 2.  Both of these movies seem to be simply the first disc of the 2-disc set of blu-rays.  The 7 part doc from Iron Man was nowhere to be found, and NONE of the bonus features from Iron Man 2, Disc 2 are included.  Both 1 & 2 are labeled ""Disc One"", so it looks to me like they just took the current discs out of the 2-disc blu ray and tossed the 2nd disc.  As far as I can tell, all of the others have the features from the original release.  OK, so maybe these extras are what is on the elusive SHIELD disc???????  Sorry....but NO.  That disc simply contains from intros to each film, deleted scenes, animatics, and Pre viz stuff.  That's about it.  I thought, ""Maybe they've ported them over to BD-Live.....ummmmm NO.  The failure to include these two discs is a total mystery to me.  Why would you want a ""complete"" set of movies when two of the discs full of special features is not included?????  That's what keeps this from getting a full 5-star rating.  Some may think I'm nit picking, but it just really aggravates me when I see a set that has been sooooooo long coming to arrive with a less than perfect landing.  While this was not a problem for me, it could be for some.  There are also no digital copies of any of the movies in this set.FINAL WORDSSo, that's it for my take on this set.  The case if very cool, the folders are so authentic looking, and HOLY CRAP....There's a freaking glowing blue cube in the middle.....what else do you need??  If you do get this, don't throw out disc 2 from both Iron Man movies, or you'll be as disappointed as I am.  Never fear, this set is so freaking cool, it almost makes me want to give it a full 5 star rating anyway.  Naaaaah...don't think so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MYGW9KQ62VJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083SBMGW#wasThisHelpful","R1MYGW9KQ62VJB","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally can't stand it when people write reviews for things they don't own.  I am a collector of limited edition books and movies, so I don't begrudge anyone who lucks up and snatches a copy of a limited edition item.  While I am sad that I missed the boat on grabbing this edition of Christine, I'm not really that upset about it.  Now I would be really upset if I had missed out on some new bonus content, but as it works out, the only thing I'm missing out on is a copy of the movie in high definition.  Oh, but wait.....That's not really true.  I have managed to obtain basically what is included on this disc for $9.99.  Here's how I did it.  First of all, I already own the Special Edition DVD of Christine, which if you don't, you can pick up for anywhere from $5 - $11 on Amazon.  I then signed in to my amazon Instant video on my PS3, and TA DA!!! there was Christine in HD for rent at $3.99 or to purchase for $9.99.  I chose to purchase it, since it will probably be awhile before another HD version of Christine becomes available on disc.  The DVD has ALL of the special features that are listed on the pricey limited one.  Here's where you'll have to make a judgement.  I just popped the DVD in, and the picture is very nice, but does lack some clarity that an HD transfer might have.  I compared the Special Edition DVD picture to that of the HD picture, and there is a little bit of a difference.  The HD picture does look nicer than the DVD in my opinion.  So if you don't own the Special Edition DVD, you can easily get a copy of that, then if you really want the nicest image available, download the HD movie from Amazon instant video.  Combined, you basically have what this limited edition has to offer.  So, bottom line, this is not much of a ""Limited"" Edition after all.P.S. It's also available for rental in HD 1080p from Vudu for $4.99","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHKMJ4SXDPWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQLSB3A#wasThisHelpful","R2LHKMJ4SXDPWB","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember reading The Diary of Anne Frank for the first time in 5th grade.  At the time, I had no idea who she was, and quite honestly was NOT excited about reading a girl's diary.  As our class read the book together, and our teacher explained the historical context, I began to get drawn into this girl's world.  Honestly, I don't think I really grasped the true nature of her world until a few years later.  I just remember how sad I felt at the end of her diary when it just suddenly ended.  Mrs. Webster then explained what happened to her, and I was truly stunned that someone would snuff out the light that shown so brightly as her words described the world in which she lived.Her diary was the crux of my interest in the Holocaust and learning more and more about it.  This book was just what I needed to really get a solid image of her entire family.  Now I can see photos of her entire family, and understand the background of each family member.  This book really works at making the reader realize that this was just an ordinary family who got caught up with the horror of the world in which they lived.  It also adds to the sadness I feel for what Anne could have accomplished in her life, had she been allowed to live it out.  Anne Frank is one of my heroes, and this book just really helps me better understand the world in which she lived.  Anyone who has enjoyed reading her diary will really enjoy this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AI423BSBN96Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307739414#wasThisHelpful","R1AI423BSBN96Z","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I teach fourth grade, and I'm always looking for books to display at the front of my room for casual reading.  I keep several books at the front for the students to read at their desks once they've finished their assignments.  After receiving this book in the mail, I couldn't wait to get it to school and introduce to my classroom.  It has quickly become the most popular book to choose for my casual reading time, and the girls like it just as much as the boys.  Sometimes, the kids will pair up and look at the book together.  When I asked my kids what they like most about this book, some of the responses were; ""It has lots of interesting facts in it.""  ""It's fun to read and pretend you're on safari.""  ""I like the pictures, because I can draw almost as good as that.""  I could go on and on, but needless to say, my students have truly enjoyed this book.  Many times a student will come up with an excited look on his/her face to show me something they've found in the book that goes along with something we've studied in class.  This is a great book to have in an upper elementary classroom, as well as the personal library of any child who longs for adventure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JM29QTO7SXHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743214251#wasThisHelpful","R1JM29QTO7SXHW","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live by myself, and I wanted to see how this would work as both a side dish and as the base for a main dish.  In order to do this with one package, I simply divided it in half.  The first meal I made was using this as a side, where I simply fixed it as directed on the package with no other ingredients.  This makes a very tasty pasta dish, and worked well with some veggies and a grilled chicken breast.  A couple of days later, I decided to add some things to this to make it a meal by itself.  I simply took some steamed broccoli, carrots, and some chopped chicken breast.  I steamed the veggies before adding them to the cooked pasta, and I baked my chicken breast before dicing it up to add to the finished product.  I did add a little extra parmesan to the final product and TA DA!!!  I had a very tasty meal.  I already have this on my shopping list for the next time I go to the grocers.

"Let me be upfront about something......I'm not a fan of most Axe products.  My experience with them is that they tend to be over-saturated with cologne, and don't tend to do a good job at the task they were intended for.  Now that I have that out of the way, I can tell you what I really think about this shaving gel.  I usually need a gel for sensitive skin, because I tend to get those annoying shaving bumps from time to time.  I was really surprised at how this gel lathers up.  I was quite surprised to find that it did a better job than my usual gel at providing a smooth clean shave.  My razor seemed to glide more smoothly across my face, and best of all.......no annoying shave bumps after!!!!  One other thing I liked about this product was that there was no over-powering scent to it.  I simply felt clean and fresh after rinsing off.  this may be a little more expensive than my usual, but you actually use less of it because of how it lathers, so I guess it balances out in the end.  This is my new shaving gel from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SVMOHNHGQSAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0J086C#wasThisHelpful","R2SVMOHNHGQSAQ","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, let me get some things out on the table.....I am a major Alien fan, and have been waiting for a good game based on the movies.  I had preordered this, and after reading some bad reviews, I was uncertain when I went  to pick it up in the store.  I've played several different Alien games over the years, and ALL of them have been miserable failures.  I was sooooooooo psyched when I first heard about this game, and preordered it waaaay back.  I had the option to cancel my preorder, but chose to bite the bullet and take a chance.  Boy am I glad that I did.  I've read many reviews giving the graphics very low ratings.  I would like to defend the graphics in this game.  Are they mind blowingly realistic??????  No.  Do they help me lose myself in the game???  YES.  The atmospheres are really reminiscent of the Aliens movie.  There are points in the game where the xenomorphs come out of the walls, which is a frightening point of the game.  That mirrors one of the scenes from the film where the Aliens literally come out of the walls behind the characters.  It was truly unexpected the first time it happened, and it made me smile just a little.  The one area I would have to say I was disappointed in the game was that there were actually graphic freezes during most of the cut scenes.  That is NOT when you want any kind of freezing to occur.  I never experienced this during actual gameplay, but it became routine in cut scenes.  A little annoying, but not mind altering enough to make me hate the game.  The graphics are not top notch, but they are not the crap that so many have claimed them to be.  One of the things I really liked about this game was when you were picking up ammo from the scene, if one of the weapons in your arsenal is full, it does not show up on the landscape to pick up. That's one thing that is annoying to me is other games when i see ammo, run over to it, only to find out that my inventory is already full of that particular ammo.  This may seem like a minor thing to some, but it was something that really stood out to me.  It was also very easy to change weapons on the fly in this game.Now, let me tell you where this game really shines!!!!!  Whoever is responsible for the sound design of this game, deserves an award.  If you are a fan of the film, you will truly appreciate the sound effects in this game.  The weapons sound just like the ones in the movie, and the eery blip of the motion tracker is unnerving in scenes where you just know there is one just waiting to jump out at you.  The music is also just spot on with the soundtrack from the original film.  The screams of the xenomorphs send chills down my spine.  When you get close to the end, you keep hearing the sounds of the queen Alien, but you keep waiting to see her.  This really helped to create some tension in the game.  I have to say that the sound of this game helped in more ways that any game I've played to help set the mood and put you in the world of the game.  Hats off to the people who designed the sound for this game!!!While the campaign is actually pretty short (it took me about 7 hours on soldier mode), the multiplayer adds a lot or replay ability to it.  I'm hoping that some upgrades will take care of some of the problems with this game, but I still have to give this game a thumbs-up.  It is hands down the best Alien game I've ever played, and I fully enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3TDK7GAZ8OU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005THAX6K#wasThisHelpful","R3L3TDK7GAZ8OU","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Rid-X for several years, and after being in my current home for 15 years, I have never had a septic issue.  The powdered version is the one I've used most over the years.  The one problem I have with it is that it takes 2 to 3 flushes to get it all down.  The powder keeps wanting to float to the surface.  I tried the liquid version, but it wasn't always available in the store.  I've used detergent gel packs with my dishwasher for years, and LOVE them.  What a brilliant idea to put a great product like Rid-X in a convenient gel pack.  The box comes with three packs, which will last three months.  It couldn't be easier than using these gel packs to protect your septic system.  No need to measure powder or liquid.  Just drop one gel pack in the toilet, and with one flush, you're system is treated for a month.  I will never go back to the powder version now.

"It's been a long time since I've seen the complete version of this classic skit.  The idea of presenting this skit in the form of a children's book is brilliant.  The illustrations are simple, and really aide a young child in understanding ""who's on first"" by showing a picture of the character with the name ""Who"" under the picture.  While adults may catch on to this humor without visual aides, this would be difficult for a child to grasp without them.  But don't be fooled, this is not a book just for children.  Anyone who remembers Abbott & Costello's imaginative take on baseball will thoroughly enjoy this new book.  If you've never been exposed to this classic comedy, you owe it to yourself to experience the wonderful talents of those two larger than life figures in entertainment history. I teach fourth grade, and I intend to have two of my students act this skit out, in order to expose this generation to good clean comedy.

"I'm relatively new to the Keurig world, and I've had a hard time weeding through bad blends to find a really good one.  Some of the ones that came highly recommended to me have what I can best describe as a chemical after taste.  The Donut Shop brand was highly rated, but when I got it in m sampler pack and tried it.........AAAAACHHH.  It was absolutely horrible, and had a really bad after taste.  No amount of creamer could make it taste good.  When my order of Martinson Donut Shop Blend arrived, I must admit that I had low expectations for it.  I went to the kitchen and popped it into my Keurig and was pleased at the delightful aroma that I smelled as it brewed.  I popped in my sugar and a little vanilla creamer and was ready to try it.  One sip and..........AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH....now THAT'S a good cup of coffee!!!!  It is a light roast, but has lots of flavor to it.  There is no hint of the after tasted I've noticed in many K cups.

"If you're looking for a great pair of sunglasses to wear in the car, keep looking.  Because most newer cars have UV tinted glass, these glasses will NOT darken in the car.  However, if you're looking for a good pair of safety glasses to wear outside while doing lawn work, or other tasks that require safety glasses, this is a perfect fit.  First of all, the glasses come in a cloth pouch which also doubles as a cleaning cloth. I think the feature I like most about these is the fact that you can customize the earpieces and nose piece to your personal comfort fit.  It's also nice that the lenses darken or lighten, depending on your location.  Lots of times when I'm doing work outside, I have to take my sunglasses off when I come in the house.  Not so with these.  Just as soon as I come inside the house, they adjust to the indoor lighting.  When I go back outside, they darken very quickly, so no more taking my glasses off and on.  The frames of these glasses also bend quite a bit without showing any signs of stress.  There is also an adjustable strap attached to the back of the glasses, which I like because I can tighten up when I'm mowing so they don't get knocked off when I mow around this pesky shrub in my yard.  One really amazing thing about the design of these is that when you're wearing them, almost your entire field of vision is free from seeing any part of the frame itself.  In other words, you have a completely unobstructed view while wearing these glasses.  They are so light and comfortable, you hardly even notice them.  I'm very pleased with these, and I think anyone who works outdoors a lot will be too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD74VOUTRP4TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JZ1TZO#wasThisHelpful","RD74VOUTRP4TW","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I teach at an elementary school, and with recent budget cuts, I had to remove my coffee pot from my classroom.  We do have a big coffee station in the teacher's lounge, but most of the time the pot is empty by the time I make it down.  The coffee maker does have a hot water spout on the side, which is usually used for hot tea or hot chocolate.  After receiving the Pumpkin Spice coffee in the mail, I was excited to see if it could help with my coffee dilemma.  Just a few spoonfuls in my mug, and a trip down to the teacher's lounge would prove very rewarding.  As I add the water, I stir the coffee, and that actually creates a little bit of foam on the top.  The smell is incredible, and I have teachers walking by asking what I am drinking that smells so good.  OK, smells are one thing, but the big test is.....how does it taste??  As I lift my mug to my lips, the aroma of pumpkin spice fills my nostrils.  I take a sip and..........mmmmmmmmmmm the taste of fall fills my mouth.  While this may not be quite as good as a cup from your local coffee house, it is a really tasty cup of coffee for instant.  I'm almost finished with it, and it is on my shopping list to replenish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJ8SVN2QB2MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004T3QMD8#wasThisHelpful","R1RJ8SVN2QB2MA","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My fourth graders just beeeeggggg me to read them Coraline each year.  It's a great story to read aloud, and it lends itself to dramatic voices while reading it.  When I received Liesl & Po in the mail, I decided that I would try it out on my fourth graders.  It only took a couple of chapters, and my kids were hooked!!!  This became a great treat for them, and they would beg me to read a couple of chapters of this book each day.I would classify this as a Cinderella tale, as it involves a young girl who has to live in an attic.  One night, this figure appears to her, and it is not clear if it is male or female.  The character also has some kind of creature with it that could be a dog, cat, or any other kinds of pet.  I couldn't help but think of Neil Gaiman's ""The Graveyard Book"" at this point in the story.  Now, don't think that Lauren Oliver has just stolen from another author, it's just that the atmospheres of the two stories are similar.This book is definitely NOT for the very young.  I would probably draw the line at fourth grade, as some of the images are just a little too dark for younger readers.  There is nothing overtly gruesome in this story, but it is a pretty dark and depressing tale.  Most of the adults in this story are evil, and Liesl and her newfound friends are the lights in the otherwise dim world.  Some may think that stories such as this are really not good for younger kids to hear, but I would stingily disagree.  The original fairy tales are pretty grim, and I really think this story resembles one of the original Grimm's tales.This is a very captivating tale for both young and old reader alike.  It has enough whimsy to capture the attention of a young reader, and enough darkness to enthrall more mature readers.  My fourth graders give this book two BIIIIIG thumbs up!!!A little side note about the advance proof from the Vine Program.  This book was a great example for my students to see the process a book goes through before final publication.  The rough sketches and the missing illustrations were very interesting for my students to see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZ79MD5A3WRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006201451X#wasThisHelpful","R3AZ79MD5A3WRY","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My fourth graders love it when I read them stories.  I decided to try Bailey out on them.  First of all, this is not a book that really lends itself to reading aloud to a group.  I found myself having to explain a lot of the things in the illustrations that added a little humor to the story.  Even with an explanation, my students just didn't respond as I had hoped they would to this book.  I really think that an audience of younger kids, perhaps kindergarten or first grade, would have a totally different reaction to this book.  While the illustrations are wonderful, the text is just not captivating for an older audience.  Younger kids could probably relate to the problems Bailey faces in going to school for the first time.  They would probably have a little different sense of humor regarding the problems Bailey faces in constantly being distracted by things throughout the day.  The illustrations are really good in this book, and help flesh out the text.  Overall, it's a good book, but not GREAT.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8K2UU5UNZQ2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545233445#wasThisHelpful","R8K2UU5UNZQ2L","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, let me get my review of the film itself out of the way first.  FLAWLESS in every aspect!!!!  You just don't see films like this anymore. Enough said.Now I will get down to the specifics of this Blu-ray edition:Outer Box:About the same size as Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind collections.  You slide the slipcover off to reveal a GORGEOUS black box with the title in bronzed bas relief on the top.  This is not a flip up case like Wiz and Gone, but a box with a removable lid.  The artwork of the title is truly beautiful.  It looks like bronze with the statues from the arena of the big chariot race bookending the title BEN HUR.  You immediately get the feeling that what you're holding in your hands is something of high quality.Inside the Box:Lift the lid off the box and you see the hardcover book with a black ribbon underneath to help lift it out of the box.  The book also has the title in bronzed raised text with a wonderful picture of Heston in the iconic chariot race.  The book itself is filled with gorgeous quality images where the colors just pop off the page.  The gold background on some of the pages adds a touch of class to this book.The Discs:The three Blu-ray discs are housed in a very study try-fold disc holder that is very similar to that used in the recent Taxi Driver Blu-ray.  Each disc is very sparse in its presentation.  The background of the try-fold is a color image of Heston in the chariot race.  The discs themselves are very classy with solid black and the text on the discs in a dusty gold.  Nothing flashy here, which adds to the ambience of class that oozes from this set.  What's on the discs is just breathtaking.  Warner Bros. has outdone themselves with the restoration of Ben Hur on Blu-ray.  The image is so crisp and clear that I noticed things in the far distance of some scenes that I had never noticed before.  e.g.) In the opening of the film when we see a Roman garrison walking across the landscape, I now notice a tiny line of red capes in the far distance moving.  I have never seen them before, because I never saw the red robes that are easy to spot now.  While Blu-ray could easily hold the full content of this epic on one disc, it was a wise decision to spread it over two discs.  Thus allowing the film to be presented in the most pristine image and sound ever!!  The bonus disc has the original silent version of the film, along with tons of extras.  One of the new extras is a documentary of Heston as he was filming Ben Hur.  This documentary is worth the purchase alone.  The Heston family has allowed the inclusion of family films and pictures, which really present Heston as a truly loving family man.  While the silent version does not seem to have received any major restoration, it is still an upgrade to the image of the previous DVD version.Heston Journal:Have you ever bought a collector's edition of a movie and thought, ""Why would they include this in the box???""  There are no cheap chachkis here.  I really wasn't really enthused about this journal, until I actually read it.  First of all the journal is a beautiful reproduction of Heston's personal daily journal as he worked on this film.  It opens with an introduction from his son Fraser, and then you turn the page and see Heston's personal daily journal pages that have been reproduced so that you actually feel like you're looking at the real thing.  The hardcover is designed to look like a stitched leather journal with the bas-relief image of one of the arena statues from the chariot races on the cover.  The name Charlton Heston is stamped in gold at the bottom.  it is really interesting to see what Heston was thinking on a daily basis of filming one of the greatest films of all time.  There are some reproductions of photos, tickets, and other items that are actually taped into the journal to make it seem more realistic.  At the end of the journal, we are presented with some personal photos showing Heston with his family around Rome and the movie set.  The last image of him walking away on the ancient streets of Rome dressed in a suit while holding his sons hand who happens to be dressed in Roman soldier garb is truly touching.  To my surprise, we are also treated to some of Heston's sketches from the movie set.  I had no idea he was such an artist!  Finally, the journal closes with a brief biography of Heston.  This journal is captivating, and engaging to read.  What a wonderful extra to put in this collection.  No collectible watches, no stacks of cheaply produced post cards, just simple memorabilia of this historic film.I previously had the 4-disc collector's edition DVD, and I was quite happy with it.  However, seeing the love and attention that Warner Bros. has put into this edition, I can strongly urge you to upgrade to this new Blu-ray edition.  The sound and image is better than you've ever seen before, and the extra items in the box are well worth keeping.  Oh, and did I mention you can get all of this for a fraction of the price you may have paid for previous collector's editions???  This is a no-brainer.......Add it to your cart right now!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCPSUS2ETZNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013MYB9K#wasThisHelpful","R1DCPSUS2ETZNV","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mojito is one of my favorite adult drinks.  There are some pretty nasty tasting Mojito mixes out there, but this isn't one of them.  Making the drink is pretty simple, because all you have to do is pour the mix into your water, chill it, and TA DA you have a great tasting drink.  If you like lemonade, and are ready for something different, try the Mojito.  Each packet makes 10 quarts, and each serving is only 5 calories.  If you're looking for a low-cal alternative to soda, this is a refreshing choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGFVJCBL1JXIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005A1LINC#wasThisHelpful","RGFVJCBL1JXIF","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you are new to the Star Wars galaxy or a seasoned follower of the Force, this is a great item.  This is a well-made helmet constructed of sturdy plastic.  The nose piece is padded to fit comfortably over the nose, and there is a pad to cushion the forehead.  This would be a great piece of a kid's Halloween costume.  Just add some black clothes and a cape, and your little one can be the Dark Lord of the Sith.  The one part that keeps this from getting a perfect score for me is that the real voice of Vader was not used.  There phrases and the breathing are pretty cool, and a chile probably will not notice that the voice isn't actually the real thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B267J3ADH5X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SGHLXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3B267J3ADH5X8","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no secret by now that Joe Hill is the son of one of the most popular authors in our lifetime.  Rather than depending on dropping the name of his father, Joe Hill has chosen to venture out on his own by dropping his real last name, ""King"".  I'm excited about the fact that Joe Hill seems poised to fill the shoes of his father Stephen.  I loved his novel ""Heart-Shaped Box"", and now he has returned with the follow-up to it.  Horns is a novel that will remind readers of just how good Stephen King was earlier on in his career.  The premise here is pretty simple.....a guy wakes up from a wild night of partying only to find that he has what appears to be horns under the skin on his skull.  As the story proceeds, the horns become more pronounced, but the weird thing is that most people don't seem to notice them at all.  What the young man seems to have acquired is the ability to hear the thoughts of what people close to him really think about some of his decisions.  This is a terrifying thing to contemplate.  What if you could actually hear what your friends and family REALLY say about you when you're not around.  As his horns grow, he seems to be drawn to the dark side.  Once this story gets rolling, it just steam rolls on to a fantastic conclusion.  I've also enjoyed Joe Hill's comic series, Locke & Key, but I can't wait for his next novel.  If you're a fan of classic King, you will love what his son has to offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFP4MX101Z8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061147958#wasThisHelpful","R3KFP4MX101Z8C","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up watching the original films in theaters, and remember the years in between, just waiting for the next episode.  The original trilogy quickly claimed the number one place on my list of all time favorite movies.  But they were more than that.  Some of my favorite memories of childhood involve Star Wars.  As the years have passed, and Lucas continues to tamper with them, the love I had for these films has faded.  The main reason for that would be that Lucas has so drastically changed the originals.  Each time these films are re-released, we find that he has again ""improved"" the films.  These improvements have been decried by long-time fans, and yet he continues to change the films.I had held off pre-ordering this box set, and was just about ready to give in and order them, when I got an email about the latest confirmed changes to the original trilogy.  I went online and found the sight where I could preview these changes.  Replacing the puppet Yoda in Ep. 1 I think was actually a good thing.  The puppet used in that film just didn't equal the original Yoda.  The next clip I watched was where Vader now screams NOOOOOOOOO as he throws the Emperor over the railing.  I felt sick when I saw this.  First of all, the voice doesn't seem to be Vader's at all, and secondly, this really robs the scene of the emotional impact it had in the original.  When I first saw this in theaters, I remember wondering if Vader would choose the Emperor or his son.  I didn't need a lame scream from Vader to understand the emotional conflict he was feeling.OK, now I would watch the clip that would just wipe any hopes of this release redeeming itself.  It's the iconic scene from Ep. 4 where we encounter Ben Kenobi for the first time.  Luke has been attacked by the Tusken Raiders, and they are looting his land speeder.  In the original, we hear an eery sound echoing in the valley, and then we see a shadowy figure coming towards the speeder.  We soon realize that this is Obi-Wan, and we realize that because of his powers, he was able to emulate this sound which frightened the Raiders.  The new scene shows Obi-Wan approaching just as in the original, except for one major difference.  Where once we were given a sound that would truly frighten someone away, there is now a sound that would cause someone to bend over in uncontrollable laughter.  Why would Lucas think this is an improvement?????  This one sound totally destroys the whole scene.The final changes I've seen really don't seem to detract from the original.  The fact that we now are treated to blinking Ewoks actually does make the scene seem a little more natural.  However, I have to wonder why all this effort was put into making Ewoks blink when there are still some major problems that have not been addressed.Lucas seems to have a major problem with letting these movies go.  I find it hard to understand why he seems intent on totally destroying these iconic films.  It really upsets me to watch what was such an integral part of my childhood slowly evolves into something that is barely even watchable anymore.  I feel that Lucas has no respect for his fans, and he continuously shows this by changing them even though he hears our cries from the sidelines screaming, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!""  Unfortunately, our cries have gone unheard.  After watching these latest changes, I have finally decided that I have no desire whatsoever of watching these bastardizations of what was once a landmark trilogy.  And I certainly have no intentions of adding any money to Lucas' greedy pockets for this travesty.The Force has gone out in the galaxy.......sad sad sad","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2H1FZ1GBGTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZSJ212#wasThisHelpful","R2H2H1FZ1GBGTP","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being an Ape fan from my childhood, I purchased the ultimate collection when it first came out.  I was pleased to go back and watch all the films, the TV series and the animated series.  The audio/video quality of the animated series in the Ultimate Collection was really lacking.  There was hardly any color palette, other than oranges and browns, and it was botched by tons of dust, scratches, and artifacts.  The sound was muddled mono track with pops and hisses.  After years of holding out, I finally broke down and took a chance on double dipping on the remastered animated series.  I popped in the original from the Ultimate Collection, just so I could have a fresh image by which to compare and contrast.  The newer release loads with the same menu design, so no real differences yet.  Once I pushed play on episode one, IMMEDIATELY, my mouth fell open as the differences were glaring right before me.  Colors and details that were not visible in the Ultimate Collection were now presented to my wondering eyes.  I couldn't believe how crisp and clear the images were.  I popped in the old one again just to see it, and was dumbfounded at the stark differences between the two version.  You can now see every brush stroke and pencil line in the animated cells,  Contrast that with the original where everything was blurry and there seemed as if someone had overlaid the whole image with a dark filter.  The audio is still mono, but it too has been cleaned up.  There are still a few examples of some specks here and there, but this is the absolute best I've ever seen this.  Another annoying aspect of the original release was that the whole screen seemed unstable, as it would wiggle and shake.  This is especially noticeable in the opening titles.  That has been corrected, and now you have a stable image without the annoying jiggling.  Fox is truly to be commended for doing such a great job at cleaning up this series that is a fond memory from my childhood.  Of course, since we only had a black and white TV at the time, it is truly a treat to see this series in all its colorful glory.  If you have the Ultimate Collection, you owe it to yourself to spend a little money and get this newly remastered edition.  You won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A45HF2VMEPXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E991A2#wasThisHelpful","R2A45HF2VMEPXW","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the fond memories of my childhood is that of me sneaking around and trying to watch Space 1999 late on Sunday nights.  This was after the original run of the series on prime time, and it had gone into syndication.  My mother did not allow me to stay up that late on a school night to watch the show, so I had to conceive of MANY creative ways in which to thwart my mother's attempts to keep me from watching this show.  While she was able to catch me many times and send me back to bed, there were enough instances where I did get to see enough episodes to fall in love with the series.Previously, I have owned some DVD copies of the series, but was always a little let down and how underwhelming the series was when compared to modern shows.  The colors were always washed out, and the sound was very tinny, as it was never meant to be played with a surround system.  If you're a fan of the show, and you currently own any of the previous DVD versions of this series, you will want to toss them after seeing 1999 on Blu-ray.  I was not prepared for the crisp colorful images that began to flow across my screen after playing the pilot episode.  The picture is truly stunning, and I would say that it even rivals that of the remastering of the Star Trek Original Series.  On the old DVD's the interior of Moonbase Alpha always seemed so bland and monochromatic.  While there are still a lot of creams and whites around, you will now notice splashes of color all over the place in computer displays and flashing instrument panels.In addition to a major improvement in picture quality, the sound remix is AMAZING!!!!! Of course this series was released long before people began to hook their TV's up to surround systems, so on the original DVD's the sound was much as I remembered hearing it on a small black and white TV in our living room.  When the first explosion occurred in the pilot episode, I was very surprised to hear a deep bass coming from my subwoofer.  Of course these sound effects have either been tweaked, or completely re-recorded for this hi-def release.  If you prefer the original mono soundtracks, never fear, there is an option for that.  While the original sound effects are really closer to my memories, the new surround effects really add to the enjoyment of this series.OK, now for my biggest surprise.  While I did love this series as a child, watching it on DVD was a little of a let down, because the special effects seemed very dated.  I expected that any restoration in hi-def would only amplify what I remembered as cheesy effects.  I was SHOCKED to see that the extra clear image provided by blu-ray really does 1999 a favor by showing the details of the models used for the special effects shots.  This show was not an offshoot of Star Wars as some may think.  1999 came out a couple of years before Star Wars was released.  While you may see an occasional wire attached to a character to help simulate the reduced gravity on the moon, the ability to see the details in the models is what really got me excited.  High definition actually makes these models look more life-like.  That was an unexpected treat with this new restoration.Now we come to the star on the top of this wonderful package.  In addition to some special features spread out over the 5 blu-ray discs in the set, there are also two DVD's chocked full of extra features.  Many of these features are released here for the first time in the US.  There are audio commentaries, text commentaries, making-of featurettes, interviews, still photos, etc.Bottom Line:  If you enjoy good science fiction, and can overlook some conflicts with scientific reality, then take a step back in time and see what good TV was like 35 years ago.  This set brings back so many good memories for me about my childhood.  I remember all of the elaborate tricks I tried to play just to be able to see this show, and it brings a smile to my face now that I can pop in a disc anytime and watch this wonderful show in a way that is far better than anything I ever expected.  Just in case I start to feel really nostalgic, I can switch on the mono sound track and sit up really close to the TV so my mother won't hear.  I swear that woman had bionic hearing!!!  Oh yeah!!!!!  Just one more plus to this new set......Instead of taking up several inches of shelf space for the DVD's, you now get the entire first season in a nice shiny package that takes up less than one inch of shelf space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WMHIHIG4BYBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ES5JDI#wasThisHelpful","R2WMHIHIG4BYBJ","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a teacher, so I use a LOT of pens in a year.  Experience has taught me that when it comes to pens, you get what you pay for.  Recently, I received the BIC Triumph through the Amazon Vine Program.  After using it for a couple of weeks, here are my thoughts on this pen.  There is a rubberized grip which make the pen very comfortable to handle.  This is a gel pen, so the ink does not dry on contact, however, I do believe it dries fairly quickly.  The point creates a nice tight line of text, even when writing small notes in the margins.  This pen glides very smoothly across the paper, and I never had a instance where the ink blobbed up or flowed unevenly.  I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this pen out, and I will add this model to the list of pens I like to use on the job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BYHY9LKF7PML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00347A8OY#wasThisHelpful","R2BYHY9LKF7PML","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This box set is a fantastic review of lang's recording history.  If you are debating between buying the 2-disc and the 4-disc set, I will try to point out why you may want to invest in the 4-disc set.k. d. lang has evolved from country, to pop, to true diva status.  Any fan of k. d. will agree that it's the voice that keeps drawing us back for more.  I have been a fan for many years, and I have to admit that just like any other musician, she may have had a couple of hiccups along the way, but the last several years we have heard her embrace her vocal style and deliver some absolute masterpieces.  I don't even have to hear a sample of any new albums now before buying them.So, what's in the 4-disc set????  The first 2 discs are the same as in the standard collection.  While I believe the songs sound great, I was surprised to see some titles missing from the set.  I just can't think of a k. d. lang concert without thinking of the song, ""Big Boned Gal"".  Although there are some songs that I would like to have had included in this set, I was happy with the first two discs.  The third disc is what separates this set from the standard edition.  The live numbers on this disc are absolutely FABULOUS!!!  There are times when I can close my eyes and think that I'm hearing a cross between Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald.  The live tracks on disc three are truly the star of this collection.  Her voice invokes an era of smoke-filled rooms with cocktails flowing.  The extra DVD has a collection of her videos ans some live performances.  OK, ok, k.d. never produced a video comparable to Thriller, but the real star of her videos is that silky voice.  I was really amazed at how well these videos sound.  Constant Craving sounds better than ever, and it is one of the better videos on this collection.  The true star of the video collection is the live performances.  I've never seen her live myself, but I hope to be able to catch her in my area some time.Bottom Line:  Is this set worth the extra dough over the standard 2-disc set???  If you are a lang fan, then the answer would be a definite YES!!!!!  The extra items on the third CD are woth the few extra dollars alone.  The packaging is also very nice.  Each disc comes in a little cardboard jacket resembling an old LP jacket.  There is also a booklet that includes all the lyrics for every song in the collection.  Just think of the DVD videos as an extra little bonus.  k.d. lang has become one of my favorite singing artists, and I am quite happy with my new 4-disc recollection set!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28O0RGOR8YMDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZTIIXU#wasThisHelpful","R28O0RGOR8YMDB","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After hearing about Heavy Rain over a year ago, I was eagerly waiting to see if this game holds up to the pre-release praise.  After playing the demo, I was intrigued with the story, the characters, and the controls.I really don't think it would be right to tell much of the story, since so much of it depends on your actions.  Basically, you're dealing with a father who is recently divorced, and lives with the pain and guilt of the death of a child.  This story is told in a totally interactive way that allows you to make several decisions on how to progress the story.  The beginning may seem somewhat mundane as you have to get out of bed, brush your teeth, and take a shower.  What is really going on, is a creative way to teach you how to control the main character.  The beginning of this game does not depend on blowing things up or shooting lots of zombies, instead, the focus is on getting to know the characters, and getting involved in the storyline.  The characters in this game are realistic, and sometimes elicit emotional responses.  Instead of relying on fast action scenes, and lots of explosives, Heavy Rain follows a dramatic storyline that draws you in and puts you in charge of what will happen to them.  One of my first concerns was with the controls.  I got a little irritated with them when I first played the demo, but soon realized that I was trying to play it like other games I've played before.  That's when it hit me, this game was not meant to be controled in the same manner as other games.  What was originally something I didn't like about this game, I have come to love the controls for Heavy Rain.  The ability to control the speed with which the characters moves and handles objects really adds to the atmosphere of the game.Bottom Line:  If you're looking for a great looking shooter, by all means DON'T buy Heavy Rain.  It's just not that kind of game.  However, if you're an adult who has been looking for a truly mature game with great characterizations, real story telling, and great graphics, I truly believe you will like Heavy Rain.  If you're still not sure, either download the demo on PS3 Home, or rent the game before you buy it.  This truly is a new kind of game that relies more on atmosphere and characters than awesome weapons and flashy special effects.  Honestly, I love a great shooter, but it's also awesome to have a new kind of game to play.  Heavy Rain is bound to set a new standard in the development of more mature titles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ORHLHI3XEVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CZ38KA#wasThisHelpful","R26ORHLHI3XEVF","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, now we all know that this is like the best movie ever made, right???  Good, then I don't have to go into the movie at all.  That leaves me time to discuss this new blu-ray collector's set of the best damn movie ever filmed.  Let's get started as if we're just opening this box set.Outer box:As soon as you get the plastic wrap off, you're going to want to rub your hands along the smooth red velvet that covers the entire box.  You'll notice the title ""Gone With the Wind"" embossed in gold foil along all four sides of the box, and the front is a recessed image from the famous burning of Atlanta scene with the words, ""Gone With the Wind"" in raised gold lettering.  Just the outer box is enough to illicit a slight gasp.Opening the lid:Now let's lift the hinged lid, and what's that I see???? The lid is secured to opening no greater than a 90 degree angle with two black strap that are attached to the lid and the inside of the bottom tray.  Oh! my my!!  Who's that I see??  Why fiddle dee dee, it's Scarlet O'hara herself gracing the inside lid with a beautiful photo from the set showing her sitting on a fence in a white belle gown, with Tara in the background.  Now our eyes are drawn to what is actually inside the box.Inside the box:We look down to see a hardcover book with a black cover showing Rhett, Scarlett, and Tara in silhouette with the sky shaded a blazing orange and red.  The book is a top notch production with glorious black and white and color photos throughout.  There are also lots of concept drawings, costumed designs, and behind-the-scenes illustrations.  Now we lifts a black ribbon on the side which lifts the book and the other extra contents out of the box.  Now we see the reproduction of the original program given out at the premiere.  Now if you have the 4-disc DVD collector's set, this is the same reproduction as enclosed there with the nice exception of being full sized. The larger size really adds to the quality of this program.  The other printed bonuses may or may not appeal to some.  What you'll find is a collection of different communiques between the filmmakers and the various production agents.  It does provide some interesting insight into the feelings about the movie as it was in production.The Meat:OK, now we finally get to what we bought this for in the first place.  Oh.....wait......I really did want all the previous stuff, so I guess for some this may just be the icing on the cake.  The final two items in the set are a CD sampler and the blu-ray edition of the movie.  The CD Sampler is housed in a very handsome CD case, and clocks in at a little over 30 minutes of Alex North's wonderful soundtrack for this film.  It leaves you wanting more, but it's a nice addition to the set.  Now for the final course....the movie.  The movie is on one blu-ray disc, and the picture is absolutely stunning.  I've never seen this movie look so fresh and vibrant.  Warner should get an award for their recent remastering of some classic films; Casablanca, and Wizard of Oz to name a few.  The sound here will leave you breathless.  The orchestral score at the beginning and throughout sounds better than I've ever heard it.  There is no edition that you currently own that can come close to the quality of the newly remastered high-def image and sound.  There is another blu-ray disc full of supplemental material.  I believe that all of the content from the 4-disc DVD is included here.  There may be something missing, but it appeared to be everything to me.  Even if there is something missing, you won't miss it, because there are three hours worth of new extra features that are included here for the first time.  First is a great documentary that originally aired on TCM, called ""1939: Hollywoood's Greatest Year"".  If you missed out on the original broadcast, here's your chance to see this wonderful documentary.  It truly is amazing how many classic films were released during this year.  You also get a new featurette titled, ""Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On"".  Finally, there is a made for TV movie ""The Scarlett O'Hara War"" that dramatizes the search for an actress to play Scarlett.Finally:As if we don't already have enough to warrant purchase, we are presented with 10 watercolor 5 x 7 cards of different production shots.  Each of these is printed on quality stock, and is worthy of being framed.WHEW!!!!!!  OK, that's about it.  Any collector of classic films owes it to himself to get this stunningly beautiful collector's set.  The quality of everything enclosed will leave you stunned.  You definitely get your money's worth with this set.  Bravo to Warner for presenting this very important film in a way that exudes quality and class.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13YLA0J5YJPLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013N7FZ6#wasThisHelpful","R13YLA0J5YJPLT","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I converted from XBox to Playstation a few years back, God of War was one of the first games I bought that was exclusive to the PS2.  I've always loved Greek mythology, so I suppose that may be part of the reason why I quickly fell in love with the tragic story of Kratos.  After finishing GoW1, I eagerly awaited the release of God of War 2.  It was truly amazing that the PS2 was capable of producing such beautiful graphics.  The story was even better than the original, and it left me hanging for part three in this wonderful franchise.I've been patiently waiting for God of War 3 to hit the shelves, so I was quite surprised when I found out that the original two titles in the series were being remastered in high-definition for play on the PS3.  I got my copy home, opened it, and loaded it onto my PS3.  I'll just tell you right now that ALL of the content from the first two games is on one Blu-ray disc, including all of the extra features from disc 2 of GoW2.So, is this worth an upgrade????? The answer is a resounding YES!!!!  If you are a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to get this title and enjoy all of the improvements that have been made to both games.  First of all, they have both had an overhaul in the graphics department.  While GoW1 still doesn't quite measure up to the latest PS3 graphics standards, it is a big improvement over the old PS2 version.  The game now fills the screen on a widescreen TV, and there is a noticable difference in the details of the graphics.  The sound has also been improved and adds to the overall enjoyment of playing back through one of the greatest games ever created.  You will also notice that the rumble feature is present, and there is quite a nice trophy collection for each game.  Some of the trophies are quite funny.  For instance, in GoW1, you can earn a trophy by dying so many times that the game offers you the ability to move to an easier setting.  It was fun dying over and over just to earn this trophy.  It's been a long time since I played GoW1, but it was amazing how much of the game I could remember.The storyline for both games is completely the same, but the improvement in the graphics and sound is well worth the cheap purchase price for both games.  This set should keep you busy trying to earn all of the trophies while you wait to get you paws on GoW3 in March 2010.  And just to make things a little better, the demo that was available at E3 for God of War 3 is now available to anyone who purchases this collection.  And let me tell you, the demo will leave you waiting in anticipation for the arrival of what will surely be the best game of 2010.  In my humble opinion, God of War is one of the most enjoyable game series I've ever played.  OK, ok, before I close out, I'll come clean.  It's just so much more enjoyable ramming your blade down the throat of a minotaur and watching the blood gush out in high definition.  Or maybe grabbing one of the bad guys and pulling their body in half with a mighty torrent of HD blood going everywhere.  Yes, it does bring a smile to one's face to relive such great gaming moments in the clarity that only HD can provide.  Whether you are a longtime fan of the franchise as I am, or if you are new to the God of War trilogy, you MUST get this new collection.  I guarantee that you will NOT be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXVFV8MCY0P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NN7AKU#wasThisHelpful","R3OXVFV8MCY0P2","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was lucky to stumble into this series from the first episode.  The Masters of Horror series had some great episodes in it, but there were some truly terrible ones as well.  That series left me a little disappointed in that there weren't more quality episodes.  Along comes Fear Itself, also created by Mick Garris, and I decided to give it a shot.  The very first episode I saw blew my socks off.  I quickly added it to my DVR programming, and eagerly awaited the next episode each week.  Through its short run on NBC, some of the episodes that stand out above the others are:  Skin & Bones: Larry Fessenden does a great job of creating tension by letting the viewer know that something is terribly wrong, but keeps holding off from revealing too much too soon.  You know something is going to happen, but WHEN????  The lead character who has returned from a hunting expedition after being lost in the wilderness for days, but his family knows that something about him is very different.  The lead actor here does a great job at creating some truly creepy moments with the makeup and his facial gestures.  Community:  This episode is reminiscent of The Stepford Wives (original edition).  The people in this neighborhood are willing to keep it perfect at ANY cost.  In Sickness and In Health:  OK, imagine this; it's the day of your wedding, and you're the blushing bride.  You receive a note that tells you that the person you are marrying is a serial killer.  John Landis is at his best in this episode!!  The Sacrifice:  OK, now this one was my favorite!!  Four people come upon this big fort out in the middle of the forest.  Once they enter, they can't get out.  Three mysterious sisters appear, and we keep thinking, ""Something is NOT normal about these girls.""  I don't want to give anything away, but there is definitely something abnormal about them.  I love the feeling of isolation and true helplessness the characters face as they are unable to leave this place.There are four episodes that I'm not familiar with.  Either they were never aired, or I simply missed them.  They are, ""Chance"", ""The Spirit Box"", ""Echoes"", and ""The Circle"".  Unlike the Masters of Horror series that was more hit and miss with good episodes, Fear Itself steps out to provide one quality fright fest after another.  There is not a bad episode in the whole series.I wish this series was available on Blu-ray, since it was originally broadcast in HD, but having said that, the picture on this DVD looks great.  There are four episodes that get the 'Director's Cut' treatment, and each episode has a nice little intro by the director.My Views on the Set Itself:  I have to admit that this set snuck up on me.  I didn't realize it was in production, and was quite shocked when I saw it on the store shelf.  Of course the thing that helped draw my eyes to it is the packaging that resembles a three dimensional tombstone with a skeleton on the front.  I LOOVE the tombstone design here, but when I opened it, my elation turned to frustration.  I'm not crazy about double-sided DVD's, but I can live with it.  What I find appalling is the fact that TWO discs are held together on ONE hub.  The discs actually rest on top of each other, which opens it up for some SERIOUS scuffing.  I'm sure there could have been a better option that could have still held the set down below the $30 price line.  There are no inserts here, but on the back of the tombstone is a detailed list of the contents of each disc.I would normally knock off a star or two for bad packaging, however, with this set I will make an exception.  Everything else about it is so perfect, that all of the positives outweigh the few negatives.  You get 13 episodes in anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, quality bonus features, and an AWESOME package and best of all.......It's less than $30.  Horror fans I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed with this great set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M43YCZMTIOT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EP8FDI#wasThisHelpful","R1M43YCZMTIOT6","A4GB8I8ACS4PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GB8I8ACS4PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Phantom Aquatics Snorkel Set is comfortable and lightweight, making it a great choice for packing your own gear instead of renting when you're going on a trip or cruise that includes snorkeling.The clear, thin construction allows for a snug, comfortable fit with little to no fogging. It comes with a lightweight carrying pouch that helps with packing multiple sets for couples or families.The mouthpiece was also pretty comfortable. I often get irritation on my gums or cheeks, but these were flexible and allowed for a good seal with an easy grip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRN8BZ3NX7YB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWX6FR4#wasThisHelpful","R1HRN8BZ3NX7YB","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Holmes True HEPA device comes with clear instructions and is easy to set up. It's a little larger than I expected--somewhat obtrusive, visually, in a bedroom, but it serves a purpose and does its job well.I'm running it all day and night. It's fairly quiet on the lowest setting, which is perfectly fine for overnight use. You can pump up the speed a few notches and it sounds closer to a room fan--loud enough to be a little annoying if you're on the phone near the unit, but not nearly as loud as a full-speed fan. You're not trying to create a breeze with this machine; you just want to clean the air. Either one of the 2 lower settings should be enough to move room air through the filters and purify the air you're breathing in. I'm very allergic to dust and some types of pollen, and so far it's doing its job in making things a lot easier for me. The air even smells cleaner.As others have said, the filters are a little pricey; of course, the more stuff in your air, the more often you're going to have to replace the filters. Nevertheless, this thing does its job, and if keeping air purified and relatively allergen free is important to you, this is a good solution. Check your filters regularly and replace as needed. It will set you back money, but if you see what gets caught on the filters instead of in your nose, you'll probably find it's worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6L5Q2V9412O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H0Y5XQ#wasThisHelpful","R2C6L5Q2V9412O","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought my daughter would be the perfect person to review the Ergobaby nursing pillow, so, without further ado, here's what she has to say:Overall I think it is a decent pillow--especially for the cross cradle position, which seems to be what it's mainly for. The shape is great and my 7-week-old fits perfectly in the groove. She seemed to be mostly comfortable, except I had some trouble figuring out where to put her head. I found that if her head was high up on the side, her neck was bent in what seemed to me to be an awkward position, although she actually seemed perfectly comfortable and happy; but if I put her head more in the cradle, it wasn't above the rest of her body like the instructions said it should be. I used it cross-legged, sitting up in bed with a backrest pillow, and found that I had to actively hold the pillow against my body or it would slip away from my middle. I didn't have to lean over or put any strain on my back, which was great, and I also didn't have to hold her head up at all, which was a nice rest from my other main nursing pillow, the My Brest Friend pillow. One thing I find invaluable in the Brest Friend that the Ergo pillow doesn't have is the clip to secure it around my waist. I think if the Ergo pillow had that, I would give it a much better rating. I also find the Brest Friend to be softer and more comfy for the baby.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300A0W232MXN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UT0G10Y#wasThisHelpful","R300A0W232MXN5","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Volo case provides slim, lightweight, light-duty protection for the iPhone 6. I had been using an i-Blason highly protective cover since I got my phone a few months ago, after hearing that the phone was very fragile and breaks easily if you drop it. And, make no mistake about it, the thin, light, smooth iPhone 6 is easy to drop if you don't have a case. The i-Blason unit comes with separate front cover and built in screen protector, and a thick, heavy-duty back casing that the front cover and phone both have to snap into. It's very protective, but it's often a hassle because of its thickness, rubbery feeling, requirement to use the thick screen protector, and inability to take anything except a direct, straight-in Lightning power plug for syncing or recharging. And it's not easy at all to snap the two pieces together or even to take them apart when I want to stand the phone on a speaker dock or clean the screen protector inside and out. Didn't mean to review the i-Blason tough guy here, but I wanted to use it to set up how light and easy this Volo is to use.The Volo is more like what I was used to before being so paranoid about the fragility of the iPhone 6. The phone slips into the case very easily. You can add your own screen protector if you choose, or not at all. I recommend screen protectors to women who keep their phones in their bags. You never know what you'll slide your screen against that would leave scratch marks. For those of us who slip their phones in their pockets, a screen protector really isn't necessary (unless you have sandpaper linings). The glass is usually up against my pocket lining or turned outward toward some tissues or other soft stuff. I certainly don't keep the phone in the same pocket that I keep keys, loose change, etc.The camera lens is completely unobscured by the case, so you can snap away to your heart's delight. The cover with rounded edges and back bumpers provides great protection on tabletops and probably will also save your phone on most typical drops of 3 or 4 feet. Of course, whether your screen survives a fall depends on the angle it drops and what the screen may be hitting up against.The short of it: very handy, very light, easy to put the phone in and take it out, provides back and edge bumper protection for the most likely falls, and allows easy access to lightning plugs and adapters of various sorts without modifying the case. I like it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0V9CM27BY50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMS1ACQ#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0V9CM27BY50","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may have noticed a $20 discount popping up all over the market on the original Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker. That's probably because they were clearing inventory to make room for the new version of this wireless powerhouse of sound. The SoundLink Mini II is simply awesome.You'll find more than 5,000 reviews for the original Mini, averaging a 4.7 rating out of 5 Amazon stars. That's a lot of happy users.Here's what they've added or changed in the new version:1. It has an improved lithium-ion battery that takes it up to 10 hours of usage from the original 7 hours. On paper, at least, that's an increase of over 40%.2. It has integrated phone compatibility, so if your paired phone has an incoming call while you're listening to something on the Mini II, the speaker will take over the audio and ring, and you can press a single button on top of the speaker and use it as your speakerphone. The sound on a call is great, and my caller on the other end said the microphone must be pretty decent because he could hear me very well. As soon as the call ends, the speaker picks up playing your music or podcast.3. It has a micro-USB input so you can charge it the way you do most other USB-charged devices. That replaces the proprietary AC input plug they used to have that required you to use their AC adapter. Because there is now direct USB connectivity, Bose promises you'll be able to download software updates in the future, such as for new Bluetooth compatibility advances.4. You can now pair two devices at the same time instead of just one, and it memorizes the Bluetooth settings for the last 6 devices you've paired.5. There are helpful voice prompts for Bluetooth pairing, identifying the device currently paired and also prompting you through setup.This is a Bose speaker, so the sound is absolutely amazing. It's tiny. It weighs 1.5 lbs and it's smaller than a brick. I've never heard such powerful lows in such a small speaker. I can feel the bass vibrations running through my kitchen countertop. The speaker is a mere 2 inches tall, 7 inches wide, and just over 2 inches deep. Picture that, or measure it out. When I first got the speaker running in our kitchen, my wife came downstairs from the bedroom to tell me she couldn't believe how great it sounded, even upstairs! We've had quite a few Bluetooth speakers here, and the difference between the Bose and those in the $35-$100 range is like night and day!I haven't tested the range fully, but I can tell you that I've had my iPhone in my pocket at times and walked upstairs and to the furthest parts of our house, and the connection hasn't dropped. I'm sure it has limits, and it may depend on how fully the speaker is charged, how fully your phone is charged, what the walls in your house are made of, and so on. They spec it for 30 feet, but I'm sure there will be variations on that with individual experiences.There is also an LED power indicator that glows green when the charge is >70%; yellow if it's 20% to 70%; and red if it's below 20%.If ""two bills"" is within your budget for a Bluetooth speaker, go for it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R75495NV8Y3NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WK47VEW#wasThisHelpful","R75495NV8Y3NE","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to go through all the specs of this camera, because there's a wealth of information about it on the product page here. Panasonic obviously pays a lot of attention to its Amazon sales channel; I noticed they even answered the first question in the Q&A section down below.This LUMIX model was quick to set up out of the box. As a lot of other reviewers here have said, though, be forewarned: the built-in memory is only enough to hold ONE hi-res photo. You might as well order a memory card right now with your purchase if you want to be off and running and don't have spare memory cards around. I'm using a 64GB card, and it holds almost 12,000 photos at the 12 megapixel setting.Setup was typical: insert the battery pack, insert your own memory card, curl the lanyard around the lanyard post, and review your software and camera setups on the multifunction display. One new thing for me was wifi setup. I downloaded an app for my iPhone and stepped through the setup to link the camera to my phone wirelessly. By doing that, I've been able to transfer images to my phone quickly and they integrate easily into my automatic cloud setups for Apple, Dropbox, etc.The camera is small and light. I feel like it's about the size and weight of a deck of cards. The crisp display takes up about 3/4 of the back of the camera, which makes it a great size for viewing and for managing settings. But that also means the control buttons have to be very small. Each button is about the size of one letter on the iPhone keyboard (I checked). Take some time to practice on it to master the most frequently used functions, and you should be good to go.I haven't had the chance to test it underwater yet, so can't comment on that.There are three controls on top: on/off, shutter, and video-record on/off. The on/off is slightly recessed to prevent inadvertent shutdown when reaching for the shutter. The shutter is in the middle and is by far the largest of the three. It's very slightly raised above the surface, making it very easy to locate intuitively.On auto settings, the pictures are crisp, sharp, and bright. There are plenty of manual settings, but keep in mind this is not a DSLR and most of your controls have to be set via tiny buttons and a series of on-screen menus.I'm not doing a drop-test, either. It's rated to be shockproof to 2m (6.6 ft). I'll let you know if I happen to ""test"" it unintentionally.Using a battery pack as it does, you might want to buy a spare to keep fully charged while you're using up the one installed. The camera comes with a plug-in battery pack charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MBSF6A6UBYZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBG61G8#wasThisHelpful","R1MBSF6A6UBYZJ","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You inspect the roller wheels often to make sure no grit has attached itself there, because rolling that grit over flooring can create scratch marks.3. Keep the device plugged in between uses so that it's always fully charged before you start out.4. Use your wrist at least as much as you use your shoulder and elbow in order to get the most out of the extraordinarily flexible swivel head. It's all in the wrist!Here's the key to how it works. Imagine a Dustbuster or any other handheld vac. Now look at the photo of the Ergorapido. See how it flares out at the bottom, before it gets to the roller/pickup portion that cleans the floor? That's the handheld vac that can detach easily and be used separately. It sucks up dust and dirt off the floor and brings it right into the handheld vac. And that's pretty much the whole thing. Everything else above the handheld vac is basically a stick and power switch that enables you to vacuum your floor without bending over. Simple, right?What you need to know:You're using a hand vac on a stick. The entire dirt/dust capacity of the unit is contained in the handheld vac. That means it doesn't hold a lot, and it's why I said above that you should use it on bare floors and not on carpeted floors. If you run it over carpet, you're going to pick up a lot of fibers and dust, and you're going to have to empty the dust canister too often. If you run it over bare floors, you'll just get the dust and crumbs and little bits of things, and you should be able to run it over all your floors before you have to empty it.It moves so smoothly! I love the way the swivel head allows you to twist and turn around chair legs and under tables and into corners and along cabinet kickboards. The vacuum is light and very maneuverable.As an added bonus, you can detach the hand vac anytime you want and use it for countertops, upholstery, tables, chairs, and stairs. It comes with a detachable accessory that gives you the choice of wedge or brush tip.Here's something I thought was really cool. When I first opened the box, I pulled out the various pieces (all packaged very securely to ensure only the slightest chance that anything would be damaged in handling) and looked for documentation on how to put it together and how to use it. There were only the most rudimentary instructions on assembly, though it's really easy to do. I assembled it within about 10 minutes and then looked for description of features, tips for maintenance, etc., and found nothing. Then I noticed there was quite a bit of information printed right on the carton. And then...and then...I noticed a QR code. So I thought, hmm, let's see...and I pulled out my iPhone, scanned the code, and it brought me right to a very cool mobile site that had a video on how to unpack and assemble the device, the features and how to use them, info on the replaceable filter and how to get it, and quite a bit more instructional and support info. So, if you want to save yourself a tiny bit of head scratching, scan the QR code before you open the box, and it will save you a few minutes of scrounging around for supporting documentation.Well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJ47AIW2NO9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQHJV8C#wasThisHelpful","RQJ47AIW2NO9P","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're taking a cruise from Rome to the Greek Isles later this year, so I've been researching Mediterranean cruise ports to plan our daily adventures. I already had the Rick Steves book on these ports, so I thought I'd also try the National Geographic version to add to my info choices.This being a National Geographic Traveler publication, it's important to note that the photos, maps, and diagrams ""travel first class"" all the way! I wish every travel guide had graphics like these. The Rick Steves guide, though chock-full of information, relies heavily on word descriptions. The National Geo book expertly conveys lots of information graphically in a way that allows for easier info gathering while on the go.A complaint I have about many of the travel guides is that they're big and heavy. You really don't want to have to carry them around. Although the Nat Geo book is about half as thick as the Steves guide, it's also built to be durable in both binding and pages; thus its weight is about equal. Better to leave these books in your ship cabin or hotel room and consult them to plan your days ahead. Or, do what I often do: just tear out the pages you need and carry those with you each day.This travel guide covers the following regions and ports:Coastal Spain: Barcelona, Malaga & Granada, Valencia, Balearic IslandsFrench Riviera & Provence: Marseille & Provence, Cannes & St-Tropez, Nice & Around, MonacoItalian Riviera & Tuscany: Genoa & the Coast, Florence, Pisa, Lucca, Siena, San GimignanoRome & Naples: Rome, Bay of Naples, Capri, Amalfi CoastSicily, Malta, & Puglia: Sicily, Malta, PugliaVenice & the Adriatic: Venice, Split, Dubrovnik, More Ports to Visit on the AdriaticAthens & the Islands: Athens, The Peloponnesus, The Islands, CreteTurkey: Istanbul, EphesusOne of my upcoming ports is Mykonos, and it's not mentioned anywhere in this book.Another one of my ports, Santorini, is covered in a tiny section of about 250 words (I counted, roughly), with no photos or graphics. In the restaurant appendix, there is one listing for Santorini.So, if you're going to Mykonos and Santorini, this book pretty much ignores you.There are about 14 good pages on Athens via the port of Piraeus, but, really, you can find tons of good travel guides covering major European cities in much greater depth than that. And there are 4 good pages on Ephesus via the port of Kusadasi, Turkey, but they contain not that much more info than you can get in your daily cruise newsletter.Sections on France and Italy seem stronger, but, again, not much hard info.To me, the biggest value that comes along with this book is its attractiveness as a first-stage research guide--for an overview--in trip planning, and in having it at home as a keepsake that you can show to others to describe a little about your trip without boring them with your own photos.Although I didn't love the Rick Steves book either, it's loaded with much more information about port, transportation, and excursion details than this travel guide has. Just a 3 out of 5. Sorry, but it really leaves you wanting for more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L47CX8LP1CYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214634#wasThisHelpful","R2L47CX8LP1CYR","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I are both big fans of Ahava products. I use Ahava exclusively for shave and after-shave, and she's tried hand creams, foot creams, body creams, eye creams and loves the feel and scent.This is a review for the AHAVA Dead Sea Water Mineral Hand Cream 1.3 fl. oz. tube specifically. As with all Ahava products, it feels smooth and gentle going on, and it never leaves a greasy feel. It soothes the skin. My wife uses this hand cream especially in the winter, to keep her skin from drying out and to keep the skin on her hands from painful cracking. Sometimes she'll even go with the much more expensive ""Dermud"" version from Ahava, which she finds especially effective.Although the 3.4 fl. oz. tube is sized specifically to meet the TSA's 3.4 oz. limit for carry-ons, this smaller tube may be enough for you--and at this price it's a pretty good buy as Ahava products go. Yes, Ahava products are expensive. I use the tiniest amount I can get away with, and a little bit of Ahava does go a long way. As the commercials say, a little dab'll do ya! Oh, wait, that's Brylcreem, from decades long past.Last item: This particular product has a gender-neutral scent and package-design, so all of us macho guys can use it without fear of derision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33LXPYLOTQURP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052OUDLU#wasThisHelpful","R33LXPYLOTQURP","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As long as your expectations are set correctly, you'll like this DII shower curtain! It's very lacy and has a pretty flower-blossom pattern throughout (or a lattice pattern, depending on which ""flavor"" you choose here).As for expectations, please be advised that this requires a shower liner. It's decorative but won't keep the water in your tub. It's very light and frilly and oh so delicate looking!My wife is more of a perfectionist than I am. She didn't like that the edges are frayed all around, apparently because of the way the underlying lace pattern would leave frayed threads when cut to shape. But it's polyester--not a natural fabric--so I guess they were able to heat or otherwise seal up the edges so that whatever is there will stay there and not fray and fall apart.The top edge is tape-reinforced to last awhile, and the buttonholes take shower curtain rings pretty easily.It's quite inexpensive, but you should get a year or two out of it and then you'll be able to get something else to freshen up the look of your bathroom!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0842OEPIKAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDHSK#wasThisHelpful","R3K0842OEPIKAU","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our little pink hooded towel arrived just this weekend, and I'd have to say the photos and descriptions here on the Amazon page are pretty faithful to the actual product. It's soft, yet not velvety soft; I think if it were too soft, it would be prone to pilling and matting plus it wouldn't be as absorbent. And, as always, for maximum absorbency in towels and washcloths, avoid using fabric softeners. That holds true for large, high-priced bath sheets as well as cute little baby towels like this one.I'm taking one star off a perfect 5 because our towel arrived with some pulled and/or loose threads. All the seams are tightly stitched, which seems great for long wear after multiple washings. Nevertheless, we were surprised to see a couple of pulls straight out of manufacturing and quality control, but the loose threads don't seem to compromise the structure at all. It's a good buy, though, as these were very minor imperfections in a very attractive and useful baby gift or accessory.The towel is large enough to wrap fully around baby and keep him or her warm and eventually dry, and the shape allows for easy wrapping or swaddling of baby as you get the diaper and clothes ready.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK38S2JEIC3Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3R9990#wasThisHelpful","RK38S2JEIC3Y3","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TP-LINK AC1200 dual band router has worked very well for me. Setup was fairly easy. One thing I did was to disconnect my old router first as well as the range extender I've been using, to make sure my devices weren't picking up any signals that would confuse them or me. After reading other reviews here, I did make sure to run software/firmware updates repeatedly until everything was up to date. I'm a chronic updater anyway, so I would have gotten to that eventually regardless of other user input.I set up my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone easily enough. I made sure to put my Roku on the faster, 5 GHz channel, especially now that we're streaming HD more often. My Mac is on the faster band, too. I set up my wife's ASUS PC as well as her iPad and iPhone on the regular (2.4 GHz) band, because she does mostly emails, social networking, and low-res video (YouTube, cooking videos, etc.). We've both been satisfied with the speed. Signal strength hasn't been an issue, except in one extreme corner of our house, where the signal drops occasionally. Then again, that corner is where one of the bathrooms is, and no one in their right minds would ever bring their iPad or their iPhone into the bathroom, would they?? (heh).The unit has 3 external antennas for the higher-speed band and 3 internal antennas for the ""slower"" band. That helps provide a strong signal and may be the reason I haven't felt compelled to try me range extender yet. Just take your time going through the setup, think about which devices you want on which band, and do all the updates and you may have the same positive experience I had. I've learned that everyone's situation is different regarding wifi usage. We stayed with friends recently in a big-city high-rise apartment building, and when I tried to log into their wifi router I saw more networks pop up on the list than there are homes in my entire community--many with the same signal strength as their own network! That's a lot of radio waves glomming onto your device antennas! They even needed to add a range extender just to get around the corners of their small apartment in that steel-enforced building--not a problem we have here with wood frame construction. One solution certainly does not work for all circumstances, so you may have to try a few different routers before finding the one that makes itself at home in your home.

"I know the most important thing for most Amazon customers is the overall star rating of a product, so I really regret that I have to give this pretty good shower caddy only 3 stars. Here are the reasons I downgraded it:1. As others have mentioned, the shower caddy slips down over the shower arm and comes to rest against the binding nut of our shower head. That means the top of the caddy sits about an inch or so further out than the bottom of the caddy, thus the shower caddy is sloped all the time.2. The suction cups provided might have solved the problem by pulling the whole unit tight to the wall, but they simply do not stick to my Fiberglas shower enclosure.3. The wires are spaced a bit too far apart on the lowest shelf, which I would like to use for bar soap. Once the soap gets down to about 3/8 inch thickness (still plenty of soap left), the soap tends to slip down through the wire shelf and fall to the shower floor.4. Because the shower caddy slips down to rest against the tightening nut of my shower head, the upper part of it falls within the water flow from the shower head. Not ideal.Nevertheless, this is one of the best-built shower caddies I've come across. It feels substantial in both the frame and the shelves--not like a lot of the flimsy caddies you see in department stores. Also, it's great that it won't rust. That's the biggest problem we have in keeping clean-looking shower accessories like curtain rings, rods, etc.So, if you have a fairly long shower arm, one that comes out at least six inches or so horizontally from the wall, you may fare better with this than we did. The suction cups also may stick better to real tile than to the wall of our bathtub enclosure. It's worth a try if you're looking for a shower caddy that feels like it will last a long time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VAN1JSW42ZWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWQ80JS#wasThisHelpful","R1VAN1JSW42ZWS","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Aqua Optima Evolve filter works well as a replacement for the Mavea-brand filters in my Mavea Elemaris 9-cup pitcher. The Elemaris is the one with the curved top that has a usage meter at the top that supposedly doesn't just count down the time to replace your filter, as the simple technology in a Brita device does. The Mavea Elemaris claims to measure replacement time by tracking how much water flows into the pitcher and by measuring the hardness of your water as a factor in filter lifetime. So, if that's really true, then rarely will you find 2 people who have the same filter lifetime. Different people use vastly different amounts of filtered water (think a family of 5 with a few pets in a house with very hard water vs. a single or couple who spend little time in a home or apartment with ""soft"" water, for example). Given that reality, I don't know how anyone can state a general fact of how much it costs per month to use a Mavea filter.So I'm not going to comment on price.Also, if the Aqua Optima gives you a straightforward ""60 Day"" usage guideline, how does that account for how much filtered water your household uses, what your water hardness is, and whatever other factors may cause your filter's lifetime to vary (bacteria? chlorine levels? other chemical and microorganism levels?).So, again--at least, to me--calculating price is very confusing. To use the Mavea pitcher with the Aqua Optima filters, you have to ignore the filter countdown gauge on the pitcher and just replace the filter every 60 days. Well, I can do that with my Mavea filters, too, and that would run me maybe $4.50 to $5.00 every 60 days. So, I'm not saying whether this whole issue is a positive or a negative. I'm just sayin'...think about it...and maybe a water technician or scientist out there can elaborate on this.As to whether this replacement filter works, it does. You just pull out your old Mavea filter and put in the new Aqua Optima Evolve filter after just a little prep. They say to dip the filter into a pitcher full of water to soak it all around, then hold the filter under your running faucet for 1 minute, then place the filter in the filter cutout space in your pitcher, and you're good to go.I didn't time it, but my impression was that the water runs through this filter faster than it does through the Mavea filter, because there's one extra hole in this one. From purely a filtration standpoint, I don't know if it's good or bad that the water runs through more quickly. But it does, and you've got a full pitcher before you know it.I saved a cold glass of water that ran through my Mavea filter, and I did a taste test with the first run of water through my Aqua Optima filter. There was no discernible difference in taste. I can't even begin to analyze how effectively the respective filters worked in removing microparticles. I'll leave that for others.As far as the 60-day timer app goes, for iPhone and Android devices, this was my experience: I scanned the QR code that appears on the filter wrap, and my iPhone went through a couple of redirects to a page where I could choose Install. I did that, and it took me to the Apple App Store but led me to an app for a VPN (virtual private network) service. I scratched my head, wondering why I'd have to download a VPN app for this. So I backed out and scanned the QR code again, it took me to an Aqua Optima page that had an install button, and I pressed install again. This time it took me to some financial app in the App Store. I tried it one more time, and this time it took me to the Aqua Optima Timer app. I downloaded it, booted it up, the app asked for access to my calendar, which I allowed, and it was easy to set today's date and choose whether I wanted the 30-, 60-, or 90-day reminder. I chose 60 and that was it. After 60 days, I guess it will alert me to change the filter.But will the filter still be effective in 60 days, based on my own usage? I don't know. Would it last yet another 30 days? I don't know--your guess, or Aqua Optima's guess, is as good as mine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOCT7VKW6FTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9WLH4O#wasThisHelpful","R2SOCT7VKW6FTE","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered the AR Blue Clean AR383S pressure washer to replace a McCulloch 1400 PSI unit here at home. The Blue Clean worked well, so I'm going to bring the McCulloch to our summer home where all I need it for is deck and siding, and it has plenty enough power for those after 6 years of light to moderate use.Out of the box, the Blue Clean was extremely easy to set up. All you really have to do is snap on a hard plastic bracket to the side of the unit, screw in the input hose adapter, and you're pretty much set for typical use. On the other end, you have to set up whatever you'd set up each time you use the machine: Screw in the output hose (I suppose you could leave it attached if you want), attach the preferred power wand (they supply 2 different ones) to the spray grip, attach your water source using the snap-on hose adapter, plug the unit into a GFCI protected outlet, set the reset button on the electrical plug, and you're ready to ""rip.""When you're done with your task, detach everything in reverse order, and easily stow the various pieces in the very convenient holster, reel, and rack they provide on the unit for the gun, spray hose, power wands, and power cord. It's really pretty cool and very, very easy to keep together all the pieces you'll need for your next use.I felt the power in this unit soon after I turned it on. As I said, I was used to the 1400 PSI washer I have; this one is rated up to 1800 PSI, which they say is up to 40 times the pressure from a typical garden hose. You take that pressure and drive it through a narrow power wand, and you're talking some pretty strong water flow. Be careful!Job #1: cutting through caked-on dirt on the concrete walkwayIt took me a few minutes of practice to get control over the jet spray coming from the Blue Clean. There are a lot of variables: water pressure at the spigot source; length of garden hose and whether or not it has any kinks in it; choice of power wand (more on that later); width and height of spray (for flat sprays); composition of the surface material you're washing; stubbornness of the dirt or stain or covering you're trying to remove; the angle of spray, and probably more I'm leaving out. I experimented a bit on the concrete, got a feel for the wands and the flow, and then went to work. Using a concentrated flat spray (and quickly realizing this walkway was really, really dirty, with years of caked-on silt, ice-melt/salt, lawn chemicals, and whatnot), I worked my way up and down one square of walkway. I started to reveal the real surface of the material and saw how bright, clean, and white it was under all that grit. The Blue Clean worked amazingly well. Then, it being Christmas week here in the unseasonably warm Northeast, some of my grown kids started watching, so I showed off a bit by switching to pinpoint power and wrote my name on the walkway! It shone through as almost a bright white, with no damage to the rock-hard surface. And that was without putting any kind of detergent into the detergent tank.Warning: don't try this on your deck or siding unless you want your name permanently etched into the surface. Plus, my wife didn't like the idea of having my name etched through the dirt (said it heightened awareness of just how dirty it was!).The two wands they include are the pretty standard adjustable wand, and a ""turbo nozzle"" for concentrated, high-pressure spray. Both worked very well and were easy to attach, detach, and control.The spray gun handle is comfortable to use, and it has a convenient lock to prevent unwanted sprays during setup, teardown, or when you're just taking a rest.AR did a great job on this Blue Clean pressure washer. It feels sturdy, and even the plastic pieces are on the heavyweight side. We'll see how well it stands up over the next few years. I expect it to do very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y4YSUOO0JHBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPXQSNM#wasThisHelpful","R1Y4YSUOO0JHBC","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dance & Learn is a game module from LeapFrog for use on the LeapTV console. I see that LeapFrog has just launched its LeapTV app store, so you can order this game and lots of others as a digital download, too.Dance & Learn is lots of fun for young children. It's rated for ages 4-7, but I think it can be used by a precocious 3-year-old, too, with some help from an adult or older sibling. There are many learning games to choose from in Dance & Learn, some requiring the LeapTV hand-operated controller and others using the system's camera to bring your child right onscreen into the action to interact with the graphics by choosing answers or following the graphics to lead the child through fun actions like dancing or swiping at stars or popping balloons!As with all LeapTV games that use the camera, it's really important to set up the play area with the correct lighting: the child should be well lit from the front, and there should be no glare on the camera and TV screen.Some of the Dance & Learn games focus on: making compound words; recognizing rhyming words; understanding adjectives; and blending sounds into words. The games integrate learning with fun actions like dancing, jumping, twirling, waving arms--almost all with screen-based interactivity that allows your child to make things happen and actually see themselves as part of the action onscreen. It's fun while learning!There's a lot of versatility in play, too. You can set the games for one child to play, or for up to four children to take turns playing. You can set up individual profiles on the LeapFrog website so that your children get activities appropriate for their age or grade level. You can track your child's progress and usage online, too, if you take the trouble to set up a LeapFrog account and monitor it.The list price is pretty high, but it looks like you can get a pretty decent discount here on Amazon. It looks like everything is list price on the LeapFrog app store, but some of their other games are listed there for as little as $10.This is a good active-learning game for a young child who has the LeapTV system. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVJ0SEEQBJHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6NGS#wasThisHelpful","R2WVJ0SEEQBJHB","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this as a Vine selection for my wife (born in the 1950s is all she wants to share about that!), and here's her review:I was surprised that this was offered as a dual-purpose oil spray: for skin and for hair. I never even thought of using the same spray for both purposes, but I decided to give this a try.For hair, I spray a small amount on my hand, rub my hands together, and then apply to my hair before drying. It dries really well and gives my hair a nice gentle texture and clean feel. I hadn't even noticed the scent till I read other reviews here. I asked my husband (that's me, the guy who's typing this!) to give it the smell test, and he couldn't smell anything till he put his nose right up against my hair. That's when he said, whoa, that other person is right! It does remind me of that beauty parlor smell my mother's hair had! But I can't smell it at all, and he says he really only smells it when his nose is right in the middle of it. So, it passes the ""stink test"" for both of us! My advice is: use it sparingly, just a spray in one hand, then rub it through your hair and blow-dry. No problem, nice feel! (And the typist here agrees.)I've always used things for my skin all year-round, but especially during the cold, dry winters here in the inland northeast. I applied the L'Occitane Shea Butter oil, also sparingly, to my skin after showering, and it works well while leaving no noticeable scent at all. Also, I really like that it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy, like some other oils do.So, yes, it is perfumed in some way, but if you can control your button finger and use just a teeny bit of it on hair and skin, I think you're going to like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ORYSOUFIYWTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQJS2IA#wasThisHelpful","R2ORYSOUFIYWTK","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Taylor 7209 scale is sleek and shiny and would fit well with the decor of most bathrooms. The surface is a thick sheet of clear glass. The great thing about that is that it's easy to keep clean, using the same spray cleanser you'd clean your bathroom mirrors with.Be aware that the scale comes with a thin piece of plastic film that keeps the battery fresh between the time the scale leaves the factory and when it eventually gets to you. The film protrudes from the battery compartment on the bottom of the scale, but I found it difficult to just pull it out as the instructions describe. I had to open the battery compartment, which requires unscrewing two small Phillips screws. You'll need one of those mini screwdrivers to open it.Also, be aware that with this type of scale, you have to recalibrate it to zero the first time you use it and then every time you move it or even jostle it from its position on your bathroom floor. It's easy to recalibrate it. Just step on it briefly, even with one foot, and let it set to a zero display. The next time you get on it, it will display your accurate weight.We found the scale varies about 0.4 lbs. from the measurement on another digital bathroom scale we have. I think that's reasonable. You'll always have small variations between scales, unless you're working with highly calibrated, scientific devices. It's relative weight you'll want to be most concerned with here. We found that if one scale says one of us gained 0.2 lbs from the previous day, the other scale also shows a gain of 0.2 lbs, so it's consistent.One improvement we'd like to see is a lighted display. Our other scale has that, and it's a helpful feature. The weight readout is a pretty good size, though, and there's really no problem seeing it unless you want to weigh yourself in the dark!Additional features include BMI measurement, and memories to track stats for up to 4 different people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193UW0JL9P169/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK7FEYU#wasThisHelpful","R193UW0JL9P169","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Belkin was one of the first companies that made accessories for Apple products, going back well before Apple became the huge mass-market success it is now. So Belkin has been doing this for a long time and knows how to get it right.The product photo shows you exactly what you get: a one-port wall charger, a cigarette lighter adapter for the car, and a USB-to-Lightning cord.The shape and solid feel of the wall charger tells me that, structurally, the charger is likely to last a long time. My experience with Belkin tells me the electronics will last, too. And it's rated for 100-240V, which means you should be set for international usage as long as you bring along the necessary plug converter.2.1 Amp charging means much faster charging of iPads, and you should find faster charging of iPhones, as well.The lighter adapter is also rated at 2.1 Amps, so you'll get that fast charging the car, too.I also like that the USB/Lightning cord has a pretty sturdy feel to it. Add to all this the fact that it's Apple MFi certified, and we have a winner here!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2PPKZFJJHC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJDXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2D2PPKZFJJHC0","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unless and until Crayola improves this product, it's not even worth a buck. The markers color so lightly that you can barely see them. The colors are duller than dull, way muter than pastel. I can't imagine that any child would find them stimulating and enjoyable to use. The only thing that worked well was the eraser. You push the eraser head down firmly over and over again on the drawing board, over and over and over again, until it draws enough moisture from the handle to erase the barely visible markings drawn on the board. That works well. The markings come right off the board.In the Amazon description is says something like Choking Hazard!! Contains small pieces. Not for use by children under the age of 3, or something like that. So keep that in mind. The small sheet of instructions that comes with it is strewn with warnings:The marking surface is ""NOT FOR USE WITH ANY OTHER CRAYOLA MARKERS."" And this is not only in all caps, but boldface, too.""Doodle Magic colors may affect the appearance of some surfaces. Wipe household surfaces IMMEDIATELY. Avoid using Doodle Magic near any surfaces that cannot be laundered.""Wow. And ""IMMEDIATELY"" is also in boldface.Cleanup instructions include:""Wash hands with soap and water after use""""Rinse clothing or hard surfaces with cool water.

"The Adonit Jot Touch 4 feels like a solid, sturdy writing instrument in your hand. It's comfortable to the grip and allows for good pen control on my iPad mini.Setup was extremely easy, but with one hitch that I overcame. Instructions tell you to go to the Adonit website, where you can see the list of currently pairable apps and link over to the iTunes store to buy an app. I chose GoodNotes. I've been needing a basic handwriting and drawing app, and this looked like a GoodChoice! I couldn't find any free apps that were compatible, just to try it out, but GoodNotes was reasonably priced and it had a lot of good reviews so I went ahead with the purchase.Instructions for pairing with apps are available through the Adonit support site. Instructions basically linked you over to their YouTube channel. Here was the hitch, which I hope is short-term: When I clicked on the link to YouTube, a shadowbox opened on the Adonit page, ostensibly to allow you to view the YouTube video within the Adonit site, but the link was dead. It went nowhere, so I was left with a blank box. I tried this on my MacBook using Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, all with the same results. So I just copied the YouTube link (right-click on hyperlink and select Copy Link Location, then paste that address into your browser command line). It took me over to the Adonit channel on YouTube and I picked the video to pair up with GoodNotes. It was really, really simple, and the video was as clear as could be about how to do it. The stylus was paired up within a minute or two, no more than that, and the app responded to the stylus perfectly the first time I tried it.The app's option bar allows various pen thicknesses and colors, highlighting in various colors, drawing of perfect boxes and circles/ovals, fill-in colors. It's really a good set of features.The box includes a USB-powered charger. The charger contains a very strong magnet that holds the base of the stylus firmly and steadily during recharge. They say it takes 45 minutes, on average, to charge up, and the charge can hold for months when not in use. There is a simple green LED indicator that tells you when it's charged and when it's successfully paired. A red LED lets you know when it's not paired or not charged. There's a simple on/off switch which seems solid and works fine. The give you a screw-on cap to protect the stylus point, and they also give you an extra point. I don't know what the life expectancy of the point is.Seems pretty good so far, and they promise more apps to come soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JUMGTP2W5LAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO1L1RG#wasThisHelpful","R2JUMGTP2W5LAS","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Moenflo XL Single Function Showerhead has a lean, attractive look and provides an even, steady flow. Installation was a breeze, as it's just a simple round thing you screw on over some fresh Teflon tape. At first attempt, it provided a tight seal when I turned the water on--no dripping from the seal, no reworks needed.It does tilt/swivel in all directions, so you can customize the reach and direction as you like it.

"This review is about the Bergamot and Pear ""flavor"" of Baxter of California's Invigorating Body Wash. As you may know, bergamot essential oil is the flavoring used in Earl Grey tea. Bergamot is a type of orange (citrus fruit), and you'd think its rind would have a tangy/citrus-y bite; but it has only a mild hint of citrus, and that's what's made Earl Grey tea such a favorite over the years.Most of us know a pear when we see one and smell one. It's one of the mildest fruity tastes and scents ever ""invented""! I love a sweet, juicy pear--especially one that's ripened on the vine and freshly picked, an experience no one should miss.So it only makes sense that if Baxter put bergamot and pear together, you'd get a mild scent. And that's what you get. In fact, it's so mild that I can barely smell it. I've used it for a couple of weeks, and sometimes I start to wonder whether there's really any bergamot and pear essence in the formulation. Other times I just barely get a hint of pear.As for applying it, I still like to use my hands to apply things in the shower, whether hard soap or liquid body wash. (Now, how would that work if I didn't use my hands to soap myself up? I'm thinking about it and will update this if I come up with something.) I found that applying the wash by hand brought up no lather at all. Something about being a guy in a shower makes me want and expect that I'm going to get soap lather all over me, and I won't feel clean unless I do. The experience was more like applying a lotion and then rinsing it off. And because of that, I didn't feel like it really cleaned me. Probably just a perception thing, but there nevertheless.Next time I tried applying it with a terry washcloth. Barely a bubble. Still more like a lotion.The next day my wife tossed me an exfoliating sponge and said, here, try this. Just a few more bubbles.Next morning my wife threw a pouf at me and said, here, soapy boy, maybe this will work.And, voila, it did! Three pumps in that pouf (hmm...does that sound weird?) and I worked up a nice gentle lather all over. It rinsed off cleanly, with no lingering oily or lotion feel, and it was all good. Just as good was the fact that it didn't make the shower floor slippery--something I've experienced in testing other body washes. That's really dangerous, certainly nothing to play around with.I guess I'm just used to the deodorant soap bars with strong scents, lots of lather, and the squeaky clean skin it leaves behind. I just have to be careful to rinse the bar soap gunk off very thoroughly and then apply lotion to the areas that tend to get irritated. The Baxter wash probably leaves some good oils on your skin, and it's probably better for your skin. But I'm just guessing.Finally, the price of the Baxter wash is a bit too high for my wallet. Summary: I'd like a slightly stronger scent, I don't like having to use the pouf, it's too expensive for me, but I think it's a good product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PIYOULQQZAKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009AXE72#wasThisHelpful","R3PIYOULQQZAKK","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The product description says, ""Applying pomade to dry hair helps achieve a more matte finish, while applying to wet hair will give you more of a semi-wet look."" I like what they call a ""matte"" finish for everyday use, and I prefer the ""semi-wet"" look for dress-up occasions.So far I've applied Baxter of California's Soft Water Pomade very lightly to medium-short hair while it's around 2/3 of the way toward naturally dry, after I've finished my shower and shave. I apply just a little and run it through my hair with just one sweep across the front/top with my right hand and one little streak down the parted side with my left hand. Then I just shape my hair with my fingers and it sits just right, just the way I like it!As my hair has gotten increasingly (almost completely) gray, it's gotten a little more brittle, with plenty of strays and stand-ups. Baxter's keeps it in place all day long without the hard/sticky feel of gel. And, yes, it does give it a natural, matte finish, exactly the way I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5GC09JUPWDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00141FB9E#wasThisHelpful","RI5GC09JUPWDE","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing we did with the Bunnery Breakfast Sampler was go through all 4 varieties of their granola. My wife and I loved every one of them. The granola has a great consistency--that lightly cooked crunch that we like. It's not overly sweetened and not overly baked, so the granola forms either very small clumps or just individual oatmeal flakes. All the flavorings--fruits, nuts, seasonings, etc.--taste fresh and natural. And as an added bonus, the granola holds up well when sprinkled over a bowl of yogurt and mixed with fresh fruit.The oatmeal with sunflower seeds has a wonderful flavor and fully absorbs the milk or water we prepare it with for a full-bodied, natural taste.The pancake mix has some extra graininess built in. It cooks up nice and light, though, but with good body that lets you know there's fiber and healthy ingredients in there.The price is a little high for regular use at home, but it could make a great gift for natural breakfast lovers out there!

"I tried the Lifeproof iPhone 5 case and found it to be a little too bulky for regular use. But, then again, it's not really intended for regular use. It's a ""special occasion"" cover, when you think it might be exposed to water, sand, mud, etc.It's impossible to place the phone with cover on the 30-pin to Lightning adapter to charge or play your phone off a speaker dock.After reading some of the reviews here that described water damage incurred during regular use, I decided not to give it a water test at all. The risks are too great. So I can't vouch for water safety.Also, the plastic screen cover doesn't lie flat and smooth enough to be used as effectively as I would like to control the touch screen. And the sound from the phone's speakers is muffled slightly by the cover. The sound from the iPhone 5 is usually great, but this just sounds garbled and muted.It may be good for someone who really needs to subject their phone to risky situations, but I'm just not willing to try that with this cover.

"The Belkin Grip Cash for my iPhone 5 has a very good design in all respects but one. It's snug so the phone won't jiggle around inside the grip, keeping it safe from vibrations, abrasion, etc. The texture of the Grip case itself is great for keeping the phone steady in your hand. Some people live and work in hot or humid climates and their hands can get a little sweaty. The grip is rubbery and textured enough so that the phone won't slip from your hand easily at all. Push controls are placed perfectly, meaning that you can control your volume up/down buttons by pressing on the case covering them (marked + and -) and the contact is perfect. The on/off switch fits perfectly into its cutout, as does the photo lens and the mute switch.As with many of these cases, the going gets a little rocky when you get to the plug-in area at the bottom of the device. The simple, thin Apple earplug jack fits nicely into the external jack, but I've seen other connectors that might not fit. The cutouts for the 2 speakers are well placed. No problem there. It's the Lightning plug jack that's the killer. The simple charging cord fits in there nicely, but the 30-pin to 9-pin adapter does not fit into the jack with the Belkin cover on. That means I can't charge my device or listen to my music on all the various speaker docks I have around the house. And for me, that's a killer.So, if you don't use the adapter, you should be good to go. If you use the square 30-pin-to-Lightning (9-pin) adapter, forget it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIWP9IRXCJDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC5D0U4#wasThisHelpful","R3EIWP9IRXCJDZ","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, dumb title for a review, but as I started writing this, I was listening to ""I've Got the World on a String,"" by Frank Sinatra. It's a rousing, feel-good song, and it was the first song I started playing when I wanted to test the Jabra Speak 510 as a Bluetooth speaker for my MacBook Pro.Let's start from the beginning, though. The speaker comes with a USB cable wrapped conveniently around its base. The unit is powered by USB, but it can also double as a USB-connected external speaker as well as a Bluetooth speaker. You just choose which way you want to go by using the Jabra Suite, which you download from the Jabra website. On the Mac, it comes up as a control panel under System Preferences.To start up, you plug the Jabra speaker into a USB port on your laptop or PC and just do a quick Bluetooth-device connection routine. You can then pair up your speaker with your phone or other Bluetooth-enabled device.The controls on the speaker are touch-sensitive and are located around the surface edge surrounding the speaker itself. You can see what I'm talking about in the product photos. The controls are surprisingly precise for touch-sensitive switches. The switches are: power on/off, phone pickup, phone hangup, + and - volume controls (which are nicely complemented by an array of little LED lights that circle the device--the higher the volume, the more dots are lit up around the device clockwise; then there's the Bluetooth switch (with blue LED when successfully paired); mute on/off; and power/charging light: red while it's charging up, and I guess I'll find out eventually what color it changes to when it's fully powered (green, I hope).The sound quality is pretty good for a little speaker. By testing it with music right now (still Sinatra), I can tell how well it's reproducing the sound. It's much harder to judge speaker quality with a cellphone connection because of all the variables of connection quality, background noise, how loudly the person is speaking, how far they are from the mic, etc. The small speaker has very decent quality. I have to say the stereo speakers built into the MacBook Pro (recent build) are quite good, and stereo, too, but this allows me to play music while I'm working without having the music coming out right in front of my face--in case my landline rings, etc. Also, I can turn the volume up and down using the keyboard volume controls. Interesting, though, that I can't mute the speaker by hitting the mute key on my Mac. The play/pause button works, though, so all is good.I also did a phone test. It required just a simple Bluetooth pairing and all was set to go. The sound is fine, a little better than the quite good built-in speaker on my iPhone 5 that's used when in speakerphone mode. The mic is great--picks up anyone speaking in my office, and with good sound, I'm told on the other end.Good job, Jabra!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZ7Y2SZLVKLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQUO5RI#wasThisHelpful","RXZ7Y2SZLVKLH","A3OC42X7H74D1Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OC42X7H74D1Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In For the Sake of Their Son (The Alpha Brotherhood #4) by Catherine Mann, Formula One race car driver Elliot Starc discovers he has a son from his best friend Lucy Ann when he is kidnapped from his best friends bachelor party. He has not talked to Lucy for eleven months after misunderstandings drove them apart and now he has discovered he has an infant son from the single night of passion they shared.Elliot wants a second chance. The chance to become the father he never had. The chance for best friends to become something more. But can Lucy Ann forgive the mistakes he's made and trust that he wants more than a marriage for the sake of their son?For the Sake of Their Son by Catherine Mann is definitely one of Catherine' Mann's best novel because of great writing and lots of drama. Right from the start the way Elliot gets to know about his son to the finish, the story had enough interesting turns to keep me hooked. The chemistry between the characters was so amazing and the fact that they were childhood best friends made their love story more believable..Though I did not like Elliot in the beginning for abandoning Lucy after their night together, I warmed up to him eventually because he was willing to undo the mistakes he made with Lucy for the sake of their son, Lucy too was a perfect match for Elliot because she stood up to him and was an amazing mother.Overall, For the Sake of Their Son by Catherine Mann is captivating read that keeps you hooked to the end. Recommend for Catherine Mann fans and for anyone who loves the friends to lovers trope.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A8MW353ZDBL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373732880#wasThisHelpful","R2A8MW353ZDBL3","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hard to Hold (The U.S. Marshals) by Karen Foley:  Madeline Howe loves her younger brother Jamie with all her heart. He is the only family she has left in this world, so when he is kidnapped and threatened with death unless his gambling debt is paid, Maddie hops on a bus to Reno to save him. She doesn't have the $50,000 ransom needed to set him free, but she is working on it. Her mind is a mad mess of worry, as she contemplates robbing a diner in order to get some cash. Instead, she uses a toy gun to take a hostage, who just happens to be Colton Black, a rugged, U.S. Deputy Marshall.Colton was onto Madeline the minute she walked into the diner. He knew something was up, but had no idea how truly desperate she was. After spending some time with her, under toy gunpoint, he gets her to confide in him a little bit, and that is when he realizes that he has to help her. There is something about Maddie that calls to Colton. In addition, he believes that the organization threatening and holding her brother is part of a huge crime syndicate, that the U.S. government has been trying to infiltrate for over a year.Madeline is a spunky little CPA. In spite of growing up without a mother, a father that committed suicide and an alcoholic grandfather, she turned out okay. Unfortunately, her brother inherited the addiction to gambling gene, associated with the Howe men, and on more than one occasion has gotten himself into trouble. Madeline basically raised Jamie, and did whatever was necessary to keep some food on the table while they were growing up. Although Jamie is 20, she continues to feel an obligation to him.Even with all of Madeline's baggage, Colton is falling for her and she is beginning to feel the same way. Madeline and Colton have instant chemistry and once they learn to trust each other, Jamie can be saved and they can begin to explore a future together.Hard to Hold is a well-written book and the story flows effortlessly from beginning to end. The characters are well described and their feelings are palpable. The sex scenes between Madeline and Colton are steamy and Colton's alpha male persona is hot.However, I found the plot to be utterly ridiculous, which made it difficult for me to get through the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WN79HPGFA71E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373797907#wasThisHelpful","R1WN79HPGFA71E","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Marrying the Cowboy by Trish Milburn, Elissa Mason has been dodging her aunt Veronas matchmaking by throwing everyone she can in her way. She even managed to put her best friends in the way before her aunt could set her sights on her. But now Verona is determined that it is time for Elissa to be married and have her own happiness. But Elissa considers herself wedded to the family nursery and its success is all she cares about.Until one unfortunate night a devastating tornado hits her hometown. When she awoke in the middle of the night all she wanted was to get to the shed with her aunt Verona before the tornado hit, but once she realized that they would not have enough time to get there, they went to hide inside a closet and tried to protect themselves. Now that the tornado has passed, they were lucky that only an uprooted tree was embedded through the window in their living room. Unlike her best friend and neighbor, Sheriff Pete Kayne whos house was completely taken by the tornado.Nothing could describe the fear that Elissa felt when she saw the house was gone and afraid that Pete may not have made it, until she heard him trapped in the shed, which was being covered by his old washing machine. Not only that, his patrol car was upside down on her lawn.Pete has had a lot of losses in his life, his entire family is gone and now every memory he had of them is also gone. He plans to do his job and help as much as he can, but when its time to go home, he has no home to go to now. So when Verona offers him their guest room, he is a little reluctant to accept, but she can certainly be persistent.Now Pete and Elissa will be roommates, separated by only a wall. And the friendship they always shared is about to change. For living under the same roof and sharing so much time together will bring out feeling that are deeper than either of them may be willing to share, especially Elissa.But unless Elissa can make up her mind and prove to Pete that she loves him, their love may be lost due to her indecision and her dreams of independency. For Pete may be willing to do many thing for her, but he will not force himself on her if she does not want him.This was a really fun and entertaining read. I loved that Verona was the same as always, tricky but with the best heart and intentions underneath it all. Friends-to-lovers is one of my favorite tropes, and the way that these best friends feelings grew and became more was just great. I also loved how the community banded together to help those that were the most affected by the tornado and hurt for the few that were lost. I hope that there will be more of Blue Falls, Texas series, and more of Veronas matchmaking, but if not, I can honestly say that I am happy with all the books in this series.If you like a sweet and heartwarming read, dont miss Marrying the Cowboy by Trish Milburn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEF19L1QDQGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1UY38U#wasThisHelpful","R2WEF19L1QDQGW","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Her Miracle Twins by Margaret Barker, Dr. Chantal Winstone longs to become a mother but after a failed relationship and pregnancy, she has lost all hopes of ever being one. So when her aloof boss Dr. Michel Devine coolly proposes that they have a baby together Chantal is shocked--maybe his emotions really did die with his beloved wife....The chemistry between them is undeniable, and after only one unexpected passionate night Chantal finds herself pregnant with twins! Can the miracle of giving life to two tiny babies heal their damaged hearts.In Her Miracle Twins by Margaret Barker is a well written story about two individuals whose relationship start with a pregnancy of convenience but slowly becomes much more intimate and serious. Both Chantal and Michel had lost someone important in the past and were hurt emotionally due to the same. The story was about how they both find true love in each other through their twin babies.This was a good story overall with enough medical details but it was lacking in emotion at times. The characters shared amazing chemistry at times but then there were also some ""cold"" moments between them where I just couldn't feel their passion. I haven't read many romances where the relationship starts with a pregnancy of convenience so this story was different in its theme to me.Overall Her Miracle Twins by Margaret Barker is a well written medical romance with a nice theme and story. It has some good moments but I just wanted more emotions from the characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X6K2PSVED69C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1V5WDY#wasThisHelpful","R2X6K2PSVED69C","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In A SEAL's Salvation (Uniformly Hot!) by Tawny Weber, hot good girl Genna Reilly was dared by her best friends to kiss sexy bad boy Brody Lane. Genna never, ever, reneged on a dare and in this particular case, looked forward to fulfilling it. She always lusted after Brody, but he was totally off limits to her. You see, Genna is the sheriff's daughter and Brody is from the wrong side of the tracks. Even Joe, Brody's good friend and Genna's older brother, had warned her to stay away from him.Brody always found Genna to be attractive but unattainable. Being raised by a heavy-handed father who was usually drunk, only contributed to his bad boy persona. Brody was forever in out of trouble with the law, and knew Genna's father on an intimate basis. When their amazing kiss was leading to more, the sheriff discovered them together. Consequently, within a few days, Brody was forced out of town and into the navy. Needless to say, Brody hates and despises his home town of Bedford.Now it is ten years later and due to an injury, Brody returns home. Due to his gramma's urging and his own guilt, Brody agrees to recuperate in her small guesthouse. Brody is a navy SEAL, a hero, and a medal recipient. He returns to Bedford with honor and respect, although he does not see himself that way. The mayor is so proud he is planning a parade in his honor. Wow, what a far cry from his loser life over a decade ago.Genna works for the mayor's office and leads a life of pure boredom. Although she owns her own place and has a good job, she still puts up with her overbearing and intrusive parents managing her life. As a result, she has stopped dreaming about a future filled with happiness, family and love. However, once Brody returns to town, the jig is up.I always look forward to reading books by Ms. Weber because they are sharp, interesting and sexy. In A SEAL's Salvation, Ms. Weber makes a reference to a book she wrote recently, which I found totally awesome because I read it as well and really liked it, Genna says:Im just waiting for the latest Cosmo. I heard there are some great book recommendations in there. Books. In Cosmo? Macy shook her head and went back to sewing tiny roses on an array of tulle circles. I can just imagine what kind of stories those are. Naughty, right? Very naughty. Red-hot, in fact, I read one last month called Fearless. Very hot.Genna and Brody are great together and their sexual appetites are extremely hot. I loved how Genna used baking sweets and treats to soothe her nerves. With Genna and Brody finally being able to support each other, their future together is extremely bright.

Add a couple of the towns busybodies and matchmakers and you just know that things are not going to be simple for either of them.I just loved that Rancher at Risk had an easy flow to it. Lianne had a hard life between the world of the deaf and the world of the hearing, since she could speak and read lips she didnt fully belong with the deaf, but since she could not hear she didnt fit in with the hearing. Something that not many could understand, and something that Ryan will learn when he finds out that she is deaf. While Lianne will help Ryan heal from his own wounds and guilt and help him learn that he cannot control everything to make sure that everything will work exactly as he wants.If you want a sweet, fun and slightly different read, dont miss Rancher at Risk by Barbara White Daille.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O48OZW7X9FBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373755058#wasThisHelpful","R1O48OZW7X9FBS","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Desperately Seeking Firemen (The Bachelor Firemen of San Gabriel #4.5) by Jennifer Bernard, In the three years since Fire Captain Jeb Stone first met Nita Moreno at a wedding, his life has changed considerably. He finds himself now in a position to pursue their attraction when fate throws them together on Santa Lucia Island. But between the pregnant friend hes there to watch over and Nitas job cleaning up the latest scandal her boss is embroiled in, Jeb has to make their limited time count. He opts for straight-forward honesty and it just may be crazy enough to work some magic on the dark-haired beauty.Press secretary Nita Moreno feels like shes been to hell and back over the past few years. Now the senator, her crazy boss, is expecting her to smooth over his latest debacle with the press while hiding out on Santa Lucia Island. Nita is happy to see her reporter friend Melissa who will get the exclusive interview, but didnt expect gorgeous Jeb Stone to be tagging along with her. Surprisingly he remembers Nita from their brief meeting years earlier and the strong spark is still there. Unsure if she should follow her attraction and let herself get caught up in the moment, Nita has to decide if an island fling will be enough of the hunky fireman for her or if she actually wants forever with him.Desperately Seeking Fireman and is quirky and oh so charming romance novella from Jennifer Bernard. I havent read any of the previous books in The Bachelor Firemen of San Gabriel series, but I didnt need to as this can be read as a standalone very easily. But after reading about yummy Fire Captain Jeb, I will definitely be checking out the other firemen, I mean, books.This novella follows our protagonists intermittently for about three years or so and we get to see the changes they endure in their personal lives. I really enjoyed Jennifers writing style. It was fun, super sexy with lots of flirting and banter going on, but there was still a lot of emotion to each scene. I thought the way she wrote the characters responses to different situations was raw and pretty realistic, which only made the story that much better to me. They may not have always made the right decisions or have known what to do, but they did the best they could and ended up balancing each other out in the end.I easily got the sense of sadness Nita was dealing with and how it changed not only her outlook but even her physical appearance to a certain extent. But Jeb brought out the spark in her that she had been missing. I loved how he could make her laugh and finally relax after all she had been through. Not that Jeb hadnt been through some big changes himself. Their burgeoning relationship was so cute and had some very, very sexy moments mixed in with all the drama.I hope you get a chance to read this endearing, steamy novella. If youre a fan of quirky characters, fun dialogue and passionate romance, Desperately Seeking Fireman is for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFSXIU0F4V2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8P3A6I#wasThisHelpful","R3GFSXIU0F4V2G","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Rome (Marked Men #3) by Jay Crownover, Leaving the army and getting used to civilian life hasn't been an easy transition for Rome Archer. He was the go-to guy in his job with the military, as well as for his family before he left home. Now he just doesn't seem to fit in anywhere and it's put him in a funk that doesn't want to let go.Drowning his sorrows in vodka isn't getting Rome anywhere. And it takes a feisty little pint-sized woman to point this out and get him moving along the right track. Cora Lewis is a force to be reckoned with and takes over his life by storm. With Cora, Rome feels like he's finally home and like he might be able to put his demons to rest. If he just can get her to understand how perfect they really are together, he could be content for the rest of his life.Cora Lewis learned young, thanks to her ex-fiance Jimmy, that handing your heart over to someone can completely break you. Now she's on the lookout for Mr. Perfect and she won't settle for less. The friends she calls her family mean everything to her so when Rome Archer comes home all brooding and full of attitude, she takes offense to it.Never one to keep her feelings in check, Cora sets out to take him down a peg or two, only to feel her traitorous body (and heart) warm up to the giant soldier. It's obvious he's hurting and could use some help but Cora is scared to get too involved. Rome is so far removed from what she's looking for in a man that she shouldn't even think twice about him. Yet she can't let it go. Is she too damaged to let herself fall in love again or can Rome help heal her as well?Rome is the fantastic third book in the Marked Men new adult romance series by Jay Crownover. I would suggest probably reading these books in order just to get the full effect of how the story builds as it goes along. Plus there will be spoilers galore if you go back to read the previous novels, but honestly, it would be worth it.Cora and Rome's story is filled with so much drama and passion it should be illegal! I fell for both of them pretty much right away, especially for Rome and his tortured soul. I loved Cora in the previous book, Jet, as she was always so willing to give great advice and took care of everyone around her. It was nice to get her full story and see her finally get to be happy (eventually) herself with sexy badass Rome.Rome had been to hell and back more than once in his life, both in the army and with the loss of his brother. I thought his struggle was a rather realistic one that a lot of people may have dealt with in their lives and loved that it was Cora who helped him dig himself out of his dark place. I found it so interesting that they were such opposites on the outside: Rome was a huge intense guy with dark hair and no tattoos or piercings, and Cora was a petite spitfire who was full of life with vividly colored tattoos/piercings. But they connected perfectly on a profound level that was nothing short of amazing.I thought Jay had an intelligent writing style that drew me in to the story. Everything moved along at a nice pace and I felt all of the characters were well thought out and that the plot kept me interested until the very end. One of my favorite things about this story is getting to watch Cora's definition of the word ""perfect"" change drastically...for the better. Rome and Cora go through a LOT in their story, sorry I can't got into details without giving everything away, but suffice it to say they earn their HEA! And based on the ending of this one, it looks like Nash will be up next in book four. Can't wait!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHJEJ7DHDEI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGZXRT8#wasThisHelpful","RWHJEJ7DHDEI9","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Tycoon's Delicious Distraction by Maggie Cox: Hal Treverne is confined to a wheelchair after an unfortunate skiing accident. He is not happy in being so helpless and constantly dependent on others due to his physical condition. He hires Kit as a temporary companion to help him with all things practical while he recuperates but he does not take into the attraction he starts feeling for his feisty new assistant. Forced to rely on her, there's no escape from her intoxicating presence and soon he catches a glimpse of the simmering desire she conceals beneath her ever-so-professional facade. Unleashing Kit's passion is a challenge this arrogant tycoon will relish!The Tycoon's Delicious Distraction by Maggie Cox is a pleasant read written in the author's usual pleasant style. Kit was a feisty heroine who stood her ground every time and Hal was too bad tempered throughout the book. I understood his physical incapability made him grumpy but sometimes I just wish he would snap out of it and realize that it was a temporary disability not a permanent one.There was an epilogue in the end which wrapped up the book well and was kinda sweet. I had a problem with the blurb of the story which states Kit was a physio when she was clearly his temporary assistant and there is a good difference between physio and assistant. Kit and Hal were likable characters but their chemistry was really low on pretty much every level.Overall The Tycoon's Delicious Distraction by Maggie Cox is a pleasant enough read altogether. It has its moments but a grumpy hero and non existent chemistry between the characters might put you off a little. Maggie Cox is a great author but this one is sadly not her best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PYPS0MVDWZQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373132115#wasThisHelpful","R1PYPS0MVDWZQH","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After running out of every possible options for cure, she turns unwillingly to the man she walked out on four years ago--her husband Dr.Ben Almeida.Ben has never forgiven Tracy for choosing her work over him and walking out of his life four years ago. Now she is here and is asking him for help but can they keep their personal problems away and keep things strictly professional..??Working against the clock means they can temporarily put aside their differences. Yet there's no denying their sizzling attraction--and Ben has always been so hard to resist...Nothing. Im just surprised you havent found a woman whod be thrilled to stick close to the house and give you all those kids you said you wanted.That would be impossible, given the circumstances.Oh? Her brows arched. And why is that?Grabbing her left hand, he held it up, forcing her eyes to the outline of the plain gold band visible beneath her latex glove.For the same reason youre wearing this. He stared into her face.Have you forgotten, Mrs. Almeida? You may not go by your married name any more, but in the eyes of the lawwere still husband and wife.Her Hard to Resist Husband is not a straightforward romance and that's what I loved about it. Ben and Tracy have big problems which are based on misunderstandings and mistrust. This is a story of dealing with problems and giving their relationship a second chance. There was no shortage of medical details and the whole story was kind of based or standing on the medical aspects which is why I think this was a medical romance in every sense. The romance is there but its not that rosy because of the misunderstandings. Sparks do fly and sometimes I did wanted to yell at the leads to just do it already but I think it was worth the wait in the end. I loved Ben and I can't explain why because there are so many reasons the author gives you to love him.Overall Her Hard to Resist Husband is a realistic medical romance about second chances. If you want something different then go for this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2B9P7OKDYIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1V5U68#wasThisHelpful","R3F2B9P7OKDYIK","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Or with everything else in the way is theirs a relationship doomed to failure, with Owen being the only bond between them?Foolish Games by Tracy Solheim is much more than the romance of Will and Julianna! Tracy will draw you in with an intricate plot and some fascinating secondary characters. I will admit that it took me a while to warm up to Julianna...no matter her past or reasoning, I really did not like her for not telling Will about her pregnancy. Julianna has a lot of unresolved issues in her life, some of them I still don't understand, and I felt like as successful as she was, she still had a lot of growing up to do. Having said that, Julianna was a strong heroine and she did manage to gain my respect and admiration. Above all, she was willing to do anything for her son. She also proved to have more depth to her than she initially appeared, she understood Will, and I found myself really wanting Will to trust her, confide in her, and give her a chance.Through most of Foolish Games, my perception of Will was that he had a lot more to give if only he wasn't so angry about past and present events. He doesn't let anyone get close to him, but Julianna is certainly managing to wiggle her way closer and closer to his heart. He loves Owen unconditionally, and it is fun to see him lighten up a bit with his baby boy. There is a lot going on in Will's life right now, and as much as he struggles with the bad, some good can come of it if he'll open himself up to it if it's not too late.I loved the secondary romance of Will's very young mother and his manager Hank! I loved watching his mother finally blossom! Hank and his daughter were fun and came across as honest, don't hold anything back people. This part of Foolish Games had me just as intrigued as the relationship between Will and Julianna. There were also some friends of Will's that I really hope to read about in a future book.Tracy kept me far more intrigued than I thought I'd be in Foolish Games. There was a lot going on, but she writes smoothly and manages to separate the sub plots enough that there is no confusion, only a reader wanting to get deeper into the story. I have not read the first book in this series, and would definitely say Foolish Games can be read alone. I will be looking forward to another book in this series though! I'd love to read Brody's story!I highly recommend Foolish Games by Tracy Solheim to a romance reader looking for a plot that just keeps getting better as the story progresses, and strong, memorable characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TJ7OJ7HZQQIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTRDJBK#wasThisHelpful","R1TJ7OJ7HZQQIR","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Texas Night...by Sara Orwig: Six years ago, Texas billionaire Jared Weston and antiques appraiser Allison Tyler shared one passionate night together that they vowed never to repeat. Now, Jared has hired Allison's company to appraise the value of some antiques he has inherited and wishes to sell. Allison is content to let things stay all business between them. There's just one problem: the attraction between her and Jared is still sizzling, an attraction Jared is more interested in indulging than fighting.Jared knows that behind her businesslike faade, Allison is just as hot for him as he is for her. The fact that his thrill seeking ways and disdain for settling down are in direct opposition to what Allison says she wants is more of a challenge than a turn off. He enjoys trying to get Allison to loosen up and give in to the passionate attraction between them.But is Jared willing to give up his high risk, non-committal ways once he realizes he has deeper feelings for Allison? Can Allison love a man who's always putting his life at risk for fun? And there's always the tiny issue of Allison's brother and Jared's best friend, Sloan...One Texas Night... by Sara Orwig pulled me in from the first chapter with the recounting of what happened six years ago. I loved Allison and Jared together when they were both young and a little wild. The dialogue was snappy and the attraction sizzled on the page. It was so easy to get caught up in their attraction that you lost sight of what was stopping them from being together. Normally, this would be a great thing, but for some reason, it didn't work for me as well in One Texas Night.I liked Allison, Jared, and even Sloan, worrier that he was. I felt that the conflict between wanting to be with Jared and not being able to handle his high risk lifestyle in light of the tragedy in her past gave Allison's character depth. I also thought that Ms. Orwig did a great job with giving Jared an actual reason why he felt that not settling down and continuing his risky behaviors was the right decision for him to make. It's just that so much time is spent on the less pressing reasons they can't be together that you only glimpse these real impediments. I also felt like the character of Phillip got a bit of a raw deal. I didn't believe what he was in the story to do was even remotely possible for him to do, which was sad because I'm sure he was a more interesting character than he got credit for in the story.I can't say that I was disappointed in One Texas Night; it's a solid read. It's just that Ms. Orwig does such an outstanding job of painting Allison and Jared's first encounter that I was expecting more. I loved the way that the love scenes were done because they took me back to that earlier scene with the writing. Allison's black moment when she realizes Jared's lifestyle is a serious impediment to their relationship was also gripping. There were moments in One Texas Night that I was completely lost in the story and loving it. It's just that I didn't feel that way throughout.I would recommend One Texas Night to readers who love a couple with boatloads of sexual attraction and tension, a flirty girl who becomes a pragmatic woman, and the high risk taking man who tempts her to let her naughty side out to play.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WDW30OD0I63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373732791#wasThisHelpful","R13WDW30OD0I63","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Promise for the Baby by Jennifer Lohmann: Vivian Yip's life is complicated. It was complicated even before she decided to have a drink at a bar in the hotel for which she worked as a Vegas Dealer. She happens to sit next to a very handsome and fairly drunk man, and they end up getting to know each other while drowning their respective sorrows.Karl Milek wasn't playing to his character that night in Vegas. His real life is controlled and disciplined. He never veers from that path - until he realizes his life isn't going to plan. When he takes refuge with a glass of scotch, he doesn't expect Vivian. Nor does he expect that they'll drink enough to shed inhibitions and have a night to remember.When the morning comes, Viv and Karl have spent the night in each other's arms as husband and wife. Definitely consummated. Neither of them remember everything, but Karl says some things that rock Vivian to her core. Accusations of manipulation and deceit which were never intended - mostly because Vivian had no idea about his life in Chicago. She reluctantly lets him go and agrees to a divorce.But things veer off course again when she shows up at Karl's place in Chicago with nothing but a rattletrap car and a baby on the way. Again, Karl is cruel and demands a paternity test, but decides he can't throw her out on the street in her condition. Viv has noplace to go and nobody to lean on, so Karl is her only hope.After a few weeks living under his thumb, Vivian decides she should do things on her own. However, when she makes a stop on her way out of town, she's drawn even further into the Milek family - and Karl's not sure how to feel about that. Is she insinuating herself so she can get more out of their already tenuous bond? He knows things about her - things that definitely don't put her life in a good light, but is she more than she seems?I like the premise of this book very much, and I found myself rooting for Vivian through the whole story. Karl is a different animal however. I just couldn't connect with him. I still have no idea why Vivian is attracted to him in the least, but I think she would definitely take to his family if this story were real life. Really, Karl was the only character I had a hard time believing - and he's the only reason I knocked my rating down to three stars.The story is solid and all of the secondary characters were lovely and full of life. Vivian's backstory was heartbreaking and I loved seeing her rise above it to stand on her own two feet. The plot was well-paced and well-written - I just couldn't get behind Karl and his issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SA05F8WYKMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373608225#wasThisHelpful","R31SA05F8WYKMZ","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Sweetest Mistake (Sweet, Texas #2) by Candis Terry, Ex-Marine Jackson Wilder is a firefighter who is used to jumping in first and asking questions later. He has no problem defending his country or running into a burning building. But admitting to his feelings is a whole 'nother ballgame, doubly so when it comes to his former best friend Abby Morgan.When Abby left Sweet, Texas just after Jackson enlisted, he sadly thought he would never see her again. Five years later, Abby waltzes back into town and into his life giving him a chance to find out what went wrong. Jackson's emotions once again go haywire when she's near, causing him to do and say stupid things. He wants desperately to convince Abby to stay so he can confess his love for her, but could it destroy the friendship he's come to rely on once again?Abby Morgan left Sweet, Texas once she realized that even though she had loved her best friend Jackson for years, he would never feel the same for her. Moving to Houston didn't turn out as she had hoped either. As a newly divorced woman, Abby's back in Sweet to put her parent's house up for sale and hopefully find some closure. However, the sparks fly immediately when she sees Jackson again. More confused than ever with where her life is going, Abby wonders if it's foolish to hope things could possibly work out between her and Jackson this time around.Sweetest Mistake is the second sexy offering in the Sweet, Texas series by Candis Terry. Centering around one of the youngest Wilder brothers and his estranged best friend, this is a story of second chances that will make you laugh but still pull at your heartstrings.There is just so much to love about this book! All of the characters are larger than life...I mean, it is set in Texas, so you can't expect otherwise. From Jackson's meddling but loving family to the local residents, everyone adds their own personal touch to the story. I loved that even though there is such a strong sense of togetherness in Sweet, there are still realistic touches like gossipy neighbors and grumpy octogenarians. Things weren't happy happy all the time. There were conflicts and personal issues.I'll admit that even though Jackson made some boneheaded moves, I still kind of fell in love with him. He's a hero who loves his family, he's a hands-on dad who isn't afraid to be silly to make his daughter happy, and he's genuine. I can see why Abby would fall in love with him! And she's not too shabby herself. She's such a caring person. Abby took care of her younger sister while her parents were MIA and was basically raised herself by the Wilder family. She also has a special place in her heart (just like I do) for animals in need, which plays into the plot a bit.If you love rugged alpha males and a well written friends-to-lovers trope, Sweetest Mistake is the romance for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODOWGEUOJLRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB36AZW#wasThisHelpful","RODOWGEUOJLRF","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. (Not Quite) Perfect by Jessica Hart: Max is still a little stunned by the abrupt way his ex dumped him. They were perfect for each other, but apparently she needed to be swept off her feet. She didn't cheat on him, but definitely got 'swept away' from their relationship. So he retreats to his sisters place to recoup. She's away on business, so he'll be bunking in with their long-time friend, Allegra.Glitz magazine has finally given Allegra an assignment she can make her own. After a round of 'why can't we find the perfect guy', her boss is swayed by her pitch to make an ordinary joe into the perfect man. Now she just needs to find a guy to be her subject. When Max lands (literally) on her doorstep, she realizes he is ready-made for this job. He's not what she'd call ""hunky"", but there's potential there. As long as he'll agree to let them give him a makeover and tutor him in the ways of dating, maybe he can get his ex back.Max doesn't want to agree to be Allegra's guinea pig, but since she's helping him to get an assignment he's been aiming for, he can hardly say no. In fact, she doesn't give him any choice whatsoever. It doesn't hurt that he'll be fake-dating a famous model for the story - although she's not really the kind of woman he'd choose to date under normal circumstances.As long as they've known each other, Allegra has never thought of Max as anything other than a brother type, but now that he's spruced up a bit, she's seeing an entirely different man - and she's surprised at how much she likes the new him. On the other hand, Max already has a preconceived notion about who Allegra is, but under the messiness and chaotic wardrobe, there's a surprisingly deep woman. When their curiosity leads to a steamy night they vow to forget, their lives become more complicated than they've ever imagined.I was not sure what to think when I started reading this book. Usually, when a guy is kinda geeky, the woman is already slightly attracted to him, but ""wakes up"" once he's seen in a new light. However, Allegra *truly* doesn't see Max in any kind of romantic or sexual way in the beginning. She even thinks that he's not really attractive, and quite stuffy.Max doesn't feel much for her either, especially since he's constantly frustrated by her superficiality and unkempt living habits. Her issues stem from an inner conflict, whereas his are mostly outward changes. Max's sister, Libby - is only mentioned briefly in the book. She's Allegra's real roommate, and I was expecting her to make an appearance at some point, but she doesn't. The twist in Allegra's backstory was truly out of left field, but things click into place when we find out her mother's secret.I really despised Allegra's mother, in fact, even after things get explained, she's still not exactly warm and cuddly. It was nice that the reveal allowed Allegra to decide what to do with her life, and that she should live it for herself, not to impress anybody else.I loved how Max came back to Allegra - so romantic. Totally swoon-worthy. I think you'll enjoy it too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG85H1SK89T9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1UY416#wasThisHelpful","RG85H1SK89T9L","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Midnight Surrender by Donna Grant, Rennie lives a life of relative isolation on property on the Isle of Coll left to her by her aunt. Every time she thinks of selling the property and moving on, something stops her. She's not sure why she hasn't left, but she feels something is holding her there. Now it is getting close to Christmas, and Rennie wants a wish for Christmas instead of a present. She is feeling lonely and wishes for someone to spend the rest of her life with. But even with this wish she thinks ""It was better that she was alone. Then she didn't have to explain the odd things she could do just by thinking of them."" Or the visions people got after touching her. Rennie is a Druid. But Rennie has no idea how powerful she can be or the extent of her legacy.Dale, a Warrior, has followed the feel of magic to Coll. Although Dale believes his past and future will make him forever not good enough for someone like Rennie, he is still drawn to her. Soon Rennie and Dale fine each other impossible to resist and they both fall hard and fast. But with who they are can they even have a future together? What can become of a Druid and an immortal Warrior?With danger close by, they are confronted by evil and Rennie threatened. Will either of them have a future at all let alone together? Will Rennie have a chance to realize her legacy before it's too late?In the short time I came to know her, Rennie came across as a strong, independent woman who I really liked. She has not moved on from Coll and seems to know the reason will come to her soon. She is cautious, but when she meets Dale she feels something for him...even after she knows who and what he is. She has taken the lessons learned from her aunt to heart. Dale is a strong Warrior who would like nothing more than to have the god within him bound so that he can be mortal again...but that can never happen, can it? Because of what he's done, what he's had to do, Dale doesn't think he deserves happiness or Rennie. Even if he can't resist her.Midnight Surrender was a well paced novella that is a quick but not rushed, intriguing read. It can be read as a stand alone outside of the Dark Warriors series (I have not read any of the other books in this series), but I think I would have had a better feel and appreciation of the novella if I had read the other books. Donna gives you some characters that you will love as well as fast paced action and suspense with entrancing descriptiveness in Midnight Surrender.I'd recommend this to any paranormal romance reader looking for a quick, fulfilling read...especially if you've read other books in this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YF2X8AUM70FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DK42O66#wasThisHelpful","R1YF2X8AUM70FU","A3326UC548HDXO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3326UC548HDXO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have purchased jewelry from this company before and been extremely pleased with the quality and appearance.  These earrings just aren't my cup of tea, though.  One thing I've always loved is their packaging -- black boxes with bright teal interior.  Both the outer box and the jewelry box in which these arrived had peeling paper on the outside.  I'm glad I wasn't intending to give this as a gift!  Inside, the post on one earring was bent; I'm guessing it was from inserting the earring into the cardboard display piece, which tells you a little about the sturdiness of the post.  It was easily bent back into shape.Otherwise, I'll just say that the photo is very true, especially the very pink tint to the center stone.  I was hoping for elegant,  but these earrings remind me a bit more of something your young daughter would wear with her princess costume, or your pre-teen to a Dad/daughter dance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWTS4B4386L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5IXKZG#wasThisHelpful","R2DWTS4B4386L3","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These little packets are SO handy!  My dogs love coconut oil on their kibble but I have to take a jar and spoon with me when we travel.  Now I just toss a few of these packets in the bag and voila!  No stress, no mess, and a perfect individual serving, and the dogs loved the taste.  These also came in handy when I forgot my conditioner; I just used a packet of coconut oil instead!  And the dab that was left, I smoothed on my lower legs, the part that showed below the capris, to make it look like I actually attend to personal grooming at times.I have NO hand strength, but managed to open the packets easily, yet they withstood the wear and tear of being loose in the bag with the metal dog dishes, the kibble and scoop and the box of treats and none were punctured or otherwise broken open.  If you were to stomp down on one, I'm sure you'd have a blowout mess, just like you would with an individual serving of sour cream, which is kind of what the container reminds me of, as there is a slight gusset on one end and then the tear-off tab ""cap"" on the other end.I'll be honest; I got these to use for travel, but they are so handy that I find I'm using them ""everyday,"" as well.

"Since a (terrific) business incubator popped up in town, the community college where I work has been holding occasional Agile Project management workshops, including Scrum training.  I've desperately wanted to go but never could, and hoped that this book could teach me enough about Scrum that I could then train students in my business management classes.I don't think it is at all a weakness of this book, because it doesn't claim to teach about Agile, the why and wherefore of these innovative project management approaches.  However, someone like me, who doesn't grok Agile in fullness is at a bit of a disadvantage.  Possibly reading ""Agile Project Management for Dummies"" (which does exist!) would have been a good first step; I would strongly recommend that this book NOT be your introduction to Agile Project Management.Otherwise, this book provides all the detail one might require and then some.  This isn't a simplified version, as the name might imply... it's really very in-depth.  That can be a little intimidating, but the examples of each step as applied to different industries are excellent and help a lot with making this seem do-able.My husband, the software engineer, was a little astonished to find Scrum being applied to things other than programming, although, since I'd seen it at the business incubator being used to coordinate every level of business development, it hadn't occurred to me that it wouldn't be.  So I do think that the diversity of examples in this book is a great strength.  There is even a chapter on Scrum for Life Goals, including financial security, weight loss, life balance, planning vacations and (my new secret weapon) success as a student.  The section on achieving in college is really terrific; as an instructor, I find myself considering the semester as one week long ""sprints.""  I think Scrum for Curriculum Development would be a very interesting read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFDV6IZX8GX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111890575X#wasThisHelpful","R1KFDV6IZX8GX9","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you haven't read at least the Farseer Trilogy, the Tawny Man trilogy and the previous book in this trilogy, Fool's Assassin, you really should; this book will mean so much more!  This book comes 10 years after the publication of the last book in the Tawny Man trilogy, and picks up action 15 years into the future of the characters (and if you're just reading the whole series now, lucky you to not have had to wait!)In this second book in the new trilogy, Fitz and the Fool are together again for the first time in 15 years, but the cost of that meeting is great.  The Fool has been kept captive and tortured for most of those years, and now he has led his captors to Fitz's home, where they seize Fitz's daughter, Bee.  Much of the book is given to action at Buckkeep Castle, catching up with the Fool's intervening years as well as his slow recovery from the torture that has blinded him.  Once Fitz learns of Bee's abduction, he, of course, is determined to go after her, but her captors use magic to cloak their movements and take much time to be found.  In the meantime, we are able to reconnect with the many characters at Buckkeep.I have to admit something: I don't know why, but I find Hobb's books to be 1000 times more suspenseful than I do any 'suspense' or 'thriller' novel I've ever read.  I think that's the reason people compare the series to Martin's ""Song of Ice and Fire,"" because of the tremendous suspense...  there are layers and layers of peril and just because one layer may be suspended for a moment, the reader is never entirely ""off the hook.""  I also think that's the reason many reviewers complain of ""slowness"" in this book: it seems that what you really WANT to happen, for Fitz and the Fool to go after Bee, is never going to actually happen.The only other thing I think I can mention without spoilers is that this is an absolutely enormous book.  My copy weighs well over two pounds; while I love that it includes all those wonderful words, this is one time, where, for me, the book would have been much easier to enjoy in electronic format on a light-weight and easily-portable Kindle!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZAJSY82V36CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392921#wasThisHelpful","R2ZAJSY82V36CH","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The biggest surprise we had with these shorts was that they are plaid.  My husband's mother was apparently frightened by loud clothing patterns when she was carrying him, as he is ultra conservative when it comes to both colors, patterns and styles.

"Bottom line: if you've ever wondered what it's like to work in a Veterinary clinic; if you love your pets and would like to better understand the challenges in their medical care; and, most of all, if you think perhaps you'd like to become a Veterinarian, this is a great book for you to read.Non-fiction books about dogs generally end in one way.  This book, which includes the lives of three dogs, includes three such events.  You have now been warned.  Yes, you should definitely still read the book but if you start to get into that part of the book (you'll know), you may want to consider your surroundings before continuing.  Fellow train-riders and lunch-counter diners tend to look askance at the person blubbing all over his or her book.I knew the rule, but, having read a brief excerpt of the book in Dr. Andy Roark's blog, I wanted to read it, anyway.  It really is a good book -- an easy read, with plenty of humor and lots of appealing honesty.  The book details the life, thus far, of Dr. Jessica Vogelsang.  Some elements are slightly fictionalized to protect the... original party.  But the stories ring very true.In a very interesting and funny narrative, Dr. Vogelsang conveys a great many truths about the world of the Veterinary clinic.  Dr. Vogelsang is very honest about her rather nerdy and introverted childhood, about how academic achievement was quite easy for her, and how she explored many other careers, including research and human medicine, before deciding on Vet school.  She was admitted to and attended the University of California at Davis, definitely one of the premier Veterinary colleges in the world.  Upon graduation, she went to work at a ""chain"" clinic, what many in the industry disdain as ""Corporate Medicine,"" but the experience she describes sounds an awful lot like most any other clinic to me.In addition to talking about the three dogs who shared her life during various parts of this journey, Dr. Vogelsang talks about her marriage as well as about her two children, Zoe and Zach.  Following the birth of her daughter, Dr. Vogelsang experienced crippling post partum depression; even as a medical professional, it took her quite a while to realize something was wrong and to ask for help.  A mother of a one-day-old infant recently walked away from her home near mine and was found dead; I hope that everyone reading this book will take this message, in particular, to heart, understanding that a mother with post partum depression is not weak nor foolish, but under the influence of some of the most powerful drugs in the universe -- hormones -- and they are making her mind play tricks on her.Dr. Vogelsang uses humor and detail to gently illuminate the lamentable fact that many members of the public have no idea how many years of school is required to become a Veterinarian (or a Technician, Hospital Manager or Assistant), nor that these professionals usually make less than half the wage of their similarly-educated counterparts in human medicine.  She talks about the challenge of dealing with patients who cannot speak to describe their symptoms while pointing out that anybody who thinks they'll go into Veterinary medicine because they don't have to deal with people is sadly mistaken.  (Vogelsang credits her own growth in interpersonal communication to a summer spent as a research assistant, recording the experience of patients during the trial of a little blue pill that was intended to help cardiac symptoms but which had other, more noteworthy effects)And Dr. Vogelsang talks about loss and grief -- her own and that of her clients.  Her discussion is straightforward, poignant but without drama and bathos.  She does a very nice job.If you love pets, I think you will enjoy this book.  I also think it will make a terrific gift for other pet lovers you may know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L7BWBFMP26NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554936#wasThisHelpful","R3L7BWBFMP26NC","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dogs can be picky eaters.  I give them a high-quality kibble, on which they thrive, but they aren't always willing to eat regularly.  Thus, I resort to what we call ""kibble sweeteners,"" something to make the food more appealing.  This dehydrated raw mixer fits the bill perfectly.  My picky eaters found the product to be extremely palatable and have been eating their mixed kibble with gusto.My 50 pound dogs get 1/4 cup mixed in with each meal.  The nuggets have been freeze dried and so can be easily crumbled into a dehydrated powder to sprinkle over the kibble, so the dogs don't ""cherry pick.""  While I sometimes add a little warm water to the kibble, I wouldn't say that these mixers rehydrate, exactly.  However, I do think it's really important to make sure the dog has access to lots of fresh water when feeding any sort of dehydrated food.  The bag also notes that this is intended to be a treat or supplement and is not a balanced diet, intended to be fed by itself; there is an Instinct Rawboost Kibble that is intended to be a balanced diet.I do think these nuggets also make a nice training treat.  Although they crumble, which is not ideal, they don't really require chewing and can easily and safely be gulped on the fly.  The bag is very careful to report that 1/4 cup has 52 calories, and notes that the dog's food should be reduced by a similar amount.  The product nuggets aren't all the same size, but I seem to get an average of about 25 per 1/4 cup, so each nugget is about 2 calories (the bag says 1.6 kcal apiece).  Unless you have a dog on a very strict diet, the calorie counting probably is a relatively minimal issue; however, 2 calories per training treat can get substantial in a hurry.  (Nature's Variety does make training treats, but I have not tried them.)The bag indicates that six ounces will provide 24 1/8 cup (or 12 1/4 cup) servings.  The bag is resealable, which is important... if you let the product absorb moisture over time, the nuggets will disintegrate and you'll just be dealing with powder.The product is ""manufactured in US facilities.""  I don't see anything about the sourcing of Nature's Variety ingredients, although most dog food rating sites are very complimentary about the company's products.  I certainly don't have any trouble giving them to my own rather spoiled but highly valued dogs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY55S2P8JZHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWPHX9K#wasThisHelpful","RYY55S2P8JZHT","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like Alex Delaware, the protagonist of this suspense novel is also a psychologist.  And, while I have enjoyed the Delaware series for the most part, I have to say that the heroine of this book, Dr. Grace Blades, makes him look a bit stodgy.When one of Blades' clients is murdered, the only clue to his identity is her business card in his shoe.  Blades soon determines, though, that she and the man knew one another as children, and that she is now in danger, as well.  The story alternates between present day and a detailing of Blades' growing up as a neglected baby, an orphan and foster child.  Extremely intelligent, Blades came to be both an extremely effective psychologist, but also has been scarred by her childhood.  She has no friends, is an extremely autonomous and self-sufficient woman, and something of a thrill-seeker.  Thus, rather than seeking help from authorities, Blades undertakes to find and deal with the murderer, herself.Author Kellerman, himself a psychologist whose work emphasized pediatric patients, uses this opportunity to turn a light on the impact of violent crime on children, and the terrifying randomness and implacability of the social services designed to protect and care for them.  The points are quietly introduced as plot elements, though, and not at all preachy.Frankly, Blades is a compelling character, reminiscent of some of the ""forged-by-trauma"" superheroes of comic books and movies.  I really hope that this is an introduction and not her only outing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OFD7V13GLQLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545311#wasThisHelpful","R3OFD7V13GLQLG","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earrings are lightweight, very attractive, and suitable for both casual and dressy wear.  What's not to love?But I also want to acknowledge the presentation, because I think these would be a terrific gift, and the packaging really supports that.The earrings come in an attractive black box that is about twice as large as a velvet earring box from a jeweler.  The inside of the box lid is lined with dark teal paper and the 'velvet' insert that holds the earrings has a teal tab that allows easy removal from the box.  This is the second item I've received recently with this 'surprise' dash of color in a black box and I have to say that I think it is very striking and classy.The velvet insert covers the bottom of the box then curves over itself, so the earrings and their backs can be viewed without removing the insert from the box.  I think this is a lot nicer than removing the velvet insert to get to the earring backs, where one often sees the brown cardboard ""guts"" of the packaging.  There are no brown guts to be had here, even with the insert taken out.  One thing that is a tiny bit odd is that the earring backs are ""enforced"" by the little plastic ""corks"" that you often see on fish-hook style earrings.  I suppose they make doubly sure that the earring backs stay in place during shipping, but I think I would remove them before giving the earrings to someone if I had the chance.The earrings, themselves, have terrific sparkle.  They do not look cheap or plastic and, for me, the only thing that really gives them away as CZ is the mounting, which isn't one that would probably be used for a diamond.  The rhodium around the outside is very pretty, and, in a touch that is hard to spot in the item photos, there are tiny CZs set around the outside, providing additional sparkle.  The earring design is very classic and would look great with a little black dress or with capris, sandals and a t-shirt on the boardwalk.  These aren't ""in your face with rhinestones!"" bling but they aren't so small as to be unnoticed, either.  The rhodium kind of ""blends in"" to the sparkle of the CZ, and, as a result, these earrings don't look especially ""silver.""  I wouldn't hesitate to wear them with a gold necklace, for example, which is nice, especially if you are traveling and don't want to have to haul a lot of ""matching"" pieces around.The earring backs are the traditional metal butterfly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPW14JO64DVB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGXZXXG#wasThisHelpful","RPW14JO64DVB6","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Warning: this is NOT a Joe Pickett novel.  I assumed that it was, simply because I'm more used to the Pickett novels.This is a sequel to The Highway, which was listed as NS (non series) but, apparently, is not.SPOILERS HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ ""THE HIGHWAY""If you'd asked me before I read this, I would have said a sequel was a bad thing.  I thought The Highway was a good story but it was WAY too creepy for my tastes, the kind of thing that gives you nightmares.  And, while this book does pick up with Cassie Dewell being called upon to identify the Lizard King, the villain from that previous book, the remainder of the story takes a completely new turn, with Cassie taking a job in a North Dakota oil boomtown.  Investigating what appear to be related murders, the sheriff in Cassie's new department suspects corruption in his ranks, and hires Cassie to come in to resolve both situations.Box has evidently done extensive homework on the bizarre environment of the North Dakota fracking oil production, where landowners routinely go from broke the millionaire and where the building can't keep up with the need to house and feed the workers, who also earn extremely well in their dangerous and mind-numbing jobs.Box also does a really fantastic job with his female protagonist.  She seems like a real, normal person, something that many authors, and especially male authors, struggle with.Lastly, Box manages to weave in an extensive storyline about a genetically-disadvantaged young man who sees everything that is happening, but who is largely invisible to the players in the story.This book gave me time to get to know Cassie better, and I will definitely read future stories featuring her, even though I know that means the Lizard King will be back.

If your hair has more texture/body than that, I think your results might differ dramatically.I used this product per directions, applying following towel-drying and without any other post-shower product.  It went on very lightly and I had high hopes, but, following the blow dry, my hair was just as flat and limp as usual, despite every blow dry trick I know to try to give it some lift.  When using my straightening iron, I could HEAR the sound of something on my hair, an added friction.

"I would love this massage device if I could use it on my neck, which is what I believe it's intended to treat.  However, I like it A LOT as for foot massage; without the massage, the heat setting is great for just warming cold feet.  The vibrate feature doesn't seem to do much except make the dog come look at it funny.The massage ""balls"" are very hard and are barely covered by a fine, netlike material.  The maker recommends folding a towel over the massager if you find the massage to be too firm, but that adds thickness and I couldn't ever figure out a position that would allow my neck to relax onto the massager with a towel on it that was comfortable for the rest of my back.  I think it might be possible to by building an incline of some but that's kind of a lot of work for a device that's supposed to be relaxing.However, using a towel for the foot massage is a good idea, because of that firmness... when the balls come together, it can really compress your foot if it's down between them.  For the heat, however, I prefer to not have the towel in place, at least not initially.The flush-mount press controls are easy to manipulate with your feet, too.

"I wish there was a rating between ""It's okay"" and ""I like it"" for this book.  It is the standard Steve Berry formula for Cotton Malone, an adventurous quest to save the United States from the devastation that would occur if some centuries-old document becomes public.  In this case, Malone is tracking down documents that might prove the 16th amendment -- and income tax -- to have been improperly ratified and thus be illegal.  An American fugitive has the documents and wishes to meet with other like-minded ex-patriots but a North Korean playboy and his killing machine daughter want the documents in order to bring down the US government and secure their own places as saviors in North Korea.Malone is moping about having parted ways with his fellow-operative girlfriend, Cassiopeia Witt, in the last novel, and Stephanie Nelle, head of the Magellan Billet for which Malone is taking on an after-retirement mission (haven't all of his chronicled adventures been post-retirement?) is still looking forward to exploring a personal relationship with Danny Daniels, presently married and, incidentally, the US President.Action takes place on a Mediterranean cruise ship, then Croatia, as well as in Washington D.C. and backstory historical figures include Andrew Mellon, FDR, and pretty much all the North Korean dictators.If you've ever wondered what the ""income taxes are illegal"" folks are going on about, this is probably a fairly painless way to get the general idea, and you get a nice grounding in modern North Korean history, too.  This is also the third mystery I've read in recent months that celebrates the beauty and tragedy of Croatia.  But the quotes from real and purported documents are long and dry, and the action very Clive Cussler over-the-top, and I just didn't really *care* very much about how it all turned out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO6GOGK2NBHA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250056233#wasThisHelpful","RO6GOGK2NBHA4","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While appearing as a guest on ""The Tonight Show"" one evening, famed hotelier Conrad Hilton was asked by his host (Johnny Carson) whether he had a ""message"" for the American people.  With great gravity, Hilton paused momentarily before turning to the camera. ""Please,"" he pleaded, ""put the shower curtain inside the tub!""  Critical advice, of course, and the reason that some people ignore it is that they hate having the shower curtain 'stick' to them during their shower.  As a result, many hotels have curved shower rods these days, providing more 'elbow room' inside the tub, and it  only makes sense to bring this innovation home.While some of the motel installations are a bit rinky-dink, this rod has a satin finish and is quite sturdy, with a ""quality"" feel.  The rod is not pressure-mount the way many of the straight rods are, so you *must* drill holes and put mounting brackets on the walls.  Except for the drill, the tape measure and the pencil used to mark the installation spot, all the tools are included in the package.  Our installation took about 20 minutes.We installed this shower curtain rod on a 60-inch shower/tub combination.  We followed the instructions explicitly, placing the ends of the rods 5"" in from the outside edge of the enclosure, and 65"" above the tub ledge.  The instructions say to put the ends 8"" in on a 72"" long tub.  There are 'leveling' screws in the mounting bracket to level and secure the rod, and they do a nice job.  The metal covers that go over the brackets were less impressive, however.  The holes that the screws go into, holding them in place, were not completely machined so needed to be drilled out a bit.  Once on, the covers protect the bracket from water and from viewing inside the shower, but show the ""guts"" of the bracket from the outside.  This was probably our biggest disappointment, as it makes the cover look like it's installed wrong and we feel it requires us to keep the shower curtain closed to obscure the big hole in the side of the cover.In retrospect, I think we should have put the bracket closer to the outside edge, i.e. not the full 5"" in.  There is some added space, but, really, not that much.  It is an attractive rod, other than the cover issue, and it *looks* like we made an effort to upgrade the comfort in this guest bathroom, but, in practice, it doesn't feel like it makes much of a difference to the person inside the shower.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHJICIRNP8Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1ZLWIE#wasThisHelpful","RJHJICIRNP8Q0","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the heck out of this book.  It is extremely suspenseful.  The author 'plays by the rules,' giving the reader all the information to figure out the mystery BUT it is done so deftly and enough red herrings skillfully inserted that it wasn't until the denouement that I was able to go back and smack my head and say ""I can't believe I missed it!""  Those are the best mysteries, in my book.In addition to great suspense and pacing, Talty has created a compelling heroine.  Detective Abbie Kearney is the best kind of protagonist, one that appeals to the best within the reader.  She is good at her job because she uses her brain; her happiness doesn't depend upon having a romantic relationship and it is a relationship built on mutual respect and not a one-sided worship of some sort.  Abbie's is a product of her history but won't let it define her future, and her flaws come from making the kind of decisions that I think most of us would make if someone's life was in the balance.  Also, Talty manages to include Irish cops without descending into cliche' -- the characters are somehow *more* real because of everything you know about Irish immigrants and communities with strong Irish sub-culture, rather than being predictable and stereotypical.  Subtly amazing writing!Talty is now firmly on place in my FictFact alerts and I will look forward to more books by him!PS Also, he dedicated this book ""to the late John D. MacDonald, still unequaled.""  While this book bears really no resemblance to MacDonald's stories, Abbie is, like Travis, a white knight -- not a noble and pure Galahad, but the best-intentioned but sometimes human sort like omer and Buffy Summers.

"There is such responsibility in carrying on the work of a deceased author and an even bigger onus on those who would continue with iconic characters like Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin.  The work has to succeed on one of two levels.  The first is to be a good read for someone completely unfamiliar with the original work, and the second, of course, is to satisfy the fans.  I haven't seen too many (anyone?) hit that second mark and was really hoping that this author, with the approval of the author's estate and an encyclopedic knowledge of the oeuvre, would get the brass ring.While I'm not a huge devotee of Rex Stout's work, I've read and enjoyed some of his books.  Neither Wolfe nor Archie resonated with me, but Stout's writing was excellent -- his pacing, his deft characterization and his ineffable sense of time and place.I'll be honest -- I couldn't finish this book.  As a Nero Wolfe story, even for someone as casually acquainted with them as I am, it falls far short.  The characters, who have such backstory and fanbase that they practically stand on their own, seem flat and hackneyed.  Stout's dialog always seemed more authentic because of period dialog, but, here, Archie's slang seems inserted for effect and doesn't ring true.  Instead of a thrilling transport to another time, I kept finding myself thinking of PI parodies, like Firesign Theater's Nick Danger and Stone in the musical 'City of Angels.'It makes me very sad; I wanted this to work because there are so many characters that I miss and whom I wish could be returned to us through approved authors.

I also love that there is a BOTTLE full of the stuff, instead of a thin straw worth of product that is artistically twirled inside a bigger empty bottle, like some of the other products I've used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUU9SW8IHS9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRUH6JW#wasThisHelpful","R2IUU9SW8IHS9G","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really fun read.  I was unfamiliar with the author, who has written a lot, apparently mostly in the romantic suspense and paranormal romance categories, which, admittedly, are not my genre.  The writing is very, very good: the prose is tight, the dialogue sounds very natural and the characters develop nicely even throughout a story like this one set during a short timeframe.  The premise for the heroine is even very fun -- a self-help author who writes platitudes in which she doesn't believe, except they seem to really help her masses of fans, so could it possibly be that her glib recommendations really do constitute good advice?I am only removing the one star because the plot was not up to the standard of the rest of the book.  If you're going to write suspense, the reader needs to have at least some doubts about ""who dunnit.""  Unfortunately, it was patently obvious from about the 3rd plot point who our villain was.The only other thing that I found a bit odd was the author's choice to have the heroine be someone who ""swears like a sailor.""  While swearing works fine in an Elmore Leonard novel, for example, it was distracting in this book.  I think it might be because the heroine was the only one swearing, often in her internal dialog.  I'd be interested to know what others thought.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6IHUGTAAZK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831555X#wasThisHelpful","R1J6IHUGTAAZK0","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A single dimension in 'star' rating isn't enough for this book.  It's got some great elements to it, and some that I didn't like as much, so 3 stars is more of a ""mean"" than a true rating!Things I liked:The book is well-written, with prose that flows very nicely, good dialogue, and some great word choices.  The descriptions of scenes were evocative, and the costumes and illusions in the magic show are extremely deft.  The author explains what you need to know about how the tricks work with just a few, well-chosen words when I'm sure some would have slogged on for pages.The timing of the book is fun, at the end of the 19th century and just across into the 20th.  Settings include Biltmore, the newly-built New York Public Library and the theatres of the various Vaudeville circuits, as well as the private train cars of the magic show and it's clear that the author has done a great deal of research to capture the look and feel of such places at that point in time.Things I didn't like:The story is described as ""Water for Elephants"" meets ""The Night Circus,"" but I thought it was more like ""Flowers in the Attic"" meets ""The Burning Bed.""  Stripped of the glamour of the magic show, it's a disturbing story without much actual plot.There isn't any character development to speak of.  The characters grow older and change physically, but, by and large, they continue to act the same way and do the same things all their lives.  There was not much depth to any of them, even the Magician, whom we hear about the most.  Her costumes and her stage routine seemed more real than she did as a person.While the dialog sounds ""natural,"" it doesn't feel right for the period, nor do many of the character interactions.  It is a very difficult period to capture, no question, but the truth is that women were still extremely restricted in terms of dress, relationship and movement.  The author sometimes gives brief nods to the conventions of the time, but never really points up the contrast when her characters flout them.  The whole story feels much too contemporary.Lastly, I think it's a bad title.  I'm really not even sure just what it references.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AJSGBL7Z468/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402298684#wasThisHelpful","R13AJSGBL7Z468","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I should start by saying that I really, really like Neutrogena products.  I am on the downhill side of 50 and wear contact lenses and low-shedding, hypo-allergenic make-up and toiletries are essential to making it through the day without eye irritation.  I'd never been particularly impressed with Neutrogena eye shadow palettes, however, so I was excited to see these colors.  I tried the mink brown, which includes three browns, from a dark walnut to a mild cocoa and a warm vanilla as a highlight; cocoa mauve which has what looks like the same four colors but with a slight purplish tint; and smokey steel, with a dark charcoal, a dark gray, a dark silver and a very cool off-white.  I have to say I love the colors in the cocoa mauve, especially; while it sounds a little awful, it has GREAT colors, not purple and not brown.  I'd like to try the cool plum, also.The shadow goes on smoothly.  It is definitely a powder, not a cream, but it is, as advertised, very moist.  As a result, it blends almost too easily.  You're not going to create the definition described on the package (""put this color here and that color there and the other color in the crease and the last color along the lash line"") because the colors are going to blend as you apply them, especially with the little sponge applicator included.  It is possible to get better definition using real tools, such a thin, firm brush for the lash-line outline, but they still blend together quite a bit.  If you're okay with subtle, as I am, that's fine, but if you're looking for high-def drama, this probably isn't the best choice.I can't give the product five stars because its main claim to fame is being LONG WEAR (it's in all caps on the package), and I just didn't find that to be the case.  I applied it a little before 10 in the morning and, when I went to wash my face at a little before 6 that evening, my remover cloth found very little color left.  Although the product indicates it includes primer, I tried it the next day with a separate eye shadow primer underneath, but had the same result.The good news there was that the color didn't seem to settle into creases or get blotchy looking... it seemed to fade away gradually, so that's a blessing.I will definitely use the eye shadow and, as I said, probably purchase a few other colors, because I do like the moisture-rich formula, the colors, and the lack of irritation.  However, if I need the color to last longer, I'll take the shadow with me and plan to re-apply.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X1WGTXUNIKN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLP9RJU#wasThisHelpful","R2X1WGTXUNIKN8","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like a crime not to love a product like this, not least of all because it is REALLY good chocolate, and I love chocolate!  However, I think that, as a ""how to pair wine and chocolate"" tasting guide, this falls a bit short, and, since that's the purpose of the product, I'm going to only give it 3 stars.  If it was just ""a collection of great chocolate,"" I would give it 5 stars.The little canister of chocolates comes with 55 squares of chocolate, divided between semi-sweet, bittersweet and extra dark chocolate.  Each candy is about an inch square and maybe an eighth of an inch thick, so these are not chintzy little pieces.  They are individually wrapped.The canister also includes two booklets.  One is about the origin of the chocolates, which are crafted into candy beginning with the cocoa beans under the label of a man who, when he found he only had about a decade left to live, decided to devote his remaining time to his love of good food and good wine, and ended up creating these lovely chocolates.The second booklet describes the process to use to pair wines with chocolates.  Our local grocery has had regular displays for the last few months of wine and chocolate for the wine.  I will readily admit that I am a culture-free bumpkin and am completely unfamiliar with the idea of chocolate and wine together up until encountering these grocery displays, which is one of the reasons I chose this package -- I wanted to learn more about this.  However, while the booklet suggests getting a bunch of wines and inviting 6-8 people for the tasting, and instructs that you include buckets for folks to dispose of wine they don't wish to drink, it falls down terribly with regard to selecting the wines to use.  A single label and vintage is suggested for each variety of chocolate, ""or something similar.""  The basic idea presented is to use sweeter wines with the sweeter chocolate and dryer wines with the dark chocolate, but there are a LOT of wines out there.During the tasting, you are then to take a bite of the chocolate and savor it, then a sip of wine, then repeat.  There's a little... meditation, I guess I would call it, included to encourage you to better relish the experience.  The booklet encouraged me to read this meditation aloud to my fellow tasters, but I'm afraid that the experience... devolved a bit at that point and we never really got around to the association of the included list of potential adjectives with the tastes of the wine and chocolate.We liked the chocolates.  We liked the wine.  We just didn't like them together.  We ended up getting out the cheese to go with the wine, and pairing the chocolates with coffee, instead.So maybe we are just bumpkins with no palate.  Or maybe I chose wines poorly, although, again, I don't feel like I was given much direction.  But, as a tasting experience, the kit didn't work for us.We did like the chocolate, though!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231TKULMPHLP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVQ452A#wasThisHelpful","R231TKULMPHLP6","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should start by saying that none of the dart players here over the holidays have played darts much in a long time; we've been more happenstance spectators at the occasional pub game.  But we were eager to try out this electronic board, sure our skills would quickly be remembered.Finding a place to mount the board was a little bit trickier than we had thought.  It is a bit heavy and needs to be well-anchored to the wall, and also within reach of a power outlet.  The dart assembly was a little tricky because two of the darts came with the tail already on the wrong end of the shaft.  The tail is bigger than the tip, so when the tip was put into the shaft, it fell out.  Realizing the problem, we switched the tail to the correct side of the shaft but, when it had been shoved into the shaft before shipping, it enlarged that receiving end of the shaft and we ended up needing to put a drop of superglue into one tip to get it to stay on the shaft.The machine plays a rather ridiculous fanfare upon powering up; one then selects either the game or the number of players.  You can record the names of the players, which works fine and the machine will then announce the name of the next player to throw, but it's a step that we quickly decided was a bit hokey and stopped using.  The volume can be muted and the display used to track play, also.The scorekeeping worked extremely well.  If a dart bounces off the board, there is a button to push to update the score, easy to do while scooping up the fallen dart.  Another button lets you acknowledge a miss, advancing the play without score, again easy to do when getting the fallen dart.  The only quibble we had here was that all the buttons for game selection, number of players, bounce out dart, everything except a miss and game restart are exactly alike with hard-to-read legends. Just making them different colors or numbering them would have made them easier to use.Darts are a bit hard to get out of the board; again, making sure the board is very securely anchored to the wall is important.  The darts to us seemed to be heavier but smaller than the traditional ones in the past, and the tails definitely seemed smaller and more fragile, although they have not broken or been damaged thus far.The automatic scorekeeping handles a LOT of different games, many more than we'd ever heard of. The enclosed instructions concisely provide the rules for them.  There were a few times we thought the board was malfunctioning, but they all turned out to be situations where we had misunderstood rules for games with which we weren't familiar (which was most of them).We are all techies and thought we'd be all advanced with the electronic features.  Perversely, we found ourselves missing the heft of the ""old"" big darts and especially the sound of them hitting a cork board.  This, of course, is not the fault of this game, but there it is, nonetheless.Despite all the things the board does well, we found ourselves turning off features like the recorded voice and the voice at all.  We wished the board were more portable, but also decided that, if the board is going to be electronic, why not have portions of the board light up to indicate targets or hits?I give the board 4 stars because it seemed to generally operate as advertised, and because we did appreciate the electronic scoring.  I withhold the 5th star simply because we didn't love it; that, however, may have been us and not the game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ09FGHCZ8VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HJVAF8#wasThisHelpful","RRJ09FGHCZ8VZ","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A loose-leaf tea that is described by the company as ""strong,"" I expected this tea to be, well, strong -- the proverbial ""stand your spoon up in it"" stew.  It's not that at all, and that's the only reason I knocked it from 5 stars to 4.  If the company were to describe it as moderate, I'd agree wholeheartedly and give it the 5th star.  It is quite a nice tea; I just think it is a better choice for a lovely breakfast that precedes a day in the garden or a ramble in the woods than for the hearty meal you bolt prior to ice fishing or baling hay.These are real tea leaves, not the minced up stuff one often gets.  My little infuser was completely inadequate for the 1-2 teaspoons of tea called for in a cup (amount of water isn't specified; I used 8 ounces).  I think I will get this infuser for the future FORLIFE Brew-in-Mug Extra-Fine Tea Infuser with Lid.  The water is to be 192 degrees, according to Tattle Tea, or boiling, so I brought the water to a boil and then poured over the loose tea in the cup.  The package says to steep 1-2 minutes.  I then strained the tea to drink, although one could always just drink carefully and then try a little tea leaf reading (Google it -- lots of directions on the web!).I found the tea to be quite dark in color, but subtle and nuanced in taste.  It is not at all acidic or bitter, but has what is almost a floral note.  For me, this tea gives a barely perceptible English Breakfast nod in the direction of Twinings' Lady Grey tea, the lighter and more restrained mate of musky Earl Grey.  That surprised me; from the company's description, I was expecting something more along the lines of Irish breakfast tea.  Thinking I might not have made it strong enough, I brewed a second cup with 3 teaspoons of tea this time, and a 3 1/2 minute steeping time, but the tea tasted the same.  It's rather remarkable, I think, for it not to get bitter or sludgy, and I'm pleasantly surprised to find that, even without the pre-measured convenience of a teabag, I get consistently good tea.  I do use cream and sweetener, and the tea holds up well to both, as English breakfast tea should, although I think I will use a bit less in the Tattle Tea than I do in some of the other English Tea blends, simply because I'm not contending with any bitterness.Now, I think I'm going to go brew a pot of Tattle Tea and then read some tea leaves to see what the New Year will bring!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PROODOHLX8SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGUQDKA#wasThisHelpful","R2PROODOHLX8SH","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the problems with evaluating photo editing software is that you don't know what you need until you need it...  so I'm not going to be able to say I've really put this package through its paces yet.  I also have Adobe Photoshop Elements 13, an application that I found amazingly unintuitive and difficult to use, especially considering that I've had every version since 9.  My hope was that Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra would be more user friendly.  I found parts of PhotoDirector to be more user friendly, while other parts were less so, and I'm having less luck finding help and YouTube tutorials for those than I did for Elements.I liked it a lot that you don't have to make an either/or choice between editing and organizing; both functions exist on the same menu set.  I did have a real time trying to get PhotoDirector to import all the photos on a hard disk, which were divided between many directories.  I ended up copying them to an external hard drive, a backup that needed to happen, but I still don't understand why it seemed to hang up (or just take forever?) while seeking photos to import.  Some apps, like Picasa, you can't get to QUIT looking for photos and importing everything each time you open the application, but I essentially had to put all the pictures in a pile and tell PhotoDirector 6 to go look in that pile in order to get all the pictures imported.Once I was editing, the basics -- color, density, brightness, etc. -- were all easy to adjust.  I am still having a tough time with the fancier edits.  I am really disappointed in the eye color adjustment, but I have the same complaint about Elements.  A long time ago, there were packages that would do animal eye adjustment.  Now, you have to adjust animal eyes by painting and patch repairing, and it is really hard to easily get a good result.The panorama feature is nice and worked really well even though I didn't originally take photos thinking that I would try to ""stitch"" them.  There is enough offset in the original images that, if you know where to look, you can see the merge spots, but it's a nice effect at a ""distance,"" when the whole image is resized small enough to see it all at once; you'd probably need to be quite a bit pickier if you're making a wall mural.I do think the app is giving me generally better results than I was getting with Elements, possibly because this app has a little less depth to it, i.e. the amateur doesn't have as much rope with which to get into trouble.And If anybody knows an app that handles animal eye repair well, though, I'd love to know about it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB9OZX5G83JX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NASFCDO#wasThisHelpful","RB9OZX5G83JX6","A221AYJCX6Y5WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A221AYJCX6Y5WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My one-pound bag of truffles contained 50 truffles.  The outer clear bag is a very crackly plastic -- these are not stealth chocolates!  It also has a label that shows the wrapper color for each of the 14 (FOURTEEN!) flavors of truffles, and the bow is attractive, equally suitable for a male or female recipient.My bag had 3 or 4 of each flavor.  The foil-lined paper wrapper is labelled in addition to being color-coded.  The colors are really lovely, slightly iridescent, and make the truffles seem quite elegant.These truffles are rectangular rather than the large, ball-shaped candies I'm more used to.  At first, I thought this was a bad thing, because More Chocolate is Better.  However, these candies won me over because they are so much easier to eat.  You can easily bite them in half, which makes them a much nicer option for public consumption.The real proof, of course, is in the truffle.  The chocolate in these truffles is absolutely first-rate.  They melt in your mouth.  Each distinct flavor is rich.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the mint, with the raspberry a close second, but they are all delectable.This variety bag would, indeed, make a terrific gift, but it's also nice to empty into a pretty bowl to set out during a party or family gathering.

"This is a murder mystery thriller, set in 1962, with a gorgeous look and sound, thanks to the glamorous and exotic settings in Greece and Turkey, and a somewhat ""Hitchcockesque"" orchestral score.It's based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Previous film adaptations of Ms Highsmith's novels have included Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mr Ripley- both excellent films.Sadly, I did not consider this movie to be in the same caliber as those great films. It lacks the richness of characterisation and quality of engagement which are hallmarks of both of those movies.Whilst it was adequately entertaining, these days we see television movies and episodes of serial television dramas which present more sophisticated, suspenseful and - frankly - entertaining tales.Although it is technically well made, it had a rather dated feel about it, like a B film from the 1950s.It's not a bad movie- rather, I suspect that audiences have become more demanding and discerning and this movie does not deliver a mystery/ suspense entertainment experience which accords with contemporary expectations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWYWSGJHQZU8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2GB6VO#wasThisHelpful","RWYWSGJHQZU8P","A2O451L6U4X8HM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O451L6U4X8HM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the movie based on the international hit musical show.It's an entertaining and engaging biopic, telling the story of the Four Seasons musical group, and its members.The focus of the movie is on telling the story of the band, rather than performance of the music. Nonetheless, several of the Four Seasons hits are presented as part of the story.Translating a musical from the stage to the screen can be a difficult process. The translation of Jersey Boys has involved a refocussing on the narrative story, rather than the music. I suspect the film is best viewed on its own merits as a biopic, rather than a stage show adapted to the screen. The structure of the story telling has been changed significantly from the stage show (which tells the group's story from the perspective of each member).I thought the direction by Clint Eastwood was masterful- telling the story in a matter of fact fashion, effectively blending drama, emotion and humor. The interactions between the members of the band - in particular their tensions - are portrayed realistically.It is an entertaining and well crafted film, which I suspect will satisfy most viewers. The finale is particularly entertaining, featuring all the characters performing together- as in the finale to a stage production.Incidentally, watch out for Clint Eastwood appearing on a television screen as Rowdy Yates from Rawhide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4VLDNDLR5SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2CHUWW#wasThisHelpful","R2R4VLDNDLR5SG","A2O451L6U4X8HM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O451L6U4X8HM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Essentially, this movie is about the world fighting against an implacable alien invader, and the protagonist's use of his ability to rewind time to carry on the seemingly futile fight.Put that way, it sounds a relatively simple story- it is cleverly and convincingly told, with good performances from the major actors.Tom Cruise plays against type, in a charming and engaging way, with a good dose of humor. Emily Blunt delivers a good performance as a no-nonsense heroine.If you enjoyed movies in the science fiction/ time travel genre such as Starship Troopers, Inception or Looper, I suspect you will enjoy this movie. The time rewind premise reminded me of Groundhog Day. And, the reincarnation concept reminded me of The Prestige.It has a good blend of engaging story, good acting performances and convincing special effects.For fans of the genre, this is a well crafted entertainment, convincingly made by an experienced action director: Doug (The Bourne Identity, Mr & Mrs Smith) Liman.Is it a great movie? No, but it is an engaging entertainment, with a sufficiently compelling premise to keep you watching.Reflecting upon the movie, I considered whether it had a message? Yes it does: maintain persistence in a struggle against adversity.Revised: June 26, 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EXO4CL8I4M5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KW25MFY#wasThisHelpful","R3EXO4CL8I4M5Q","A2O451L6U4X8HM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O451L6U4X8HM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie is not for everyone. It demands patience and concentration. For the director, it is a work which involved 10 years in the making. As you watch this film, it becomes evident that each scene has been the subject of much thought and consideration.For those who enjoy this genre of film, it is an extraordinary and rewarding experience. Others would find it a chore to sit through this complex allegorical tale for 108 minutes.Jonathan Glazer has crafted a remarkable work of original motion picture art, with the collaboration of Scarlett Johansson, who delivers a stunning performance in a complex role as an alien whose mission is to kidnap men for consumption by her race. Her role was made additionally challenging as several scenes involved improvisation, with Ms Johansson engaging numerous unwitting persons to become participants in the movie.The music by Mica Levi is atmospheric, haunting and disturbing.Daniel Landin's cinematography is excellent- whether it is capturing the beauty of Scarlett Johansson and the Scottish countryside, filming from a point of view perspective or meeting the challenge of filming covertly. The cinematography effectively conveys the mesmerising ambience and the emotion of the story.The story is told in a mesmerising fashion- the jigsaw pieces of the tale are disclosed one by one until the full picture is revealed.Interestingly, part of the filming of the movie involved the unknowing participation of men who were propositioned by Scarlett Johansson as she was driving a van. Covert cameras in the van captured their reaction to being approached by a beautiful and mysterious woman. The unwitting participants were told about the filming afterwards.In much the same way, the audience is taken on a journey where the multiple layers of the story are lifted one by one, until the final denouement. Johansson's (unnamed) character develops during the film, evolving from being a dispassionate hunter through to learning and experiencing human compassion, desire and vulnerability, acceptance by and assimilation with humanity, then ultimately metamorphosing (like the insects she finds fascinating) from being the hunter to prey and on to being a victim of cruelty and ignorance.There are fine observations and explorations of the nature of humanity- both good and bad - including compassion, vulnerability, mercy, pity, altruism, survival, desire, lust, cruelty and ignorance. And, the director makes some pointed observations about ""skin"" - society's fascination with the outer envelope of physical appearance.I have read that others have compared this movie to the works of Kubrick- I thought that there are some comparisons to be made with ""2001- A Space Odyssey"". As I was watching it, some scenes vaguely reminded me of Tony Scott's ""The Hunger""- however, the stories are quite different. At times, I could see parallels with Nicholas Roeg's ""The Man who fell to Earth"". And, I thought the sympathetic killer theme was reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""Psycho""*. Luc Besson's ""Nikita"" also came to mind.**Nonetheless, this is an original artistic work, which stands on its own creative merits, and which I suspect will become the subject of critical analysis by film students.This is a quite remarkable movie- very rewarding and worthwhile for aficionados of this artistic genre.*An unusual coincidence: Scarlett Johansson's character is a sympathetic killer; in ""Hitchcock"", she portrayed the actor who played the victim of one of the screen's best known sympathetic killers- Norman Bates in ""Psycho"".**Another coincidence: Ms Johansson is starring in M. Besson's ""Lucy"".Revised: 1. June 12, 2014; 2. June 15, 2014; 3. June 16, 2014; 4. June 17, 2014; 5.

"Chef is a straightforward story, which is told in an engaging and appealing way.The star- Jon Favreau- also wrote and directed the movie. His character- a celebrity chef who falls from grace, then rebuilds his life- is appealing, sympathetic, believable, and most importantly: genuinely funny.The story comprises several themes:1. Confrontation between the artistic creative chef (Jon Favreau) and his conservative employer about whether to serve adventurous or conservative cuisine2. A verbal ""pie fight"" between the chef and a fussy food critic3. A father disconnected from his son4. A road trip, where the chef rediscovers his creative roots and reconnects with his son5. The chef discovers reinvigorated creativityFrom these ingredients, Mr Favreau cooks up an entertaining feel good light comedy.There are good cameo appearances from Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr.Sofia Vergara appeals as the chef's ex wife.While the story is simple and straightforward, it is told in an engaging and charming fashion, with a good dose of light humor.The food scenes are gorgeous: apparently Mr Favreau did his own cooking after training from road truck chef Roy Choi - watch the closing credits!Also, look out for the animated Twitter tweets- an interesting story telling technique.This is an entertaining movie with broad appeal- well worth a look!Revised: June 14, 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOLW2HMU8E5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQTHKQC#wasThisHelpful","R2JOLW2HMU8E5L","A2O451L6U4X8HM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O451L6U4X8HM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I highly recommend this movie.It's a sensitive adaptation of the best selling young adult novel.What is it about? It's a love story- two star crossed lovers who find each other through their fight with a common enemy: cancer.Shailene Woodley is perfectly cast, as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a normal teenage girl coping with all of the agonies of growing up, with the additional challenge of battling cancer.The story explores her battle with cancer, as well as her first romance and the frustrations of growing up.Laura Dern stands out as Hazel's loving mother, who portrays all the love and angst of the parent of a terminally ill child.There's a subplot involving Hazel visiting a famous author in Amsterdam (a cantankerous Willam Defoe), and a poignant visit to the home of Anne Frank.This type of story is difficult to bring to the screen successfully- the artistic talents involved have done that, creating a beautiful and moving cinematic experience, which is well worthwhile.Revised June 9, 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4RLD4PAHPC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAJ2K0Y#wasThisHelpful","RQ4RLD4PAHPC6","A2O451L6U4X8HM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O451L6U4X8HM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At times it's rude, profane and violent. Also, some scenes involve sexual references and toilet humor.Nonetheless, I thought this was a clever and entertaining movie- a send up Western, in the tradition of ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Evil Roy Slade"".The opening is terrific: a great Western score, and beautiful cinematography capturing the natural beauty of Monument Valley in Utah.The story is a simple one- but if you like this kind of humor, it's done well.The cast is uniformly excellent- Seth MacFarlane shows a deft comic touch as star, writer and director, as well as contributing his talent to songs in the movie- the dance hall scene with the band performing ""If you've only got a moustache"" is a show stopper.Charlie Theron shows another side as a comic talent, and the remainder of the cast are experienced comedy players. Liam Neeson is a suitably nasty gunslinger.There are some surprise cameo appearances which add to the enjoyment of this carefully contrived amusement.On the whole, this a well made light comedy entertainment. The music is great and the cinematography is gorgeous.Be sure to watch the credits all the way to the end:)Well worth seeing, unless you find this genre of humor offensive or in poor taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4ZJ666FSDJQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM9MP9I#wasThisHelpful","R4ZJ666FSDJQV","A2O451L6U4X8HM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O451L6U4X8HM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a comedy based upon the rivalry between a young couple with a new baby, and their new neighbors - a university frat house.The cast is good for this type of movie: Seth Rogan and Zac Efron play their protagonist roles convincingly, and Rose Byrne is a good foil as Rogan's wife.All of the cast are quite charming in their roles.Liza Kudrow makes a welcome cameo appearance as the dean of the university.It's a comedy based upon the simple premise of the friction between the family wishing to enjoy a peaceful suburban life and their garden partying neighbors.One thing you need to know is that is at times rude, and the characters use colorful language. Indeed, in one scene, Rogan comments to Byrne about his concern that their daughter's first word may be a profanity!If you enjoy this simple and somewhat  raunchy humor, you will like this movie.

"This is an excellent movie.I suspect it is not for everyone: essentially, it's the tale of a morally bankrupt corporation which will stop at nothing to cover up its misdeeds. There's a battle between good and evil, and a full spectrum of characters: including decent people who are innocent victims, an anti-hero good guy, and people whose humanity has seemingly disappeared. The interplay of these characters, and the layering of story lines and subplots is handled masterfully.What makes it a good movie?First, the excellent performances from the cast. George Clooney is entirely believable as an attorney who is his firm's ""fixer"". Tilda Swinton delivers a superb performance as a corporate executive who will do anything- legal or not- to protect her employer. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.Then, there's the screenplay and direction by Tony (Bourne Legacy) Gilroy. He sweeps you up into the story, and the devious twists and turns of the plot, as well as taking you into the lives of the characters.While this is a fictional story, there is an aura of authenticity which creates the impression the events depicted could happen in reality. It's a cautionary tale of what can happen when corporate greed overwhelms moral judgment. But, it is entertaining, and the moral message never overwhelms that entertainment value.Well worth watching for a compelling tale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DLOAKBZS6VYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014B8KSI#wasThisHelpful","R3DLOAKBZS6VYC","A2O451L6U4X8HM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O451L6U4X8HM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My back pain from Spinal Stenosis and 2 herniated discs is so bad, my doctor offered me actual narcotics for the pain.

"If there's a stronger umbrella out there, the President's using it.I'm simply amazed at the capabilities of this umbrella.  This Wooqwin automatic opening and closing travel umbrella is the answer to all gift giving!  You push a button it opens, you push another and it shuts. Then you just push the top into the bottom. And you can do all of that dryly.  Nice sturdy grip on the handle too. Nylon strap to hang also.I live in thee -''windy city'' so when I heard this was wind proof and rainproof, I was over joyed. We got it yesterday and since it was a rainy day today, we took this out to an empty golf course to test it out. No matter how hard it was blowing, (45 MPH winds clocked) this umbrella never collapsed! Standing still in a down pour, he was dry.He (husband) ran almost 300 yards with it completely opened, turned it against the wind, stood there and just let the wind TRY. Nope.The umbrella won.I'll bet I've gone through more than 100 umbrellas in my lifetime so far, but I've never seen one stand up as well as this one.

"If you are reading this, -believe all of the 5 star reviews, because they are true.These are wonderful!  In my experience with headphones, what I look for  now--is comfort, clarity, construction and weight.These Thorx Sentey LS-4430  Headphones provide all of those features. Made to last with a brushed aluminum and padded over head low tension bar, that is so light I can wear then for hours with no problems whatsoever. I'm thrilled. No shmushing my head too tightly! My most comfortable headset yet.  The over ear--ear cups are really well padded and they even rotate to suit your head. They're collapsible too.  Considering what they're asking for headphones of lesser quality out there, I'd say these were of studio quality with an excellent and very high performance level. Audio quality is beyond my expectations.For this price point you will not find better.The black case they come in is very handsome and sturdy, with a nice strong zipper. Looks wise (aside from the quality) -it's worthy of gift giving. I can easily answer calls with the controls on the cord, with a built in microphone, and you can also play and pause the music from the same controls.

"No one hates the smart phones more than my husband. He sent 3 back because they didn't hold a charge for more than 3 hours, they didn't fit in his chest pocket without slipping out, and he wasn't about to carry one around like a hat box or a pizza, anymore. So he went back to a beloved flip phone, and found this Turtle back case, REALLY well made leather (made in the USA) case that fit his LG 450 flip phone, -AND his needs, just perfectly. Super strong and really well made!It comes in 2 pieces, it snaps together. He's thrilled. It's perfect. The clear vinyl covers the keys and the back clip is very sturdy. Ports line up just perfectly.  He MUST keep it clipped on his chest pocket, as he doesn't want look at his phone screen for comfort all day. ..I'm here for that.Is this a snug case? OF course!  It's real Leather! Yes!  Is it strong? Yes!  \IT HAS to be snug--because they eventually stretch out a little so you must have a case with snug-ness! You must EASE your phone into it.The numbers are just a tap away with this clear vinyl cover, close over them -as is the face.

"This necklace is just beautiful.A shiny rich shade of silver -this could quite easily pass for real. Has a nice weight to it, not feather light or cheesy feeling. This looks really expensive.  I can't tell the difference of this shade of silver--when I wear this and one of my real silver bracelets.As you can see by the picture the chain links are box shapes and the main medallion is around 4.5 inches long a it's highest point.The whole necklace measures 20 inches long, and looks really rich around your neck. The links that hang with the coins have tiny onyx colored stones adorning them also. Very striking, feminine, and very pretty!Great with a turtleneck and jeans- a simple white blouse open at the neck-- or even a strapless top.I like my necklaces to hang longer than this one is, so I got an 8 inch extender here on Amazon, and now it hangs at the exact length I like.I'm always getting compliments on this.

"I liked this Bluetooth 4.1 magnetic wireless i9 headphone by SmartOmni. The magnet  and the minimalism of this set is made for a sports headset that is resistant to moisture such as sweat and doesn't have long cords hanging around as you exercise or participate in a sport or activityA very advanced integrated magnetic design that uses strong magnets at both ends creates this whole unit as a circle to really hang on your neck nicely. Indicator light, in line microphone, and the multi-function button along with V + / next track, V-/ previous track are on the control bar. A little small for my bigger fingers, but I got the hang of it eventually. I really don't use this for calls or take calls with Bluetooth head phones when I'm running, but tried once for reviewing purposes- and the call was clear.Nice, well balanced, satisfying sound. No shuffling, or tinny sounds--these are unusually clear. Not bombastically loud, but rather in the safer range. Loud enough.I think they cancel out noise pretty well, considering the racket on my busy street.  Ear buds are clearly marked left and right, and all the controls are on the bar-in the cord and near your right ear. The only control on the ear buds themselves is the USB port for charging. Charging took me about 3 hours. Pairing was not a problem and I'm not using them the predicted 7 hour playtime, a few hours a day is all I need them for, although the instructions will say a probable 7 hours talk time and 7 hours play time, standby time, up to 200 hours.The ear pads they came with fit me well but an extra pair comes with. I'd call this a Hematite shade of black as they have a nice glow to them..All in all, a very cool set.

"I love fringe, and so for me, this fit the bill. I's like an ultra suede, because it looks like suede to the naked eye, but isn't and has no bulk factor like the real thing.  It just barely meets in the front, but that ok with me because I don't tie it anyway. I think it's meant to be worn open so the fringe will blow.. It's comfortable and I can hand wash it in cold water or dry clean it. It comes down to the middle of my thigh and I'm 5' 7''. On each height, it will of course, differ.

I try not to over pack but if I don't, then I buy souvenir's and my luggage ends up stuffed anyway. :(Even after trying out another one of these, I know I would never travel without one for Each suitcase or bag--what ever the fabric of my bag is.It's just a much more secure feeling -since we can no longer lock our luggage- during air travel,  knowing that these would help contain, any accidentally jarred opened luggage.. I would really highly recommend a few of these -or more- for yourself or for your family.Peace of mind isn't really expensive in this case!*received free for my unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22J3LYY9KG3E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016EYL43W#wasThisHelpful","R22J3LYY9KG3E1","A38BYCK64K98TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38BYCK64K98TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sentey has truly out done them selves this time.  This Artix Sentey Gaming Head set has an incredible sound, through their explosive internal speakers.  Well built and amazing!  First of all, the ear cups are so soft and fully padded, and omni directional- I could wear them for hours, (and have) without any discomfort whatsoever. Headset is plastic and light, not a heavy piece of metal hanging over, and on top of your head.The ear cups are made to sit around your ear-- not on them.  The inner overhead strap makes an ideal cushion for almost all size heads, and the strap on the very top meets this inner strap for an even more comforting and secured fit.  The controls are all located on the clearly marked left ear cup, and in this left ear- flips out the microphone. After the microphone flips down and it then can be flipped back up up for your convenience.In-line controller for Microphone, Mute and Volume. All switches on same side. Extremely clear microphone picks up your voice with out directly speaking into it. Sound so astonishing clear and realistic it Almost scared me-- (I thought bullets were whizzing by my head on one of the games!)  (ha ha)The braided audio cable -about 7 ft. 5 inches long, and is thickly covered in heavy duty plastic. Much easier to clean and very durable!When you turn on those led blue lights on the ears- you feel ready for lift off!  So Beautiful!  Gold plated USB 2.0 connector to increase connectivity. One year warranty. If you really want to impress someone with quality and performance, THIS is the head set to get!

"This is Wolverine LED Headlamp-is a VERY necessary light that ought to be in every ones car, hiking bag or home.Maybe even a few scattered around your home.It's very comfortable, softly padded to fit well, great stretch, water proof, adjusts either up or down, with an led light, that lasts approx 100,000  hours. 3 settings, medium high, and hazard blinking. Scope pulls out for a more narrow beam. Takes 3 triple A batteries. So easy to use, and for so many different uses!  Of course the usual, biking, camping, night riding, and incidents in strange dark places, dim attics, crawl spaces, black outs, night walking, looking for something small you've dropped or lost.  There are countless reasons more!Having a light such as this, makes me wonder what I did with out it.This has even helped me thread the dreaded needle. :(My eyes aren't great anymore for tiny objects-but with this head light, I can see Much easier.It helps so much with my jewelry making, my embroidery, tweezing my eye brows, and even painting my fingers and toe nails with a more exacting ''aimed'' light, because my hands are free wearing this.  Winning!Carrying a small child alone in the dark, can be very dangerous- until you reach a lighted area, but if you slip this on, finding your way, or getting the keys from your bag is a cinch.

"Syllable A6 wireless Bluetooth sports ear phones with in line control built in-- are wild.  Unusually tiny and delicate  ''looking''  headphones, as shown, and much attention to minutia. These are actually made for sports.It slips around your neck like a thin pliable rubber cord, and the look is very inconspicuous. Charging took me about 1 1/2 hours, and pairing with my iPhone was simple. I held down the tiny red button, until the led light flashed red and blue. A6 should come up quickly.  Range is good for around 15 ft. Should give you about 3 hours of listening time, and they're - Sweat proof. They should connect to most devices that are Bluetooth enabled.This necklace type headphones will stay around for many reasons aside from it's rather invisible look and feather weight, -it's very subtle.I feel they can be worn well with many sports, such as running, skating or biking. Tennis? of course!Answering a call is as easy as pressing any key on the multi function button.There's a magnet in the clasp that holds the ear buds on your neck, --and inside a side of this magnetic clasp is the charging port.The pendant are where the controls are located! In line control built in microphone! Clicking the button powers the device on -off,  2 clicks control volume up and down as well as track shuffle, clicking any 3 buttons answers a phone call,  and to hang up simply press any button.Though admirably built the volume isn't earth shattering. It's safe volume is very clear, and easy on the bass.Ear plugs, though I only received one set, fit extremely well. Good noise cancellation.I think this Syllable A 6 wireless sports head phone is an ingenious piece of work, Imagine anyone doing this much intricate work with any really great results--- They did!  :)  Love!Comes with Syllable A6 Bluetooth Necklace 4.1 EarphonesUSB to Micro USB charge cableInstructions= excellent*these were given to me in exchange for my honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35QD9ADNMKHWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GYB6IY#wasThisHelpful","R35QD9ADNMKHWJ","A38BYCK64K98TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38BYCK64K98TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I looked at the style of these Sentey over ear Headphones- I liked them right away. I thought they looked really cool, especially for this price point. Comfortable, and stylish with a good, clear and equalized sound. The ear phones are nicely padded, and the padded frame sat well on my head. It was nicely adjustable for my sons head also. Low tension on the ears, while the ear pads tilt and swivel to suit your needs. Left and Right earphones clearly marked too. Worn for hours comfortably by myself. With microphone inline control, play/pause answer/hang up control is handy for accepting calls, and there's also a button to mute calls or to hold it down to end them They're compatible with my family's Many devices!. Our calls were perfectly clear. The tangle free, braided cord, 3.5 mm audio cable is remarkably well made!  My kids and I can be unintentionally tough on things, - it looks like this cord will fit the bill.Not a delicate set, this is truly built for the use of just about anyone. The sound is better than good. Great bass and clear highs.Not noise cancelling- but that's good, because I have to hear what's going on in this house. I just leave it plugged in to my PC so when I relax to some music, or listen to bio's on you tube, I've got them ready. The case is rich looking but made tough and the cool logo placed on the case is a sharp touch.

"Great multi- functional tie, scarf, belt, or-- ''what ever you can imagine''- hanger, takes away much of the clutter out of your closets. Built with very sturdy standards, this J.S multi-functional chrome finished hanger has black PVC coated tips to keep the tie rungs from snagging any of the more frail materials it comes in contact with, such as expensive silk or the other fragile fabrics of scarves. Heavily coated PVC ends keeps many types of fabrics from slipping off as it works as a ''non slip'' agent.  Belts can be hung off the bottom two hooks or even higher on the upper rungs.This hanger alone is capable of holding 24 ties--or even double that if you hang 2 on each rung. He's managed to hang 35 ties alone on one hanger alone. It could also hang over 20 belts if you so desire!  I find if you spread open the hanger on the bottom a few inches it allows for more room for heavier fabrics or better air flow for your fabrics.This can also be used to hang extra handbags. This is surprisingly strong!A strong top hook that swivels 360 degrees, and comes ready to hang. So movable you can turn it and aim it anyway you choose in your closet or on most any rod. They come in a 2 pack and my husband has one now for his many ties and belts, and several inches of more room in his closet.I've been using the extra hanger for my many scarves. They hang very well and don't fall off when moved aside.It's the kind of hanger that is designed mainly for ties and belts, But -if you have other needs --  I guess you might just hang up a myriad of your own ideas on it!

"These Brainwavz S3 IEM noise isolating earphones have to be one of the most phenomenal earphones I have ever used. They must be audiophile friendly, because if they were any clearer, I'd think the musician I'm listening to would be sitting on the chair opposite me. I felt like I was in a mini recording studio with these on. Staggering clarity.They come beautifully and safely packaged, with S3 Earphones, Hard zip around carrying case, shirt clip, Velcro cable tie.  Also, with 6 sets of silicone ear tips, 1 set Comply foam tips T-400, 1 set silicone bi-flange ear tips, 1 set silicone tri-flange ear tips,  and a clear written instruction manual with warranty card. (24 month warranty)Cables are flat  (thank you Brainwavz)  so tangling isn't an issue. Works flawlessly with my Android and my tablet. Matter of fact, a rhapsodic experience. The housing is of high quality metal, and ear phones are designed and do- fit securely and comfortably in your ears. Model here comes with volume control, pause button on flat cord, play, fast forward, reverse, and all controls worked flawlessly for me and also on our IOS devices.Ear pieces are clearly marked ''left'' and right''  intentionally, so you will hear the music as it was recorded and laid down in the studio by the engineer,  so it will be heard the way it is intended to be heard.Costly? maybe.

"These Kizwavz KV-100 Children's Wireless Bluetooth headphones are extraordinary. My 9 year old daughter went wild when she saw them; and in pink, her favorite color!  Visually beautiful, these are also adjustable, light weight,  and very much quality built.I am very impressed at how well these are made, and how they are specially geared in sound level to a child's sensitive ears. They accompany a large range of head sizes, as her head is medium sized for a child (and mine is a larger, size 7)  they fit very comfortably on us both.  Nicely padded ear cups also. The sound is as clear as almost any adult headset, and you can hook them up to your laptop or phone if you run out of charge. They pair easily, and run several hours on a charge,  with a typical range for for a Bluetooth headset. I feel safe letting my daughter use headphones geared towards her age group. If plugged directly into my laptop or tablet, the sound can be considerably louder, but they both offer a sound warning.Comes with: KV -100 Bluetooth headphones, Aux input cable, USB charging cable, and an easy to read instruction manual with a warranty card- warranty good for 12 months.What a wonderful concept!

"I liked these Bluesky Dream goggles.Good for a back up pair for my husband and myself and husband, but these will work differently for different sports of course. We ride his Harley. No matter what you wear on a motorcycle you're not going to get the same effect that other sports give you. Untested on snow days, but in high winds and through light rain and bugs, they work fine. That said,  it all comes down to your needs and your preferences. These really  fit me well, (husband also)  because of a nice adjustable strap they sit snug and softly around my head.  Clear dark gray and mirrored lens, that are UV-400, the view inside is nice. Not professional goggles but a good stand by.These come in a great zip up  case, with decent foam padding, with a carabiner for hanging. From lens vent to lens- vent  they measure 7 inches across,  and there are also vents on the top of the goggles, to eliminate fogging or excessive wind.Too much air can dry your eyes, and too little air can suffocate them.  It's a delicate dance there. So far, this hasn't been a problem with our biking. He's worn them and  I've worn them, and the air pressure seems fine. Really nice surprise!  No dust gets through either.Lined in a generic foam material, they felt soft enough not to irritate my face under the helmet.  I'd personally prefer them for lighter sports such as bicycling, four wheeling, dirt biking and such.  The frames are plastic but not flimsy.

"Don't wait until you're older,  to start taking card of your skin!This 'Body Merry'  -eye gel AMAZED me. I tried it for just a few days and saw that the puffiness under my eyes has subsided and the skin was much flatter there and not puffy anymore. If I'm going out for the evening, I apply this for a few hours before, - just to look refreshed.I always apply it in the evening after I wash my face..I wondered why this Body Merry gel-- worked so well and others didn't? So I look at the ingredients, (and first of all, it hasn't been tested on animals-- I like that)  and a very well known $$ brand uses this Hyaluronic acid ingredient, and there's So many other very healthy ingredients in here such as MSM, peptides, proteins, and more.I never thought I'd see such good results. I eat junk food a lot sometimes and it's FULL of salt, and that swells up our eyes, but this Body Merry eye gel ''un-swells'' them and you can count on it to take the swelling down.The key about your facial skin here; is:  DON'T WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE OLD TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR SKIN!BUT--ANY time you begin is better than never -and it's never too late!  Do it NOW. ....I did.My eye skin looks bright and smoother, not puffy and swollen like I was crying. I love his eye gel and I won't give it up! I reviewed this because I loved it.

"I had a ball with these!! SO believable my kids screamed with surprise when they saw one on me! Nylon but not like a pair of nylons--stronger.A perfect match to my Caucasian skin, and with plenty of detail!  My husband is Asian and the tattoo sleeve blended well enough for him too.  If you are of a darker brown or black skin tone the black in the sleeve can blend well, and the ''flesh part'' color becomes the tattoo, instead of the other way around! Who's left out here? Many tattoos only Go up to the elbow, and a rolled up shirt can hide that part easily.Add a pair of gloves if you want true authenticity and it's game on! So many patterns to choose from.Of course if you have Superman's arms these aren't for you. :)They look so real with the beautiful intricate drawings and colored art, I was shocked myself!They go on easy and off easy. They wash well in cool water.  They're comfortable and very hip looking --when you need to look hip. ~or hot.I'd say GET Some!!---FOOL your friends---So much FUN!!  I LOVE them!!

"This is an excellent dry bag!  When we food shop, our cart is loaded with  perishables that can leak, drip and thaw in warmer OR cooler weatherThis fantastic Feilaiger 10 liter dry bag eliminates this problem. No more dripping on the dry items anymore. That's just one use, because the uses are endless. When I wash certain things in cold water I've used this as a bag to separate the little things that need separating in my wash.This bag is super easy to wash itself. Just warm to hot sudsy water and rinse, with the bag inside out and it's good to go, --  (after drying naturally).We've used it to hold bird seed,  wet bathing suits after a day at the beach,  my sons books on those rainy days for school.Use your imagination for your needs. We've even used it for ''car and paper refuse''  while driving our crew on long trips.Skip the sharp items ie: knives, pens unless contained in a proper holder.  This 10 liter dry bag is a keeper.!  Solidly made of sturdy PVC material this things is STRONG. Top closes by rolling it down 3 times and connecting with the clip. If you have another spare strap you might attach it with the carabiner and carry this on your shoulder.  Bottom line this is a multi-purpose bag for anyone who has a need for it.Would I recommend it? Yes!  SO many different uses.  I love this bag!

"Upon receiving this I first tried this on (my head) and it was quite comfortable. You could feel where the weight was but it wasn't bad at all. Then since there were no 18650 ion batteries that might have come with it, --I had to borrow the proper batteries and charger from an Asian relative and I was ready.Once fitted and working I wanted to test this out so I wore this on the lowest of the three LED beams at night; and that was impressively bright to say the least. You can set this light at several different  angles. You can also wear this light on your belt if you prefer.  And--this has a zoom lens also.This has an even brighter beam than the first one and then a flashing ""help me'' beam. This light on the highest setting is almost surgically bright! Startling!  I pictured guys down in the coal mines wearing something akin to this. Don't look directly into this light, it's painful..At it's brightest level, It's made to REALLY see where you're going, like in pitch black areas. The beam spread out very wide in it's shadow so it 's not just a ''sewer lid'' sized area --it covers a lot of ground. I wouldn't face an on coming car with this on the brightest beam. Don't do that. The light is so bright it should be left OUT of drivers eyes as well as your own. It's obviously not a toy.The elastic encasing is soft, stretchy and adjustable. I wore it for about 20 minutes -without pain of it's now battery filled weight. Some of the places you might need this head light might be while camping, working anywhere it's dark,  under your car hood, attic, underground cellar, a storm blackout or power outage (yes -Especially when the whole house goes black), even on our way to our out-house in the dark, up in the north woods. Yes, many of us still have those..Safe to say, this is a great light where ever you have no light,  very little light--or need a ton of light.  Would I recommend this?  Yes.

"These Ponosoon Sports sunglasses, are handsome and amazing sunglasses with 5 interchangeable colored lenses that you can change for different reasons, settings, sun angles and many sports. Diffusing harsh rays of the sun, these are very advanced in the making.These glasses are made to wrap around the sides of the eyes so no peripheral light can bother or creep in the eyes,- even protects against dust and wind.  The colors of the plastic lenses are useful and amazing. They vary in their stunning colors,  and please note that they are lighter than glass..Distortion free too.PERFECT for Cycling, boating, biking,  horseback riding, among so many other activities, sports, and out door hobbies. Anywhere too much sun is an issue.Driving ? Absolutely!The cons. Removing the initial lenses was a little problem for me. Maybe I got a stiff pair but I am still trying to remove the first lenses without breaking them. They were really ''in there'' well. You must work them out gently.The frames are very flexible and very comfortable on my own head, keeping in mind, we all have different shapes and sized heads these fit me well. The seller is great and really tried to help me by sending photos on how to do this. You tube may help others. I really love these glasses!The lenses they come with are super clear and the color blue is really sharp and edgy.  I love the shape of these on my face type. Nice arms with a good spring to them too. They do not come off my head while being physically bounced around in my Cycling or in a very active motion. They hug your head softly.  They come in the most attractive large, rich looking, silver patterned , zippered case! -- also with a cleaning cloth, carabiner clip,  soft inner satin case and the five lenses.You cannot ask for more, in a pair of interchangeable lense-- Cycling, and many  Sport Sun  Glasses.

"Product provided for little or no cost in exchange for my unbiased reviewWe all have stress. It's a part of life.  But trying to calm yourself at a moments notice can't involve a hot bath (in the middle of a meeting?)  or maybe some medications... no! I want something natural like this silky rejuvenating  Karmick Sleep mask!  It is one of the most relaxing ideas to come around in a long time.This mask is very special. It contains Flax seeds to help weigh it and to contour it to the shape of your own individual face and it's features.The masks  ''innards''  gently fall into place on to the sides of your nose, the rounds of your cheeks, the lift of your brow and the concave of your eyes. It applies a very soft and comforting relaxing pressure.  These Flax seed granules help to distribute the pressure of this mask equally in places on your face designed to give you comfort and to soothe away the stresses of the day -or even the moment. Just think -you can carry this with you. Pull your car over, lean your seat back and apply this mask. Relax for a moment... almost anywhere.It can also block out light, you can heat this for your sinuses or dry eyes after misting it with water and micro-waving for about 30 seconds  or allow it to cool in your refrigerator to use for bad headaches or, migraines. (cool for about 2 hours in  your freezer in a plastic bag)All of this, with the pure and natural scent of beautiful lavender. Gently squeeze this mask for more of the scent.  This is such a delicious way to relax and have a soothing break from a stressful moment or at the end of long hectic day!

"These lights for my fountains were the most beautiful dazzling lights!-- changing colors under water, and turned off or on with a remote! I had ordered them and a few days later two went out. This vendor replaced them right away. I was thrilled.  All of fountains were floating colored water lights, that either stayed one shade or ran the gamut of all colors, like a rainbow.  You adjusted the color or colors. Just stunning! Now at the end of Summer only two lights remains working, and we always turned them off each night. I'm hoping they will do something to extend the life a lot longer than a few months, because they are so very beautiful to watch when working.I really hope they remake and perfect them.

"I was given these for free (or at a discounted rate) in order to offer an unbiased reviewI Never knew there was anything like this out there. Never!  Something to hide or camouflage ugly unsightly power cords and such.I use to just put a fake plant in front of them and vacuum around the cords, I had lost all hope---- and then I saw these. I fell in love immediately. I have several wall sockets in my office alone, and all of them have power strips with nasty looking cords hanging all over the floor. But no more!Think of when you purchased your last umbrella and how it went into a sleeve-- well this is on the same concept. You run your cords down a sleeve that you will just zip up. Only this sleeve is open at both ends. Voila! -Success! THESE are WONDERFUL for an UNORGANIZED person --(like me).  :)  The amount of JOTO Management Sleeves that you will use, will depend on the length of your cords or your own discretion.  Set of 4. Each 19 inches long.They're soft, black neoprene and the zipper is a good zipper and very easy to use. No tugging. They can be laundered, they don't ''catch'' on your stockings, and your cords are all contained in the sleeve.  (rather than hanging loose and  tripping over them)They are in full view, but neatly and amazingly pliable. I just placed 5 cords in one sleeve, and can actually see my floor in that area, for the first time in years-  :)  and I haven't even hit the bedroom yet.I'm tossing the fake plants; I don't need them anymore! I can now sweep, vacuum, and  mop that area with ease. No dangerous, dangling, or ugly cords are in my way!!  These sleeves are a blessing.

"I've been using Tumeric in my cooking for many years now. I love it in all of my rice dishes because I love the delicious nutty flavor it gives, along with the bright yellow tint it gives. Toss some on your chicken or your fish! Don't let the color shock you.  It's a strong color for a reason.It's an anti-oxidant along with having anti-inflammatory properties.It's also good brain food. Is known to enhance brain power.Just a 3/4 teaspoon per two cups of rice makes plain white rice just taste better (and look like designer rice while you're at it). I have been using it more now, to keep the inflammation down on my joints, as my doctor says I have the beginning of Arthritis in my knees.This Kazu Tumeric is EXCELLENT!  The flavor, the smell, all of my Tumeric enhanced dishes are even better with this 100% organic Tumeric. I've always bought it by the bottle in the grocery stores. :(  -- NO more.

"The life of this Lohas candle base, soft white led bulb - is a huge selling point, but the glare of it turned me off. I almost feel like it's a surgical light intensity, and for those who like a light that's blasting- then this is for you. Mine is the soft white and I put it in one socket of my candle based  ceiling fixtures, and after the short delay of the bulb, I could see every imperfection around it, even the dust on the glass parts of my chandelier, that I had just cleaned off that same day. IF_ this bulb was the dimmer bulb, my feelings would change about it. Having company over for dinner and having these light bulbs (I can only imagine a few of them together) glaring in their faces, could just be too uncomfortable for my eyes, or most eyes, without being able to dim these. I do love the idea that the bottom half can be unscrewed to fit smaller areas like under a ceiling fan, where a smaller enclosure might be. Or in a spot that's very difficult to reach and to replace a bulb, this would be ideal.Bottom line here. The quality is excellent and for those who just adore lots of strong light and longevity in a bulb, -- you've found your dream bulb.*product provided for review *","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFA999EJO80IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3WWMS6#wasThisHelpful","RFA999EJO80IO","A38BYCK64K98TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38BYCK64K98TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tiny but cool.  This YUMMQUA wireless Bluetooth Headset mini stereo is small but packs a nice punch. (battery must be full first)  The charging wire is connected to the charging socket on the headset.  The charging light shows red when fully charged--and red light goes out when charging is accomplished. This hooks over my ear easily, (can shake loose so make sure it's stable),seems to be made tough, and the sound is really very nice and clear.I paired it to my tablet; as I always use that the most. No problem, my tablet accepted easily.A difference here, is that you push down on the top of this device instead of a side button, and I like that better. Range around 10m --or 30 feet. Lithium battery, protection circuit. and noise canceling. ( I had to wear 2 pairs of reading glasses to read the tiny instructions) .

The netting blocked out the mosquitoes - and we could sit out on my deck after hours and talk without bugs biting or crawling on us. Loved that.  The zippered door was such a plus and a great idea as opposed to just maybe a flapped door.

"This supplement has had a very good effect on me.I use to LOVE to drink green tea, -but noticed that it made me feel so jittery. I read up on these Advanced Green Tea Extract, and read it had no caffeine--I thought, well that's good. Also it's all natural, vegan friendly, and high in the anti-oxidant- ''Vitamin C''.All  That really sounded good to me. Also it seemed to increase my mood in a better way, and I wasn't looking for the red licorice I depended on, to calm me down whilst feeling anxious.  I'm serious..I also seem to be more focused, alert, and I felt an inner calm in me, that I hadn't felt in a long time. There was a mild sense of energy too. But without the jitters.  I got on the scale Sunday and I've lost about 4 pounds. Is it this supplement? I hope so.Those words  ""Fat Burner"" gave me new hope, in losing my extra 9 lbs. Will it work the same on you?

"Lovely off white or ivory 2 inch wide floral lace ribbon.  It's a bit scratchy,at first,  but it softens in time. A person mentioned here, I'd read on the reviews that she'd trimmed a candle with this. You can, with some glue.I have used this for crafts, It's excellent for a home made a wedding garter.  Nice for trimming a dress, or trimming socks,Good for lace trim on gloves, -but use caution it might tear.  I made some lace cuffs on a blouse with this- but you must be careful, as it can also catch.  I put some lace on a head band with household glue,, I made my pillow cases fancy with his trim, but just for looks. Even used this on my dress towels; but then must dry clean.For other items this needs a small stitch as lace is very open in spots.  If you tie your hair up with this remember, you must use hair pins.- because remember, there's no give!  You can tie a curtain back with this lace ribbon, but must be nailed to grab the solid part of the floral pattern, and hooked gently to wood trim.So pliable you can wrap it around the steering wheel of your wedding car, but.again, it must be glued with washable glue or it will slip off leather.All of these will work with this type of lace ribbon! Use caution. Even though it's costly, it has Multiple uses.I've done many. If it wasn't a multi--use ribbon I couldn't have done all of this.  BUT.-- remember -It does NOT stretch. Baste if in doubt, it can be very fragile. If laundered, use COLD water NO dryer!  Hand wash is even better.I've really enjoyed using this ivory lace ribbon!

Use it in your kitchen or anywhere, with no fear of it falling and cracking a floor that may otherwise chip.Let the kids use it too, remember this locks-  and this shaker is shatter proof, and is made heavy-duty and-- BPA free.Carry it anywhere, it's portable!Comes in a very lovely gift giving container too.A nice gift for the serious drinkers or the fancier cocktail lovers for the holidays.

"This is the best milk substitute I've found to date! It actually tastes really close to milk, especially the creamy texture and the slight sweetness. I am lactose intolerant and don't really like Lactaid, so I pretty much only drink soy, almond, hemp, rice, or flax milk (which ever is available). I've tried all kinds of brands of these milks, Silk, Blue Diamond Almond Breeze, Almond Dream, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods 365, literally at least 20 different combinations of nut/seed milks and brands. I've concluded this is the FIRST product that I've had that actually tastes like it could be milk.Prior to this brand, I actually really disliked almond milk. I could not get over the almond nut taste and the ever so slight gelatinous texture. I thought flax milk tasted the most like milk but the separation and grittiness was insane. Rice milk had the texture closest to milk but was sickening sweet and tasted like rice. I actually like the taste of certain soy milks but it definitely does not taste like milk.I would say Pacific's almond milk comes really close! I mainly use milk as creamer in coffee and tea and I believe this would make a great substitute for milk without adding additional nutty flavors to the drink while keeping the consistency. Even confident enough to say this would go great in a hot chocolate (almond and soy milk usually just don't taste right).

"I'm not going to comment on fit of the cups since everyone's breasts are different but I do not like the straps on this bra. They do not stretch and are somewhat short. As a result, they are either too tight and leave marks on your shoulder or if too loose, fall off. There needs to be some elasticity so they clean to shoulder! I've had this bra for a month and wore it maybe 8 times (haven't even washed it yet) and the lace is already ""pilling"" with threads coming off from rubbing against my shirts. To get a good fit I ordered this bra in various sister sizes.

I ordered 4 sets because I didn't know what color and size I wanted: 2 smalls in black and pink, 2 mediums in black and pink. All the bottoms had size variations. They were basically triangle shaped bottoms but the ""triangles"" were different sizes (one was wider, one was taller)! The fabric wasn't super cheap or anything but I wish they took more care in cutting out the shape of the panties?","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LST0DCENDBDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010D85N8M#wasThisHelpful","R1LST0DCENDBDP","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This screen did not work with my phone! My old LCD was still working on my crack iphone but glass was everywhere and the digitizer no longer worked.Upon opening the kit, I was impressed by the contents, especially the tools that came with the set. It seemed they included everything you needed although there were no instructions, just a link to iFixit.To my dismay, after putting the new screen in, I found out that the screen won't even power on. My phone was on and functional though because iTunes was able to detect it. I even booted into DFU mode and did a full restore. After extensive googling, the problem lies with the screen being a non-OEM aftermarket part with outdated firmware. The funny thing is, if I boot my phone with the old broken screen and then unplug it and plug the replacement back in, the replacement does turn on. This shows the Apple logic board does a part check in the beginning and some how knows the replacement screen isn't a genuine part. I don't know what about my iphone 5c makes it unique to not take aftermarket screens. I have a yellow 16GB unlocked phone purchased in Jan 2014.The screen bezel that came with the replacement also felt like it was made from a cheaper plastic and did not fit 100% flush with the phone! The screw drivers that came with the kit were also crap. Overall the kit is pretty complete but it's a pain to spend hours taking the phone apart, putting it back together, deal with the tiny pieces, only to find out the screen won't even power on. Avoid all the pain and just sell your phone for parts on Ebay or bring it into a shop!","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109QR7TC8JM1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZT2A02#wasThisHelpful","R109QR7TC8JM1B","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DO. NOT. BUY. THIS! This product is WAY too expensive for what it is and is a huge rip off! All it is is a cheaply made wooden Victor mouse trap you can buy for 50 cents at the hardware store and a red piece of plastic that goes over the metal part of the trap. You can probably make your own by cutting a plastic take out box, paint it red and just hot glue it to the metal part of a mouse trap. You have been warned.The worse part is this thing doesn't even work. I put this next to my bedroom door because my cats like to bite at my door at night. This thing didn't trigger at all and the cats just stepped over it. They also put their nose up to the yellow trigger and sniffed it and it did NOTHING. The only time this thing triggered was when I tried to set it and it would unset itself when I put it down. When it did trigger, the red plastic thing came flying off because it didn't quite fit.I also don't think this device is all that safe. It is a fifty cent mouse trap! You don't want your pets stepping on the trigger and getting their paws slammed on by the mouse trap. I even snapped my own fingers setting this. Unfortunately, it seems the only way your pets will set it off is if they step on the yellow part, which would make the metal part snap down on whatever pressed the trigger.This device might work if you have a giant 100 pound dog that romps and bangs into things but definitely not for graceful animals like cats. Even then, there's better devices like the ssscat air canisters or a sound deterrent like the sofa scram.I can't believe I paid $16 for 2 of these things that probably cost a total of $1 to make.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287XO15W16EQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJVFVNA#wasThisHelpful","R287XO15W16EQN","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The construction of this flashlight is solid (not like the cheapo painted aluminum flashlights from Harbor Freight) and will last you many years.The only reason I'm not giving this light 5 stars is because the twisty tie mount is garbage. You can only mount the light on the handlebars of the bike and even then it doesn't stay put. The mount rotates a little when the bike bumps which misdirects the beam.Tip: you can just press the end of the flashlight 2 times and twist the 3rd time to cycle to flashing mode, no need to twist and turn the flashlight on and off 3 times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3344QAW8UH90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BP3PT34#wasThisHelpful","R3344QAW8UH90","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This toilet seat in TOP quality! Everything is made from solid wood with a hard polished layer of white paint that almost feel like porcelain. The color of the toilet seat is not pure white but somewhat off-white. It's quite sturdy and the chrome is quite shiny although I'd imagine it would rust after a while.Unfortunately, I cannot use this toilet seat because I bought it for my cats. They are toilet trained and I bought this seat so I can bring the child seat down and give them more space to stand on the toilet. The problem was this toilet seat (both the adult and child) is QUITE thick. This is good in terms of quality but bad for my cat. The stacking of thick toilet seats created a ""tower of hanoi"" effect for my cat and he couldn't find a complete level surface to squat. The child seat is raised about another inch above the adult seat.The seats are also completely flat. They do not dip in like some other toilet seats so no contour for your butt!

"I have a Neato XV-21 and bought this robot because it was on sale at Best Buy. I also bought the combo brush accessory with it effectively turning into the equivalent of the Botvac 80. I am however extremely disappointed. There is a serious manufacturing defect with my new Botvac. It gets stuck in a 2 by 2 feet area and consistently tries to go backwards and back into walls. I know this is not normal because my XV-21 never did that. I am going to try to do a software update on it and if there is no fix for that, this unit is going back to the store.Update: I was able to get a replacement robot from Neato. The diagnosis was a stuck bumper. The bumper on the robot would not click so the robot thought it was consistently bumping into a wall, thus it would back up repeatedly. However, Neato still messed up or something and sent me the Botvac 80 (the purple model) instead of the 75 that I originally purchased. The Botvac 80 is the except same robot except different color and different accessories. I guess this worked in my favor because I got to keep the old accessories that came with the 75 (extra filters) AND the new accessories that came with the 80 (combo brush).  My only concern is that if the Botvac 80 they sent me breaks, I'm not sure what I would do about proof of purchase since I had originally bought the 75 and not the 80. Oh well, I'll worry about it when it happens.Anyway, my replacement Botvac works fine except it has problems with turning around next to stairs. It keeps getting stuck between the corner between the top of the stairs and the hall way wall when it tries to turn around. My Neato XV-21 never did that. I do notice the battery on the Botvac has a little more power than the battery on the XV-21. It was able to get over a slightly higher ledge going from my bathroom to the hallway where as my Neato XV-21 would always get stuck at that point. Lastly, the wall brush on the Botvac is useless. I found that my XV-21 hugged walls better and got more debris along the edge compared to the Botvac!The only improvements on the Botvac seems to be that the battery is better and it is slightly quieter. Otherwise, this machine is quite buggy and not worth the extra money. I would recommend the XV-21 over the Botvac.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T2TP3NNUZPJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J08ITBK#wasThisHelpful","R2T2TP3NNUZPJL","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought my mask in the Ulta store. I wanted the red led anti-aging version but they only had the acne mask which has both red and blue leds.

There is no reason why you can't use this mask afterwards. The LEDs in the mask might eventually get dimmer or burn out though but that shouldn't be after 30 uses.

I still have black heads on my nose, old acne scars, and uneven bumps near my chin (where the light doesn't reach).

"I'm not sure how accurate the fat measure part of this device is but I will say this device is incorrect with how it measures your weight depending on what mode you use it in. This is pretty bad considering this is a WEIGHT SCALE before it is a body composition monitor. It could also be that the instructions are wrong in that case, they need to fix it so people can use this device correctly because the instructions themselves make up 20% of this product. I would say, without the instructions, you would not be able to figure out how to even use this thing correctly because it's super non-intuitive and finicky.I've read the instructions multiple times and it tells me that if I want to measure my body composition along with my weight, I have to step on the scale with the hand sensor already in my hands. The device will then measure my weight first then I need to hold my arms out for the body composition process. If I just want to measure my weight, I don't have to pick up the hand sensor at all, and just step on the scale. I have no problems with this process except whenever I measure my body composition and weight at the same time, I end up weighing at 2 pounds heavier than I am while using weight only mode.I'm not sure if the scale ""forgets"" to calibrate for the sensor being in my hands or whether their instructions are written incorrectly to mislead you into thinking the scale actually calibrates for the hand sensor. This seems like a really stupid error for the company to make if they are going to release an $80 complicated product that comes with a complicated instructions manual.AND YES, this product's operations are complicated. Another majorly inconvenient thing about it is, despite having the ability to recall 4 profiles, you have to REMEMBER to select the profile right after you turn on the device and before you step on the scale. If you step on the scale and try to recall your profile after, it's too late and your have to turn the scale off and on again. I hate how this scale does not actually work like any other ""dumb"" digital scale. Other digital scales reset to 0 pretty quickly when you step off. This scale remembers and forces you to manually turn it on and off to reset it back to 0.

"I bought this book because I was trying to change my lifestyle and drink more water instead of sugary sodas and juices. I was excited to try the recipes because of the beautiful photos in this book but I have to say I am rather disappointed. So far I've tried 4 recipes in this book, I don't remember the names but they were the one with blueberries, lemon, and ginger, one with orange juice and tamarind paste, another with watermelon and basil, and another with celery and green grapes. All these recipes sounded good in principle but they either tasted like flavored water or reminded me of dishwater. What I mean by that is, even though there is good tasting fruit juice in your water, the recipe always tacks on one weird vegetable/herb ingredient that ruins everything. The blueberry drink was way too gingery. The orange juice and tamarind drink had cilantro in it that made it taste like I was drinking leftover dish washing water from a pot of soup. The watermelon and basil combination by itself was great except the recipe called for vinegar that made the watermelon juice taste like a vinegrette salad dressing. The carbonated water did not help and made the watermelon juice more sour when watermelon is suppose to be nice and sweet. The celery and green grape was just nasty salty and sour. Also, the book says you can keep the waters for up to 3 days. I would not keep them for more than 24 hours. I ended up with a big almost half gallon of celery water, and the morning after getting it out of the fridge, what was a nice green turned into a boogey green. It just did not look or taste appetizing after that.Overall I dislike how the author tries to be ""inventive"" with the recipes and make them more packed with flavor than they should. I think you are just better off infusing slices of cucumber or lemons in water and drinking that! More refreshing and fewer weird ingredients.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JA8QO1DYY7YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002H5GTHO#wasThisHelpful","R2JA8QO1DYY7YC","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was VERY difficult for me to find a good boston style cocktail shaker!! I finally gave this set a try and it works great!Before this set, I tried the True Boston Shaker and the Stainless Steel Cocktail Shaker (28 oz.). The True Boston Shaker leaked!! The 28oz boston shaker cup was 30oz and did not go well with the standard 16oz pint glass I had at home.This set comes with a metal cup that is maybe 32 ounces and the glass can hold maybe 24 ounces of fluid. This could be a pro or con. For me it is a little too big because I have small hands and it gets difficult to hold due to the size and weight. The good thing is this set does not leak and the recipes printed on the side of the glass are traditionally correct recipes for some standard bar drinks.I have not used the strainer. From what I can tell, it looks really cheap and will probably rust. I have OXO SteeL Cocktail Strainer as well as the OXO SteeL Double Jigger. The OXO strainer is a little too small to cover the big cup that comes with this set but it works. I love the jigger from OXO though, highly recommend.Even if you don't use the strainer that comes with this set, it is still a VERY good value! You can get this set even cheaper at Target.

"This ice tray is indeed spill proof and you can just throw it on top of your pile of stuff in your freeze without needing to worry about water spilling out.However, there are a few annoying flaws.1. The ice cubes are a tad too big and weird shaped. They are more like ice oblongs.2. If you want to fill the tray with filtered water, anything other than over a sink with a tap, you will have a hard time because unlike in a regular ice tray, the water does not flow easily from one block to the other. In a regular traditional ice tray, you can just keep pouring water in one space and tilt the ice tray and the water will overflow to the other spaces. Not so much with this tray. There are no ""channels"" in between the spaces so if you keep pouring into one space, water just spills out all over the place.3. I have a hard time getting the tray to release the ice cubes.4. It makes ice cubes that are not filled in all the way. This is because I have to press out the extra water when sealing the tray and sometimes I press out too much water or it doesn't seal properly and I end up dumping some water out from one of the spaces.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FM0AV2HQC6F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007U256D2#wasThisHelpful","R1FM0AV2HQC6F7","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this mattress protector to put on top of my latex topper. The topper fabric feel like velvet and does not crinkle as advertised. However, I would not call it ""plush"" as the topper is still rather thin. Unfortunately, this protector retains heat like no other. I got a latex mattress topper and it's suppose to keep the sleeping surface cool, but putting the protector on top totally reversed the affect. Sometimes I wake up drenched in my own sweat at night and this is sleeping at 67 degrees in the winter.I might just stop using the protector. I was afraid my cats would pee on my new bed as we just moved to a new place but they haven't and it's been 2 months.Overall, I would not recommend this topper for people who sleep hot.

"These boots fit great. I wear 6.5W and these are true to size where as other shoes I've ordered, the 6.5Ws were too long and I had to go down a size. There is enough room for me to were some no show liner socks.What I like about these shoes is that the heels are angle inward instead of going straight down. At first this felt really awkward but it made the shoes more comfortable as the angled heel gave more arch support. I found I was able to walk longer in these shoes without arch or ball of the foot pain. The shoes really fit like they were part of my feet and after I got used to the heel, walking was natural for me. I've never experienced that with any other pair of heels as they were never a perfect fit. I could still not get rid of pain completely of course. After walking 10 city blocks, my feed still needed rest.  If anyone know of heels that don't hurt your feet at all,let me know.My only complaint about these shoes are that the inner zipper rub up against my ankles and agitate them. This might be a problem if you wear tights. The zipper lining could snag your tights. These boots might work better with sturdy thick leggings. I was wearing them with no leggings under pants and against bare skin, the lining was super rough and tore at my skin!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18G8JJ3YSQKN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWOARNI#wasThisHelpful","R18G8JJ3YSQKN0","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put this dish mat underneath an IKEA ORDNING bi-level dish rack to dry all my dishes. I got two of these dish mats so I could alternate/wash one each week with my laundry. Upon removing the dish mat at the end of the week, my counter was soaking wet and there were obvious soak through spots on the bottom of the mat. Good thing 1 week was not enough for mold to grow on the counter I have. I would not recommend this if you have a lot of dishes to dry or plan to place a whole rack over it.I could have destroyed/ripped the bottom lining by putting the mat in the washing machine but this mat was advertised as machine washable, too.And FYI for those of you who are wondering because it's not very apparent in the description or in the positive reviews. In the picture, it looks like a real bamboo weaved mat. However I can assure you it's just a bamboo print. The mat itself feels like felt with a nylon backing. It also comes in a cheap plastic bag and looks like they just cut a square of this fabric off and stuck it in the bag. It's kind of pricey for what it is, absorbent felt in a bag. If you don't care what kind of print you get, the same company sells another product that is the same thing but markets it as a litter mat or dog food bowl mat. These mats come in paw prints and are bigger but cost less. They are rubber backed instead of nylon and seem to be more waterproof.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVVL5IU0ZCLEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DHYOWK#wasThisHelpful","RVVL5IU0ZCLEH","A10QUY14I0ZYFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10QUY14I0ZYFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yeah, this is a winner.WARNING: You have to get the right size. This is not one of the ones you can cut and shape. If you get the wrong size/width your feet *won't* be happy. So Amazon asks me to try these out and tell people what I think. I think ""sure, why not?"" These are so much better than the old fashioned ones I used to see a lot as a kid. I tried those once: the foam rubber ones with the tiny holes in them. They sucked! This is high tech. It is like having an extra set of soles in your shoes. I suppose you can replace the top foam rubber layer show manufacturer's put in most shoes, but I found that just slipping these in worked fine. They raise your heel noticeably (1/4"" - you will feel the difference), but the ball and toe not so much. These will make your shoes feel tighter, but it is worth the small annoyance because the extra bounce in your step makes your feet feel better, and possibly your knees and hips if you hate being jolted by harsh impacts.These aren't miracle springs in your shoes (although I have see ad for those - and they sound pretty  cool) but they definitely make a difference if you walk a lot. Of course show manufacturers could simply add some REAL padding and support to the insides of their shoes, but since that will never happen, these ""after market"" inserts do the trick nicely. I am a believer now. I will never get another pair of shoes or boots without grabbing a set of these because my feet are worth the extra ten bucks or whatever these cost.

"Holy crap these things are big.I saw these advertised in jr. high school as a kid (if we sold enough magazines for the school we could get this or a Three Dog Knight album) and I never saw the value in them, coming from Southern California. Amazon asked me to review one, and since I was a kid I have been in MANY cold places. First off, I was surprised how big it is (like a pack of smokes). I seriously thought they were the size of a regular zippo lighter. Unless you have giant sized hands, this should lay flay on your palm and cover the whole of it, and your fingers if you have small hands. It is easy to use, it works like it says, and lasts for hours.You pop the top off and then remove the tiny slide-off burner part, which exposes a hole. Then you pour that lighter fluid that comes in the yellow squeeze bottle with the blue cap into a small plastic bottle that comes with your hand warmer--and fill your handwarmer from that. It is like a measuring cup so that you don't under/over fill your handwarmer and it makes more sense than I want to give it credit for. After that you just make sure the hand warmer stays upright until you light it. It even comes with a little bag/pouch that absorbs the excess naptha (lighter fluid) and keeps the metal from burning your skin.it works well, not super hot, but comfortably warm, for at least 6 hours. the instructions say up to 12 hours, but I am never out in the cold that long at one stretch. I carried it around in my (various) pockets a few times to test it for leaks (naptha burns on the skin, like when you overfill your Zippo) and had not troubles. It doesn't smell very much; I would dare say not at all unless you are really inhaling (kids, don't try this at home--I am a professional product tester :-)It is a handy item. I wish I had known how cool these are years ago; I would have bought two (*not* one for a friend).

"Okay, so here's the straight dope: This is a cool atomizer/vaporizer. This is not a perfumery. It won't make your house smell pretty, and it does not create a strong smell like burning incense. I did not try it with Vicks, so I did not give it the old fashioned vaporizer test, but I did follow the instructions several times. You only put in a few drops of fragrance or essential oil in comparison to the 1/2 cup or so of water, so the scent is very faint. I will try it with much stronger doses next and see if I can break this thing.The gray ring around the middle is actually a light that comes on when this thing is operating. It creates a nice effect; very spa-like. So, I got mine free for testing it out. I like it, but you have to know what it does to know if it is right for you. It runs for about 45 minutes in a real world application. It is so simple that the instructions are almost pointless. My concern is simply that you may not get the level of smell you would with a tea-light candle and a ceramic warmer; but then again, that would mean a LOT less water used. But, it does put out a vast amount of cool steam, so it does exactly what it says. The only scent or medication dispersal that will occur is in direct relation to how potent your blend is. Keeping that in mind, you can vaporize ANY essential oil with this thing, easily and with no mess. ;-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X17DP6H8WSXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9JPYJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2X17DP6H8WSXW","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neoprene pad, but the top surface is different. THAT is what make all the difference.I am not a mousepad kind of guy. They are always too small and my mouse runs off of the edge because I have dual giant screen monitors. It always feels like the standard mousepad was made by stingy people, and the various images don't impress me. I never look at my mousepad; I am looking at the screen. I read a few reviews before agreeing to try this one out and the word on the street was that ""it is large."" It is, in fact> TWICE the size of a normal mousepad. It is my humble opinion that this should be the size of all mousepads.I tested this with my $100 Kensington state of the art ultra mouse that claims not to need a mousepad, but works a LOT better with one, my $80 Logitech m705 (which apparently is now cheap at fifty bucks), and my $120 Logitech ""dark surface"" mouse. ALl of these mice claim they do not need a pad, but they give me problems no matter what surface I use. This pad made **significant improvements** on all three mice. the top surface feels like a teflon skillet; a flexible teflon skillet, but definitely like a smooth surface that has been gently roughed but with sandpaper.

"This is the best cookie sheet I have ever encountered. Technically it is a ""baking mat,"" but I was new to the idea when I first tried it out. I didn't bother to read any instructions. I just tried it out to see if I could break it (I failed). I am attaching images to show how this thing performs. I started my first test with a batch of peanut butter cookies (pictured below). They came out perfect - not burned on the bottom, or even dark at all. The heat distribution was far superior to anything I have ever experienced. I had no idea this was how the pros do it. My greatest surprise was when I pulled my boring old-fashioned ""non-stick"" cookie sheet (and baking mat on top of it) out of the oven and slid the baking mat directly onto the wooden counter. Within seconds it was warm to the touch, but several degrees cooler than the metal cookie sheet that I needed to use an oven mitt on. And, the very best part is that the cookies slid off with no hassle or scraping - and no PAM or oil was used.All in all this is a no brainer. It makes cooking baked goods far more satisfying and easy to clean up. No stick, no fuss, no problems. I was offered mine free to test and review (which I have done) and I am glad to have this product in my kitchen. I will keep the old cookie sheet around as a support platform, but that is really about it. I wish I had know about these things years ago.

"I am seriously in love with this thing. I have bought all kinds of computer headsets: Turtle Beach, some other $100 brand wireless headset, and a few of these cheapie Logitech ones. If you need to have your head covered with giant cans that block out all awareness (and you want to look like an air-traffic controller) then these are not for you; but if you want something that is cheap, buts out a LOT of sound, and people can hear you, this is what you need. It's noise-cancelling function is moderate; but then I am comparing it to a $250 model I bought to REALLY cancel mic noise. For most people is is all you need.Please note: there is no volume control or mute button on this model. For that you want the USB version. This one comes with a 3.5mm jack.I generally **hate** wired headsets, but every cordless headset I spent money on has its own set of problems, from flat out not working (and having to be returned) to the headset turning off automatically after 5 minutes - and then there is the weight issue. Make no mistake - these are exceptionally basic, but they are made by Logitech. I have bought more Logitech products over the past 20 years (speakers, keyboards, mice, speakers, headsets . .  . ) than anyone I know. I trust this company. They make TONS of stuff and they do it on a budget. I got this headset for free from Vine to test and review, but it works just as well as the two I purchased a few months back.P.S.

"Oh my god I love this thing!Okay, so I have been trying my hand at making pizza, but the dough is a problem (not being a professional pizza chef). I don't want to spend $300 on a Kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook, and besides, people have been making bread and pizza by hand since the beginning of time, so why not me? I was offered a chance to get this thing for free if I tested it and posted my findings. Little did they know that I am a complete amateur at monkeying around with dough, so it did not look good for them. So here is what I did and how it worked out:I grabbed an old pizza dough family recipe from a friend and went to town. Unlike my previous experiments I dumped everything into the bag (after letting the yeast ""proof""). That's really it. This comes with two reusable zippy ties (made from silicone) and you just knead everything in the bag. Knead, and knead, and knead. After about twenty minutes of gushing it around in your hands (which was kind of like playing with Play-Do as a kid--so that was fun) I let the bag sit and the dough rises in the bag. I punched the dough down (still inside the bag--this is where you start to appreciate the beauty of this thing) and tossed it in the refrigerator overnight. Today I pulled it out, punched it down and turned the bag inside out.This is the best part. The dough literally peels right off of the bag. I never would have believed it last night. There is literally ""no clean up"" with this thing. No bowls and spatulas to wash off, and zero waste. All of the dough landed on the butcher block and was made into pies. I was skeptical about this (and how hard it was to make bread or pizza). This is a permanent member of the kitchen and there is no way in hell ""BakeitFun"" is getting this thing back. I try to be selective on what I review (I turn down a lot of offers), but this time I scored. This is one of the best kitchen inventions of the 21st century to date.

It is an ""A-list"" quality comic book series. It is set BEFORE Batman is Batman. That sounds dumb, right? But that is the beauty. It is not quite a cop show.

You will see some pre-supervillians, and some *early* Bruce Wayne, but that is all I will tell you. I am buying these ""per episode"" so I seriously like the quality of this show. If you watch the first two episodes you will get the feel of the first two seasons. A *lot* happens, but the feel of the show never changes.

Go here (the official website link) to get the driver for either Mac or Windows (I didn't see anythingf or Chromebook): http://www.tp-link.com/en/download/UE300_V1.htmlOkay, so my story, and why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 (this will apply to most of you). I got this to review and I popped it in my MacBook. Voila! It worked! Just for 30 seconds because my MacBook was nagging me to upgrade to OSX Yosemite ""for free!"" so I did. Well, I inserted this thing again and the little light flashed and blinked, but I had no internet. So I tried it on my PC (Quad core i7 running Win 8.1 - a fairly current machine I think). NOTHING!Grr . . . now I was upset.Well, after about an hour of searching I figured out I had to go to the TP-link website and find the product and look for a driver (that is why the link is above). I downloaded it on my PC and my MacBook. I had to install and restart my computer but now it works perfectly. It is fast - literally as fast as my hardwired connection can go; which is much faster than my wireless (but tat is just simple physics). I love this thing and it is compact and handy. I am VERY upset that they couldn't print that you DO need a driver and WHERE to get the driver in the manual. That is just sloppy. The reason I love it so much though is that the new laptops (like my MacBook don't come with an ethernet port, so without this I can't get ANY internet unless it is wi-fi, which is not always available. This is small and unobtrusive (it is about the size of a large USB thumb drive and the USB plug snaps into the large plastic case (the cable bends in a ""U""), so that is nice. It is an elegant solution to a problem MacBooks have (no ethernet plug). Just make sure you download the driver and go through the ten minute install process. If and when Apple releases yet another Mac OS upgrade I am certain that you will need to hunt down the link to get the new driver and reinstall it, which will be fun, because you will need to get on the internet somehow to get the driver to allow you to connect to the internet. So, like I said, I got this for free to test and review (thanks Vine!) but that didn't mean I would like it. It is amazing (once you get it working). Anyway, hope this helps.

"I was asked to review these, so I accepted a free package and I went to work on my Mustang. I had some problems (below), but the short version is that they work and they are superior to the factory originals I replaced.So here's what happened and what it means to you:I set about replacing the various bulbs illustrated on the back of the blister package (the paper insert inside the preformed plastic case. It shows places these bulbs can be used (dome lights, trunk lights, parking lights, etc). I did not replace the dome light on my Mustang convertible as the plastic lens was difficult to get off and if it broke I would have to go find another one. I had better luck with the license plate lights and the trunk lights however. These fit into the standard sockets very well, but there is some maneuvering (elbow grease) to make them work. During that time the exposed wires can (and did) get bent. This is a small design flaw. You see, the connector wires (you can see one in the Amazon product shot - it is at the opposite end from the white squares (LEDs). are wrapped over the edge but not secured. They bend left and right (like thin wire does) and that makes the bulb not work, or flicker when you are installing it. There are no instructions so I had to figure this out for myself. Straightening them out (to look like they do in the product shot) is easy enough once you know what to do.The factory original bulbs were all glass (even the connector part), and so these look and feel a LOT more durable. The LED here provides a piercing bluish-white light that is much brighter than the incandescent filament the factory bulbs use BUT they are omni-directional. They shine ONE WAY, so you don't get the full pass through ambient light you get from an incandescent bulb. This matters in the trunk, as the LEDs that shine sideways and against the trunk roof do you little good, so you can't count those as ""helping light up your trunk."" In simple terms the bulb is operating at roughly 50% efficiency - so you have to take that into account as to why your trunk will not be much brighter. They work a LOT better as parking lights, where their rear and side facing LEDs can have their lights reflected.Now for the bad part: They do NOT fit as trunk lights. They fit the slot, but they are slightly larger than the factory bulbs, and thus when you try to insert them into the lens cap (after slotting them into the connector where they light up) you won't be able to replace the lens cap (the part you see on the outside of the car - just above your license plate). As a result I broke one of my lens caps for my license plate ""lighting system."" I am paying to review these it seems. Not a huge problem, but don't think that you can make these fit - and lens caps are universal in size on most every car in America, so that means these won't work at all for your car. I would remove another star for this except that they are pretty ingenious and LEDs last a lot longer than filament bulbs. They are a good idea and I would like to see this technology supported so that it can improve.So there you have my results: they work, but they have limitations, and they are too large for certain applications where the automobile manufacturer has only allowed for the exact space taken up by an original bulb. Caveat emptor - thanks for reading this. I hope it helps you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GIM8ALEWFMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAG6RMM#wasThisHelpful","R4GIM8ALEWFMM","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was asked to review this, and when it first arrived I didn't like it. The product images make it look larger than it is. It is the size of a Bush's baked beans can (or a Foster's - if you like). It's not bad - just small. It is great for a kid, or for a mini tent lantern, or something on your way to the outhouse (assuming you are camping). It is extremely light (the light slides into the housing when the lid lowers - so that is all empty space when the lantern is on.Okay, so this thing grew on me after a while. It is bright, but it would be nice if it were brighter. It will light up a 6x6x6 area to a comfortable dim working area, or you can easily read by the light it puts out if the lantern is with 2-3 feet and above you. One thing that would make it a LOT better is if there were a shield, so you could make it directions. It sounds hokey (unless you are camping - and given that it is camouflage painted that is not a stretch), but if you wrap one side of the light in foil it makes a much brighter lantern. The thing is ridiculously easy to operate; you simply lift the lid, or flip up the handles and give them a quick tug. The lantern extends about 5 inches (that is how far the light slides up) and you can adjust how much light you want by raising and lowering the lid (and thus the lantern light bulb) as much, or as little, as you like.It requires 3 AA batteries (double A - not triple A - just in case you are skimming this review), which you insert in the bottom. The thing is moderately durable. It is made of a plastic that feels like tin, so it is not crush proof, but it is somewhat resilient if you drop it (on the floor, or dirt - concrete might be a different story - I didn't throw it against a wall, but I will if any serious buyer needs to know its impact resistance). Oh, and there is a compass on top. It ""works"" (for the most part - it sticks just a little). This is useful if you are lost in the woods but it won't replace a real compass, or one on your phone.All in all for the price it is a good little lantern - just don't be surprised how small it is (about twice the size of a soup can). I think I will keep this in the trunk for a while and see if it is handy there. It is surprisingly dark in a trunk at night when you are rummaging around for something, and this is very bright at short distances. Thanks for reading. Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33KIQOUGAGP05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V97YCLQ#wasThisHelpful","R33KIQOUGAGP05","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are cute in theory, and they do work (the little balls roll along the top of the shower curtain rod to make the curtain slide easier (less tears). But they make me feel like I am showering at a cheap motel. Alright, so I am old (finally!). I am no longer in my 20's, and if I was, the last thing I would care about is bathroom aesthetics. But having a few coins in my pocket to jingle together now I like the idea of actually enjoying the view in my bathroom. I like something that looks cool, and a bit elegant, instead of like a cheap gas station. These would be perfect for any  ""# Motel,"" or ""Motel #."" They were easy to put up and they work, but this is not my cup of tea.By the way, I was given these to review, but only after I politely declined the offer. I warned the company that I like my shower curtain rings (I actually bought an expensive set, and as crazy as that sounds I have never regretted having something really nice in the bathroom, along with a cloth curtain and a cloth shower curtain liner - so maybe this product is outside of my demo). I will boil these clean and donate them. Someone else may appreciate their usefulness. Thanks for reading.

"I was invited to review these at no cost. While I am deeply appreciative for that honor I have a few complaints. The sound is fine and they work, and they are easy to use. Yeah, yeah; the engineers did their job.BUT . . . It is a matter that they just don't fit like they do in the pictures. I have to wonder if they glued these onto model's heads. You see, the issue is with the backstrap part that wraps around your head. It is semi-rigid, like a stiff electrical cord (well, I guess it is an electrical cord). I understand that it was designed that way to help keep it securely on your head, but it does not ""grip your head,"" so that part doesn't quite work, but staying with the stiffness - it is too stiff to allow the ear buds to fit into your ear canals. You end up with a pair of ill-fitting earphones that sound great and look kind of cool, but fall off of your head and keep sitting on the edge of your ear (canal) because of the angle.They come in a nice carrying pouch (it's a soft black clamshell case with a zipper) and a USB charger, but that does not fix the fact that they just don't fit. I blame thee wraparound backstrap thing for being made of the wrong material. It is flexible but like a spring. A spring can stretch but it always snaps back into the same shape. It is not customizable. Neither are these. I know they are inexpensive, but at what cost? The technology is cool, but they need better testing before this leaves the factory. I like reviewing products, but this one should have been reviewed on the factory floor. :-(","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QRNJVH64FECD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUMPF1O#wasThisHelpful","R3QRNJVH64FECD","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so I read the other reviews and rah rah rah they are great. Well, yes, they are, but I would like to add some real meat to this discussion. So, I was approached by LG to review these and I really had to think of how I could possibly TEST these things before I said yes. Lucky for me I am smart (or just lucky). Here's what I did:I took my credit and ATM cards and diver's license and slipped them into the smaller cases and headed to Starbucks, 7-11, and Burger King. In fact I went to as many places with ""swipe and pay"" or ""tap (your card) and pay"" or ""wave your card in this general direction and we will happily take money out of your bank account."" The whole point of this is to protect your new ""RFID chip imbued"" cards from hacking. Think of it like a lead sleeve. In fact it looks like a browning envelope you might put a wafer thin . . . er . .  wafer (I suppose) into a microwave. If you have ever made a pot pie or a frozen pizza in a microwave you have seen the silvery lining inside the cardboard box your microwaveable food comes in. It is what ""crisps"" your food. This looks exactly like that on the inside: a cardboard foil sleeve essentially.I don't know the technology, but it certainly blocked any RFID signals, as I was unable to pay for anything with any of my cards when they were inside the sleeve. I had to physically remove the card from the sleeve and then suddenly my wallet felt instantly lighter. Come to think of it, this and some scotch tape could be a great way to start saving money. Just tape your cards in these things. So, all in all, the technology works. These are really lightweight, and relatively convenient. Now, there is the caveat that you have to actually slide your card out of the little cardboard foil envelope every time you want to use it, but this is the price we pay for having ""tap and pay"" or ""wave and pay"" technology and at the same time protect ourselves form having our cards hacked. I can't speak for the passport, but as it works the same way (it's just a larger sleeve) then I am confident it is just as effective. Not exactly sexy, but safety never is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGF7KSDNPIZOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT2S3P6#wasThisHelpful","RGF7KSDNPIZOG","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mediabridge asked me if I wanted to review this. I said yes, as I have just joined a gym and carrying around my iPhone 6+ is kind of a PitA. So, pros and cons:I really like the 2"" wide velcro strap. It is a lot more comfortable and stable than I had thought it would be. It is super-high quality velcro, and not scratchy at all. I read where another reviewer said that it collected fuzzies. Well,that is true of all velcro. The alternative is to get a leather strap with a belt buckle. Personally, I like this option. It is easy to adjust if you tighten it too much, or put it on too loosely. It did fit my bicep nicely, but if you have really skinny arms, or ""26 inch pythons!"" you will probably need to make some manual adjustments to this product to make it fit you. If you are in the majority middle however you should be just fine.This thing is a lot more stable than I had imagined. It really didn't look like it would stay pressed up against my arm from the product shots, but here is where that wide velcro armband really comes into play. Well, that and the rubber backing of the case for your phone sticks to your skin a bit as well, so this thing doesn't move around a lot. The controls are all covered (volume buttons, screen on/off button, and even the big round button on the front of your iPhone is now a raised rubber M. This means no camera usage and no selfies, but how could you do any of that when it is on your arm? This thing is designed to be slipped into and out of at the gym, or whenever you are getting ready to run/exercise/work in the garden for a length of time.. . . Which brings us to the cons: Well, this means that you have to take your iPhone out of your OTHER case, and then put THAT CASE somewhere while you are exercising (or whatever). If this is not a PitA then you are in good shape. For example, if you were to be running a half marathon, or skiing, and wanted to listen to music all day this would be great. It is just enough of a hassle that you don't want to have to do this every day. Also, as far as water protection, think of it as sweat-proof but not waterproof. If you are wearing this on your arm presumably sweat will roll down (thanks to gravity). the speaker, lighting plug, and headphone jack are not covered at all, so this case is not even ""water resistant,"" but you should be able to work out in it doing anything BUT swimming and be fine. I was.Ultimately, this is like a condom for your phone. It is a soft piece of form-fitting rubber that slips on easily enough and holds your phone in place remarkably well. It is not rocket science, and it is not a miracle product. This is *all it does* and if that is enough then you will get great value out of it, but it is not something most people will ever keep their phone in on a regular basis, mostly because it is hard to work the controls on the screen when your phone is on your arm. This is a ""one-purpose"" product. It does that purpose well, but other than that it has limited value. Anywa, hope this helps. Thanks for reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2998DWZHREKFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RXT7XN8#wasThisHelpful","R2998DWZHREKFG","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was asked to review this. Just so you know, I got it for free, but that never influences my review.So, how did it work?Well, just in case this is not completely obvious, let's step back a moment and think about what a ""selfie-stick"" really is.It's nothing more than a glorified monopod (mono - versus tripod). Monopods have been around forever. Usually you will see some sound guy holding a microphone on a giant stick (or ""monopod"") just overhead of an actor, out of frame of a camera. The idea of the ""selfie stick"" is to attache a small camera to a monopod. So really, the question is whether this is a halfway decent monopod (with a camera attachment on it).As a monopod it is okay. It does its job, and it is easy to use. It is VERY light duty (even for a selfie stick) so you do have to be careful with it or you will bend or snap it, so only 3 stars there. That said, the cell phone holder attachment at the end is industry standard, and it works well, holds your phone ion place firmly, and accommodates anything smaller than a phablet. I used an iPhone 6+ which was also inside a battery charging half-clam case, so I tested the limits of how much this selfie stick could handle weight and size wise. It held up well (as it should), so no points deducted there.Where I really fell in ""serious like"" with it was the ease of bluetooth connectivity. I didn't ""rtfm"" and so I had no idea what the button was supposed to do. I thought it was a remote to move the camera around. It turns out that whatever you have your phone set for it will act like a remote. For example: I charged up the selfie stick by plugging it into the computer for a bit. Later I came back and pushed the button and looked at the settings on my iPhone. It shows up as ""Winnersun"" on your phone by the way. I hit the button on the selfie stick and some music on myPhone started to play. I hit the button again and the music stopped. This made me think, so I turned on the camera app and hit the selfie stick button again. It snapped a picture. I switched to video and hit the selfie stick button. It started recording. I hit the selfie stick button again and it stopped. This made sense.The device is pretty stupid (non-intuitive - not ""it is bad""), but that is okay. You just have to be 2% smarter than the tool you are using. As long as you set up your phone to be ready to snap a picture or start recording, this selfie stick will do its job perfectly. As a bonus, you can use it as a remote for your phone for a number of things (like playing music it turns out). So, all in all, yes, it will hold your phone in place, it does fit in your pocket (if you have baggy pants - it was weird trying to walk around with this in my jeans pocket, although I did get some nice compliments). For the price it is a good value. The plastic grip on it is durable and easy to clean, and the hand loop (not shown in product shots) is nice to make sure you don't drop it - and your phone. What makes this is the bluetooth remote. I was given the black topped model and I have to say it looks pretty cool. This will be going in my gig bag. You don't have to just shoot selfies with it. Think of it as a 3' extension of your arm that you can use to film hard to get spots. THAT is why I give it 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31U4O8K3R406F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0PTMVG#wasThisHelpful","R31U4O8K3R406F","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When ZVOLTZ contacted me and said ""Hey! Do you want to review this?"" I thought to myself ""I just reviewed an identical product that cost twice as much. This has to be crap. There is no way they can sell the same exact thing for half the price."" But I said yes anyway (I really wanted to compare these). So here's the poop:It is ridiculously inexpensive for what it does. So that is nice. But I did some comparisons to other, even cheaper, options and saw the tiny differences, like no LED lights and a less user-friendly composition. This thing is spot-on exact to the more expensive brand name models. I seriously believe the manufacturer makes them and simply silk screens each company's name on the back. The LEDs on the back are bright and easy to see, and they light up as it charges. If you want to see how much battery power is in your ZVOLTZ ""external battery/charger"" you simply quick press the button on the back. That is the same button you press to turn it on to charge your iPhone.Mind you, if you do NOT push the power button after snapping your iPhone into this thing it won't charge ""automatically."" You have to press the button, and then it will charge until your iPhone is completely charged, and then it shuts off automatically. If you want to charge your iPhone more (after using it for a while ) you press the button. It's pretty simple in that respect.Here is a HUGE ISSUE you must know: This works with an iPhone, so it has a built in lightning plug, but to charge your ZVOLTZ (battery/charger) you have to have a micro USB cable (which is PC or Chrome - and NOT Mac). This thing does come with a cable (USB 2 on one end, micro USB on the other), but if you misplace or forget it and think ""iPhone, right? I can just use my lightning plug to charge my ZVOLTZ"" you will bee angry, frustrated, and disappointed. You need to remember this because it is counter-intuitive and may cause problems.So, how long does it last? This charges my iPhone 1.25 times from dead, and if I charge my iPhone through my ZVOLTZ (so they are both charged 100%) I can squeeze about 250% of my iPhone's normal duration, or 1 normal iPhone charge and an extra 1.5 charge delivered from the ZVOLTZ.. This means that for the hassle of charging once you get a LOT more ""in the field"" iPhone usage. This makes a huge difference with the crappy iPhone batteries.The downside if that you really need to keep your phone in this thing at all times. It is not that large really.It makes your iPhone thicker and larger, but that is the point of a protective case. This is really Otterbox or Ballistic (premium brands) level protection ""plus you get an extra battery."" If you have an iPhone 6+ you know how much bigger it is than a 4 or a 5, so an extra cm or two should not matter much. But if you are a priss like me an love your TwelveSouth ""BookBook"" leather case that makes your iPhone look like an old leather book then you have some serious choices to make. Style or battery. This thing rates a 5 on style (compared to a solid 8 for the BookBook) so there is that. I make a big deal ot of this as I have found out the hard way what happens when you try to swap cases too much with this style of battery pack (no matter what brand you buy). The top or front part of the case snaps off (this is no easy task by the way) and you have to SLIDE your iPhone out, not LIFT it out, or the built-in lightning plug will snap off and you just wasted money on a battery case. Prognosis: if you get this thing leave it plugged in at all times.Is it waterproof? Meh. More than NOT having your iPhone in it, but I would not drop it in the toilet to find out. The speaker holes are ""okay,"" but they point up (at you) instead of down the bottom of the iPhone so they give the illusion of a slightly fuller, richer sound and tiny increase in volume. All in all I really like this thing. It feels good in your hands and is relatively non-slip. Just make sure you like it, because you won't want to take your iPhone out of it: that is a hassle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5P3NAMP06R7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S01L348#wasThisHelpful","R2L5P3NAMP06R7","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid cable, but it does have dome drawbacks. Disclaimer: I like Mediabridge products, because of all of the money I have spent on them, none has ever disappointed me. Coincidentally I was offered to test this for free, and I did. I am a bit disappointed, but not horribly so.So, we have a ten foot cable. That right there is worth 5 stars. Apple will NEVER make a ten foot cable. You would never think you need one until you get tired of jerking the tiny ones out of your Mac/i(Thing)/wall adapter. This is really handy when you need to run some cable a ways and you don't to have to use generic USB extenders (3' male to female extension cables). It is twice as thick as the ones Apple makes, which I like for durability, but according to the specs, this allows you to run a lot more wattage (means you can charge more - longer; the cable won't fry or melt).So basic usage: It has a standard USB (2) to lightning plug design. ""Meh."" They could have gone USB3 as long as they have a lightning plug and a thicker wire core, right? That would have allowed more ""speed"" of data transfer. Oh well, it is an inexpensive plug. I am disappointed, but not mortified. Next we have the color. I have to address this. Not to be a snob, but if you buy a Macbook, and/or an iPhone and/or an iPad and/or an iPod (omg! I just realized I might have too many Apple products!) you expect your cables to be white. It is an Apple thing. Apple = white cables. maybe someday they will come in cool rainbow colors, but until that day white cables screams out ""Mac cool."" The ones they sent me to test and review are battleship gray. Yes, gray like the Death Star, or like an average day in Seattle. It's kind of depressing really. I know this does not affect the function of the cables, but you have to be seen in public with these. If they offer these in white be sure to specify. The ones in the product picture are black.Now we get to what is seriously wrong with this cable. Sorry Mediabridge: ""I love you man,"" but that lightning plug end is purposefully fattened up (for extra strength?) and that makes it completely useless when you are trying to charge your Apple product and your i(thing) is in a case you bought to protect it. This may seem like a small inconvenience until you have to deal with it and the only fix is to go on Amazon and buy a NEW cable, wait 2-5 days and then resume normal operation, or get in your car and drive around looking for a long cable that has an Apple-standard connector.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R238Y4G38AGGCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS1JZDS#wasThisHelpful","R238Y4G38AGGCS","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a few Bluetooth speakers. I think I was the last person on the planet to see the value of a Bluetooth speaker, but i have quickly become a connoisseur of these little devices. I prefer ones that are mid-range in price, and on the higher end of the quality (for price) spectrum. The idea of spending several hundred dollars (or more) for a tiny speaker I can take everywhere with me is just stupid. So, when I was asked to do a review of this I looked it over and said, ""why not?"" I have a feel for these now, after having bought several. I know what I like and what I like is ease of use, great sound, and a long battery life. Waterproof or water resistant properties are a bonus. So, why this speaker - and is it worth paying for?To be fair, I compared this particular speaker to my iHome speakers (two popular models) and one a friend sent me that looks like an octopus, as well as a rather large one the size of a football. This one outperformed them all. I have never heard of this company, and the fact that the big promo on Amazon is ""Bluetooth"" and not a brand name makes me think of my 42"" Hisense computer monitor. I bought that at Walmart for half the price of any name brand. It works, but for the price I would not cry if it didn't. The same thing applies here. This is a GOOD LOOKING speaker. The blue ring does not light up by the way - it just looks like it does in the picture. I have added my own ""real life"" pix below.So, the sound is great, but what is really cool is that you don't drain your iPhone's (or Android phone's) battery whilst blasting your music. It draws from the speaker, so your phone lasts a LOT longer.All you are sending from your phone is the standard wireless (""Bluetooth"") signal, so it is a low, steady draw of power. The battery (in the speaker) does all of the hard work. Not shown in the Amazon product pic is the GIGANTIC suction cup. At first this really pissed me off. I thought the suction cup looked dopey and cheesy. Well, then I tried using it and that thing is made of superglue. A tiny bit of moisture on a smooth surface (like tile, or glass, or your car) and that suction cup will hold up in a hurricane. It is a PitA to get it off of whatever you stick it to - which is the point of a good suction cup.The buttons are easy enough to figure out, and it is kind of cool to be able to raise and lower volume, pause, stop, fast forward and reverse, all without having to grab your phone. The speaker is great but the voice recognition of the unit is about 70% of where it should be: it will never replace your phone's microphone.Prognosis? This is a keeper. For the price I would put this as top of class. It charges quickly and is easy to use and remarkably water resistant (do not soak it). Great for rainy days, boats, bathrooms, or kitchens, as an external speaker. It is no Bose, but it is perfect as an additional speaker. You can always use it as an extra ""hidden speaker"" to complete your sound system as well. Anyway, thanks for reading - hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXPONNLZB935/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N69MYU6#wasThisHelpful","RDXPONNLZB935","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grr!!Stupid Windows!I swear, I have been through this twice now. I ""think"" this is working, but the Bluetooth technology can't be seen by Windows (8.1 i7 Quad core). I look online for help and get nothing. I am DONE with this. The tiny blue light works, so I know this thing is on, and ""occasionally"" I can get one of my Bluetooth headsets to work when this is plugged in. But other than that it is pretty useless. Until this comes with a manual I will say ""stay away from it entirely.""

"I have read some of the other reviews about this product so I will try to avoid repeating the same old information you will find elsewhere. I got this to try out free from Amazon in exchange for a review. What Amazon didn't know was that i would ask this product to do the impossible (and why not?)I bought a 100 year old set of (leather) saddlebags on eBay. It sounded like a good idea at the time. Well, they arrived and they were stiffer than old shoe leather. I had made a huge mistake and needed a ""miracle cure"" to bring the leather back to life. I had read all about mink oil (the yeses and the no's on whether to trust it or not), and I have some Leather Honey(tm) on hand. I decided I would give THIS product a try and even called the company.So, points for them answering the phone and helping me. I told them what I was attempting and asked them specifically for detailed instructions to get the best results. Sadly, after several treatments, and a LOT of soaking the bags in this stuff in ideal conditions I saw almost no change at all. Here is what happened. First, the smell is pretty strange - but the company is ""The Chemical Guys"" so that should not be a surprise. They are trying to invent a leather miracle-worker in a lab; of course it is going to smell like the inside of a plastic factory. To me, that was an acceptable nuisance if it did what I needed it to. The first coat soaked right into the leather within 15 minutes. Other than that I noticed no difference (except the smell).I coated the leather a few more times over a few weeks (which is why this review is so late) and if I used my imagination I could pretend I was seeing results. This product will NOT restore old dried out leather (note: this leather was slightly flexible and not brittle, flaky, or falling apart - just very very dry). I did try it out on my Docs though and it seemed to help a little (they are not dried out and 100 years old). Compared to other leather products I have used in the past I can't say this one is any better or worse. I don't care if you gave me a lifetime supply of this. I just don't see how it can help (or hurt). I would give it two stars, but the customer service is above top notch. I didn't talk to some shared customer service drone in a call-center. I spoke to someone who knew he product inside and out (maybe it was one of the Chemical Guys!) but I never asked what he did there. It pains me to write such a scathing review seeing how eager he was to help me succeed, but the stuff just doesn't seem to do a whole lot more than any quality oil or leather treatment would.I want to know what results other people are getting and how they can prove it. I should have seen SOME difference, some noticeable effect, but after weeks of trying all I ended up with was a smelly leather bag that was just as dry as when I got it from eBay. My Docs - well they are new and stiff (like Docs are) and this stuff did not soften them up much at all - if at all. I will keep trying this stuff (as I still have half of a bottle - this stuff does seem to go a long way). If I end up succeeding with an amazing breakthrough I will certainly amend my review. As for now, I just cannot recommend this particular product. The company? Yes. Thanks for reading. I hope your experiences are better than mine have been to date.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNM0F0KO8UEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FALVXLY#wasThisHelpful","R1LNM0F0KO8UEE","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great light-weight yoga mat bag with adjustable strap because it really thoughtfully addresses the needs of the practitioner. Here is what really stands out:(1)  Side loading zippered bag so it is easy to pull out and put the yoga mat especially when I am in a rush;(2)  Tabbed zipper makes it easy to open/close the bag when I am in a rush;(3)  The bag is sufficiently wide enough for the thick and longer Manduka mat;(4)  Vents in the bag are great to minimize a smelly mat;(5)  I like the lined interior so I can wipe it down if necessary;(6)  Two extra storage from the zipped interior and exterior pockets;The zipped interior webbed pocket is great for keys, wallet, and cell phoneThe zipped exterior pocket is great for frequently reached objects, such as yoga gloves, skidless towel, or yoga strapBut . . . to improve on an already awesome bag, recommendations:(1)  replace the strap connector to the bag from plastic to metal for higher durability;(2)  make the exterior material waterproof or line the interior of the exterior pocket to minimize the water intrusion when carrying the bag in the rain;(3)  confirm if the bag is machine washable; and(4)  have two zippers because in my experience a long zipper invariably breaks then I can no longer close the bag.All in all it is a great bag for the price.

"I was asked to review this, along with the company's other creations. I got them free, but I like complaining, so they don't get any special treatment from me. That said, these are GREAT - but only if you have an actual use for them (see below). Otherwise they are a waste of money.You can make anything in these: jello, jello shots, ice, candy, chocolate chunks, square cakes, ice cream, sorbet, and pretty much anything else you need to freeze or bake in a mold. What makes this special is how easy it makes to create square blocks, which are extremely useful for creating artistic shapes (ice cream cakes, cake castles, Jello pyramids, etc). This is more a tool for the professional food artist than something you would have hanging around the house.

"Yea yeah, I got these free . . . so, how do they work?Well, before I address that I have to say that the reviews for this product are hilarious. The vendor does have to set the price, but they seem to still be in testing phase. Okay, yes there is a (gentle) learning curve to these. First, use good water. Forget that stuff from the tap. Purify your water or use distilled. Also, watch the temperature you use, and the temperature of the molds while you are pouring, and even the temperature of your freezer. All of these factor into how quickly your particular ice cubes will freeze, which in turns creates various amounts of cloudiness or bubbles. No, you CAN'T see the fill line, but if you use a measuring cup you will never make a mistake, so that problem is easily solved.For best results, use Kool-Aid, or similar colored punch flavored creations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFEWE5MQN4IAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEF176O#wasThisHelpful","RFEWE5MQN4IAA","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, I like it. But there are some caveats. The lines on this thing don't etch very deep into your ice, candy, or chocolate, so it is more of a special occasion thing to be combined with other obviously Star Wars themed items, than something fun and exciting on its own. I got this free to review. As I said, I like it, but I don't ""love"" it. Silicone molds for ice cubes are a PitA. I know this, as I have years of silicone mold experience making soaps, candies, and candles professionally. After reading other reviews I see what they did wrong. First, never run hot water over a cold silicone mold. You run the risk of damaging your mold and its contents. For best results you really need to use cola or tea, ice coffee, or some other dark liquid (hmmm... like chocolate) to really get the best results. Also, don't remove the mold from the freezer (or refrigerator) depending on your technique and what you are making, until you are ready to serve. If you are working with ice I strongly recommend that you pull this out from the freezer several minutes before, and then popping it in the fridge to defrost in a more controlled environment. You want the mold to warm up, not the contents inside. Silicone molds require patience - there is no substitute for that. When you take that into account, this is a pretty cool one. Thanks for reading. Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6BEYQCIFQRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEEGC8S#wasThisHelpful","R2C6BEYQCIFQRP","A14XUCN5OC998O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14XUCN5OC998O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a chance to review these. They didn't have to ask me twice. These are super cool. They are silicone cups (well duh . . .) and they are easy to use and even easier to clean. The fun colors mean that you can pour the batter in them, toss them in the oven, and serve them. Why? Save money, save time, and make it fun to grab your creations. I am not sure what else I can add, as there are already so many reviews, but even though I got these free for examination, I really like them. They are dishwasher safe, or you can soak them a bit before hand-washing them.

"I bought this b/c all the sauces I made from roux came out gritty and saw online that it was bc the cheese proteins would curdle if I was heating it too quickly or unevenly.  Great, so cheese sauce is out of my reach unless I use Velveeta?  (Not an option for us, since Velveeta is not kosher.)  But wait, what's this?  A cheat?  A cheese sauce hack?  Sodium citrate?Wow, I cannot believe how magically it works!  Added 2 teaspoons of this stuff to a cup of skim milk (which makes the milk turn clear, very interesting), bring to a simmer, mix in 4 cups of cheese slowly (I used an immersion blender to break it up quickly), and TA DA!  the most amazing cheese sauce and mac and cheese you will ever taste.  It tastes so intensely cheesy, so smooth and creamy, I cannot believe it took me so long to find this stuff.  I'm gonna put this stuff all over steamed veggies, baked potatoes, nachos.

"I'm a huge fan of the Dr. Brown's glass bottles.  It's the only brand of glass baby bottle that I've been able to find commonly in stores.  We started out with about 10 of the 4oz glass bottles, but are now down to only 3 after about a year's use, thanks to slippery fingers during washing.  I came back to purchase 3 more of the 8 oz. bottles and have found that they've held up really well, despite being larger in size and therefore more susceptible to breakage when dropping them.  We've had a few roll off the desk and hit the floor, but no breaks or cracks so far.  These are awesome for us b/c our son will only drink milk very warm (yep, we couldn't break him of that habit).  So, I felt much better heating up glass bottles in a thermos full of hot water rather than plastic, even the BPA free ones.My only criticism is that I wish that the nipples on the 8 oz bottles were level 3 or 4.  Instead, they came with level 1 nipples and I had to purchase Level 4 separately.  If a baby is ready to drink from an 8 oz bottle, it seems likely to me that they've graduated beyond the level 1 or 2 bottle nipples.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ET1I9YJOD3M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WPUMXE#wasThisHelpful","R1ET1I9YJOD3M4","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We bought the ""AB Gold"" colored one for the irridescent rainbow stones.  It looks so much like the tiara from the Disney movie Tangled, which is why I was purchasing for my daughter.  I was very surprised by how small it was when it came.  It's not going to fit across your entire head like a typical headpiece, but designed more to fit into a top knot or top bun type hairstyle.  My daughter still loved it and the bonus was that its size makes it similar to Elsa's crown in Disney's Frozen movie, so she's using it for dual princess purposes.  :)I was a bit disappointed when I saw one of the larger stones come loose and get knocked out of place with only gentle play.  I was able to re-affix it by bending the prongs back into place, but I would have preferred something more durable for the price.Please let me know if you have any questions or if you found this review helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAW9F2RCFWIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXZFHGG#wasThisHelpful","R1IAW9F2RCFWIS","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ever since having a baby, sunscreens have had to go through the Environmental Working Group (EWG) rating system before I will put it on my kid.  Given that every sunburn that a child has increases the chances of skin cancer later in life (five sunburns during your entire lifetime will double the chances at melanoma per the Skin Cancer Foundation), a well working sunscreen is a must.  But if you have a baby, you know that you also want something that rubs on quickly and smoothly for those squirmy bodies who don't sit still and something that doesn't have a lot of unhealthy added ingredients.MelanSol rubs on without leaving a thick white film on the skin surface, something that I've had difficulty finding in the sunscreens that the EWG rates highly.  The EWG actually rates this as a 2 (Low Hazard) on a scale of 1-10 and recommends the sunscreen.  It is BPA, phthalate, gluten, and paraben free.  It provides broad spectrum protection (UVA and UVB).  At the time of this writing, though, it is snowing in April (boo!) and I haven't had opportunity to truly test the product to see whether my fair-skinned son will redden under harsh conditions.My biggest beef with the product is the price.  At around twenty bucks, it's pretty comparable to my previous go-to for the kids, KINeSYS Spray-On Sunscreen.  But I prefer a cream to a spray for when we will be exposed to the sun all day at the pool or beach.  The spray works awesome for every day, quick coverage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PC3XHZOMZWOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0CVAY6#wasThisHelpful","R3PC3XHZOMZWOT","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an 8 year old who still has a bit of chubby baby belly so I ordered this jacket in a size 10/12.  Although the sleeves are, as expected, long for her, the trench fits just snugly around her waist.  So, I wouldn't recommend this if you have a husky child.  But I'm still very pleased with the quality of the material, especially since the price was such a bargain.  The trench is lined, so it provides some protection from cool weather on spring or fall days.  And I was surprised when the trench came that the fabric is actually quite waterproof.  The hood is detachable and the bottom of the trench hits my daughter just above mid-thigh.

I really like the design; I'd like to see it made in a knitted fabric.  It might look a little less tacky.  Bought this on the word of another reviewer who said it made any dress red-carpet ready.

"I actually already own the Perky-Pet 2-in-1 Wild Bird Feeder which didn't fare the elements too well last year as the copper finish not only began to tarnish quickly, but one of the ports actually corroded completely away during storage in our shed over the winter.So, when this Perky-Pet Seed Bunker feeder showed up, I was very pleased to see that for only a slightly elevated cost, the material on this feeder is of much sturdier quality.  This means that the feeder is pretty heavy and the metal is extraordinarily durable.  In fact, a number of the hoods and perches came knocked out of place during shipping.  (Amazon's usually amazing service for some reason did a lousy job with packing this item for shipment.)  But the perches and hoods were not damaged or bent despite what was probably a turbulent journey and they were easily snapped back into place.  I've only had it for a month, but my guess is that the quality material will probably fare a lot better and longer than my other bird feeder which is mostly made of thin plastic.For what it is primarily designed to do, it does it just fine.  It's easy to fill with bird seed and it attracted a variety of beautiful birds the very first day.However, it is not squirrel proof.I actually filled both feeders and suspended this one from a tree using a metal hook and the other from a shepherd's hook.  I noticed the very first day that half the seed was gone, very quickly.  Suspicious that a squirrel was getting into them, I swapped the two feeders, thinking that perhaps the lack of a plate on the bottom of this Seed Bunker feeder would make it harder for the squirrel to get a grip onto the feeder from the shepherd's hook.  A few hours later, I saw that much of the seed was gone already.  And then an hour after that, I caught the culprit in the act.  The squirrel was able to climb right up the shepherd's crook and then held himself upside down while raiding the Seed Bunker.  It did the exact same thing with the other bird feeder by climbing the tree and scooting himself upside down the metal hook.  At this point, I'm pretty convinced that very little will deter squirrels from the bird feeders, not even those fancy ones which have the collapsible perches (designed to collapse at the heavy weight of a squirrel, but not a bird) since the squirrel made no use of the perches at all when he was lowering himself onto the feeders from above.It should be noted that Perky Pet does market a number of wild bird feeders that are specifically targeted for problem squirrels here, here, and here among several others, but even those are of limited effectiveness against a determined squirrel.  (Which is what we've got.  Those little buggers have completely chewed through several thick plastic trash can lids of ours.)  Squirrels can chew through plastic parts of so-called squirrel-proof bird feeders.  And even if the feeder is completely made of metal (which this Seed Bunker feeder is not, as the viewing windows are very thin plastic), the squirrels can learn to shake the feeder and spill the seed onto the ground.  There are a few feeders that seem to fare better at warding off squirrels than the ones from Perky-Pet, but they tend to be in the next price range up and still not 100% effective for everyone.Our current hope, since we don't contemplate spending more money on bird feeders, is that greasing the pole and hook with ample amounts of vaseline will keep the squirrels away and perhaps make for some funny videos if we see them slipping off.  We will see if that does the trick and I'll come back here and update.  I guess, meanwhile, the silver lining in all this is that now that the squirrels have all this bird seed, they're sorta leaving my trash cans alone.  The other silver lining is that my kids have a good reason to scream ""Those Darn Squirrels!"" whenever they see the thieves raiding the feeders.If you found this review helpful or if you have any questions, please let me know.

"My son suffers from chronic eczema and dry skin.  We've tried a lot of combinations and for spot treatment, this product works incredibly well.  There was a short time awhile back that following an allergic reaction, he was left with patches of eczema, so we tried to rub some baby oil on it.  Turns out he was allergic to the baby oil (who knew?) and his skin turned into a full flared attack of scaly dragon skin.  It took weeks to go away.  We tried this Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Instant Therapy on it alone, and it helped moisturize the area, but didn't seem to make a major dent by morning.  Eventually, we figured out that rubbing him all over with Aveeno Baby Eczema lotion after a bath and then sealing it in with a petroleum base like Vaseline or Aquaphor did the best at eliminating the scales and covering him with footed PJs.  But this system wouldn't work on exposed areas, like his face or hands, where we didn't want the petroleum to be smeared all over the bedsheets or the furniture.  This is where the Eucerin Instant Therapy ended up being a blessing.  It is as lightweight as a lotion, spread easily, had no smell, and was easy to apply to a squirmy baby.  This was important since it took more frequent applications to help eliminate the dry skin.  We applied twice a day and it took a few days, but cleared up nicely.  We hadn't had such nice results using Aquaphor, baby lotion, or even the expensive Stelatopia alone.  We did get similar results, however, when we used Triple Cream.Something else that we've seen work for the absolute worst cases of eczema are bleach baths taken once or twice a week.  Add one half cup of chlorine bleach to a whole bathtub of warm water.  Watch out that the water doesn't get into child's eyes or mouth.  It seems to help with eliminating some of the bacteria or microbes on the skin that can cause inflammation.  All in all, I'd say this is a good product and worth a try in your arsenal for eczema treatment.  All babies/children seem to react differently; the skin is actually the largest organ in our bodies and an integral part to the immune system, so what works for one child may not necessarily work for another.Good luck.

"At this point in my parenting career, I am seasoned enough to know what I want out of a stroller.  I've owned a lot of other strollers and tried out a few of my friends.  I started with the close to high end Valco Baby Tri-Mode when my friends were pushing their expensive Bugaboos.  I used a Britax Chaperone for awhile before deciding it was way too bulky to pull in and out of the car and had wheels that constantly fell off.  I tried going the minimalist route with the Contours Lite Stroller but it was so light, it kept falling over when I weighed it down with my diaper bag, purse, or shopping bags.But I'm excited about the Graco FastAction Fold Sport stroller.  It combines a lot of what I like about the other strollers:  maneuvers easily even with a heavy child; cup holders and storage aplenty, and easy to move in and out of the car.  It's not a perfect system, nothing ever is, but it hits that sweet spot of portability with user-friendliness so well that I'm getting rid of the other strollers.Specs:  Stroller weighs 21.47 lbs; is 42"" high; and 24.5"" wide at the widest (back wheels).  It is convertible to a 3 or 5 point harness and will hold a child up to 50 lbs.  (However, I had my 8 year old who is pushing 70 lbs sit in it, and I could still push it easily around the house.)Pros:1.  Value/Affordability -- Given the wide range of price-points for strollers out there, the Graco FastAction Fold Sport comes in on the lower end, without dropping into the cheapie umbrella stroller prices.2.  This stroller enables you to just snap a carseat into it to connect a carseat.  There are two flaps that can be unsnapped and opened to give the carseat a resting mount.  This feature allows parents to replace the SnugRider or Snap-N-Go.  (Though I think that if you can afford it, it's still worthwhile to hold onto a snugrider type stroller frame since it is so lightweight and much easier to use for infants still in carseats.)3.  One handed fold and lock.  That's the whole schtick behind the stroller, right?  You just pull a little strap hidden in the seat, pull, and the entire stroller folds and locks into place.  It's actually the exact same system used in my more expensive Britax Chaperone stroller.4.  There's a very simple system of locking for the swivel wheel, brakes, and the food tray.  Some may say it's pretty primitive.  But I've seen with my other strollers is that the complex locking mechanism or reclines, pneumatic wheel systems, and press button tray removals end up catching or failing somewhere.  And then, you've got a more complicated problem to fix than when a primitive system breaks.5.  There's a simple drawstring method for adjusting the seat back to recline, with a drawstring stay to keep it in place.  The strings don't adjust as smoothly as I'd like for my light sleeper not to notice, but I suspect it will become smoother over time as the strings are used.  I also don't like the flimsy feel of the plastic drawstring stay, but most people don't a the wrecking ball of a toddler like I do.6.  The canopy is arched and provide ample shade for even the tallest of children.  There's a zippered hood for extra coverage when the sun is coming in at the child horizontally or you want to cover them up while they're sleeping.  There's also a mesh viewing window to look in and provide ventilation while the canopy is closed.7.  The storage basket is ample and you can open up the velcro to reveal a second, smaller compartment separated from the other by a mesh.  This allows you to put stuff, like a sippy cup, keys, or some other item that you wouldn't want to rolling around and become lost among the coats, bags, and other mess of the larger compartment.8.  Two cup holders each for both baby and adult.  Love this.  I have an older child who also wants her water bottle in easy access when I go on walks with them and she hates the strollers that only have one cupholder.9.  Most importantly, the stroller has great maneuverability, turns on a dime and glides over the floor.  It does really well on the sidewalks of our Baltimore neighborhood which is full of cracks and uneven cement (thanks, Baltimore City government).  The back axle and basket are pretty low to the ground (trade off for more storage space), which makes pushing the stroller down stairs a bit tricky, but still very doable.  The sport stroller is a lot easier to push than the regular four wheeled Graco travel systems and is a good alternative for people who do a lot of walking with the stroller.10.  The assembly was quick and easy and I was able to do it in 10 minutes out of the box.Cons:1.  It's not quite as compact or light as an umbrella stroller.  You shouldn't expect it to be; it *is* a sport stroller.  But then again, it's not a jogging stroller and doesn't have huge wheels, so it's not going to do rough terrain that well either.  But for most users, it will meet their needs just fine.  It should be noted that Graco does have a FastAction Fold Jogging Stroller that has the air-filled tires for those who really want a jogger and it's similarly priced as this stroller.  But, mind you, it also is a good 9 lbs heavier than this sport stroller.2.  There's no easy way to remove and wash the padding or straps.  Most strollers don't really have an easy way to do this, but the Graco FastAction Fold Sport also has lots of holes and crevices (not to mention that folding strap hidden away in a pocket in the seat) that allows for cereal, snacks, and gunk to get caught in it.  Not to mention that if you've ever had a child vomit or explode out of a diaper in a stroller, the fewer slots to clean, the better.  At least the stroller has an easy to wipe down fabric.3.  The folding mechanism of the stroller is internal and not easily fixable if it goes bad.  I found that out with the Britax Chaperone, which as I said previously, has the same folding mechanism.  It started catching more and more frequently and just had difficulty in folding.  Then, after awhile, I had to only use the stroller while it was open and no longer had the option of folding it any longer.4.  Once the stroller is in the folded and locked position, it's not quite as compact as the photo would have you believe.  One you set it on the ground, it opens a little bit more (maybe another 1-2 cm).  Also, there's no easy way to push it once it's in the folded position.  (My Britax stroller would still allow you to push the stroller on its wheels towards the trunk of your car.  The Valco and the Bugaboo, once folded, couldn't be pushed either and had to be lifted into place.)  This Graco stroller could theoretically be pushed on its wheels, but the handlebar drags on the ground.  If the handlebar was slightly shorter or adjustable, it could have removed this issue entirely (are you listening, Graco?).  An adjustable handlebar would have also been a boon for those who are not average height.5.  The stroller really could have used an extra pocket or storage compartment on the seat back or hood.  More storage is better.6.  My biggest beef with the stroller is that it requires two hands to open stroller.  One hand must pull the release strap (the same as the fold and lock strap) and the other hand must reach down and grab the handlebar and straighten the stroller at the same time.  So, while you're doing this on the walkway bridge right out of the airplane with a ton of passengers piling up behind you and your carry-on luggage, who's going to hold the baby who is cranky and crying after the flight?  A much better system would have been some sort of release button or strap that would have let you open the stroller with one hand.Please let me know if my review was helpful or if you have any questions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEUBFAKOJ1AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8MQ81S#wasThisHelpful","R2OEUBFAKOJ1AT","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initial assumptions and caveats:1) We run Macs in our household, so our setup and user experience is Mac-based.2) We plan on using this product exclusively either as a repeater (i.e., wireless extender) or client (i.e., a device to receive a wireless signal and convert it to ethernet), and my review is targeted at this experience and this experience only.  I cannot and will not comment in this review on how good this product is as a base wireless router either at home or on the road.Within these parameters, I am very satisfied with this.  It was easy to set up and will make our home wifi that much more robust.  Here are some observations gleaned as I set up the device.A) The instruction manual, or rather, poster, is quite thorough and well-documented.  It's very small, however.  At this point I'm north of 40 and my eyes don't read small print that well.  Also - mini-CDs (like the one included with this product) don't work either for us Mac users, or for anyone with a slot-loading optical drive.B) When you set up the device for repeater or client and run a survey of networks to extend, your network will show up once for your main base station and *once in addition for each repeater or other base station on your wireless network.*  The only distinction will be something called a BSSID, which may or may not be the same as the wireless device's MAC ID.  I couldn't easily locate my Airport Express' MAC ID, so the only way I knew for sure which BSSID corresponded to my base and not my existing repeater was simply to unplug the repeater in use before setting up the TPLink.  In retrospect, since the survey lists access points by decreasing signal strength, the best thing to do would have been to set up the TPLink in very close proximity to the main base station.C) By the way, for you Windows users out there, on the odd chance you've gotten this far in a review that is clearly not intended for you, this device doesn't do Wifi Protected Setup (aka the sort of instant magic that attaches printers to networks with a single button) with Windows either.  Folks, please correct me if I'm wrong.Finally, D) this device comes with a USB port which can ostensibly be used to attach a drive to the network as a volume server via SAMBA. Well, it works, but I wouldn't try to use it as a full fledged NAS backup access point, i.e. as a poor-man's Time Capsule.  On a lark I decided to see how long it would take to send a 6 GB DVD iso rip over to a USB key through the net - it would have taken an hour for just those 6 GB if I hadn't lost patience first.  If I were writing that file via FireWire, it would have taken no more than 30 seconds.  Note - if you're running OSX, SAMBA drives do *not* plug and play automatically - you have to connect to the server formally.  Open the finder, open the ""GO"" menu, at the bottom there's an option to ""Connect to Server"" - the server is ""smb://tplinklogin.net"" - use the same account info you use to access the TPLink itself for login.  Alternatively, I used my OSX administrator account and that worked fine too.I hope you find my observations helpful.  This is a very inexpensive and versatile wifi device, and it would be a shame if unnecessary exasperation got in the way of enjoying it.  Thumbs up!P.S. One last weird observation:  I don't know how easy it would be to use more than one of these within the same network, especially if you plan on using the USB input for volume or file serving.  Most likely, these devices are all accessed via ""tplinklogin.net"" whether for http or smb access.  So if you've got more than one of them, how will you - or for that matter the rest of the network - know which TPLink device you're trying to access?  Inquiring minds want to know.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X53YNBOL7ULI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRMAOIO#wasThisHelpful","R2X53YNBOL7ULI","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a parent of a child on the spectrum, I naturally found this book interesting.  Temple Grandin obviously doesn't need any introduction, but I gather the other author, Richard Panek, is well known as a science writer.  I haven't read much of Dr. Grandin's other works but this one is clearly written well.My primary interest at first reading were chapters two and three, in which the authors summarize current theories on the neuroscience and genetics of spectrum disorders. I'm not a scientist, but what they authors write here seems intuitively correct: the spectrum disorders are to a great extent manifestations of neurophysical and neuroanatomical phenomena (and interestingly enough, Dr. Grandin suggests later that maybe her motor function difficulties result from a reduced cerebellum), and that those phenomena themselves result from certain seemingly minor but crucial de novo genetic mutations.Oh, and she discusses the vaccine debate with an interesting perspective - I don't think she buys the vaccine theory that much yet.  One, she suggests that a great number of severe 18-month regressions actually result from mitochondrial disease, which in turn often results from the fact that the genetic integrity of male sperm deteriorates markedly as men get older.  Two, she hasn't seen the controlled study trying to connect regression with vaccines that she believes would set the record straight.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U411VQAI6L5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547636458#wasThisHelpful","R3U411VQAI6L5P","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Screen protectors are increasingly commodified - most iPhone screen protectors are adequate for most iPhone users and have the same degree of ease or difficulty during their application.  That being said, this product is nice for a couple of reasons:1) The holes are aligned very precisely.  If you don't misalign during the application process, it's a really good, snug fit.2) The protector, once applied properly, stays on quite nicely, is easy to wipe off, and has thus far proven very abrasion-resistant. I like it.Kudos also to the other reviewer who pointed out that AT&T stores will apply something like this for free.

"Bless the folks at Avery - first their DIY labels in formats galore, and now these ticket sheets.  It really is a great concept - customized printer paper along with downloadable word processor templates.That being said, have some reasonable expectations for this particular product, which is squarely designed for amateurs making small batches:1) It's not glossy or anything resembling photo paper.  You're printing tickets on cardboard stock.2) If you want to print color tickets and you have an inkjet, remember that retail color inkjet ink is expensive.  If you're printing these on a color laser, more power to you, but if you plan on investing in a color laser to print tickets like these, maybe you're looking for a more wholesale quantity of ticket sheets.3) Speaking of wholesale, there's a reason why this package only comes with ten sheets totaling 100 tickets - more than that and a targeted user ought to begin considering whether printing the tickets is best outsourced to a professional shop.In sum, a great idea for what it's intended to do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4TWUNDWOUK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I213WQ#wasThisHelpful","R2X4TWUNDWOUK0","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This really isn't so bad - I haven't used that many steam cleaners, but I was satisfied under the circumstances with what this product was able to accomplish.First - I didn't find it that difficult to set up.  The only confusion I had with the setup instructions was a picture step describing the attachment of an optional part not included with this particular model.Second - it actually cleaned a tough stain quite well.  We tested this after our daughter conveniently vomited some half-digested pizza on our upstairs carpet.  In fact, we didn't end up cleaning the vomit with this product until the morning after, 12 hours later at least, in part because we hadn't assembled the cleaner, and in part because this happened at night and all of us were a little under the weather and just needed to go to sleep.  So how did it do?  Using the sample cleaning fluid, the cleaner handled the stain quite well.  It didn't remove the smell completely though, but it left little enough that the smell faded on its own within a few days.  I assume the cleaner would have tackled the stain better if we had cleaned the vomit immediately.Third - I've seen some complaints about the single chamber water system as being messy when pouring out.  I didn't find this to be the case when I brought it to the sink.  Don't know how environmentally friendly Bissell's cleaning fluids are, however.All told, it's not bad.  I'm assuming that this cleaner is marketed as pet-specific because it's going to be most useful to pet owners, especially those with dogs prone either to anxiety or intestinal issues.  However, if you have neither pets nor children (i.e., you're not going to be staining carpets that much), you may want to consider whether you need something like this, especially at $250.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJ4WD635QUQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZBIMFY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJ4WD635QUQE","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each year, as part of our pre-Passover cleaning and preparation, we ""kasher"" our granite countertops and steel sinks, a process which involves systematically pouring boiling water over every square inch of said counters and sinks.  We've evolved a system where we boil the water in big pots and pour it after transferring to two smaller pots which we alternate.  (I'm not going to bore you ad nauseam with the intricacies and the reasons for this system.)The only problem is that neither of said smaller pots has a spout, so the pouring was very imprecise.  Rather than buy a new pot or saucier with a proper spout, we decided to try this.Big mistake.  To begin with, we never felt confident about the seal, and it always seemed like there was water leaking around the edges.  And then, after switching a few times between the two smaller pots we used for the actual pouring - and mind you, the pots were not the same size at all, i.e. 1 qt vs 2.5 qts - this thing got so bent out of shape that it basically couldn't seal at all, and the pouring was even more imprecise than it used to be when we didn't use this piece of plastic junk in the first place.A *total* waste of the money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHOUJBJ0VZD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MAE3UC#wasThisHelpful","RTHOUJBJ0VZD7","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First - this is not a Matzah in any normal sense, and the box says this clearly.Having gotten that out of the way, here's a review of the product on its own merits.The good news (besides the obvious benefit of it being gluten-, soy-, and dairy-free - i.e., kosher for Passover) is that it's crispy, and I personally think it's tasty - kind of like a Pringle but a lot lighter and less aggressive, flavor-wise, which isn't always such a bad thing.  The bad news (besides the price) is that it breaks very easily; I'm not kidding.  Also, it can get stale pretty quickly and lose all of its merits in the process.Our daughter used to be on a much stricter gluten- and dairy-free diet, and these came in handy at the time - she liked them slathered with mayo and sliced smoked turkey.  But now that her diet has broadened, there are other starch and carbo sources she likes more, and we no longer have quite the need to shell out the expense for these.

"When we switched to Comcast for our internet recently,  At first we rented a unified wireless gateway from them, but that was frankly not a good solution.  We looked into setting up our own modem and router instead - especially since we're convinced we're going to be with Comcast for quite some time since we can't get any faster wire-based internet connection in our area.  I looked at the list of recommended DOCSIS 3.0 modems on Comcast's website, and this seemed to be the best combination of inexpensive, no-nonsense, and highly rated.  And we've been quite pleased.Two issues, though:First - switching the cable modem you use for your Comcast connection is not so brainless.  You have to call them up, read them a bunch of MAC codes and serial numbers, and then you have to go through an uncomfortable few minutes when your old modem's been deauthorized and your new modem is unresponsive because it's just getting started with the connection process, and you have to switch your ethernet cable from the old modem to the new at some point in the middle of this juggling act.  There's a reason why this is the sort of thing usually handled by comcast techies, and I can't really fault the product for this.Second - the modem is locked down, as in you can't replace its firmware with a more flexible open-source variety to fit your needs or if you're otherwise adventurous.  When you access the router's IP either through wireless or an ethernet cable, all you get is a status page without any links or other form of input.  Firmware changes, if any, are pushed from Comcast alone.  I think I can live with that for now, though.All told, I'm almost completely satisfied with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31G8JCN9IGHK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IJHK96#wasThisHelpful","R31G8JCN9IGHK5","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been using a Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier for the last three years and we've benefited greatly, particularly by getting sick a lot less often during the winter.  The main drawback about the purifier we've been using is that it is *really* loud, even at its lowest setting.  So loud, in fact, that our filter's been doing double duty as a white noise machine helping keep our kids asleep.  We won't be able to do the white noise thing with the AirGenius5, though.  Too quiet, even at its highest setting.That's not to say it isn't effective.  I set it up in the middle of a sunbeam in my living room at the middle setting, and watched all the flickering dust decrease markedly over the next hour.  The set up was really easy - the device was ready to go practically out of the box.  It really didn't take very long for the AirGenius to clear a fairly large room.  Not to mention the fact that the filter mechanism is really easy to access, and the default filters are actually washable!  (Ours also came with a sample odor-catching filter, which is not washable, but which we haven't tried yet.)My one minor gripe:  the instructions say you need to give the AirGenius three feet of space around it.  Well - we've got a toddler, and something like this isn't going to be safe for very long if it's not backed inconspicuously into a corner.  In a perfect world, Honeywell would have packed an optional and easily assembled pedestal base to stick the AirGenius into for just this purpose.  But really, you can just run it at night when the kids are asleep if you have to.  And note that I'm still giving this product five stars.Note:  unlike the purifier we've been using, this is *not* a HEPA air purifier, and if your allergies need filtration that effective, then this product is not for you.  Luckily, no one in my house has dust, pollen, or dander allergies as far as we know, so I don't think we need a fully-HEPA air filtration system in our living room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVCYQZGXMUKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P7SVHS#wasThisHelpful","RWVCYQZGXMUKW","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After I ordered this product, I saw a fair amount of internet noise about how Apple routers didn't play nicely with other companies' repeaters.  To paraphrase at least one comment I saw in response to someone else who tried to use a D-link product to extend an AirPort Express' wireless reach, ""apples play with apples, and you've got a banana,"" or something to that effect.  So I resigned myself and figured I'd try as best I could before giving up.Lo and behold, the setup was so easy I was worried I was missing something.  Granted, Apple routers don't do WPS (wifi protected setup), so it's not the totally effortless one-button setup I'd have had with any other base router.  On the other hand, this product comes with very clear instructions as to how to do a manual setup, and it took me less than five minutes to get my extender up and running.  And I know it's working - I have a monitor and a keyboard in my library room which I sometimes attach my laptop to, but which was beyond my router's wireless range.  That is, until now.  Also, I've been extending my wireless network for almost an hour now, and it has yet to drop a connection or cause any other hiccup in my wireless transmission, as far as I can tell.All told, I am surprised and gratified about this product.  Seriously - if you've got an AirPort Express and you need a little more range in your home, do not be afraid of this little guy's manual setup.Now if only I can figure out a way to keep my toddler from pulling this thing out on a regular basis...","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JB8AJAA84SBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OZUPUC#wasThisHelpful","R1JB8AJAA84SBB","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good printer - it produces quality pages, fast, and it was easy to set up with my network.  I never thought an inkjet could replace my laser printer, but this one just did.  (Granted, my old printer was an 11-year old Samsung ML-1430 which was totally incompatible with printing by WIFi; besides, said printer's ink cartridge was about to run dry and I was reluctant to shell out $80 for a new one.)That being said, I have three gripes with this product, of increasing severity.1) The nitpicky:  the instructions say that when you install the ink cartridge, you have to push down until it clicks.  Well, it really has to click - in my first attempt at setting the printer up, I thought it had clicked but I didn't push hard enough, and the printer went on priming forever without telling me that there was just no cartridge installed properly.  Just remember to push firmer than you might think you need to.2)  The obnoxious:  the starter ink cartridge is apparently just that, with only enough ink for 200 pages of normal use.  Of course Epson sells a  2400 page ""XL"" cartridge, but that'll set you back $50.  Come on, Epson, don't be so cheap.  Just price the printer a little higher and include the XL cartridge.  This by itself would have made me rate this with four stars, but then there's . . .3)  The seriously bad:  this is the second Epson printer I've installed on OSX where I couldn't get it to work without going to their support website first, the other being the XP-400 whose installation CD lacked a Mountain Lion compatible driver.  And this one was a real honest to God pain in the tush because the installation kept failing until, as per the not-so-easy-to-find instructions on Epson's site, I reset my printer preferences and printer list altogether.  In other words, I frankly don't know how anyone without at least moderate tech savvy could have succeeded in installing this on OSX without either calling Epson support or throwing their hands up in angry despair.  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, EPSON - THIS IS A SERIOUSLY BAD TREND.  There is no excuse in this day and age for allowing home printer installations to be anything but brainless.  None.  And this is why I'm only giving this product three stars.  For what it's worth, this printer doesn't do AirPlay either.There you have it.  I like this thing now that I've installed it, but I wish I hadn't gone through the aggravation.  It's a shame too, because Epson really should not be driving willing consumers away from an otherwise great product.I hope this is informative - and please, if you're an OSX user having trouble with your install, feel free to send me a message and I'll try to help.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IN3ACNKR9I58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A750ZHG#wasThisHelpful","R1IN3ACNKR9I58","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Once I had this device hooked up and running, the channels I was already receiving came through clearer.However, not only did I not get any new channels, but for those channels where my reception was already iffy at best, this device basically killed their signal altogether.

"My husband would be the first to tell you I'm not a techie.  But I found this printer to be painless to install and a real joy to use.1)  Before we discuss the actual device, I first want to praise the packaging of all things.  Frankly, I was shocked at how small the box was when the printer came in the mail.  This is a model of how printers ought to be packaged.2)  The quick installation sheet that came with the printer was easy to understand and follow.  Like I said, painless.  The one caveat here is that I just updated to OSX Mountain Lion, and the installer that came on the enclosed CD said it was incompatible with my operating system.  I knew that the next thing to do was to go to Epson's web site and download an updated, Mountain Lion-friendly driver, and sure enough, Epson's website almost intuited that this was what I was looking for.  I only wish, for the sake of others perhaps less experienced in this sort of thing, that Epson had taken the time to add ""Please visit our website for appropriate installation software"" or something to that effect to the ""incompatible with your system"" dialog on the original install program.3)  The LED control panel is incredible.  It's easy to read and very easy to use, even with just four arrows and an ""OK"" key.  Really that's all you need.  The fact that I could actually key in my lower-case wireless router password is a big plus over the last wireless printer I installed and I mean BIG PLUS.4)  Oh and this printer also has an SD slot for printing photos straight off memory media, again unlike the last wireless printer I installed.5)  The printer works really well with OSX's built-in Image Capture program, which is smart on Epson's part as other printer manufacturers would just have tried to craft their own substitute which would not have been nearly as good.  Why reinvent wheels unnecessarily?6)  My only real gripe with this device (other than the fact that I had to figure out on my own to download my installation software directly from Epson and which I don't think is really a gripe given how recently Mountain Lion was released) is that it doesn't have a document feeder for the copier / scanner as far as I can tell.  This has the potential to be a real nuisance for anyone who needs to copy or scan more than three pages at a time.  In my case, however, I can just use my other wireless printer which does have a document feeder for its copier / scanner, but I'm under no real illusions that most people have spare copiers lying around at home.But, as I said, this is a great buy for its price point, and recommended.Please let me know if this review was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28BAMK034QV9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EGDW3O#wasThisHelpful","R28BAMK034QV9A","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't get me wrong.  My daughter loves this.  Loves it!  It helps that we already had and my daughter already loved the mobile home, and now we have the ""people"" who were actually meant for the mobile home.  Assembly was easy too.  The item comes in a really huge white box, but it's pretty light, so I could carry it on my own.This dollhouse is massive.  You probably already know that.  There are three floors above ground - four if you count the secret attic of a pop-up ""play room?""  You gotta make sure you have the space to store all that.  I suspect that's probably part of the strategy.  The bigger the house you have, the more rooms you have, the more doll furniture you gotta buy to fill that space, right?  (Just like in real life houses, LOL.)  The house is probably so huge that you should buy the Loving Family African American Family and turn the whole building into a hotel or bed and breakfast.Definitely a load of fun if you've got the room for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25VOCL4LX5S23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077NCEX4#wasThisHelpful","R25VOCL4LX5S23","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter started using these at age 4.  She LOVES eating chinese noodles with them and adores having pho (traditional vietnamese noodle soup) with chopsticks just like the grownups.  They've made it really easy to use, especially for my kid who has significant fine motor issues.  These broke after only a couple months of use.  One ""leg"" snapped right below the round axle part.  My daughter is very gentle, so I can imagine that it would break more easily with a kid who is more rough with them.  Still, they're not so expensive, so I can't say I mind that much.The other thing I don't love about them is that they're plastic.

"I have a screen protector on my iPhone, and I've replaced them several times.  It's not that hard, probably because they're small enough that there's less room for screw-ups.Apparently, putting a screen protector on an iPad is something else entirely.  Primarily, the screen is a lot bigger (duh) so there's a lot more possibility of something going wrong, and in my case, plenty of things did, partly because I didn't do the process right due to the unclear instructions, and partly because the kit's components were, to put it charitably, not up to spec.1)  First of all, they tried to put the instructions on the packaging itself rather than a fold-out poster.  Really dumb idea, because I found the instructions almost incomprehensible in the absence of lots of large, detailed pictures.  There were pictures, yes, but they are small (at most 1 x 1.5 inches) and there weren't enough of them.2)  Second of all, the screen installation is not very intuitive.  By way of example, the hard peelable shell on which the screen rests in the packaging comes with a little tab on the side that says ""place this on top"" - which is fine except that the words on the tab are right-side up when the shell is on the bottom.  This is dumb, and it made my installation a lot more complicated.3)  This thing comes with an ""alignment strip"" which is supposed to anchor the screen in place to the iPad at one of the edges during the placement process, except mine wouldn't stick to my iPad.  Absolutely useless, and I had to undo and redo my placement process several times before it was aligned properly.4)  Like iPhone screen protector kits, this came with an applicator designed to smooth the screen down during placement and help smooth out bubbles afterwards.  Only the applicator in this kit is made out of flimsy cardboard as opposed to plastic. Utterly lame.  Frankly, given the amount of pressure needed to push the bubbles to the side, I ended up blunting the cardboard before I got rid of that many bubbles. I ended up using a credit card, and even then I couldn't get them all.  What's the use of the vaunted fingerprint disappearing tech when there are perma-bubbles below the screen protector which make the thing unclear anyway.  At least it won't get scratched.This is the sort of thing where I'm supposed to be able to write a simple, pithy review to the effect of ""simple to use, works well, does what it's supposed to do.""  The fact that I can't just makes me all the more disappointed in this product.  Avoid.I hope this is informative.

"Having played with this device for a month or so, I like it.  A lot.First, the pros:1) Google TV is actually a great built in operating system.  I haven't experienced any crashes, I liked the ease with which it updated its own firmware, and the tv's control panel is a really intuitive interface.2) An amazing picture.  Stunning.  Just remember to keep it orthogonal to sunshine and you'll be reliably glare free.3) The passive 3d thing is really nifty and easy on the eyes, and you can play with its settings to adjust how much depth is perceived - practically, this adjusts how out of sync the alternating lines in the picture are, but it works.4) Did I mention that it comes with just about every connective interface one could think of (except perhaps Thunderbolt - give that a few years and it may be in a successive generation).5) The remote was really easy to pair with the television once it connected to wifi.  Also, as an added bonus, you can download an app that turns your smart phone into another remote.A few cons:1) There are some ways in which the interface is not intuitive.  My particular gripe is that when you're watching regular TV, there's no on screen option to go straight to settings.  You have to go to the home page first.  This would not be so much of a problem except for the fact that the remote itself doesn't have a settings button.  Interestingly enough though, the downloadable Google TV  remote app actually does have its own settings button.  Weird.2) It's great that you move the mouse on screen by moving the remote itself in space, like a Wii controller, but it's not the most precise of tools, and it takes a *lot* of practice to learn how not to wield the remote in more than the most clumsy fashion.3) The TV's built in wifi receiver is really not that great, and I don't see why it couldn't have been made better.  We first had the TV in our living room, and it had a lot of trouble receiving a decent signal from our router, which is upstairs in our guest bedroom.  This is particularly problematic because the TV sometimes couldn't connect to wifi except after repeated attempts.  This problem went away when we moved the TV to our bedroom, but still, more flexibility here would have been good.4) The remote shows every indication of being proprietary - although I haven't tried it, I don't know how well a standard universal remote would work with the Google TV system, and in particular I don't know how many universal remotes come with built-in keyboards or motion sensing technology.  Of course, ""proprietary remote"" usually equals ""expensive to replace.""5) The main drawback of LG's passive 3d technology is that it really plays 3d at 1080i rather than 1080p - that is, it staggers the horizontal lines so that each side of the glasses is only picking up every other line.  The main consequences is that you're only getting 540 lines of resolution rather than the full 1080.  I don't know how one would work around this, though, except maybe by creating a tv that really has 2160 horizontal lines squeezed into a 1080p aspect.  This may not come for a while but one never knows.6) Last and admittedly not that important - don't expect to be able to pick up broadcast TV without an antenna, but those are not necessarily that expensive.In sum, this is an amazing product.  Hopefully we won't get sucked into using it that often.  (Also, it would be nice if someone gave us a blu-ray player with 3d capability, but you can't have everything.)Please let me know if you find this helpful or if you have other questions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DH9AUM6EO3FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074WVYNO#wasThisHelpful","R2DH9AUM6EO3FL","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good example of getting what you pay for.  In this case, not that much, and as I will explain, I don't really know why this thing exists or why RCA invested time, money, and effort creating it.First, the pros, for what they're worth:+The voice recorder is OK, if a little difficult to use.+The device has open storage and an intuitive folder structure, so it's very easy to shift files in and out of it when it's connected to a computer through USB.  This is probably it's best feature.+At least the one I received came with a $10 card for eMusic, which makes this thing even less expensive than it really is.  Don't know whether this was included just to sweeten the hearts and tongues of Vine reviewers, though.Alas, the cons, which in my opinion far outweigh the pros:-The videos are recorded in a proprietary format whose translation software is WINDOWS ONLY.  In other words, OS X users without recourse to a windows install will NEVER be able to watch any videos recorded with this thing.  In my opinion, THIS IS A DEALBREAKER.-The interface is really clunky.  There are limited options for navigation, and they don't always make sense intuitively in context.  There were a number of times where I wanted to be able to do something with this device, but it took me way too long actually to get there.Look, folks.  I use an iPhone, and I simply cannot see any purpose for this device which my phone couldn't do ten times easier and better.  That being said, there are people out there who don't use Macs and don't want to spend the premium for an iPhone, and this might be good for them.  Then again, Droid phones are also cheap and I can't imagine they couldn't handle what this thing does that much worse than an iPhone.In sum, I can't see how this device is anything but a low-end product with an extremely limited target market - windows users without the wherewithal for a cell phone with a data plan.

"The good news is that it's an OK but not spectacular broom and dustpan combo.  The dustpan part is particularly nice because you don't need to bend down to pick it up.Two pieces of bad news.  First, it's not as effective as a regular broom - my daughter spilled a whole lot of tiny rainbow sprinkle balls on the kitchen floor, and this thing had trouble picking them up rather than just pushing them around.More obnoxious is that it takes too long to charge.  This won't be a problem for most people, but know who you are and how much you sweep - if you're sweeping multiple times a day, this won't get you very far and it's not for you.  For example, there was an enormous half-lab / half-newfy who belonged to some folks who lived with my in-laws for a spell.  This dog loved nothing more than getting wet and tracking mud, and my mother in law found herself sweeping much of the first floor of her house several times a day.  This sweeper would not have helped her very much at all.In sum, know what you need to sweep and how much, and that will tell you whether this is a good investment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R289FQS1UB7TZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00440EO4U#wasThisHelpful","R289FQS1UB7TZJ","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This lighter is beautiful; my husband tells me that one should expect this level of aesthetic elegance from Zippo.  More important, however: this is *the best and most effective non-disposable long-handled lighter I've ever used.*  *Period.*  How shall I count the ways?1)  The flame at its highest setting has so much output velocity, you might need to get an acetylene torch if you want anything stronger.  OK, maybe that's a little hyperbolic, but I've only used one disposable with comparable power.2)  The flexible goose neck is ingenious, and incredibly practical so many ways.  For example, after I light Shabbat candles, I have to put the lighter down before I make any blessings. With the straight-necked disposables, I was always afraid of putting the lighter down on the heirloom wooden buffet cabinet where I have placed my candle-holders; with this lighter, however, I can simply point the neck up and put the lighter down.  No more worries!3)  Another example of why I love the goose neck:  when my husband grills he lights his barbecue coals in a chimney starter which he places on top of the lower grille of our Weber kettle.  When it's windy, the matches which could fit in the side holes of the chimney's lower chamber do not produce a strong enough flame to survive the wind, and the straight necked disposables won't fit in the side hole.  With this lighter, my husband simply curves the neck under the lower grille and back then back up into the chimney chamber from below, and the flame is strong enough to take care of the rest.  Unbelievable.4)  I can't imagine how this is not a more environmentally sensible product than the disposables.I have only two minor gripes.  One potential flaw that doesn't bother me so much but I can see how it might bother others with less manual dexterity, is that the the clicker for the flame itself is a flat switch rather than the trigger on virtually all of the disposables I've used.  But again, from my perspective, the increase in usage difficulty is marginal, especially when compared to how clunky such a trigger would look on this lighter.  My other gripe is Zippo's claim that the lighter should only be refilled with Zippo's own premium butane fuel; besides, the way the lighter is designed, any replacement fuel would have to be inserted through the flame adjuster at the lighter's bottom via what appears to be a proprietary mechanism.  I'd appreciate any information as to whether there are more generic (i.e. cheaper) alternatives or whether such alternatives are wise.  (On the other hand, I don't smoke or light fires that often, and I can't imagine I'll be running out of fuel on a regular basis, so how much expense could there be?)My husband tells me that back when he knew a lot of smokers, Zippo lighters were definitely among the hippest and coolest accessories for that vile habit.  And they work phenomenally well, much better than the Bic disposables.  Given that (thank God) fewer and fewer Americans smoke, Zippo clearly had to expand into different markets, and this one strikes me as a perfect fit for their expertise in elegant but easy flame creation.

"Pro:  The armband is a good design - not too elastic but not too tight.  Velcro doesn't last forever as we all know, but I can't think of a cost-effective or practical alternative which would be any more durable.  In particular, something akin to a belt or watchband with holes and a clip would if anything be less durable.Con #1:  Mine came with a cloudy screen cove.  One, it made the item as a whole look stale, which might not be entirely impossible given that it was designed for the 4th generation models which will likely be obsolete come September.  Two - perhaps as a consequence of degraded plastic - my motions and touch on the screen felt that much less sensitive.  It's ok if all you really want to do is strap the thing on while you're exercising and navigate the music player, but it wouldn't be quite so much fun if you actually wanted to text or write an email, tasks requiring considerably more precision.Con #2:  I normally keep my iphone in an Otterbox Commuter Case, which is designed to make it difficult to extract the phone, for any number of good reasons.  Surely Belkin knows by now that there are lots of people like me out there who keep their phones in protective cases.  The fact that this product, and every other product Belkin makes for iPhones, all insist upon being their own exclusive cases strikes me as ridiculous.  Surely there's a way for Belkin to invent an armband which functions essentially as an adjustible clip which would enable people to keep their existing cases on and yet still enjoy the benefits of a good exercise armband.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227868988J4LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VDPDHU#wasThisHelpful","R227868988J4LN","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Playtex bottles are great, easy to assemble, clean, and hold while feeding.  The whole bottle comes apart which makes it super easy to clean -- and gives you peace of mind that you're properly sterilizing it for your little one.  I used these same ones with my last child and found they didn't leak like other brands.Downside to this:  If you lose the little vent disc piece that goes in the bottom of the bottle, you can't use it any more (they do provide some extra vent discs, however).  The bottles come apart into five pieces, which is a lot of keep track of, compared to other bottles.The bottle pack comes with five bottles (3 slow flow bottles, and 2 fast for when newborn gets bigger) in the box, making life easier with a newborn when you can't wash dishes right away.

"I have been on the market for a good vacuum cleaner for awhile.  I tried out many, many upright and canister vacuums -- and returned most of them.  It was actually nice to get a chance to review the Hoover Windtunnel canister -- it was one of the models that I had purchased and returned to Target, although a slightly different model.  At the time, I returned it because I felt that although it was amazing at getting at the crevices and the cobwebs on the ceiling in my home, it failed to contain the sort of suction I needed to deal with wall to wall carpeting.  (I have hardwood floors, wall to wall carpeting, carpeted stairs, and area rugs--so I got to test a variety of surfaces.  We also do not have pets, but we do have grandma's dog that visits regularly and sheds plenty.)  I liked being able to test this Hoover Windtunnel model out more thoroughly though, but the longer I use it, the more disappointed I become.First of all, the suction is not that great.  It does just fine for low pile carpets and hardwood floors.  Medium pile carpeting gives it a harder time -- I would pass on this if you have wall to wall carpeting.  And the worst part is that the suction seems to get worse over time.  Moreover, the brushes in the vacuum head does not seem very powerful.  Between the poor suction and lousy brushes, a lot of dust and dirt ended up being pushed around.The main advantage of this canister, however, are the other attachments.  It was easy to vacuum the stairs, the ceilings, and the baseboards with this attachment.  Getting under furniture and beds was also a cinch.  As a result, it is an excellent choice as a secondary vacuum to get your place extra clean or for super spring cleaning.  However, at this price point, I'm not sure who would do so.The Hoover is lightweight -- though I see that there are plenty of other reviewers who disagree.  For me, it's not been a problem to carry it around.  And it maneuvers well enough.But if your primary goal in purchasing a vacuum is suction -- I have other recommendations.  For those die-hard canister fans, I would recommend a Panasonic, which is also slightly less expensive.  If you can afford a Miele, I found that people who had them were consistently satisfied.  Among uprights, we tried out the Dyson.  Among the many people we know with Dyson vacuums, it seems evenly split among those who love them and those who hate them.  I ultimately settled on the Electrolux Nimble, which to me, had the best combination of suction, maneuverability, and price.  But vacuum choice is a highly personal experience.  I would recommend trying out several.  I hope my review may have helped guide your purchase, though.

"I feel like the adhesive on these Nexcare waterproof bandages are much better than compared to Band-Aid Brand Water Block Plus.  I had a nasty cut on the finger where I was a little too aggressive chopping vegetables and had the opportunity to try both bandages out on alternating days.  They both pretty much did the trick--staying on for most of the day, despite exposure to water during hand washing, dishwashing, or bathing.  The Nexcare stuck a little bit better than the Band Aid brand; however it was a little trickier to put the bandage on curved surfaces--like around a finger.  The water blocker bandaids work like a typical bandage.  But the Nexcare is oval-shaped, plus it has these little tabs that you hold onto until the bandage has adhered to your skin and then you remove the tabs.The only notable exception:  My daughter had a scrape on her middle toe.  She's six.  That's a little toe.  She insisted on having a band aid on it for weeks.  Well, we got to test a variety of bandaids and made much use of these waterproof ones (since she wanted a new bandage every time one fell off in the water).  The Nexcare bandage stayed on through a visit to the swimming pool, but then fell off half way through the shower later that day.  The BandAid waterblocker fell off a little bit sooner.  However, a regular BandAid bandage (with princess character) that managed to wrap a few times around itself (since it was such a small toe) actually stayed on for a couple days.  Go figure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSD43J1WZ1ON8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CBDLX4#wasThisHelpful","RSD43J1WZ1ON8","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We agree that this is a neat product, given its flexibility and the fact that the iPad bed easily turns 360 degrees.  However, we disagree about whether the main riser is just right or too stiff.This thing works because the iPad sits in a bed, a case really, connected to the rest of the frame via a stiff hinge that is capable of holding the iPad's weight in place more or less at any angle as needed.

"I did not enjoy using this product.  In particular, don't expect the gel pack to warm up within 10 minutes, especially if you've refrigerated it to make it cool. The product instructions should have disclosed that the heating time was from room temperature.  And even when it was warm, it was really no warmer than running a washcloth under really hot water from the tap.  You don't really need to pay for a product that's going to lose its heat almost instantly.  My engorged breasts were in agony.  Cabbage leaves ultimately brought the engorgement down, but for immediate relief, I used an old fashion hot water bottle and that did the trick.Even used as a cold pad, it didn't seem as effective as Soothies Gel Pads, which were amazing for the initial nipple soreness pain from starting breastfeeding a newborn.  If you have severe nipple cracking and bleeding however (as I did trying to nurse a tongue tied baby), you ought to consider asking your OB or midwife to prescribe something called Triple Nipple Cream (also called Dr. Jack Newman's Nipple Ointment) which will heal nipples in 24 hours.  The prescription will have to be compounded (mixed together) by your pharmacy, so you'll have to check to make sure the pharmacy has it in stock.  (A mom's tip:  24 hour pharmacies tend to have more different drugs readily in stock b/c they never know what prescription will need to be filled urgently overnight).If you found this review helpful, please let me know.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGFS5CP09XQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00643FRUA#wasThisHelpful","R1TGFS5CP09XQL","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In general, this is a good printer for its price point.  We tested it on a Macbook Pro, mid-2010 vintage running OSX Lion.1)  Assembling the printer and the cartridges was easy.  The instruction poster was quite detailed and quite helpful.  5/52)  Wireless setup:  we were unable to connect the printer to our wireless network directly, probably because we don't use a numerical password and our network is not open.  However, it was easy to introduce the printer to the network through our computer, via USB cable. We're curious whether people with routers using standard 10-digit WPA or no encryption found the connection process directly from the printer.  Nonetheless, even given the limitations of the printer's LCD console, it shouldn't have been too difficult to program it to accept wireless passwords with more than just  numbers, even given the price point.  3/53)  Software installation:  Mac users have two choices:  install with the included disc or without.  The main difference is that the drivers on the disc enable you to monitor the printer's ink supply directly from the printer system dialog.  The generic drivers from the operating system itself apparently do not.  Also - keep in mind that there are two driver choices for OSX wireless printing from the operating system itself - one of which connects through Bonjour and the other which does not.  As best as I can tell, connecting it through bonjour may make it harder to switch between printing and scanning.  My recommendation is to use the driver on the disc.  4/54)  Printing:  once the printer was connected, we had little trouble using it.  Some minor gripes make it a 3.5/5 overall.  A)  The printer seems to have an irreversible default to printing in color at least on OSX - the printer's system setup dialog does not contain a color option as far as we have been able to tell.  Individual applications may have their own particular print dialogs, some of which enable printing in grayscale or black and white.  However, for some processes (e.g. printing coupons directly off the web through Coupon Printer) switching to black and white seems impossible.  This is a gripe because color ink is expensive.  B)  The print tray itself does not hold that many sheets.  Between this, and the fact that the printer itself is fairly slow, I would not recommend using this printer for documents longer than 10 pages if you have an alternative.  For this reason alone, we're not ready to mothball our decade-old laser printer even though it's not wireless.  C)  Photos - this thing can print photos just fine if not spectacularly.  It would have been nice if it had an SD slot for printing directly from the card to the printer, rather than having to go through the USB port.  However, since USB adapters for flash memory media are commonplace, this is a minor gripe at best.5)  Scanning:  you have a choice between running the scanner from the printer or from the computer system dialog.  I would handily recommend the latter, again mostly because I prefer to avoid using the tiny, clunky LCD console.  It's a good scanner, whether through the feeder or with documents or pictures placed directly on the bed, albeit a little slow.  4/5 if you go through your computer, probably 2/5 otherwise.Disclaimer:  we have not as of yet tried using this as a fax machine.All told, this is a good product for the price, but you might want to pay a little more for a similar printer that is faster, with a better console, and which offers more color flexibility directly in the driver software.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCHO8REZA0HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073N1J48#wasThisHelpful","R3UCHO8REZA0HC","A3NDUBKYPI47N2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NDUBKYPI47N2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's seldom we're treated to a mixture of hot and sexy steamy romance, a real love story and a lot of hold your breath-scary suspenseful moments. I couldn't remember getting this excited over a book, I honestly didn't want it to end. It's fast paced, action packed, a real page turner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and my stomach churning ... everything a good thriller should be. The story is well written and the characters believable. Texas Kissing is a sizzling, and intense romantic suspense conspiracy thriller.The writing is amazing, Ms.Newburry knows how to keep your attention. Sometimes, she would leave off at a tense moment only to pick it up later. Gah, not fair! The characters were real, with real flaws that all of us have This is one of the best romantic suspense novels I've read of Helena's, and I know it's not going to be the last,. as a matter of fact, I think the author is just warming up! it's really fast paced--pages are flying as you get deep in to the story. Plan on not doing anything that must really get done, because it's not going to happen. You will not be able to put this down, it's consuming, it's one hell of a ride. Well done, Ms.Newbury!

"Since I had GETRON cell/GPS holder dashboard/windshield mount, I didn't think I had a need for another one. I mainly use this to hold my Garmin GPS. Up until my company started combining our twice a month conference with webinar at the same time, I felt a bit inadequate having to drive to my destination while listening to the conference/webinar. This cell phone air vent version is like heaven sent! I switched my Garmin to this and mounted my Note 4 to the dashboard mount since it's higher and more like eye level since I can hear the GPS tells the coming turns ahead. It really works great and serves my intended purpose. Now I don't miss any scheduled appointment nor any of our company's webinar if they happen to coincide at the same time.

"I could have easily given this a 5 star except for the fact that almost 60 percent of the book is much ado about nothing. First, the heroine, Holly, appeared to be of a weak character and a whiny. Then there's a lot of senseles scenes and conversation and a lot of getting drunk and more boring conversations. Only up to the last 40 percent of the story that it got interesting. Where at the beginning I kept putting it down as it was almost excruciatingly boring,  I couldn't put this down like my life depended on it. I went through a multitude of mixed emotions...I got so angry and disgusted with the hero, Jake, and his whole family, especially his mother, they were heartless and phony. There was one scene where I felt like my heart was ripped wide open, it brought back some memories. I cried, I was afraid for her, I was apprehensive, angry and sad, and then I was so proud of Holly, I felt all the emotions and hardship she battled, her triumph in the end. But oh, it's not over, far from it. The beginning is just starting, I was so hooked that I felt I was reading two different books. I urge you not to give up, don't let the first half deter you, keep on reading, I promise you'll be so involved you'd probably dread getting to the end. You'll want more, definitely more! I really, really hope the next book would come very, very soon.Well done, Ms.Isabella White, you got me...hook,line and sinker!

"was a bit surprised too see so many negative reviews at Amazon, some said It was so bad they didn't even make it to the half of the story and gave up. I started to doubt if I read the same book. I love this tale and the characters, they all seem so real and relatable. It has drama and a little mystery that kept me glued in. The heroine, Tiny, is one strong, loving young woman. Dedicated in helping her very ill mother, despite her serious impiment, she takes on a dangerous and unsavory job that could get her in prison, worse yet, could cost her life. And Ian, the oh so handsome, sexy as sin,so taken by Tiny's beauty, inside and out, took on the job of taking care of her and her mother. His unrelentless pursuing of Tiny, making sure she's safe, was just admirable. There's a scene where Tiny was so devastated on the lost of her mother, rode like hell on a bike until she collapsed on the ground on the cemetery where mother was buried. She was so overcome with grief didn't realized Ian followed her. He picks her up and said..."" would you let me share your grief and comfort you, she was just like my own mother too, it's my loss too""... So profound it brought tears in my eyes.The ending just got so intriguing and I can't wait to read the final book, TAKING CONTROL, I highly recommend this. a complimentary copy courtesy of NetGalley ","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM35LI9FD5EID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZ35D4W#wasThisHelpful","RM35LI9FD5EID","A3UHDN1OOU5BLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHDN1OOU5BLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I'd like to apologize to the esteemed Ms.Jordan for voicing out my disappointment and for giving this less than 5 star. I fear I sound like an ingrate for she generously gifted this to me. I always believe in honesty is the best policy, and I'm sure Ms.Jordan would agree with me. I believe that she gifts many reviewers many of her books solely for the purpose of posting an honest and fair review.Having said all that, If you like a lot of hot sex scenes and not much of a real story, this one will do that for you. I was impressed with the first book, it had potential and a great promise of becoming one of the best sellers that I rated it 5 star. It was full of intrigue, drama, a little angst and of course, hot sex...and it was exactly just that, pure sex and not much else. The majority of this short tale was all about their wild kinky sex. While at Gio's little yacht over the whole weekend, they had a marathon of sex, Gio trying to establish dominance over Taryn as his sub, pages and pages of them that I ended up skimming through it all.

He and Juliet are a perfect match made in heaven. The many incredible sex scenes are explosive, wild for my own imagination.

"The 1st and 2nd were great, (gave them 5 star) I couldn't wait to read this 3rd one after book 2 ended in a real cliffhanger. I just have to have this, the final book, pronto! I simply couldn't waste any minute. And what a let down this turned out to be. The first quarter of the book is mostly about brokenheated Juliet, staying in bed, days on end, sobbing, waiting for Dom to come knocking at her door.  Binging on junk food, booze and completely forgot about personal hygiene. Then all of a sudden she gets up, pulls her hair up, in her flip flops and sweatpants she's worn for days, ( one of her roommates implied she reeks) took a cab and went to Rexford hotel to try to talk to Dom and explain herself. Excuse me, but if trying to see my boyfriend to beg for his forgiveness and take me back, I would absolutely make sure I look amazing, well groomed and smelling like roses. So of course, she didn't get him back, not even to listen for damn minute, he just called her a whore and drove off. So Juliet decided to decamp and work for Lillian, Dom's ex wife, the very same who exposed Juliet to Dom about her being a bait to lure him and get photographed in a compromising position, the very same one who took Dom to the cleaners and now owns a large amount of his stocks. And why would Lillian go to Juliet's house and offer her a job at the hotel as her personal liason? She's a newly graduate, no experience and just an intern, that just threw me off, it simply doesn't make sense. Then not long after, all four of them, including Dom's brother, Xander, were in it together plotting to catch Blaine Prescott, Dom's arch enemy and competion, to confess he's behind the attempted killing of Xander and Juliet, using Lillian as the bait. To make matters worse is Dom leaving the scene to take a phone call, doesn't return until everything turned violent, both Juliet and Lillian gets beat up. He's supposed to be there the entire time to make absolutely sure Lillian is safe in case Blaine Prescott turns berserk (which he did)This has become a farce! It didn't even clarify who tried to kill Xander and Juliet, It felt unfinished and rushed. I almost didn't finish this, but I just had to. After all, I've already invested 6.97 of my precious dollars for two books that each ended at 76% and one at 88%, short as it already is, I don't think that's fair.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12COSVMFH121U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012TPOCDY#wasThisHelpful","R12COSVMFH121U","A3UHDN1OOU5BLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHDN1OOU5BLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is just the kind of story I always wanted--simple, no profanities , a little bit of angst, just enough to get the story flowing. There's a bit of drama and lots of honest-to-goodness hot sex, I mean hot! The characters are so diverse, so convincing you could see them in everyday walks of day to day living.I'd consider myself blessed to have a best friend like Larene, who's there to hold your hand while you cry your heart out, who's there to eat and binge on chocolate cookies and ice cream with you, calories be damned! And iI'll absolutely consider myself ncredibly lucky to have a boyfriend like Tristan Blake, who not only a billionaire but hot as hell-fire sinfully handsome, but also knows how to truly show good times and romance a woman. Oh yeah, talk about wine and dine you in private entire floor, overlooking a breathtaking view of the entire city, from the top floor of an exclusive sought after restaurant...who takes you in a private jet and flies you to London and Scotland just to make up for his errant ways. Sure, Noelle suffered some heartaches but who hasn't? I have had my share of heartbreak but no one jetsetted me to UK,(not just yet!) let alone in a private jet. If that happens to me, call the paramedics please! Swoon!  ;)I like Noelle, she's smart, she's beautiful and level headed. I admire the way she handled all the conflicts and dealt the heartrending news and Tristan's fury directed at her. Somebody has gotten engage...and somebody leaked out the sensational Tristan's family secret and scandal to the media...what a tangle and mess they weave! A hold-your-breath moments aplenty. Tristan and Noelle's relationship is never smooth, it's one step forward and two steps back.

"And once again, I'm simply been proven wrong! Ms. le Carre is a master of poignant moments in sexy as hell-romantic writing. SEXY BEAST is one of her best novels in which she recreates such breathtaking moments. A luminescent love story set against a trademark storyline of two people in love with one another, but having to wade through practical and emotional obstacles before they unite. Layla and BJ are a fictional couple who jump out of the page because Georgia makes them real and believable. The pace never slips and your interest is kept from beginning to end. My gut was like a roller coaster reading the dialogue between BJ and Layla. Emotionally and sensually, this book really packs a good punch. The characters and their interactions with each other are beautifully written with a strong emphasis on the emotional link between Layla and BJ, their special bond is strong and has real depth. It is passionate, it's deep and intense, imbued with a sensuality that leaps off the page. Though all of Georgia's books I've read are stunning, so far, I'd say this is not just one of the best. To me, this stands out, it's different from all the others. There are several twists and intense moments throughout the book, and the characters are diverse. i really liked the way Layla's character grew from the shy but spoiled little girl to a stong fearless woman, that still however, shows her vulnerable sides at the scarriest crucial moments. This is gripping at times, when faced with a devastating news that threatens their lives. So different from all of Georgia's books. This is also the first time she shared with her readers one hero's sex scene with other women other than the heroine. It was vivid, explicit, raw, but my oh my, it was electrifyingly hot!Ms,Le Carre is a genius at describing all that happened in the past, including that of Jake and Lily's story leading up to that night, when BJ caught Layla in his bedroom stealing something from him. What follows next was Layla's come hither's vilifying ""punishment"" from BJ...and that was just the beginning, a wetting of ones appetite...so rousing I wanna stand in line and get punished! ;)I clutched this book to my heart when I finished it and have re-read it. I feel an incredible gratitude to Ms.Le Carre when she brings us stories like this. She's made me laugh and cry, all her books gave me a myriad of fleeting emotions...I have been terrified, angered, excited,--and this is no different. She gives you that sultry, Gypsy itchy charm, a cover for a multitude of sins and passions simmering just under the surface. She uses a seamless multi point of view to let the reader really experience these vividly created people in a way enforced writing, (single pov) just cannot flesh out. It's simply Le Carre's and the genre at it's best!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22P4BEWC8PSCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012GRLQJI#wasThisHelpful","R22P4BEWC8PSCR","A3UHDN1OOU5BLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHDN1OOU5BLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like best is that it's a standalone, no cliffhanger, no waiting for the next 2 or 3 more books to get to the HEA. It's simple, no explicit, sleazy sex scenes either that gets so old at times. Instead, it left a lot of room for your imagination.I also especially like that the author brillliantly weaved a whole lot of different facets of what makes an easy read and entertaining story. It's had all what I'm looking for in a good book. A mixture of drama, right amount of angst, mystery, murder integrated with somewhat akin to supernatural sixth sense and a love story.

"This came real handy when we went to Disneyland and took the splash mountain ride, it's a rollicking log flume ride that goes through many dips guaranteed to get you wet, including any gadgets you have with you. Hah! It's definetely one of my faves rides so we took it more than twice and not a tiny speck of water got in my cell. We were so ready to get soaking wet but confident it would keep my cellphone safe and completely dry. Some of my friens had to stay behind and take the next ride while one of us stay in the dry ground to hold their cellphones while getting on the ride so as not to get them wet. While, I, takes the ride on every turn. ;)The opprtunity to do a true test how good and reliable this waterproof pouch came yesterday. We had an almost all day pour of rain, when I thought it finally stopped in the late afternoon, I set out to take my hour long power walk, put my cell in my pouch just in case it rained again.

"Loved, loved this product! You can eat or drink anything and it stays, amazing! You can even suck face and no one can tell. ;) LOL! I'm so glad I can still get this at Amazon or else, I'll be really screwed! (pardon the pun) ha haa! I have gotten so many, many compliments how good and becoming the color on me,  I've lost count. It's a true wonder for me why manufacturers discontinue products or colors that was so popular. I mean, you couldn't find these easily when it was still readily available. They always ran out of stock, anywhere I went. So, when it comes back in stock I would always purchase several of them, afraid they'll ran out again. Sadly, this color together with one of my faves,( Azalea) has been completely discontinued. So yeah, I'm grateful Amazon has them all the time.

"I was really very curious as to what this book really entails, so I got it since it was free. Now I know I'll never going to develop a liking to this kind of books. There was really no story, no depth, no character(s) growth--it's just simply pure SMUT. Its akin to watching a porno movie, only its not visually but literary.

"We've read and seen the best part of this tale at the second book. It could have ended on book 3,instead it was dragged on to book 4. And therein lies the problem for me--was totally disappointed on the outcome of the last 2 books. It just didn't quite measure up to the first two books, especially the build up in book 2 where it ended in a (seriously) cliffy. I couldn't even wait for the next one to come, I practically stalked Amazon making sure I didn't miss it. To my chagrin, it was a big disappointment for me. It pretty much covered their day to day lives, like going out to dinner, the evryday going to work, going to functions once in a while and some flashbacks here and there. The only part that got exciting was really at the end. So this 4th book started where the 3rd left off, and the chase begun. Lola one step ahead of Beau so on to another city, he pretty much chase her from city to the next and ended up almost bac to LA. Beau gets down on his kness and begs for forgiveness. Lola played a little hard to get but took him back, of course, she gives Beau the big news...and off they rode into the sunset...ho hum!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJIQ8WOBTQHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9M77YC#wasThisHelpful","R1VJIQ8WOBTQHB","A3UHDN1OOU5BLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHDN1OOU5BLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the tension and the emotional rollercoaster ride this takes you on, there was something about this book that seemed to have even more depth, emotion & richness.The pace never slips and your interest is kept from beginning to end. From the first page you are instantly drawn to Angela, who is not just another typical, clingy and full of angst heroine as one would expect. She is both sincere, smart and gutsy yet so innocent, which is a rare thing to find these days. However, the great thing about Ms.Nissenson is that she always develops both the heroine's and hero's character equally well. Nick Manning is not just a typical playboy, which makes a nice change. It is nice to see that such a dominating person, could be so vulnerable. Nick and Angela are a fictional couple who jump out of the page because Janet makes them real and believable.The remaining cast is made up of a colourful, exciting array of individuals, each with their own past, quirks and motivations. Ms. Nisseson has put a lot of effort into making every single character an enigma, and the richness of the supporting cast adds to the story big time. I find this book so engaging I wouldn't and couldn't put it down if my life dependent on it. (Lol) amazing!!! is what comes to mind to best describe this...here's hoping there's a follow-up book.  an ARC was provided for a truthful and candid review ","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207U8VJ75EAK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTUVAZI#wasThisHelpful","R207U8VJ75EAK1","A3UHDN1OOU5BLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHDN1OOU5BLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As usual, Ms.Le Carre has carefully spun a tale that is guaranteed to snare and entrap you from the very start, like falling in a quicksand and no way of getting out.

"And gives you an unbelievable story and turns it to not only believable but makes you hungry for more! This is well-written with just the right infusion of tension to keep the reader turning its pages. While its quirks and whims seemed predictable, not all are. There are more than enough surprises for even the most jaded of readers will find absorbing and riveting. It is a wonderful story-within-a-story of greed, love, and redemption.The characters are worth knowing and the ones that are not make the story the terrific tension filled that it becomes. It is captivating and beautifully written.DISFIGURED LOVE just further proves to me that Ms.Georgia Le Carre is as good of a suspense writer as a romance writer. Even though to some  readers parts of the book get a bit hard to take, it will keep you turning the pages long into the night. As the intricate plot unfolds, Georgia Le Carre expertly weaves the story together with twists and turns, and shocks at every bend, an enthralling yarn that grabs hold from the start and doesn't let go. No author has, as successfully, jumped from romance writing to the thriller arena, as Ms.Le Carre has, and I don't think anyone will. As with her previous novels, Georgia has penned another blockbuster destined for the number one spot on all the charts!There's a memorable scene in the book where Lena takes one last look at the chairs lined up against the wall, occupied previously by her sisters before they were sold, so nostalgic that it truly sunked in my heart. I felt that gut punching, unequivocal loss as if they were mine. How many authors can accomplish such a feat, giving us a memorable love story combined with heartbreaking story of grief, death and perdtion...with an exciting, unexpected conclusion that makes the reader feel satisfied.

"I can't seem to process what just happened between Beau and Lola--one moment they were making wild, passionate love, next she's going to leave Johnny for him, then--WHAM! It got unbelievably crazy it felt like I got hit by a four wheeler truck. Gosh almighty, it totally blindsided me! What the phok is Beau thinking? I was so in love with him then he turns around and delivered a shocker that knocked me out of breath!Lola was devastated and bewildered, couldn't believe all is real and not just a dream, a nightmare. After going through the scariest life altering experience with Beau, where they could both have lost their life, Lola realized she's fallen hopelessly in love with Beau. The morning after their incredibly hot night together and the night to remember, the morning after, that can never be forgotten and will alter Lola's life forever. Blinded by her love and lust, Lola set out to do exactly what Beau asked, leave Johnny and come to him. As she was about to use Beau's cell phone to call Johnny, a text from Beau's ""sister"", Bridgette, popped on the screen, so cryptic and foreboding that Lola felt her blood run cold. The confrontation ensued, truth revealed, secrets so devastating it's breathtaking. It literally took my breath away. Beau, so beautiful, is in truth a monster. Lola thought he might as well have slapped her, she almost wished he had, because at least she'd be able to feel her pain in a physical way. Instead of as a gaping hole in her heart. But she wasn't finished with Beau, not by a long shot, he'd made mistakes thinking she wasn't paying attention. He'd committed the greatest crime there was--he'd played with love. And nobody should ever be able to get away with that. No, she wasn't finished with Beau, she would break him too. Somehow, some way, Beau would get what he deserved. She wasn't sure how, or when, she only knew one thing, Beau Olivier would be sorry he'd ever laid eyes on her...and the game has just began.The ending just pho king ripped me apart, it's all I could think about, it follows me from room to room.

"Anything written by Ms.Jessica Hawkins is pure bliss to read. It has all the elements you're looking for a book. One thing you need to know before reading one, know that you have all the time and absolutely can not be interrupted because it'll be a struggle to put it down.This is the tale of three strong characters, two (Johnny and Lola) are struggling to keep the bar they bar tend and manage, keep it afloat and stay in business. And the other, Beau, is incredibly wealthy, knows and gets what he want when he wants, a hunk and sinfully devil may care handsome. Together this three renders the readers totally fascinated, intrigued and in awe of that awesome feeling of being torn, should they or should they not accept the proposal.Lola and Beau's undeniably breathtaking animal magnetism is so palpable, the desire so great they are doomed to succumbed to. All the other readers review are all so true, and if I may add, it is full of heat, seduction, so alluring it is pure pleasure to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLOOV7RC59QNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OW7WTT2#wasThisHelpful","RLOOV7RC59QNM","A3UHDN1OOU5BLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHDN1OOU5BLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's no way you can go wrong with $9.99! It has a smooth, soft luxurious feel to it. They do run a little smaller than the actual size but lucky for me, I listened to other reviewers advice, I ordered one size larger than my usual size and it was a perfect fit. If you're concerned of showing your less than perfect arms but want to wear a sexy sleeveless dress, this is heaven sent answer to that dilemma. I couldn't believe it cost less than ten bucks for the feel and the looks and the joy I got from wearing it.The only downside, it only came in black, if they were available in many colors, I would have a closet full of them.

"From the moment I started this book to the very end, my mind was so wrapped up with the story it was a struggle to put it down. The heat and passion, the gripping suspense, knee deep in grifter- mafia deception , it has a bit of everything that makes a book a delightful read.

"If you're like me, who's read almost all the reviews before starting to read this book, you might end up undecided if you should or should just pass it up. I almost did, and a travesty it would be if I passed it up for this is one of the best books I've read.As uncertain as I was in the beginning , I persevered and made it to the finish line, and what a finish it was. Though I did some skimming, mostly on things that were written at length I thought was unnecessary. Such Adelia's parents courtship, equestrian-equine husbandry, steeplechasing, etc. It was so drawn out it got a little too tedious to read. To me, they're simply fillers and in my opinion, a waste of the writer's time and effort. I admit it is a well balanced combination of a lot of things I like in a book and has all the elements of what makes a story shine, distinct.Devastated by the loss of her beloved parents, Adelia tried to put her life back together by pursuing her dream to become a number one equestrian and compete in the Olympics. At a party given for the winners, Adelia met the conniving, scheming, devious, cunning woman that ever existed on planet earth, Karolin, who then introduced Adelia to her twin brother, Miles. It didn't take long before this two dated seriously, sex hot and heavy, oodles of steamy sultry sex scenes, married and got pregnant.I really like that there's a fusion of scheming, black mailing, bitterness, dark secrets that can ultimately destroy the love and fragile bond of Miles and Adelia, trust the deceitful and cunning Karolin to make sure of that. How I love calling her all kinds of names, trust me it's befitting. But thanks to women like Karolin, the devil incarnate, it makes up for an entertaining interesting read.I'm looking forward to reading the next book, sans the unnecessary fillers, I really think this has a great potential to become a bestseller, I even see it as a blockbuster movie film. It would have been a big loss on my part had I decided to skip this entirely. Ms. Belle Ami is a force to be rockened with, just can't wait to get my greedy hands on the 2nd book.

"I'm of two minds about this product- I really like the matte (peach) but I'm less enthusiastic about the dewy (pink) side.The matte side I have been using on the areas next to my nose, where I have large pores and roseacea. It blurs the pores nicely, but barely has enough tint to deal with some of the roseacea. It goes on smooth and silky, and almost instantly feels dry. I like that, having very oily skin in that area. It doesn't last all day, but it has a nice compact and is easy enough to deal with in the middle of the day. I've used it on clean skin and also over oil free sunscreen; it doesn't seem to matter. It works fine either way. I have not tried it over makeup yet but I think it should work fine, because the foundation I use is also oil free (silicon base like the sunscreen).The dewy side I've used on my cheekbones and above my eyes and I have to be really careful not to use too much, because it stays a little sticky if I use even a hair too much, and that drives me batty. Used very sparingly, though, it creates a nice, fresh, look.Neither side has made me break out, and I break out if I put anything remotely oily on my skin.I think this is a really nice product if you have break through in oily areas of your skin, because it's easy to carry and super easy to apply.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R46XSWV9UJIUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3CZGYK#wasThisHelpful","R46XSWV9UJIUX","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This science fiction/horror tale is totally agenda driven. Its about the day that toxic waste, thrown into the creeks, rivers, and earth, become sentient and rise up against humans. Its about as subtle as a sledge hammer with its message that we are destroying the earth.Written in 1991, the novel is sited in the town of Paradise, Pennsylvania, a small to medium sized city. Its large enough to have some industry, and that industry creates waste. So there is a company that deals with relieving businesses of their waste. Problem is, they are not very particular about disposing of said waste. Their subcontractors- redneck yahoos who consider out of sight, out of mind a good working plan- arent any more particular. One day as they dump 55 gallon drums into the creek, the creek itself- joined with the waste already there- rises up. Then there is the nuclear power plant in the county that is starting to sing to itself as all hell breaks looseIts a very grim novel, with lots of vivid gore; the descriptions of what happens to the humans is revolting. I didnt realize until after I read the book that they authors are considered splatter punk kings. There are a lot of characters in the book; sometimes its hard to keep track of them. Sadly, none are fleshed out at all. They are just puppets doing their jobs for the story. The plot is also lacking. The book is powerful, but still a letdown because of that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTR0BZFWV0COU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477806881#wasThisHelpful","RTR0BZFWV0COU","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Violet, Audrey, and Bert are three young people with dreams in 1938 Hollywood, all working at Selznick International studio. Violet wants a husband. Audrey wants to be a film star. Bert wants to go back to college and become an ornithologist. Bert also dreams of Audrey; he has such a massive crush on her he cant see anything but her. And Audrey and Violet have secrets as well as dreams; secrets that could easily destroy those dreams.Their lives play out as Gone With the Wind gets filmed at the studio, starting with the massive burning of Atlanta scenes. After the movie finishes, Audrey and Bert leave Selznick Studio, but the three remain close friends. The story takes us through WW II and after. Audrey and Violet have times when their friendship threatens to implode, but somehow things work out. The story is framed with short chapters set in 2012, when Violets family is cleaning out the bungalow where she and Audrey lived, and a vintage hat accidently gets sent to the consignment store. The hat is one anyone would recognize: its the green velvet hat Scarlet OHara made out of her mothers drapes. How did this come to be in Violets possession?I was disappointed. I couldnt manage to like Violet; she came across as sweet and innocent at first but turned out to be very manipulative. Audrey was okay, but kind of flat. Bert is just a prop for the women to use. They just didnt seem real and the dialogue is stilted. Its almost like the book was a first draft, and the author needed to go back and flesh out the people. Not unreadable but only 3 out of 5 stars.

"I have used Scharffen Berger's baking chocolate before (makes the best flourless chocolate cake EVER), but had not had their eating chocolate before. There are four types of chocolate in this jar- which is quite large and would make a great holiday gift.The milk chocolate is 41% cacao and is the best milk chocolate I've ever tasted. I normally don't even eat milk chocolate I dislike it so much. This, I could eat endlessly. It's smooth, silky, and has a lot of flavor instead of just tasting like wax.The semisweet is 62% cacao and it has some bitterness to it. It's still pretty smooth and is definitely stronger in cacao than supermarket semisweet. It has some interesting nuances to it; kind of spicy and coffee like.The bittersweet is 70% cacao and it's surprisingly grainy, rather like bars with partially ground nibs in them. I don't find this graininess unpleasant. The flavor has a LOT of nuances to it; vanilla, spice, and something I can't identify.The extra dark is 82% cacao, which is slightly less than Lindt's 85 and 90% bars, but for some reason it tastes darker. It's more complex. The texture is about the same as the Lindt, with perhaps just a little bit of graininess. For some reason the adjective 'winey' comes to mind when tasting it.This would make a great gift to the dark chocolate lover but probably not for the milk chocolate aficionado as even the milk chocolate is pretty intense. The little bars (5 gm each) are a great size for a pick me up or a couple for finishing off a meal- the darkness and flavorfulness of the chocolate means you don't need a lot of them to be satisfied. They stand up well to tea and coffee, but not red wine. I didn't try them with white wine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAV0V6GWJIDSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116DEBFO#wasThisHelpful","RAV0V6GWJIDSI","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LeFanu is highly thought of by a lot of horror aficionados, so I was exciting to have a chance to read this book. Dovers edition is not the full volume that was published in the 40s; this book has four stories in it. Green Tea is the tale of a man haunted because hes overstimulated his brain and body with, well, green tea; a demon of sorts follows him everywhere. Squire Tobys Will is the tale of a father and two sons, and what happens when a parent favors one child too much over the other, creating hatred that transcends the grave. The Fortunes of Robert Ardagh and Sir Dominics Bargain are both deals with the devil tales, the second being a superior story. Ardagh fails to deliver the creepiness for some reason.LeFanus prose is lovely, if slow, to read. It comes from the era where something being a fast read wasnt a concern. Its ornamental and lyrical in high Gothic manner. It creates an air of extreme tension in Green Tea, and dread in the others. If you like old school horror, try these tales.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3482VPC6X0TOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014U9ATWA#wasThisHelpful","R3482VPC6X0TOQ","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iris and Her Friends is the second book John Bayley wrote about his wife, novelist and Oxford don Iris Murdoch, and her decline from Alzheimers disease. The term her friends does not refer to people in her life, but to the compensations that her disease brings with it- the fact that she nearly instantly forgets bad things that happen, the warmth of simply holding someone you love, and that she no longer has to obey rules of decorum. Bayley, who had a lot of time to examine all facets of their life while caring for Iris (he took care of her at home up until a couple of weeks before her death), seems to have been determined to see all sides of the situation.Most of the book is about Bayleys life before meeting Iris. He reminisces about his childhood and young adulthood while lying in bed, unable to sleep because Iris is not settled into sleep herself. He was a bookish, introverted lad who stood apart from his older brothers (and his parents) in having no love for golf- they lived on a golf course. He spent most of his childhood playing by himself. While boarding school was hell for him, he took to the military quite well- he knew what was expected of him there. These memories are interspersed with the daily life of caring for Iris- walks, meals (spoon feedings), and the odd habits she developed as her disease progressed. Through it all, despite occasional episodes of rage on his part due to sheer frustration, is the love that held them together for so many decades.While not as incredible a book as Elegy for Iris, its a thoughtful and moving treatise on love and loss- when the person you lose is still right in front of you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B521NJWIC6S5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393320790#wasThisHelpful","R1B521NJWIC6S5","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In The Silvered, the world is similar to ours during the Victorian era. Except there are werewolves, mages who can control different elements, and magical artifacts from the past. There are also guns and airships. Its vaguely steampunk in feel, even though there is no actual steam technology.Mirian Maylin, 19 years old, has some mage blood. She has tested as having powers in several elements, but has not progressed beyond first level in any of them. She has been invited to *not* come back to the university next semester because she performs so poorly. Her mothers biggest worry is that Marian might not attract the attention of someone of the Pack, and marry into it. Marian does not care if she ever gets married.We start the book with a war beginning; the Empire is attacking the country of Aydori and has declared Pack members to be abominations. A rather garbled warning from a Soothsayer has Emperor Leopald kidnap the top five members of the Mage pack. Mirian finds herself in the position to follow the Mage pack to the Empires capital city and try and rescue them. She also finds herself in the company of Tomas Hagen, younger brother to the Pack leader, and, with Captain Reiter of the Empire forces following her because they think shes the missing sixth member of the Mage pack.I really liked the characters; Mirian is strong, smart, and stubborn (and, according to Hunt Pack members, smells amazing- a sign of mage powers) and she and Tomas have to grow up a lot in just a few days. While they find themselves partners by chance, they work very well together. Likewise the kidnapped Mage pack leader, Danika, has to face great personal loss along with physical and psychological abuse but stands up to it. I should warn you there is a lot of brutality in this book; its set during a war and it doesnt bring out the best in a lot of the soldiers. It also shows the peril of dehumanizing others; it makes it far too easy for people to discount the worth of their lives.The book ties up all the loose ends- even though as I got near the end of the book I couldnt figure out how the author would manage that in such a short number of pages. But Id forgotten how good a writer and world builder Tanya Huff is; parts of the ending are very unexpected, its neatly done, and, while this is a standalone novel, there are a few things that could lead into another volume set in this world if she wanted.

"I'm not even sure where to start talking about this program. It's so huge and does so many things that I'm completely overwhelmed.I should say that I've been using an ancient paint/draw program- Photo Impact 8. Before that, I had Corel Draw 3 & PhotoPaint. So, I'm way behind the times. But I have been a constant user of paint and draw software, using it for illustrations to accompany articles.Painter 2016 combines both photo manipulation and drawing from scratch. It allows you to mimic real world drawing/painting techniques (oils, inks, watercolors, pastels- you name it, it's got it) and some techniques that are unique to digital media. And obviously, you can combine the two. Some of the natural techniques have been improved: in the real world, you have different textures of substrate, and they most often have grain to them. If you turn then in different directions v. the orientation of your brush strokes, different effects are created. Likewise, a fluid brushstroke will look different if put on paper laying flat versus paper on an easel. You can mimic those effects in Painter 2016. Other new things to this version are Dynamic Speckles and Particles, which are unique to digital - there is nothing like this in natural media. I don't quite understand them yet, but they look kind of space age and fantasy oriented. They've also improved blending (something I've always had a problem with). Then there is Audio Expression, where you run music into your computer and Painter converts the sound into visual effects. I'm honestly not sure how useful this will be, but it's fun to  play with for a while. This version also offers more brushes with more options available to the brushes than before, and you can import Adobe brushes.It has a steep learning curve if you're not using, say, the previous version of Painter. Thankfully, there is a lot of tips included, and there is a lot of help online. That's one thing I don't like: you have to have a connection to use tutorials, rather than having the tutes resident on the computer. It saves a lot of hard drive space that way (the users guide is over 700 pages long; I haven't decided if I want to save that file to the hard drive yet!), but is a pain if you're out in the country and want to use it. Also, you need a fast computer. I put it on my 5 year old laptop, and there is a lot of lag after every action. It's not so bad as to be unacceptable, but kind of annoying. The work space is very customizable, so you don't have to work around tool boxes you're not using on a particular project.This is going to be a fun program.

"Ever since this book & movie came out in the 70s, Ive heard about how scary it was. I was very disappointed in it now that Ive finally gotten around to reading it.American ambassador to England, Jeremy Thorn and his wife Katherine, after a couple of miscarriages, are having a baby. But when Thorn gets to the hospital, the priest in charge tells him the baby has died. But a mother with no next of kin has just died giving birth. The baby is healthy and has no one to take it. Will Thorn adopt the baby, pretending its his own, lying even to his psychologically fragile wife? Yes, yes he will. He never even sees the body of his own baby.Four years later, bad things start happening around Damian. The nanny commits suicide at his fourth birthday party. A new nanny appears the next day out of the blue, without anyone calling the agency. Katherine begins to get neurotic as the boy gets closer to the nanny and withdrawing from her. A priest follows Thorn, babbling strange warnings. A paparazzo who follows Thorn finds ghostly images in the photos he takes; on the nanny before her dramatic suicide, on the priest who follows Thorn. Animals fear Damian, except for a mysterious black dog that keeps getting into the house. Churches induce a hysterical fear in him. What is the child? Is he the antichrist?Sadly, the book didnt induce even mild fear in me. I think the problem is that you have to believe in Satan to be scared by this book, and I dont. So while I felt tension, waiting to see who lived and who died, it couldnt really creep me out. The book has flaws, too. The characters are two dimensional; no one is really likable. There is no depth to the story. I think the problem may be that Seltzer was also the screenwriter, and I think the screenplay may have come before the novel. In a movie, things arent described for us. The actors facial expressions, the set designers, the lighting person, all add the depth missing from the printed word in the screenplay. I think it didnt occur to Seltzer to add these cues for the novel reader.Meh.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1UPEGEBHE1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P52LG6#wasThisHelpful","RE1UPEGEBHE1F","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cat food is made from good stuff. No grains. Low fat pollock fish for the main protein. It has all kinds of things like Omega 3 fatty acids, pumpkin, blueberries, broccoli, vitamins, and probiotics. It achieves its weight control  properties by having lower fat and higher fiber than the average cat food, but it also packs a LOT of nutrition in a small amount of food. There is nothing in this food that I wouldn't eat myself (in different format, of course)Our cats hate most weight control foods, and even most touted as 'healthy'. But our butterball ate this food readily. Two others also ate it just fine. Two rejected it, but one of those seems to live on air anyway- he's very, very picky. That's three out of five cats eating it readily. So this food is just as palatable as any standard cat food- which is VERY unusual. It's very, very pricey, though, so I can't give it five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMFM3F1G3Z79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTKQG#wasThisHelpful","R2DMFM3F1G3Z79","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 7th century AD, young Hild, who attends her queen, is chosen as the handmaid of Eostre. She goes about blessing the plants and animals to insure their fertility. The handmaid serves for one year, when a new one is chosen. Hild, however, turns out to be the last handmaid, as the rulers of the land turn away from the old religions and adopt Christianity. While Hilds king holds to the old religion of Woden and Thor, the queen is a Christian.England as a unified country does not exist yet. Numerous kings battle constantly over land and resources. Many marriages are made to cement peace treaties; every royal girl must expect this to happen to them. Hild did not expect this to happen to her, but it turns out she has enough royal blood to be a bargaining chip. A marriage that is loveless at first is arranged for her and she has to leave the people she grew up with. This wont last long though; the incessant battles mean she is driven from her new home.Hild is a very resourceful woman. She knows the healing arts and is skilled in running a household. As she finds herself pushed from place to place during a hard life, she always manages to make the best of her situation; not just making things better for herself, but for those around her. She finds herself curious about this new religion, as joyous Christian brothers roam the land, spreading their faith. She learns to read and write, copying their books and memorizing them. Gradually, without really thinking about it, she finds herself the leader of a Christian community, where despite their poverty, everything is shared.Of course even they are buffeted by raids and wars. Brothers and bishops are killed. The plague wipes out a huge segment of the population. But a change as big as the baptism of the population comes when one bishop takes on the ways of Rome, insisting on gathering riches for the church, forsaking the vow of poverty, and making the accoutrements of the church and the bishop-hood of gold and silk.The book covers Hilds life in detail from childhood to death. It vividly portrays the hardships of the era- no one, including royalty- had comfortable, easy lives. People slept on straw. Food was scarce, particularly in drought years or when raids occurred. Medicine consisted of a few herbal remedies. Every single thing had to be made from scratch. But despite the vividness of the settings and the details of everyday life, the book is slow and pretty unexciting. Hild is strong, smart, and of good heart, but she never really springs into life on the page. The book was interesting, but not really gripping. And I found the portrayal of the Old Norse religion as evil annoying. Just because it was different doesnt mean it was evil.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KGV4MNT0VPHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782641548#wasThisHelpful","R2KGV4MNT0VPHO","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this sequel to Poes The Fall of the House of Usher, McCammon proposes that not all of the Usher family died at the end of the story, that a brother lived on. And while the brother had the Usher Malady, he also had the power to attract good things to him And the family prospered, beyond all imagination. But the power did not come without strings attached; while materially blessed, the people of the family all have major problems.Rix Usher is the family black sheep; he escaped the family estate and has had a career as an author, but now he finds himself with writers block. When his father sends the older son, Boone, to fetch him to his death bed, he decides to go, despite swearing hed never go back. This places him in a veritable cornucopia of weirdness.This is, bar none, the gothiest novel I have ever read. We have a southern mansion. We have a mother who refuses to accept that her husband is dying, even though hes rotting away- literally. An alcoholic, gambling, wife beating, bully of an elder brother. A sister who has done exceedingly well in business as a model, but is a drug addict. A lodge in the middle of the family estate that no one lives in that Rix got shut into as a child for two long, dark, terrifying days; a building that changes its layout on a whim. Mountain folk just outside the estate who believe in the Mountain King (good guy) and the Pumpkin Man (very bad guy who steals children), and a huge black panther named Greediguts. There is the teenage mountain boy who finds he has supernatural powers. There is also the ruins of a town that was smashed apart years ago buy comets. A newspaper owner who wants to know whats going on with the family patriarch and her father, writing a history of the Usher family. And then there is the soul voices of reason: the head caretaker and his wife, who basically raised Rix, the only people who showed him love when he was growing up.There is a LOT going on in this book. Every time you turn around there is a new twist. Almost no one is what they seem. There is a mix of supernatural, technical, and human evil. Threat is everywhere. This is one of the creepiest books Ive ever read, despite it being so over the top. And it is very, very, over the top.

"Jon Childes has found a peaceful life. He lives on one of the Channel Islands, working at three different schools teaching computer science. His ex-wife and daughter live in England, but hes found a new relationship with a fellow teacher, Amy Sebire. He hopes the horror from his past is gone forever.But its not. Once again, the psychic visions are occurring. Once again, hes made a connection with the mind of a vicious murderer. When this happened before, Childes was able to convince a police detective that he was for real, and together they caught the killer. The visions and the stress they caused were the cause of his marriage collapsing. This time, not only is he seeing what the murderer is doing, but the killer is aware of Childes, too. And he wants to hurt him. He is making his way closer and closer to Childes, hurting the people he cares about.There is an air of constant menace to this book. Despite a good number of scenes taking place in daytime, I felt it was always dark. The atmosphere was very well done. Sadly, I did not much like Childes, and the women in the story are not fleshed out at all- his ex-wife is frankly unbelievable.

"Think of an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer taking place, with creatures blowing up the high school, people being killed, and strange things happening. Now think about the people who are living with these events, but arent part of the Scooby Gang, people who arent in on the secret events, people who dont have special powers to save the world. This book is about those people. Sounds boring? Its not.Mike Mitchell is our narrator. He has OCD, and is in love with his best female friend, Henna, but she doesnt know it. Or doesnt admit to knowing it. His sister, Mel, had anorexia but is in recovery. Their kid sister, Meredith is possibly a genius. Their father is a fairly useless drunk, with basically no involvement in the family, while their mother is a politician, who seems to regard her family as a political asset or liability. Shes extremely unlikeable. Mikes best friend is Jared, who is gay, and just happens to be the grandson of the Goddess of Cats. This makes him very attractive to cats, including mountain lions, and gives him the ability to heal others. Hes the odd man in this circle of friends; he has superpowers, but isnt involved in the supernatural crisis. Hes considered a normal kid. That bit seems pretty strange.Every chapter starts with a few lines about what the super friends- the indie kids, as they are called- are up to with the aliens/demons/whatever. Mike and his friends arent even interested in whats happening on that front. Mike hits a zombie deer with his car, and while it seems odd, hes not really concerned about the fact that the deer is a zombie. All he wants to do is go to the prom with Henna, and graduate without the school getting turned into a hellmouth or something.The story amused me. On the cover we see a bunch of teenagers, the four in color being Mike & Co, while in monochrome are a girl with a stake, a kid with a wand and cloak, someone with a bow & arrow, someone sparkly, and a lot of others- the people from all the supernatural YA books, movies, and TV shows. They are in the background, while the normal kids are the focus. The story is totally character driven, and the kids really come alive. Mike annoyed me at times with his neediness, but that is a part of his anxiety complex that drives his OCD. I understand that. I have OCD, too, and it was nice to see it accurately portrayed. I dont know if the authors other work has the dry humor this one does, but Ill be reading some to find out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT38LV00OVSOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","RT38LV00OVSOG","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Queens Own Fool is Nicola, who is given the nickname La Jardiniere. La Jardinaiere was real, although we know almost nothing about her. Yolan and Harris have used her as a lens to view the life of Mary Stuart, the Queen of France and of Scotland.Mary, at the time Queen of France, buys orphaned Nicola from her uncles entertainment troop when she is a girl. Nicola is witty and, more important, honest. Mary values honesty above all- she hears so little of it at court- and relies on Nicola to remind her that she, despite being Queen, is mortal like her subjects. The novel takes us through the death of the young King of France and Marys decision to live in Scotland, so she can rule rather than being an extraneous female for her uncles to marry off to further their political aims. This turns out to be a bad decision; Scotland is full of internal strife between Catholics (which Mary is one of) and the Protestant rebels. She walks into this situation fairly blindly and makes her situation worse by marrying pretty boy Lord Darnley. No one likes Darnley; hes ambitious politically but mannerless, forces himself on serving women, cares nothing for the people of Scotland, and rather reminds me of Donald Trump. Mary is helpless as rebels take over the country.Ive never much cared for Mary Stuart; she always struck me as fairly witless and ruled by her heart rather than attempting good governance - not good traits in a queen. Seeing her through Nicolas eyes, though, I could see other sides to Mary; she was kind and smart (in book learning, at least). She was a woman in the wrong place at the wrong time; a pawn of first her uncles, then the rebels, then prisoner of her cousin Elizabeth I of England. Other than her years at the court of France, she led a pretty sad life. Nicolas version of Mary made me sympathetic to her as a woman who cared deeply for her friends and her people.Nicola herself is witty, brave, and fast thinking. She acts as Marys eyes and ears when Mary is held prisoner and helps her out of several scrapes. Nicola is almost too good to be true, but I enjoyed her and think she makes a great heroine for the YA crowd for which this book was written. This was a fast, couldnt put it down read for me. While I knew there could be no happy ending for Queen Mary, I couldnt help but be rooting for her and being tense over a lot of the scenes, hoping for the best. Great book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2I58N7CYNY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0698119185#wasThisHelpful","R1E2I58N7CYNY7","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Golem of Paris is a much, much darker tale than its predecessor, The Golem of Hollywood. At the end of that story, protagonist Jacob Lev found out that his mother, Bina, who he thought had died when he was a child, was alive, catatonic, and locked up in a mental institution.  This book is in large part her story, of what she went through that drove her mad  and how it ties into the mystical Golem storyline.The other main storyline is the police case that Lev is on. Assigned to scanning and digitizing cold cases in an old warehouse, he finds himself intrigued by a gruesome ten year old case of the murder of a mother and son. Its a very unique MO, and Special Projects (the division of LAPD that Lev became of part of in TGOH, which seems to be staffed mainly people who may not be quite human) okays him to go to Paris to investigate.Like TGOH, TGOP is all over the map. Millionaire Russians, a really intense fight scene that seems unwinnable, Czech black ops, the supernatural; its all in there. Like TGOH, TGOP does not resolve all the issues by the end, but Lev (and us readers) have learned enough to make us even more avid to find out how it all resolves. What exactly are the Special Projects people? Why is the spirit of the Golem so dangerous? And what else is Levs father, a rabbinical scholar, hiding? He hid that Bina was alive and that he and Jacob are direct descendants of the Rabbi of Prague; there has to be more. Hes in the story too much *not* to be more than he appears.The story can be hard to follow at times. I found myself having to go back to the start of chapters frequently to figure out exactly who and when the scene is about. But I found it worth the effort. Looking forward to seeing where this series takes us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSXJUMN9WCNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171738#wasThisHelpful","R3MSXJUMN9WCNT","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1909, Samuel Clemens- Mark Twain- first blessed the marriage of his secretary, Isabel Lyon, to his business manager, Ralph Ashcroft, and then, one month later, fired them both and went on a rampage of invective against Lyon. Why did he do this after shed served him for seven years? He claimed- in newspapers as well as in a 400 page manuscript- she stole from him, she was a drunk, she lied, and that she had attempted to seduce him. He took back the small house hed deeded over to Lyon and her mother. Clemens and Lyon had previously enjoyed a close- some in the household said too close- relationship. What happened?Most took Clemens version at face value. But author Cullen had access to Lyons diary that she kept during her time in Clemens employ. A very different story emerged from that, one that clears Lyons name. This novel brings Lyons time with Clemens to life and shows us a side of Clemens not usually seen: how he hated the persona of Mark Twain that he had invented to charm the American public, a persona he felt obliged to keep alive no matter what it did to his family. And he was a man who constantly sought attention and love.The story covers the time of his beloved wife dying; his collecting of young girls as angelfish; the death of his daughter Jean; his meeting with Helen Keller, Anne Sullivan, and Sullivans husband John Macy; the affair of his daughter Clara with her married musical accompanist and her subsequent marriage to another man, and Lyons own marriage. Cullens use of period details- dress, home dcor, transportation, and more- bring the story to life. Lyon emerges as a good woman who has the misfortune to love someone unsuitable for her; Clemens seems to be a considerably darker figure that the Mark Twain we are introduced to in school. Very interesting if sad story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V59JZU5NUQVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476758964#wasThisHelpful","R1V59JZU5NUQVE","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beasts is a collection of 16 weird tales by Detzner. Some are previously published but the majority are new to this book. A mix of horror and dark fantasy, some with humor. A goddess choose to live as a mortal for a while. A woman is reborn every year. One of those creepy animatronic animal bands in a pizza joint is put back into service. A stage magician proves to be more than he appears to be. A giant computer that achieves sentience makes a very odd choice. A billionaire who is an animate skeleton throws a party. A woman makes a friend-or pet- out of a tentacled creature from the ocean.  One story- Shadow reminded me of Ray Bradburys work. Some made me think of things I read decades ago, in Hitchcock magazines.I enjoyed most of the stories; I think some could use more polish.

"This gel is very nice for oily skin or combination skin like I have- it's oil free and I've not broken out in my oily zones but it's moisturizing enough for the dry parts of my face and neck. I've been using it exclusively since receiving it and my skin is in pretty good shape for now! The green tea extract (actually Epigallocatechin Gallate, one of the prime polyphenols in green tea) is high in the list of ingredients, it has a good amount of Sodium Hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid) for moisturizing, a retinol, allantoin (a healing agent), and is a water & silicone gel that's very unlikely to clog pores. I love the scent, which seems moderate when put on but vanishes right away. I'm hoping that continued use will decrease the redness I have from mild roscecea, but that is really hard to judge without really good photographic evidence.

"Do no harm is paraphrased in the Hippocratic Oath that medical students are all exposed to first thing. Its the common principal in all medicine, but is especially stressed in neurosurgery, where the possibility for harm is so high. Henry Marsh has been a top neurosurgeon in Great Britain for many years and shares his stories of the trade here.Each chapter is named for and explores the treatment of a different neurological problem; meningioma, pituitary adenoma, infarct. Each chapter features a different patient; we see how the patient came to Marsh, how the operation went, and sometimes we see how they fared. Not always; sometimes they are whisked way back to the hospital that referred them, rather them leaving them under the care of the surgeon. So there are times that the author had no idea how they ultimately turned out.The descriptions of the problems and the way they are treated fascinated me, but beware if you are squeamish- the author describes things pretty vividly. But his book is not just about operations; its also about his own life, the about the NHS system in England. The system limits not just patient care but the hours doctors can work, which can make arranging long operations difficult. New doctors dont have time enough to learn all they should. Marsh describes taking this out on nurses, anesthesiologists, clerks, and more- while an empathic, caring, man with patients, he seems to have been an ass to those he worked with at times- and admits it.I couldnt put this book down. It was like reading a series of exciting stories, watching Marshs expertise and character grow. And I love a good medical description.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDPGD9Q4IP7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006581X#wasThisHelpful","R3KDPGD9Q4IP7P","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This prevents wasting paper. I have a spindle type paper towel holder, so there is no problem with it fitting on my holder.

"Psychogeography is, in Ellards opinion, how our surroundings affect our moods and behavior. How plants make any place seem better- and make people less apt to destroy things. How featureless concrete expanses make a person nervous and unwilling to linger. How surroundings can awe, suffocate, sooth, or tempt a person (think the insides of shopping malls). He explains how and why people have these reactions, and how they can be used to manipulate people. He also goes into how digital technology is changing things, and how it could be used to alienate or integrate.This is important stuff for any architect, designer, or city planner. Its also helpful for just about anyone who wants to understand why the feel the way they do in certain environments. One part I especially liked was when he wrote about Temple Grandins slaughter house designs that keep cattle calm instead of panicked as they go to their deaths- this is manipulation at its most obvious. How many places do we frequent that affect us in a similar way without our ever being aware of it? The book is technical but easily readable.

"Georgiana Spencer, born in 1757, was not your typical court lady of the time. She was seventeen when she married the 5th Duke of Devonshire, twenty years her senior. Like many men of the time, he made no pretense of being faithful, but the Duke went further than usual. He fell in love with Georgianas best friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster, and moved her into the house. The three lived together for the next 25 years. Georgiana loved Bess as much as the Duke did, so it was not the horror story that some have made of it. Whether Georgiana and Bess were lovers is not known, but they seemed satisfied with sharing the Duke.Her living arrangements (and her own love affairs) have overshadowed the fact that Georgiana was very politically active. In a time when women could not vote, Georgiana held parties to sway political affiliations and lobbied hard for the Whig contingent and was very politically influential. Living in the turbulent time that King George III was slipping in and out of madness meant various political factions were jockeying for power, and Georgiana had the ability to create a spectacle to attract people.Georgiana was always in debt. She was a gambling addict and ran up tremendous IOUs; but she was also extremely generous with money to her friends and family. The Duke bailed her out many times and still, she died in debt. She was also an amateur scientist and a collector of mineral specimens. Her interests were far ranging.She was a fascinating woman and a lot of correspondence was left from, to, and about, her. This helped the author, along with a huge list of books, bring the Duchess to life. Parts of the book are fast reading; the parts about politics were, to me, slow going and frankly bored me, but necessary as so much of Georgianas life was about politics. Not the easiest read but well worth the effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PDWSBNSLETE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375753834#wasThisHelpful","R28PDWSBNSLETE","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like all things labeled 'Healthy', these treats are not on the cat's 'most favored' list. They eat them, but not in a frenzy like they do regular kitty crack. At first they were tentative to taste them; they sniffed them for a while before starting in on them. The finicky cat won't eat them at all; thankfully, the one with urinary problems will eat three or four at a sitting, which is good because he can really use the cranberry that's in them. I wish the cats liked these better, because they really are full of healthy things.

"This is a very nice piece of cast iron cookware. It has a nice, thick, bottom and the handle is heavy enough that it's not going to snap off like some I've seen. The casting is nice and tight; while it's not buffed slick it doesn't have any pinholes or big lumps. Very good quality.It said it was pre-seasoned, but I was dubious about that. Turned out it really is; we made quesadillas first and they came off perfectly. Did a fried egg next, with only about 1/4 teaspoon of butter, and it had absolutely no sticking problems. I love the large, flat area that allows a lot of bacon to be fried flat instead of curving up the sides of a skillet! This piece will get a lot of use in our kitchen, and not just for Mexican food- although it will be perfect for making tortillas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I627S6Y216FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAAR4HE#wasThisHelpful","R3I627S6Y216FP","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Born in 1879 and living until 1964, Alma Schindler Mahler Gropius Werfel lived a long life. She lived through two world wars, outlasted two husbands (Mahler and Werfel), divorced another one (Gropius), was constantly unfaithful, drank too much, was a virulent anti-Semite despite marrying two Jewish men and having affairs with many more, was emotionally abusive to pretty much every one around her- especially her husbands, lovers, and children-, thought Hitler had kind eyes, was self-deluded and self-aggrandizing, was a great fan of the arts, and was greedy. Yet men of genius flocked to her. Painters, writers, composers, architects, sculptors, conductors, politicians, and more all became lovers or friends. And to be either of those things, you had to be a vocal admirer. Any criticism of her and she was an enemy. So what did this woman have that other women didnt? I confess that I am no closer to understanding that I was before reading the book.She was physically attractive, but not exceptionally so. She knew how to decorate a house and to throw a party. She had composed a few songs described as slight before meeting Mahler, who put an end to her composing  Apparently she must have been a good conversationalist, to have interested so many people. A number of her lovers remained attracted to her long after their affairs were over- was she that good in bed?Was she a muse? Mahler, Gropius and Werfel were all pretty well along in their careers when she met them, so they didnt need to her create. Werfel wrote a large number of plays and books after becoming Almas husband, but part of that is because she demanded that he support her in the style to which she was accustomed. To do most of his writing, he most often fled to another city until he was finished with the project- those long separations may possibly be why their marriage lasted so long.Its a mystery. I was rather revolted by the picture of Alma that emerged from the book. Hilmess research is impeccable; he waded through boxes of correspondence and diaries. Alma kept a rather thorough record of her life and relationships, although she self-censored it at some point. That she destroyed some diaries and letters is probably a good thing; as it was, her memoir, En Leben was so full of sex that it was sold from under bookstore counters like pornography (bearing in mind that this was 1959). Her story is interesting-Alma and Werfels escape from Europe as Hitlers armies took over was enough to make me hold my breath- but most of the book moves very slowly. Because of her character, I cant say I really enjoyed the book. Just as I thought she couldnt get any worse, shed do or say something unforgivable. And yet, so many in her life forgave her constantly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WOEC4OJ19PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555537898#wasThisHelpful","R6WOEC4OJ19PO","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1888, in New York City, Mary Handley gets fired from her sweatshop job just in time to get appointed as a detective on the New York police force- the first woman to be on the force. Given the attitudes of the time, she is harassed by the men on the force and hounded by the press. But shes determined to solve the murder of Charles Goodrich, barely retired accountant for Thomas Edison and fianc of her friend. Through the course of Marys investigation, she meets Edison, J.P. Morgan, Nikola Tesla, a hired assassin, and a young man who woos her but turns out not to be as he seems. She finds herself followed, beaten, drugged, and lied to. But Mary is not your typical girl of this era; she knows jujitsu and is not afraid to fight. Although there are numerous people that look to have a reason for murder, the actual murderer turns out to be a complete surprise.This is Levys first novel, and I have to say it shows in places. Mary is a, well, Mary Sue despite being authored by a man. She thinks a little too modernly to be totally believable, and speaks a little too modern era, too. I enjoyed the story, and feel the era was pretty well depicted, as well as the historical figures although Im sure many readers will be upset by Edisons portrayal. The story is based on a real event; Mary Handley was real and indeed helped to solve the murder. There was just a little too much explaining things to readers instead of just showing them; this looks to be the first of series so Im hoping the author gets better with time as there is promise here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ2BK5QYZL9GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418920#wasThisHelpful","RJ2BK5QYZL9GR","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an exceptional book on designing and creating shirts. It assumes you know basic sewing; this is not a book about sewing. Coffin deconstructs shirts into five different blocks or basic shapes: dress shirt, sport shirt, knit shirt, folk shirt, and shirt jacket. He also shows various collars-so many collars!-, cuffs and pockets with glorious details. By adding these collars & cuffs to the various blocks, you have nearly limitless options in your shirt- any of which, of course, can be used in a womens blouse just as well.He does show some sewing tips: sewing without pins (wow), stitching seams, how to fold and put together a placket, and the best way to turn a point- essential for nice looking collars. Along the way are example shirts, designer pages and what theyve made, how to copy an existing shirt, and pages of helpful resources: books, classes, software, and websites. There is also bonus material- mainly patterns- that will be available online but as of today (6/22/2015) only some of it seems to be working.This is one of those books that I know Ill turn to again and again. While not a tailoring book, the author does give a lot of tips. One thing that fascinated me was how the Duke of Windsors collars were made- obviously of the highest quality but a method that looks incomplete from the wrong side! It has a purpose, of course- to reduce bulk. Its things like that that make this book so interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHLUF6HT24BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589238265#wasThisHelpful","RSHLUF6HT24BS","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1881, a Chinese mandarin is beheaded for speaking the truth to the Emperor, leaving his 7 year old daughter, Jinhua,  orphaned, as her mother died giving birth to her. His First Wife promptly sells her, and she, the pampered child who has unbound feet and the ability to read, ends up in a low class brothel and forced into being  a money tree at just shy of twelve years old. The only person who is kind to her through this is the brothel maid, Suyin. Her career is cut mercifully short, however, when a high government official, Subchancellor Hong, visits and decides she is the reincarnation of his old love. Jinhuas life takes her not just to the upper class again, but to Vienna, and to Peking during the Boxer Rebellion.Sai Jinhua was a real woman, and through the years much of the detail of her life has been lost, altered, and made legendary. The author has done her research, not just into Jinhuas life but the lives of those who knew (or might have known) her, and into the conditions in China during the period, but of course, given all the varying histories she has had to make choices about which ones to use and breathe life into the story. The story comes off as (mostly) real feeling, but drags at times. The last part of the book drags- which is odd, considering what violent events take place in it. I came away with great sympathy for Jinhua- and even more of Suyin. In this book, Jinhua is totally human, with both good and bad aspects to her character. Not the best example of this type of novel, but this is a first effort and the author has great promise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16RTBZ8BHVNQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525955135#wasThisHelpful","R16RTBZ8BHVNQ7","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1966, twenty-two year old Goldstein walked into the Village Voice and invented the job he wanted: rock critic. During his time doing this, he had some amazing adventures and met a lot of the great rock innovators. He became friends with Janis Joplin, was a passenger in a car driven by a completely stoned Dennis Wilson (who at one point in the trip said Whoa! The road is doing these weird things.), and had the Velvet Underground play at his wedding. But in this time of social upheaval, music came to seem less important than politics and protests. His beat changed to protests, he became friends with Abbie Hoffman, and hung with the Black Panthers. Later he became a chronicler of pop culture, and then a worker for gay rights.The book really only spans a few years, but so much happened during that time- the core of the hippie subculture came and went. Music went from being all about the music to selling out to commercial interests. The drug scene went from happy, smiling potheads to bikers selling the hard, injectable stuff. The innocence was lost.The book is a personal memoir, but Goldsteins life is inextricably meshed with so much of the history of the time that you cannot tease them apart. He changed as the times did.I loved reading this book; I was born in 1954 so I was too young to appreciate much of what was happening in the world even though I was aware of it. This was a nice trip back through time, viewed through a critical eye.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ROI85DCIW2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620408872#wasThisHelpful","R37ROI85DCIW2T","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have loved pretty much every book Alice Hoffman has written, so I was excited to receive this one for early review. For the most part, I was not disappointed.In 1817, on the small Caribbean island of St. Thomas, teen aged Rachel Pomie, member of the small Jewish community, is told by her father that he has arranged a marriage for her. Her father and the prospective groom wish to merge their businesses, and the groom, thirty years older than Rachel, is a recent widower with three small children. Despite her dreams of going to Paris, Rachel enters the marriage with surprising dignity and maturity. Now she is trapped on St. Thomas.Luckily Monsieur Isaac Petit is a man ahead of his time. He loved his first wife and is gentle and thoughtful with Rachel, viewing her as a partner in the job of raising a family.  Rachel makes friends with the Petits maid, as well as with the ghost of the first Mrs. Petit. But when Isaac suddenly dies, she finds herself alone with seven children, and no money- in their community, women cannot inherit anything. Everything she has thought she owned is now the property of Isaacs family in France. A nephew will be sent to sort things out and run the business. Rachel finds this infuriating.When the nephew- several years Rachels junior- appears, they fall in love. According to their communitys laws, they are family even though there is no blood shared between them, and thus cannot marry. Shunned when they have an affair despite lack of blessing from a rabbi, Rachel moves heaven and earth to obtain the blessing of the rabbi and be married after several years of effort. Anything can be done for love.Which is why it is so ironic that when their youngest son, Camille Pizarro who will be acclaimed as the father of Impressionism, falls in love with the cooks daughter, Rachel refuses to give her blessing to the match. The girls is both working class and not Jewish.This is not just the story of Rachel and her husbands. Its also about the love between sisters- even when the sister cannot be acknowledged; parental love; love that must be kept hidden; the horror of slavery; the lack of womens rights in the 19th century; the persecution of Jews; and magic. There is a lot going on in this story, on several levels. Its told so beautifully that the story leapt into my mind in glowing color. St. Thomas is a place of incredible physical beauty and the sense of place, both there and in Paris, is very important to the story. I have to admit that while Rachel is a very sympathetic character in the first portion, she is much less so later on, and we have no way of knowing why she changes so. But people do change when the shoe is on the other foot. A wonderful story that held me totally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZF882RI4Y89K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451693591#wasThisHelpful","R2ZF882RI4Y89K","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a work of urban fantasy/science fiction that never stops moving. Widowed accountant Jacob Hanley is about to eat lunch at a restaurant when an old man collapses in front of him, warning him about Symbios and the Great Elder, and dies. When the EMTs take the body away, Jacob discovers that the old man left a business card on the table. Then the coroner finds that the old man was only 30 years old. Jacob not only becomes curious but feels the mans family should be notified.. and the police cant find anyone home to tell. When Jacob makes a trip to the mans house himself, he finds himself trapped by two thugs who are ransacking the house. Suddenly his world is upended, in an adventure that will involve his policeman brother, a dirty policeman, an accountant at Symbios, a PI with mixed allegiances, and the Great Elder, a genius who may have gone too far. The whole world is at stake by the end.This story really held my interest. The characters are well done (especially Frank, the PI), the threat is complex and seemingly unstoppable, the action nonstop. My only beef with the story is the ending- there are a whole lot of loose ends. This is obviously the first book in a series- but youre not told that until you get to the end and suddenly there is a big lack of explanations.

"I find myself torn, as I so frequently am with anthologies, between great enthusiasm and complete boredom concerning this book. Some of the stories I found excellent; some were little more than scenes or prose poems. Most are not what Ive come to expect from standard steampunk; while there are airships and robotics and alternate histories, there is not the perky heroine and handy, well dressed hero racing through an Indiana Jones type adventure. Many of these stories tackle racism, colonialism, sexism, and class stratification. Many also desert the usual Victorian London or American wild West settings so common in steampunk; we find ourselves in Haiti and Meso-America as well as other places. I applaud the inclusion of these tales that stretch the usual boundaries of steampunk, but some of them could have been a lot more interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZ00FASPG1CO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762444681#wasThisHelpful","R1QZ00FASPG1CO","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I thought this product was working; then I got up one morning and the plants- some only a couple of inches from the Deer Off units- had been either eaten to the ground or pulled right out of the ground. So I think it was just good luck that my plants weren't getting eaten before that point- that, or the units don't work for more than 3 weeks. Not sure which.The other problem with them is that the metal wires to put them on are not the rigid stakes like you see in the picture; they are thin wires. They come curved into a U shape to fit into the box; you straighten them out and put them in the ground. They sway and bob and cannot hold the weight of the units up more than half way. This means that the unit sits kind of on its side, which may allow water to get into the bad smelling stuff that is supposed to keep the deer away, which would mean shorter life of the product.I'm not impressed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYILG7CPEL2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9Q38JQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UYILG7CPEL2O","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The authors family wasnt close- in fact, theyd decided that they worked better living in different cities. But now Weavers Seattle based brother has two children and another on the way, and her 70-ish mother decides she needs to move to that city. When they see a very unpromising property- a rundown old house with a huge, overgrown lot with fruit trees and berry bushes- they cant get it out of their heads. The mother buys the house because of the food producing prospect; Weaver is enthused because her happiest childhood memories revolved around a garden. Her brother doesnt care.Weavers mother has had a hard life; never loved or wanted as a child she then finds herself abandoned by her husband with one small child and another on the way. As the sole support of her small family, she tried to always have food growing, so that no matter what, the children wouldnt starve. Now, despite them all living in relative prosperity, she feels compelled to continue with this habit. Weaver sees the garden as an opportunity not just to indulge her love of gardening, but to bring her family closer.The family story runs parallel with the gardening one; tasks in the garden bringing back memories and allowing for new bonds to be built. One of the problems is that Weaver is the only one who cares about creating family closeness; the mother is gone all summer, leaving the garden work to the author, while the brother and his wife are happy to allow the kids to spend time with Aunt Tea-Tea they themselves show absolutely no interest in the garden. They have their own lives. Not only is Weaver battling the wild, overgrown garden and its problems, but her own hang-ups and family apathy.The book has a slow start, and it jumps around in space and time, so you have to really pay attention. There are some repetitive areas. Two things remain constantly in sight- Weavers determination to both grow emotionally herself and to repair her family, especially her mothers belief that she (her mother) is not worth loving. This is not high drama but the give and take of daily life, and I could certainly identify with some of what they all went through. Of course there were many moments that had the gardener in me nodding my head sympathetically and going Oh, yeah, been there, done that! And Im definitely getting some Shuksan strawberry plants next year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341ATM374RHLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345548078#wasThisHelpful","R341ATM374RHLK","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One year after the death of Kathleen Eaden, author of the classic and beloved The Art of Baking dies, the posh Eaden grocery chain is holding a bake-off. The prize? To become The New Mrs. Eaden. The winner will receive a 50,000 pound (roughly $75,000 US) contract to advise the chain on its line of baked goods and become the face of Eadens baked goods. The path is then opened for the winner to have their own celebrity baker career.The book focuses on the five competitors who are selected to attend the bake-off, and also on the original Mrs. Eaden back in 1966 as she works on the cookbook. Vickie, Karen, Jenny, Claire, and Mike all travel to the rambling country house, with its huge and lavish kitchens, where the Eadens once lived and is now a headquarters for some of the company happenings. The bake-off takes place over several weekends, each weekend being devoted to a different type of baked goods: pies, bread, cakes, etc.Each competitor grapples with their own set of life problems as she strives to perfect her craft: the stay at home mom, the perfectionist, the poor single mother, the widower, the empty nester, and, of course, Kathleen Eaden, whom they all think of as the perfect homemaker as her cook book implies. These struggles, and the competition itself, prove fertile ground for the growth of their characters. I liked some characters and disliked one very much for a lot of the book, until her back story was revealed. The book isnt really about baking at all- although its certainly full of baking. Its all about motherhood and family and womens choices.I am a bit torn about the book; parts are very, very good but there are weaknesses as well. Some of the characters are nearly unused, including a character who makes the cover copy. These characters are not people but just objects that serve a function, much like a door stop. All the men are like this; the only male who gets much play is really a caricature. The women, on the other hand, are pretty well done. The excerpts from Mrs. Eadens baking book are lyrical and over the top in their praises of what good baking can do for ones family. It seems that to her, all family problems can be solved with a proper pastry-which turns out to be ironic indeed. Martha Stewart would fade into the background next to this woman and her odes to homemaking. Oddly, the competition itself is somewhat in the background; the problems the women have getting there gets a lot of time but there is no tension to the baking and judging themselves- sometimes we dont even know who won a segment until its mentioned in passing later. As the plot device on which the book hangs I would have thought it would have taken center stage. This is one of those books I cant give five stars to, but when the author writes another book I will be reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8KUK2JR0BSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059402#wasThisHelpful","R1L8KUK2JR0BSR","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most moisturizers- even the silicon based ones- tend to cause some breakouts for me, and when I put them on at night, by next morning my skin is oily looking and feeling. This one does *not* do that- unless I use too much it goes on dry feeling and stays pretty much that way over night. So, yeah! Despite not being oily, it's non-drying, too. It's got the right balance for my skin.The amount of salicylic acid is  quite low, but since I'm not breaking out it must be doing it's job. It provides a mild exfoliation that keeps the pores clean. My skin is actually free of pimples- not a single one- for the first time in years. This is a break through for me!One thing I was a little leery of at first was using a leave on salicylic acid product- I had been using rinse off products. They all had a nasty smell and I didn't fancy having that on my face all night. But this product smells of nothing but fresh, juicy, pink grapefruit juice; it smells quite edible so I'd watch out for it around little kids.I would have liked a little higher percent of the active ingredient, but other than that, this seems to be a great product for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5G3O7IW7JHC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR1YQKO#wasThisHelpful","R5G3O7IW7JHC2","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adeline was Virginia Stephens given first name, but as it was her dead aunts name, it hurt her mother too much to use it. So she was Virginia from the start. In this novelized biography of the last fifteen years of Woolfs life, Adeline exists inside Virginia her whole life as a separate personality to absorb the abuse she endured from her step-brother and to deal with emotionally upsetting events. Virginia talked to Adeline as if she existed outside of her body.Written mainly from Virginias point of view in the present tense, Vincent has done a good job of allowing the reader a look at how Virginia might have felt at times when she held conversations with her younger self and with friends who had died. The times when mania was setting in are particularly suffocating and uncomfortable. Her novels tended to be based on experiences she or her friends & family had, and writing them was rather painful. In a lot of ways, Virginia Woolf never grew up and she needed people- mostly her husband, Leonard Woolf, and her sister Vanessa (Nessa) Bell  to take care of her even during her good times. Very fragile emotionally, she was treated like a precious egg that could break easily. From this book I get the feeling she never knew a moments peace from her demons.The style of writing is rather wordy and full of similes; very unlike most prose of today. It put me in mind of Woolfs own writing and Im sure this was deliberate on the part of the author since we spend most of the novel inside Woolfs head. While it made for rough going at times, I feel that ultimately it helped sustain the feeling of intimacy with Woolfs thought. I have to say that while Ive enjoyed other books about Woolf and the Bloomsbury group more than this one, I did enjoy this book and feel its a worthy addition to the growing shelf of books about that group. It also has given me an urge to know more about W.B. Yeats, as he comes off in this book as a jovial mystic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4C11PPRAN8K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544470206#wasThisHelpful","R4C11PPRAN8K1","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Buried Giant doesnt tell its story simply. On the face of it, its a simple tale. An elderly Briton couple- Axl and Beatrice- not valued by their little village, decide to pay their son a visit in the village nearby where he lives. On the way they meet a Saxon warrior and his injured charge, a knight, ogres, a swarm of nasty pixies, monks with deadly intent, boatmen who ask an awful lot of questions before ferrying his charges across to islands, and more. Many of these characters are not who they seem to be at first. The knight is Sir Gawain, despite King Arthur being long gone. The boatmen, despite working a real river, are the ferrymen of the dead. Even Axl isnt the peasant he appears to be.Axl and Beatrice are in love with and devoted to each other. Beatrice addresses Axl as husband and he calls her princess  Im afraid to say that I did laugh a bit at this, being put in mind of The Princess Bride. They never want to be more than a couple of steps apart.An odd mist lies over the land; it brings forgetfulness, both of recent events and those long past. It lies in patches, so that sometimes Axl and Beatrice can remember things they previously couldnt. This leads them to wonder: if there were bad things in their past, would they be better off forgetting them? No, they decide. Those events made them who they are today. But while remembering is good for Axl and Beatrice, it isnt best for everyone. Sometimes its best to let the past be shrouded in forgetfulness for the sake of happiness and peace. Axl and Beatrice can forgive- have forgiven- their past errors; thats a lot harder for large groups of people.I read this book over about 24 hours; when I would take a break I needed to shake my head to clear the mists out. The story enchanted me, in the same way that Arthurian legend and Tolkiens word does, despite being told in plain language without the flourishes or old fashioned language of many myths. I loved this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4FIINIOXA85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030727103X#wasThisHelpful","R1X4FIINIOXA85","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was loath to put this book down once I started it. It held my interest like a well-crafted novel would- for the most part. The authors premise is that empires expand when they have good sources of food (mainly grain), and then, when the food sources fail the empire collapses. They present the Mayans, Mesopotamia, the Romans, the British Empire, modern China, and modern America among others, and they paint a pretty scary picture.Sadly, their scholarship doesnt match their writing. The British Empire didnt fail because of a shortage of grains. Some of the dates given are just wrong; in at least one case, that makes what they are saying impossible (that a certain event caused something).The book jumps around in time and place; I found it rather jolting at times to make the connections. For some reason, they felt they could bind a lot of the events together with the story of the world roaming trader Carletti, but they dont even give him a continuous narration. He really had nothing to do with their thesis.What was good about it? It does examine food surplus and scarcity. To be a food empire, the empire must be able to produce or capture a surplus of grains. They must be able to ship it to all its area, and trade it for other things, both necessities and luxuries. Having more food than your own population also gives a society another, very important, thing: when there is enough food that not everyone has to be a farmer, people can do other things, like learn to read and write, become artisans, and go exploring. Being able to have a non-farmer class gave us civilization.They also go over why the food surpluses ceased to be. Irrigation that created over saline soils, loss of soil nutrients, loss of soil itself due to erosion, lowering of average temperatures by even one degree makes plants take longer to ripen grain, lack of rain- all these things can create disaster. And we are facing that again today: today we face climate change, soil erosion, drought, and the fact that the vast majority of grain growing (and, hence, meat producing) relies on petroleum inputs- and we are fast running out of petroleum.The authors do not have an answer to our possible/probably plight. One thing they do suggest isnt something that will work for most areas of the world: becoming locavores. Eating only foods grown within a circumscribed area at least remedies the amounts of fuel used to truck and process foods. Now, a big city, with all its suburbs, covers a huge area with blacktop and concrete and will have few areas for growing foods- and it takes a LOT of area to grow grains and frankly no one wants a pig farm next door. Our area, despite being rural, cannot successfully feed itself. The soils are not rich enough to support much beyond grass hay and cattle. The growing season is too short to ripen grain a lot of years- not to mention many fruits and vegetables. Its possible on a small scale to ripen peppers and tomatoes by protective coverings but it would take a LOT of greenhouses to feed the county year round.What this book does is point out a lot of different aspects of food supplies and make you think about them. For that I give it four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNJ1XHWTH3X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HHO4G8#wasThisHelpful","R2UNJ1XHWTH3X2","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We don't have our watering system hooked up yet for the growing season, but our water has such a high mineral content (magnesium, calcium & iron) that it creates crusts on container plants in no time, and if you leave water in a clear container overnight you can see sediment in the bottom. We also get a lot of alga growth, which I hadn't realized was connected to the scale & crusting.I started putting 1.5 ml of the product into every gallon of water I used on the container plants (I have to ask why they give the measurements in ml for the product and gallons for the water.. odd to mix systems like that). The containers that had new soilless mix in them have not gotten crusts on them, nor have they grown alga. The older containers that already had some crusting have softened somewhat and the alga is not nearly as thick in the ones that had it. This product is a win; given what I'm seeing I'm sure that the irrigation system won't be plugging up this summer like it usually does!

"I am loving this foundation. I've been using silicon based foundations for years, but even they didn't last all day. This product lasts ALL DAY most days.

"What a sad thing to review this book right after Sir Terry has passed away; sadder still that I have to say that I didnt really like the book. It was okay; I read the whole thing without finding it a chore, but it wasnt what I expected. I thought it might be a humorous book on how *Discworld* works, rather than our own.There are four books in the Science of Discworld series; this is the only one Ive read. The books are written in an alternating chapter format: Sir Terry writes the short, fiction, chapters and Stewart and Cohen write the longer, nonfiction, ones. The fiction portion tells a tale of the wizards of Discworld and a misadventure while doing a team building exercise in the forest. They find themselves interacting with Roundworld, a globular world where magic doesnt exist, but elves do. Thinking this situation is unfair to the humans, they first eliminate the elves from Roundworld. Then they discover that this was a horrible mistake, as humans need to believe in magic in order to thrive and progress- even though the magic is imaginary. They have to go through great effort to correct their meddling.The science part of the book covers a lot of different subjects; quantum physics, evolution, psychology, religion, time, multiverses, culture, and philosophy. Its all in terms that most will find accessible, but there is some repetition.Its an attempt to get lovers of fantasy to read science-y stuff and sneak some education down our throats, sort of like a grown up version of Mickey Mouse teaching kids about math or something. It works, but not terribly well. The wizard story is just barely held together; the wizards do something, and then they stop and what just happened is explained to us. By the end of the book, I remembered a lot of the science but little of the story. While Cohen and Stewart wrote the science sections, I swear I see Sir Terrys hand in that; the footnotes are some of the funniest stuff in the book.Final verdict? Certainly not my favorite Pratchett, but if I see the other three in the series Ill probably read them. Just not that eagerly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKG3HJFLLG9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804168962#wasThisHelpful","R2YKG3HJFLLG9E","A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book should appeal to a range of readers from telephone collectors to economic historians to MBA students.  Written in 1939, it is an exhaustive chronicle of the origin and development of what was, at the time, the largest aggregation of capital controlled by a single corporate entity in the history of the world.  To have that title at the end of the Great Depression is all the more significant.  AT&T stock paid 10 percent dividends right through the depression while protecting its employees.  While most foreign countries nationalized their phone services, the AT&T private enterprise delivered the world's finest telephone service at the world's lowest prices.  America led the world not only in inventing the telephone but in making it a practical reality.The book also covers the strategies for building and sustaining the monopoly.  For example, after bankers took control of the Company, they used their influence to limit the availability of loans to independent phone companies, making them easier for AT&T to buy out.  The Company used creative accounting (to put it nicely) to mask profitability and justify their rates.American Tel & Tel focuses primarily on the business rather than the technology aspects of the story, although it does give considerable attention to the question of who really invented the telephone.  One thread that runs through the story is the role of Theodore N. Vail whose vision, business acumen, leadership, and boundless energy combined to make the company survive early challenges and ultimately coalesce into the ultimate monopoly.  At one point, Vail left the Company and later returned to reenergize and revitalize it, following a path eerily similar to Steve Jobs' managerial trajectory.  There's an MBA thesis topic ready-made.Several other threads are worth pointing out.  Western Union, the de facto communications giant  of the late 1870s, did, with the help of Thomas Edison, seriously challenge the fledgeling Bell company.  At one point, Alexander Graham Bell offered to sell Western Union his telephone patent for $100,000.  Western Union famously refused, passing on what turned out to be probably the most valuable single patent of all time.  Later, AT&T swallowed up Western Union, only to spit it back out when the government started making noises about anti-trust action.  Western Electric, which was started by Western Union, played a critical role in the growth and monopolistic control of the industry wielded by AT&T.  They also served as a useful cover in the shell game AT&T played to conceal profits.  The Company also used an extremely convoluted accounting system, which, in hindsight, appears to have served the role of obscuring profitability.If you find these snippets interesting, you should enjoy the book, and I strongly recommend that you get it.  I believe it is out of print; however, used copies can be found.  If you are more interested in the evolution of telephone technology, I recommend Ralph O. Meyer's book on Old Time Telephones, Design, History, and Restoration.  Dr. Meyer's book is the definitive work on the subject, and it covers telephone technical evolution from the invention to AT&T's divestiture of Western Electric and the ""Baby Bells"" in 1984.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JXGN1EBA0RRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000855ELC#wasThisHelpful","R1JXGN1EBA0RRN","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me, this book is in the top 3 or 4 books of the 25-volume Freddy series.  Florida and Detective are also in that group.  The plot, the personalities, and the battle scenario are all superbly crafted.  I read all of the series that I could get my hands on at the public library as a child of the late 50s.  I read them and tape recorded many of them for my son, who pretty well wore out the tapes (no iPods, iPhones, or portable DVD players in those days).  I read the full series, in order, end-to-end to my young daughter, who is the same age as my grandson.  They were all simultaneously in print only once -- a brief run by Overland Press.  The full availability now in electronic form is a huge blessing.I have a tendency to avoid reviewing these books because I don't feel I can take time to do them justice.  They are absolutely superb children's literature.  They are very engaging, effectively combining humor, intrigue, and action.  They offer sound life-lessons and are terrific vocabulary builders.

"The one that I just received has absolutely no odor problem.  Apparently that problem has been fixed.  In fact, it smells and feels like an expensive leather wallet.  The leather is very smooth and supple.  Standard credit cards fit the slots perfectly.  The slots are snug, but that's good because they will stretch.  It is very slim for a 12-slot wallet.  Dollar bills also fit comfortably with room to spare in both dimensions.  Twenty Euro notes fit well without sticking out of the top.  A British 20-pound note will stick out the top slightly -- if you're in the UK, you'll have to fold the larger notes.  At least for me, the wallet is neither undersized nor oversized.  My definition of oversized is when wallets tend to catch going in and out of the hip pocket.Good wallets aren't cheap, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this one, given the price.  It is not made in Switzerland.  It is made in India.  When I was in the horse business, India was known for cheap but functional leather products.  This wallet is a cut well above the quality what they produced for horse tack 25 years ago.The leather should be durable.  It's hard to predict how well the stitching will hold up, but I'm taking a small gamble and buying a second one just because I like the look, feel, and design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBL96JGKMY7FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JNHDHY#wasThisHelpful","RBL96JGKMY7FS","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently spent three weeks photographing, among other things, interiors of the great cathedrals, palaces, and castles of Spain and Portugal.  I had tackled similar challenges in other countries using other good low-light cameras including the A99.  What the A7S does in dimly lit interiors is, as my title says, astounding.  You can be in a situation that looks gray and shadowy to the point that you can't see much detail or color with the naked eye.  Then you look through the viewfinder on the A7S, and it's like somebody turned on the lights.  The colors come alive, and the details pop out.  Then, the actual shot typically looks even better than the viewfinder image.At one point, my wife and I were looking at a dark interior cathedral wall that contained an elaborate array of organ pipes.  I showed her how it looked on the A7S rear display.  She said, ""It looks like a spotlight is shining on it!""To get these effects, I put the ISO on auto and went with shutter priority to allow good hand-held operation.  In that circumstance, the camera is going to go to the largest aperture and set the exposure to look like an illuminated scene.  The images I got in these circumstances had very, very little grain.  As an aside, the camera's noise management (if you choose to shoot jpeg rather than RAW) is superb (and it hasn't always been that way with Sony as I relate later).Another way I used this camera effectively was for indoor candid portraits.  Using HDR, even in backlit situations, most shots came out better than if I'd used flash fill.  I do occasionally use flash, but I never bothered with flash on the S.  Even so, it was comforting to know that I could use a very small flash and get the same results on the S that would require a big honking flash with any other camera.  That high ISO capability has the side benefit of downsizing your flash requirement.  (The 4-stop advantage reduces required flash power by a factor of 16.)In all of my shooting to date, I've yet to see noticeable noise on any shot but one.  That one was made outdoors in the black of night with only a few scattered lights around.  The ISO for that shot was 409,600, and even then the image was dark.  Auto ISO will go that high in pitch black.  In retrospect, I should have tried multi-frame noise reduction to see how much it would have helped.  I'll try doing that and check back later with an update.Another way the A7S high-ISO capability helped out was shooting from a moving platform.  For example, in Seville, we took the classic horse-drawn carriage ride.  The carriage was continuously jerking forward and backward.  I had a zoom lens with built-in stabilization, but the oscillations of the jerking motion were too great for the stabilization to correct.  No problem.  Just crank the ISO way up and shoot with a super high frame rate.  The images came out tack-sharp with no grain at all.  Even when I was just walking outdoors, I tended to set the ISO to 800 minimum.  There was just no point in shooting ISO 100 or 200 unless I wanted a long exposure with short depth of focus.I made heavy use of in-camera HDR on this trip (which isn't available, unfortunately, in RAW).  HDR pushes the exposure in dark areas by shooting multiple shots with varied exposure and superimposing higher exposure in darker areas.  I'm used to seeing grain when I do this with dark scenes.  Again, I saw no grain.I confess to initially being skeptical about the A7S.  In order to have smaller, lighter lenses to go with the A7 line of small, light, mirrorless bodies, Sony went with higher minimum F numbers (e.g., F4 for the 24-70 Zeiss zoom compared to F2.8 for the much bigger Alpha lens).  In addition, Sony did not put optical stabilization in the new FE prime lenses, and my other Sony-Zeiss alpha lenses didn't have it either.  What good was a low light sensor if I forfeited aperture and stabilization, I asked.  The only reason I ended up with an A7S (and some FE lenses) was that my wife wanted to give me something for our 25th anniversary.  I'm now a true believer in the A7S.Sony has now come out with the A7R II.  I'm thinking about getting it as a companion to the S.  I've got the lenses, which are a big part of the expense.  Even with it's backlit sensor, The A7R II can't touch the S when it comes to low light.  Nothing can.  What the A7R II backlit sensor does is help out a lot when you try to make individual sensor detectors very, very small.  The S will benefit proportionately less because of its  larger detectors.  I do shoot a lot of landscapes, and I often need to crop.  That's the only pressing reason for me to go to the A7R II, and even if I had it, I'd stick with the S for most shooting.When people complain about the A7s, they often cite short battery life.  Even an A99 has longer battery life (which says a lot).  What we have to realize is that when we downsize everything we have to pay a price, and not just in lens aperture.  An A99 battery has 150% more weight and volume than an A7s battery, yet the little A7s battery supports the same functionality.  It's no surprise that A7s batteries have relatively short lives.  Unfortunately, the battery size is not reflected in the battery price as much as we might hope.Aside from short battery life (it does come with 2 batteries), I have one other criticism of the A7S design.  The A7S has this ability to go to very high ISO, yet the automatic ISO doesn't seem to take advantage of it unless pushed hard.  For example, I was out today shooting with a 300mm Alpha lens using the LA EA4 adapter.  The program mode set my shutter speed at 320, leaving my ISO at 100.  Now this would be okay if there were some form of stabilization in play, but there was not.  I'm well aware of the old speed versus focal length rule, but, to me, a faster speed would make more sense here.  This camera has ISO to burn, and the automatic ISO selection should, IMHO, take advantage of it.  ***Update:  the A7SII has corrected this with additional flexibility in auto ISO settings.***Another complaint (but not at all from me) is the matter of ""lossy"" camera RAW.  In my own shots, I have yet to see a recognizable artifact from whatever RAW compression is applied.  I've read the critics comments on this, but I've yet to see an example image from any critic showing a recognizable compression artifact.  I assure you, I can see plenty of artifacts when I use jpeg compression as well as when I apply sharpening.On the subject of sharpening, one of the most critical limitations on sharpening is that it brings out noise.  This is another distinct advantage of the A7S:  noise is extremely low, which allows much more aggressive sharpening.On the subject of jpegs, Sony has, in the past, been rightly criticized for bad application of sharpening and noise reduction.  In the A850/900, the result was a serious noise problem, which drove more people to shoot RAW and do their own noise reduction and sharpening in post.  I have found jpegs from the default settings in the A7s to be extraordinarily clean.  No doubt this is due in part to the low-noise sensor.Speaking of controlling ISO, the Sony manual does a particularly poor job of explaining how to use Auto ISO with control of the maximum and minimum ISO limits.  Here's the sequence:Menu > Camera 4 > ISO > Auto.Now scroll to the right. You'll see the max and min settings appear, which you can select and adjust over the full range of ISO choices.  You don't want to overlook this because this camera is so incredibly capable at high ISO, and, as I've said, the camera tends to be way too conservative in its auto ISO selections.  ***Update:  Again, this was fixed with additional user controllability in the II version.***If you have Sony Alpha lenses that you want to use with the A7s, you'll want to get the LA EA4 adapter.  I have both the EA2 and EA4.  The autofocus tends to hunt very badly with the EA2.  The EA4 essentially turns the camera into an SLT and improves the autofocus performance.  The only downside is loss of one-half stop of exposure.  The A7s autofocuses beautifully with the EA4.As far as video performance goes, I've used it, but not enough to comment.  I did do an in-depth evaluation of the A99 video, which I reviewed as mediocre due primarily to moire problems.  All the professional reviews have praised video performance for the A7s.  They have specifically said there is no moire issue.  Their praise has had only a few caveats.  Perhaps the most significant complaint is rolling-shutter skew.  (A complaint from non-pros is the inability to record 4K video internally.)  Otherwise, the pros are saying it raises the bar for SLR video.So should you buy an A7S or an A7R II?  If I had an A7R II as well, I'd probably use it less than the A7S unless I were only going to shoot outside in the daytime.  What about waiting for an A7S II?  It'll probably have built in stabilization, which certainly would not hurt.  It will probably also record 4K internally.  But it might be correspondingly more expensive as well as slightly larger and slightly heavier with even worse battery life. ***Update:  The A7SII fixes pretty much all of my complaints about the A7S.  But it does cost more.  Based on my own experience, if I were starting from scratch, I'd get the A7SII; but I won't sell my A7S to upgrade.  I'm doing fine without the in-camera stabilization and additional ISO control, but I'd definitely pay more up front to get them.***My bottom line is this:  For me, the A7S is a magical little camera.  It breaks the constraining bonds on low light, sharpening, camera shake, freezing action, and huge flash attachments.  I can do so many things so much easier with it, and I can get some shots that no other camera can touch.  I think it's a breakthrough product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AE8QJGT9MWC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIWXTXG#wasThisHelpful","R1AE8QJGT9MWC3","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only bad news is that the first time you see this, you may find it confusing.  The good news is that for several subsequent viewings, youll discover new intriguing subtleties.  (Like Groundhog Day, but without the repetition.)  The plot has three distinct layers, with the last only revealed at the surprise ending.  The script is full of quotable lines.  All three lead actors play their roles to perfection; its clear they are having great fun.Did you know that the original casting had Martin and Caines roles reversed?  What could they possibly have been thinking?  One would think that Ruprecht was created with Steve Martin in mind! Steve had a Golden Globe nomination for best performance by an actor in a comedy/musical.  Apparently, as soon as the cast did a couple of scenes, they and the director set things straight.Like other reviewers, I waited a long time for this movie to be available online.  Steve Martin has said that this is his favorite role.  It is my favorite comedy, an all-time classic that I like to go back to again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW73DYMZXNA8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005PJ6O#wasThisHelpful","RW73DYMZXNA8N","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, this is a 5-star product.  My problem is that I bought two of these and they were obviously taken out and repackaged.  One of them actually had the inner case inserted backwards in the outer box!  They both had some dust on them.  One had rattled around inside the inner case enough that the case window showed the effects of an opacity on all but an inner circle that the filter could not rub against. There was dust on both. One actually had a splinter of debris inside the inner case!  I had to clean both with a blower AND a Zeiss lens-cleaning wipe.  I'm not the first Amazon reviewer to have this problem.  Amazon's price is good on these, but is it because they are seconds?  The outer boxes were sealed with the standard tape, but I absolutely believe this is not a B+W quality-control issue.  I've bought a lot of their filters over the past 7 years and never found one  that wasn't pristine until now.  Something else is going on here.Now for the good news.  When cleaned, these filters show no problems at all: no blemishes on glass or metal.  I'm a true believer in B+W.  I use filters primarily for two reasons:  to protect the lens and for polarization effects.  Back in the film days I had all sorts of special-effects filters, but now it's about those two purposes, and these were obviously for protection only.  What do we want from a protective filter?  (1) Do no harm.  (2) Protect.  (Not necessarily in that order.)  I've used all of the high-end filter brands, and the very best do very little harm besides lens flare under extreme conditions.  I've not been able to identify any image degradation (except flare) with the very best UV filters.  So why B+W?  Because B+W filters are so easy to clean.  For me, that means they do a better job of requirement number 2:  they protect.  I've had so many filters that would have blotchy reflectivity after wet cleaning.  Not B+W.  Water won't hurt them, not even rain water.  So far nothing has, and I have 20 that I've subjected to all sorts of elements.  I always use B+W, and I always buy their top-of-the-line for a given functional type.  I even have 4 of their signature series.As an aside, many years ago I did careful tests of not-so-good filters.  I found that some of those filters degraded images more than the difference between a Nikon AI prime lens and a Hoya 70-210 zoom.  Point is, filter quality does matter.  I don't believe that super high numbers of coatings are relevant; there is a law of diminishing returns for numbers of coatings, and B+W has enough to get the job done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NH8IZZ310KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OVE17E#wasThisHelpful","R18NH8IZZ310KD","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OMOTRON sells the exact same keyboard without the stand for about half the price.  Is the stand worth the extra money?  The stand is very lightweight and it does work.  It collapses flat.  It has very cheap, deformable plastic hinges, which probably won't last long with regular use.  The only functional complaint about the stand is that in upright, portrait orientation there is no room at the bottom to plug in a charger.  Some apps will work in landscape orientation, and a few will work upside down, either of which solves the problem.  The stand is plenty strong enough for an iPhone 6+.As far as quality, the keyboard feels like it cost about 12-14 bucks.  I've had no problem with keys sticking or not working.  It is definitely better for me than typing on a touch screen.  Also, as others have said, it can work with laptops -- a good thing if you have one of those that won't let you turn off the touchpad.Good luck with your decision!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDO8R0TARKYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIF1V2M#wasThisHelpful","R2SDO8R0TARKYP","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Florida"" is the first and one of the best of the 23-volume Freddy series.  The books are very educational.  They are suitable for reading to kindergarten-age kids and reading by older kids up to as high as age 14.  Brooks is a master at character development.  If you child is lucky enough to get hooked, he will discover a comfortable, fun world with magnetic personalities entangled in beguiling plots.When reading to very young children, expect to have to explain a lot of vocabulary -- not a bad thing at all.  Many years ago, I read these to my son and recorded them on cassette tapes.  He played them over many, many times, especially when traveling.  He developed a love of books that led him to read 54 Hardy Boys volumes while only a third-grader.This book originally had the innocuous title, ""To and Again.""  Like Howard R. Garris (Uncle Wiggly), Brooks didn't settle on his central character in his first books.One good way to get into these is via Kindle.  A Kindle app on larger phone or tablet is a great option.  Kindle is currently the ONLY way to get all of the series.  There is a website dedicated to Friends of Freddy that is worth looking up.BTW, the New York Times speculated that Orwell drew his inspiration for ""Animal Farm"" from the Freddy series.My grandson, son, daughter, and I have all enjoyed the Freddy books.  I can't recommend them highly enough.Another good choice is the Oz series, which consists of 15 volumes, beginning with the Wizard of Oz.  Those books are for similar ages, but probably no younger than 7.  Of course, when the kids are old enough, nothing beats Harry Potter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YJT4BHA3M3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0AYO7A#wasThisHelpful","R24YJT4BHA3M3K","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time I'm writing this, there are two other reviews, both of which are unfavorable.  Much of the problem seems to stem from the earlier lack of a clear statement that you have to turn the switch on manually.  The listing now makes that clear, at least to me.  If you take the time to watch the video, it should remove any further doubt.  It appears that the earlier reviews had the effect of improving the listing -- we owe thanks to the earlier reviewers for that.  The other concern is that, in a 3-way application, you  need a special remote.  That is true; the remote needed is the Leviton VPOSR-10.What do I mean by ""almost""?  If you reenter the area very shortly after the switch automatically turns off, it will turn itself back on!!  My two both do, anyway.  It's as though they are saying, ""Oops, I must have turned off too quickly -- you're still here.""  Go figure.  I'm not making this up.I just installed two of these, both in single-pole configuration.  They are working fine.  I turn on a switch manually; the switch stays on until the sensor determines that the area is vacant; then, after a variable delay, the switch turns off.  There are two adjustable screw settings on each switch:  one for sensor sensitivity and one for turn-off time delay.  The time delay is variable in discrete jumps from 30 seconds to 30 minutes.  The sensitivity is reducible by 50 % from the max value.  I set mine for max sensitivity since I'm often at a fairly wide angle from the switch.So far, it's working as advertised in my application.  I have a home theater that has 11 Z-wave switches and dimmers distributed around in it.  I've had manual switches in the equipment area that I tend to forget to turn off.  These new switches are perfect for me -- they are a better solution than adding more Z-wave switches.

"Summary:  This is a beautifully made, distinctive-looking watch that has grown on me over the month that I've had it.  As another reviewer said, pictures don't do it justice.  It's accuracy so far is superlative, drifting less than a second a month (for much better news:  see update below).Around the time that Citizen bought Bulova, they patented a new quartz movement, which, without the benefit of temperature regulation, is supposed to beat the accuracy of conventional quartz watches by a factor of 18 when installed in very large watch cases.  The movements, all of which are made in Japan, use a three-pronged quartz tuning fork that rotates rather than vibrates (i.e., torsional motion).  The frequency of the torsional motion is much higher and claimed to be much less sensitive to temperature than the conventional, two-pronged quartz vibrational mode.The first watches to get the new movement were dubbed the Bulova Precisionist.  The first Precisionists were huge things -- kind of a clock on your wrist.  Bulova has now released a second generation Precisionist that is a bit smaller, but still big (e.g., 46mm x 0.5 in).  Other manufacturers (e.g., Omega) who had made extremely accurate watches by applying costly, sophisticated temperature regulation to conventional quartz, had gotten out of the super-accuracy lane when radio control came along (so-called atomic time and GPS time).  Radio control worked well and was much less expensive.  The original Accutron was the first all-electric watch and set a new standard for maintenance-free, high accuracy performance.  Now Bulova decided to play the accuracy card again by introducing the Accutron II.  Accutron II is a smaller incarnation of the Precisionist movement, and I've read claims that the smaller size sacrificed a lot of the accuracy advantage.  Accutron II watches definitely look more expensive to my eye than Precisionists.Here's what I've found so far:  the Accutron has been more accurate than the Precisionist.  The Precisionist movement is claimed to be as good as 10 seconds drift per year, which is better than a second a month.  I've found slightly under two seconds a month drift, which is still far better than conventional quartz, which is generally rated at 15 seconds a month unregulated.  Meanwhile, this Accutron II has been good to within a second a month!  Did I get lucky with the Accutron II?  Did I get unlucky with the Precisionist?  I have no idea, I'm just reporting the results.**** Update **** after five months, the Accutron II has gained one second!  After six months, the Precisionist has gained 10 seconds -- about double the advertised drift but superb by any other standard.  Even though I have several radio-regulated watches, the Accutron II is my reference when I don't have time to make sure the radio watches are updated or go do the NIST thing on a computer.  This is fantastic accuracy for any free-running clock:  about 0.08 parts per million (ppm).Other reviewers have done an admirable job of reporting on the Space View heritage of this watch.  I'll just add that this watch is Beautifully made.  Everything about the case exudes quality.  To me, it looks far more expensive than its price.  The only thing I wish it had is a sapphire crystal, but that would certainly increase the price some.  The crystal is domed in a way that is very pleasing to the eye.  One good thing about so-called mineral crystals is that small scratches can be buffed out.I'll be surprised if this watch gets many negative reviews.  There just isn't much here to fault, and there's a whole lot to love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MAN39KGP6FPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDV7Z74#wasThisHelpful","R1MAN39KGP6FPB","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, the standard review stuff:This product works very well.  Logitech considers the remote supplied to be bare-bones, but I'll take a reliable bare-bones remote that can control a wide range of esoteric electronics any day.  The remote is sleek and compact, partly because it uses a button cell.  This thing is now handling relatively rare components from Mark Levinson and Bryston with aplomb.  Bryston charges $300 for their remote, which doesn't come with the equipment!  Mark Levinson charges $500 for a replacement!  Thanks to Logitech, I can now teach any learning remote to ""speak Bryston.""  (The Levinson preamp will actually teach a remote itself.)  The range of coverage of the IR blaster, hub or extension, is excellent, and I've been using blasters for 10 years.  My controlled equipment can pick it up after one bounce from just about any object in the room.  I have about five URC blasters strategically placed in my home theater today.  The Smart Control offers me another option beyond the URC 30, which is no longer supported by URC.  You may have noticed that a lot of reviewers are not using their cell phones as remotes.  I'm using both, and I'm happy with both approaches.  One advantage of the WiFi connectivity is that you can control from anywhere that your WiFi network reaches.  Walls and other obstacles simply don't matter.  Of course, direct-RF-linked alternatives will typically penetrate one or two layers of walls.I'm trying to determine whether I can add more Smart Control hubs to a single network and then add more networks for other systems.  I'm pretty sure the answer to the second question is ""yes.""  If it turns out to be true I'll expand this review to explain in detail.***Update***  You can have multiple hubs in one house on one wifi network.  You give them different names, and they work independently with their assigned remotes.  I haven't done it yet, but Logitech told me it is doable.  You cannot have more than one hub in one subnet, working together; in other words, there is no slave mode for a hub.  This limits extensibility, because a single remote can only transmit through a single hub and its blaster.  Each hub has a second blaster jack.  Logitech sent me one for free; I'm not sure how to buy one otherwise.  Some other systems allow you to plug in additional blasters anywhere that is in range.  URC Powerblasters are an example of that, but they cost almost as much as a Smart Control Hub with remote and blaster.  I'm going to try some other mix-and-match combinations after I get my next hub.  Now back to the original review.Let me explain the title of this review.I had a problem with this product that led me to write a one-star review yesterday.  I promised to upgrade the review if Logitech solved the problem which they did in VERY short order.  I had an audio component that Logitech apparently had incorrectly represented  in their IR code database.  The result was that I couldn't control the component, and it was the primary component controlling this particular system.  I e-mailed Logitech on Sunday, and, when I got home from work on Monday, they had fixed the problem in the database and sent me instructions on how to reload the device (see below).  The process worked, and now the Smart Control setup is exceeding my original expectations.  The main body of this review provides my Sunday message to them and their Monday response.  The respondent actually gave me his direct e-mail address, which I have removed out of respect for his privacy.  You may find it interesting reading.  I draw some conclusions at the end.  I'll begin the story with my original review.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe Logitech online database is very impressive when it comes to including codes for even the most obscure components.  I was very pleased to find I could set up my Bryston music server and DAC as well as my Mark Levinson 326S -- or so the website led me to believe.  All my components were in the database and were easily loaded along with several activities onto my hub.  Now for the bad news.  While the hub controls the Bryston components just fine and the hub/blaster exceeded expectation in area/volume coverage, there was no control of the Mark Levinson preamp.  The hub wouldn't turn it on, and when I turned it on manually, the hub wouldn't control the volume.  In other words it's useless to me (other than I can use it to teach ""Bryston"" to other IR remotes).The following is my communication to Logitech:""The hub cannot control my Mark Levinson No. 326S preamp.  The hub is at least turning on and off other components.  I've placed both the hub and the blaster directly in front of the preamp to no avail.  I've put them next to the preamp's own remote, and the preamp's remote will operate the preamp but the hub and/or blaster will not. They will not turn it on out of standby, and, if it is already on, they will not adjust volume.""I've been using the Harmony remote.  I note that my iPhone 5 does not even show a volume control on-screen.  Could this be because the preamp was not loaded properly into the hub so that the hub has no knowledge of a volume control in the system?  I did the setup on a Windows 8 machine, not on the iPhone.  Then I downloaded the iOS app and set the iPhone up with the hub via wifi.""It wouldn't be surprising if you hadn't had much feedback on the Mark Levinson 326S.  It is a high-end, line-level preamp, and only a small percentage of hardcore audiophiles will know the model exists.""The Smart Control is potentially a terrific product, and control by cell phone is coming fast to all things electronic.  I hope this problem can be resolved.""I followed this quote in the original review with the following:  Stay tuned.  I'll follow this up as I hear from Logitech.  If Logitech can't resolve the problem, I'll try it somewhere else with more mainstream components.  Based on the reviews of others, I expect my chances are good.  Meanwhile, since the product has totally failed to work well enough to be useful, I have no choice but to give it one star.  I'll certainly upgrade the rating if I can justify it.TimMONDAY MESSAGE FROM LOGITECHHi Tim - I am the Director of Product Management for Logitech's Harmony division.  I wanted to first apologize for the experience you have had, but I promise we will make it right.The team and I have looked into your issue and believe we have identified and resolved the issue.  We have corrected some of the data associated with the Mark Levinson device you have.If we could ask you to follow the below steps this should address your issue:Sign into your account on MyHarmony.comSelect the Device tab on the leftSelect your Mark Levinson deviceSelect Delete this devicePress the blue Add Device button and re-enter your device (Mark Levinson) and model number (NO. 326s) and click AddSelect the Activities tab on your left and select one of the activities that contains this device and click Change your settings to add the new device. Please repeat this for each activity.If you could confirm that this has fully addressed your issue we would greatly appreciate it.Please don't hesitate to reach out to me personally in the future with any questions you may have.Again, I apologize for your initial experience.  Thank you for your business.Chad ThompsonLogitech - HarmonyGlobal Product Management & MarketingThanks,ChadSo what have we learned from all this?  We've learned that Logitech places top priority on keeping their database blemish-free.  We've also learned that they don't want unhappy customers.  In the immortal words of Bo Bice, ""It's all good.""I'm not going to go overboard here.  I've had some problems with Logitech software in the past:  bugs, bugs, and more bugs.  As far as software goes, on this go-round, the software has worked flawlessly.  I'm planning to do a lot of experimenting with the Smart Control setup, and if it works out, I'm hoping to be able to use it in two more applications in the same house.  It's sad how few multi-function remotes there are out there with good Amazon review ratings.  That was what led me here in the first place.  I'm now another member of the fan club.All the best,Tim","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G52ZEYCUTK17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ5RYI4#wasThisHelpful","R3G52ZEYCUTK17","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have to conform to the standards laid out in this book, you obviously have to buy it.  If you are looking for a really good style manual, there are better ... and there are also worse.  A style manual normally includes coverage of grammar and then goes beyond that with recommendations on how to apply it.  It provides rules for the ""gray"" areas in which pure grammar leave a lot of lattitude.  One goal of a style manual is to help you learn to make your writing ""scan well,"" that is, make it smooth and easy to follow so that a reader gets the meaning on the first pass.  A style manual will also help with formatting.The ultimate style manual is The Chicago Manual of Style, which is the standard at most of the major publishing houses.  It has roughly twice the useful content of the USGPO manual.Are you familiar with the difference in usage of ""that"" and ""which""?  It has to do with restrictive versus non-restrictive clauses, and it is a rule that is observed formally in America but not in the U.K.  It's an example of a rule that Chicago covers but the USGPO does not.  Proper usage will definitely make your prose scan better (even if you're British).You may wonder why I called this manual ""mediocre,"" yet I gave it four stars.  I wish I could give it three and a half, but it is enough better for me than some others (e.g., the AP Stylebook), that I decided on four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YMZL8MPRYPTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147005499X#wasThisHelpful","R2YMZL8MPRYPTF","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is on a level somewhere between undergrad and graduate level mechanics.  It will be VERY useful to students in either capacity.  It is an absolute tragedy that Schaum has stopped publishing it.  Engineering students of dynamics will equally profit from this book.  It would also be great for reviewing for prelim's/qualifiers.I'm a huge fan of Murray Spiegel's writing.  He has a way of cutting through to the heart of the matter and then explaining and demonstrating applications.  It's not that I'm against theory; it's just that I don't feel comfortable until I've solved real problems with real-world numbers and units. This book gets you to that level quickly.  Of course, you learn more when you have to figure out more for yourself, but sometimes time is of the essence.When I took a course out of Goldstein's Classical Mechanics, the professor used problems out of this book by Speigel to illustrate points.  (He didn't admit that; we just figured out what was going on.)BTW, an intermediate undergrad book that also tends to make this subject easy is Becker's book.  That book being out of print is yet another tragedy.Since you're looking for books on mechanics, I have to mention one more classic: Symon's Mechanics.  That book, however, is the direct opposite of a Schaum's Outline.  It has an exceptionally lucid explanation of principles, but it requires a huge leap to actually solve the problems at the end chapters beyond Chapter 3.  Many students have had to ""grow up"" as physicists to be able to solve the harder problems in that book.  It is, to undergrads, what Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics is to graduate students.  (It took me 18 pages to work one of Jackson's problems, and, when I finished, I felt like I should publish it!)  Symon's book isn't that tough, but attaining the required proficiency to solve the tougher problems is a worthy rite of passage.  I worry that problem solutions on the internet and greater reliance on computer-based solution are robbing the next generation of physicists of analytical skill.The fact is, classical mechanics has had no significant discoveries in the last 80 years.  Related diciplines, such as quantum mechanics, have influenced the way that classical mechanics is taught in only minor ways.  But educators seem to have a need to be trendy.  Physics types are probably the least trend-oriented, but it's inexplicable to me that books like this one and Becker have fallen by the wayside.  Profs should be recommending these books even if they don't use them as texts.  At least Goldstein and Symon have stood the test of time pretty well.Bottom line:  If you're studying mechanics/dynamics or if you just want a handy reference for review, you owe it to yourself to have this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBRF78ZRP0CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0070602328#wasThisHelpful","R3CBRF78ZRP0CK","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a very good desk reference on mathematical functions.  You can browse it right here on the Amazon website, so I won't go into a lot of detail on contents.  A more modern book, NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions, is based on this classic and should be considered by any modern buyer.  I gave the book five stars because it offers a broad set of basic functions at a very low price -- lower than the NIST edition.  The print in this Dover edition is small.  The original, Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables, National Bureau of Standards, Applied Mathematics Series, was a big, thick book with pretty large type.  You can follow the link and buy one on Amazon cheap.  I've been using that edition since just a few years after it was released by the NBS in 1964.  The old book, amusingly, had tables that appeared to have been produced, not through type-setting, but by typing on a mechanical typewriter!  My guess is they wanted to save money and avoid possible errors in typesetting.  Some have said that the tables are no longer useful.  If I convert the functions to computational algorithms, the tables can be extremely handy for checking.Other reviewers have stated that this book does not provide computational algorithms.  That's true some of the time, but not all of the time.  I once lifted two recursive formulas for the error function from this book that I programmed directly into a hand calculator. (No, I'm not a masochist; this was a long time ago before PCs.)  Fact is, an awful lot of functions are now included in programming language libraries, not to mention MatLab, etc.Today, I happen to be using the formulas for solution of the cubic equation, which I lifted from this book.  Did I have to do a little work to make them computationally practical? Yes.  This book wasn't the only source I had, but it gave me the best starting point that I could find.  I couldn't find a directly implementable computational algorithm anywhere.This book was THE standard among physicists beginning pretty much when it was published and lasting for a good twenty years.  For me, it's still the first place I look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3957MKBJAPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486612724#wasThisHelpful","R1F3957MKBJAPA","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been using the LaCie with two Macs.  The Thunderbolt port stopped working with both Macs.  Neither of the Macs has a USB 3.0 port, so I'm stuck as far as the Macs are concerned.  When I plug the Thunderbolt cable into either Mac, the light on the drive flashes continuously at a very high rate, but neither Mac detects the drive.When you set up the LaCie, you can define two partitions, a Share partition formatted for both Mac and PC and a partition formatted for Mac only.  Neither of the partitions will now register through the Thunderbolt port.  Both will register through the USB 2.0 ports on the Macs.  Oddly, on one of the Macs, even the USB 2.0 port is crippled; I've not been able to salvage a single file from the LaCie with that Mac.  Files that were copied were corrupted.  Currently only the folders are visible and not the files.  Fortunately, USB 2.0 works on the other Mac, and I've been able to salvage the files.  Both of the Macs are recent models running Mountain Lion.  There were no software updates made to the Macs that could have triggered the problem.I did not make this purchase on Amazon.  I bought it new and in its unopened original packaging on eBay.  I haven't determined how LaCie will treat me on this.  Was the LaCie I purchased on eBaY only sold there because it was known to be defective?  It's unlikely, but not impossible.  I'm telling you the whole story.One thing I noticed was that when it was working, the drive stayed very warm when plugged into a computer via the Thunderbolt port, even when idle and even after it had been ejected on the Mac.  I've read similar comments from other users, so that's not just my unit.  As you'd expect, it sped up the drain on my MacBook Air.  If the LaCie hadn't stopped working simultaneously on both computers, I'd worry that it had damaged the computers.Bottom line:  this expensive drive has reliability that is highly suspect.  I wish I knew of a better alternative to recommend.  If anyone knows of one, please add a comment.  Also, if anyone has one of these that doesn't run very warm, please offer a comment.  If that were the case, users could buy from Amazon and return the ones that ran warm.Later addition:  I now see that 2 people took the trouble to say that they found this review helpful, while 10 went to the trouble to say that it was not helpful.  This is a hazard of writing negative reviews:  you get a lot of ""unhelpful"" hits.  Amazon keeps score on ""helpful"" versus ""unhelpful"" responses, and the ""unhelpfuls"" hurt the reviewer's rating.  Of course, if a review appears to be dishonest or misleading we should indicate that it is unhelpful.  If it doesn't provide a highly positive evaluation, some may  think it hasn't helped them find an answer since it didn't say ""buy this.""  Some people who have good luck with a product, or just WANT to like it, will go down the line and hit the ""unhelpful"" button for every one-star and two-star review.  I personally value positive and negative reviews equally when they are based on real-world, hands-on experience with a product that I can't test for myself.  In the case of this review, I went out of my way to warn people of what happened to me.  In the past, I've gone back and deleted honest, but negative, reviews because of the ""unhelpful"" scores they generated.  I'm not going to do that on this one yet, but if the ""unhelpful"" hits keep coming, I'll have no choice.  Deleting the review is, in a sense, dishonest, so I'm going to hang tough for a while.  BTW, my reviews are about 10-to-1 positive.  Also, if I solve early problems, I go back and increase my score and explain why I did.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O5U4PO3MZF3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4BEG8M#wasThisHelpful","R1O5U4PO3MZF3I","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spreader will cover more ground, faster, with less hassle, for less money than anything I've tried.  I've been using spreaders for 40 years.I've used several of the kinds that roll on the ground and broadcast.  They're slow because they're low to the ground and the seed (or fertilizer) hits the ground before it can go very far.  Also, you can't vary the spin rate independently of your walking rate (as I explain later).I've used rolling drop spreaders, and while they are very precise, they are even slower than rolling broadcasters because they cover such a narrow path.  I do use them for seed to cover areas close to beds so that I can avoid growing grass in the beds.Until I got this spreader, the fastest things I'd used were the old hand-carried, wood-and-metal-and-canvas broadcast spreaders.  They had two problems.  When you filled them you had to have help because the canvas top would bend, and the whole thing would flop over and spill.  If you used fertilizer in them they would last one season before they corroded so badly, they were useless.  They were cheap, and they were very fast, and a lot of pros used them for seed and even fertilizer.  I used them because they were fast, but lately I haven't seen them in the stores, probably because people kept beating up the retailers over the corrosion problem.Then, from Amazon, I got a very expensive, hand-carried broadcast spreader call the Solo.  Terrible choice.  It didn't fall over, and it didn't corrode, but it was slow as molasses in the winter and didn't spread evenly.  It was also very hard to use without catching your finger in the mechanism.  It didn't hold a lot either.  I hated it.My neighbor had a huge, heavy, pro-grade handheld broadcaster that worked pretty well, didn't fall over, and didn't corrode.  I used it once.  I lift weights, but this thing was terribly unwieldly.  I actually tried several times to find one at the Farmer's Supply where he said he got it, and I never could.  Now I'm glad I didn't.I've used the little one-handed scoop-shaped spreaders you find a Home Depot et al.  They are fine for sprinkling seed on spots, but they're too small for full yards.  You'd do better spreading by hand out of a bag.And then along comes the Earthway 2750.  It does everything the old hand-carried, wood-and-metal-and-canvas broadcast spreaders would do, only better in terms of smooth cranking and speed variability.  It won't corrode (although I do worry about one little screw).  It doesn't flop over for two reasons:  (1) it has vertical plastic pieces you install in the front and back of the bag to hold it up;  (2) it has a wide, very stable base to keep the whole thing from tipping over.  The zipper on top is a nice touch to ensure that it doesn't spill when you're hoisting it onto your shoulder.  It costs a lot less than the Solo and will cover a yard more evenly in about 20 percent of the time.Now, let me manage expectations.  If you've never used a hand-held broadcast spreader before, don't fill it all the way up the first time.  You especially don't want to fill it all the way up with heavy fertilizer.  Once it's loaded, start out gingerly.  Prop it against your stomach to get it out in front of you.  You vary the width of the path that you sow by how fast you turn the crank (which slings the seed out).  The amount that you put down per square yard depends on three things:  (1) how far back you pull the left-hand lever; (2) how fast you walk; and (3) how fast you crank (because that varies the width).  It is not like learning to ride a bicycle, but it does take getting used to.  Once you get the hang of it (punny) you'll find it gives you wonderful control -- far more than any rolling spreader.Okay, I read the review from the person who said she got the fertilizer all over her.  I just walked in from using it, and I don't have a particle of fertilizer on me, but I certainly understand how it can happen.  Before you fill it up the first time, hold it in position and walk while turning the crank.  Pull back the left (valve or throttle) lever and look down to see what the valve in the bottom is doing.  Get comfortable doing that much first.  Next, fill it about 1/4 full.  Start walking and cranking BEFORE you open the valve.  Open it slowly.  If you do this, I predict you'll be totally successful the first time out and not waste a bit of seed or fertilizer.I also read the review from the guy who broke his spreader.  I was concerned by that.  The only way I can see that happening would be if you tried to  strong-arm the crank.  Just spin it up gently before you open the valve.  If you try to spin it up fast when it's clogged with fertilizer, you could stress the mechanism.  If you are using pelletized fertilizer, you're going to need to break up any clumps.  Follow these suggestions, and I'll be very surprised if you break it.***Update***  I've now been using this spreader for over a year, and I'm still sold on it.  It still works like new.Good luck!Tim","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9V6ADJPG5EG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009GZA6O#wasThisHelpful","R9V6ADJPG5EG6","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time of this writing, there is one other review, which gives the product one star.  The review says there are no instructions.  My clock came with good instructions, a two-sided sheet inside the sealed box.  The sheet was folded up very small and could easily be overlooked.  (I'm not saying the other reviewer's clock had instructions that he overlooked -- please take what I say at face value.)  Now, on to the review.The clock performs mostly as advertised.  The time readout is tall enough to be easily read from 10 feet away in decent light.  The day, date, and temperature readouts are much smaller.The one problem with performance is that the temperature measurement is about 4 degrees high.  It seems that most digital travel alarms now have temperature measurement.  They probably all use the same electronic module, and I expect that all of them are similarly unreliable.  Of course, mine may be much worse than typical.  I didn't want temperature measurement.  It can't help battery life.  Temperature measurement is only useful to me if it is about somewhere else;  I can tell well enough for myself how my motel room is doing.  Also note that the temperature measurement is very slow, at least an hour, to respond to, say 5 degrees change in temperature.  Even if your clock is better calibrated, don't expect it to tell you your motel room temperature if you have just taken it out of your suitcase.The clock is very lightweight, which makes it feel a bit cheap.  I'm sure the designers assumed that lighter was better in today's world of airline weight limits.  Most of the clock is plastic, but the front panels, left and right, are wrapped in a thin sheet of metal veneer.  This adds a look, if not a feel, of quality.It uses a CR2032 battery, which is a large button cell (included, of course).  When you change the battery, you have to reset the clock, including the month, day, and year as well as the hour and minute.  Hopefully, this will not be frequent.  Setting is fairly quick and intuitive.There is a tab on the back that flips out to act as a ""table stand.""  That's how you prop it up on your bedside table.There is a large, wide, snooze/light button on top.  It will be easy to find in the dark.  The downside is that, while it takes significant force to push it, the button is easy to accidentally press when you're handling the clock -- like when you're setting it.  The sliding cover does not cover the snooze/light button, so you have to be careful to pack the clock so that the button isn't pressed in transit, which would keep the light on and run down the battery.  Taking the battery out is not a good option since, as I said earlier, you have to reset everything if you remove the battery for even a second.The light does an outstanding job of even illumination of the screen, which is apparently backlit.  I've had a number of travel alarms that were lit from one or both sides and extremely hard to read in the dark.  Also, older clock bulbs seem to burn out as a matter of course, even with light use.  I'd like to think that this clock uses an LED with attendant long life and low wattage, but I have no idea if this is the case.One last note:  When you first use the clock, you have to remove the insulating tab in the battery compartment.  I didn't get the cover back on straight  before the first time I went through the setting process.  When I later tried to straighten the cover, the battery lost contact for a millisecond and I had to redo the setting sequence.I would have given the clock five stars if the temp gauge had worked accurately.  The clock will do the job for me, and I recommend it to anyone who needs something lightweight and doesn't need a temperature gauge.Tim","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SH7D786CRVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M5PB7M#wasThisHelpful","R10SH7D786CRVR","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well-made product.  I did find the Amazon description to be misleading.  It says there is an o-ring where it attaches to the engine.  This is not true.  You have a simple pipe thread where you attach to the engine.  The o-ring is (happily) on the other end where the cap is that you remove to drain the oil.  It's a good system with only one compromise:  the hose stays full of oil that is not used by the engine and is lost every time you drain the engine.  This, I believe, is why manufacturers don't use this approach.  The amount of oil lost is probably under an ounce, so it's no big deal.As you can see from reading other reviews, the real question is whether it is workable in your engine's geometry.  Can you attach it?  If you can, will the hose be long enough?  Will you be able to tuck it out of the way?  I have to wonder about people who blame these problems on the product.  Try to figure this all out BEFORE you buy.I used my Drainzit hose to replace one of the little Briggs and Stratton twist-to-seal kits that came on a 15-year-old riding mower.  The old kit was leaky after 15 years, and it was always a hassle to deal with, partly because of its poor accessibility.  I made up my mind that I was going to replace it if it meant cutting sheet metal to get access.  I expected trouble removing the old B&S one and installing this one.  I avoided cutting metal by using a stubby  wrench (from one of those cheap Harbor Freight sets).  I ground down the shoulders on the open end side to allow it to maneuver.  (Not sure why a low-leverage wrench designed to get into tight spaces would need wide shoulders anyway.)  I wrapped the Drainzit's pipe thread in teflon tape so that I wouldn't need to get it super tight and could ensure a leak-free connection.  It worked.You may be considering the B&S Valve Kit.  There are a couple of advantages for it.  First, you don't have to leave the hose on.  Second, it doesn't waste any oil.  This is the same B&S kit that I said was a hassle.  It is a valve that you twist and pull out to open.  You push in and twist in the other direction to close.  If it is hard to get to, it'll drive you nuts.  As I said, mine leaked eventually, but the little yellow cap that they now provide should reduce or eliminate leakage -- assuming the little cap holds up.  If your oil port is easy to get to, and you don't want a floppy hose to deal with, you should consider the B&S alternative.  The Drainzit will give you a sure seal and be easier to work with in most configurations, but if you need a really long hose, you can buy the B&S and a separate long hose.Bottom line:  The Drainzit product does what it is supposed to do.  Before you buy, you should look carefully at how you will install it, use it, and live with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y35GEVCPZ4DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PDN3HY#wasThisHelpful","R2Y35GEVCPZ4DB","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How can a little remote control stun anybody, you ask?  Because, in this day of foreign made, poorly conceived, poorly executed, poorly documented electronic devices, this item stands alone in my experience.  It will control my iPhone, used as a music server, from 30 feet away through two walls.  It is an ideal size.  It has a hidden, but easily accessible, keypad to support certain functions.  It has an off/on switch so you can carry it without worrying about running down the battery (bluetooth demands this).  The setup is straightforward, only because of the superb little instruction brochure.  Once it has been set up, you reconnect it by first turning on BT on your controlled device and then switching on the remote. (Of course, I could choose to leave my iPhone BT on all the time, but that would speed up the depletion of its already short-lived battery.)Speaking of the instructions, all I can say is ""Wow.""  How can I be ""wowed"" by instructions, you ask?  Because they are clearer, better written, and better illustrated than any instructions for anything I currently own.  Are you tired of the uncertainty of not knowing what you're going to have to face when you open an instruction brochure?  Are you sick of convoluted explanations and hideous grammar in instruction booklets for just about everything you buy?  Are you sick of typos?  (On more complex devices, are you insulted when you have to buy a book to learn all the features?)  I have $4000 cameras and $75000 cars (new price, I bought used) with manuals that don't come close to this  little product's manual in terms of quality.  The writing is beyond clear and correct, it's actually sophisticated.  They apparently spent the whopping $200 to have a professional editor make it what it is.This is obviously a 5-star review, but could the remote be improved?

"While this product seems expensive as an add-on to do what an iOS device (iPad, Pod, Phone, etc.) already does, it's practically free when compared to high-end audio investment cost.  Using it as a headphone amp, all you do is plug the Lightning end of your iOS device's cable into the device and the USB end into the iDo.  Then plug your headphones into the iDo and voila.  Other reviewers have already said that this device greatly improves typical iOS-device sound, and it does.  I confess that I'm comparing it to the iPhone 5's audio output, and the iPhone 5's audio is a significant step down in sound quality from earlier iPhones and iPods, probably because it is so small and lightweight.  But there's nothing wrong with the iPhone 5's digital signal, and that's what the iDo uses.  I'd say the iDo will take you 75 percent of the way from iPhone 5 sound to what you'd get from an audiophile rig costing 10 times a much and taking up 20 times as much space.  That's a good deal. If you're an audiophile (audiofool?) or if you happen to have a home theater receiver, you have options that may produce even better sound.The iDo is especially good as a headphone amp, but you can do more with it.  It has RCA line-level jacks on the back that respond to the volume control.  You can connect it to a boom box or set of computer speakers or whatever.  if you're a 'phile, you can input it either to your preamp for switching or directly to power amp(s) if you have separates and don't need the switching.  A more important option is to use the coaxial digital output.  If you're a 'phile who has a separate digital-to-analog converter (DAC), you can do it that way.  If you have a home theater rig, you probably have the ability to connect the digital output to your home theater receiver.  If you have an expensive receiver, its built in DACs are probably better than what's in the iDo.  Whether or not that's true, your home theater receiver is the gateway to your home theater speakers.  No question that this is how 90 percent of digital-output users will do it.  Understand that when you use the coaxial output, you are bypassing the iDo's built-in DAC and analog amplification entirely.  Get a coaxial digital cable if you decide to do this.  If you have an old composite or component video cable, that will do in a pinch.If you have a home theater receiver with a USB input or bluetooth, you may be able to play your cell phone directly through the receiver.  If that's your objective, check those options first.I tried using the digital output going directly into a high-end DAC, and it sounded superb, as you'd expect.  Going this route, I have a true, high-end music server in my iPhone 5 (I have 1000 songs from ripped CDs using Apple lossless compression on my iPhone.)  The message is that it produces a clean digital signal.  If you have any home theater receiver, this is a way to use the iDo, even though, in that mode, all it is probably doing is routing the digital signal to the coax output.  (I'm guessing that there's no processing involved -- there may be.)One technical aside:  the volume control, which affects the line-out as well as the headphone output, is analog instead of digital.  It is digitally controlled, but the actual volume reduction uses analog components.  This is a good thing.  Reducing volume digitally into standard DACs can produce very bad sound.So what am I saying?  The iDo is an outstanding headphone amp.  It can serve as a DAC plus a preamp.  It can produce a coaxial digital signal.  So it can be just an add-on to your iPhone to upgrade the headphone sound, or it can turn your iOS device into an outstanding music server for a home theater or even a high-end audio rig (if the rig has DAC capability).To me it's gratifying to see other reviewers praising a product whose sole function in most applications is sound quality improvement.  It's a sign that in an age of synthetic sound, people still hear differences in quality, and people still care enough to go out of their way to get better sound.  I'm tempted to buy another iDo so I can have one at work and one at home -- actually, I could use two at home.  It's a great product that exceeds expectation.***Update*** If you're primarily interested in using the digital output, check the NuForce website for a cheaper option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUP7DOW40WVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LRTH5Q#wasThisHelpful","RSUP7DOW40WVM","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've only had to actually use Eclipse fluid on a sensor three times.  Other times I've gotten by with blowers and brushes.  But when I've used the fluid and a swab from this kit, what I've seen under a loupe has been very impressive.  The sensor has been perfect as far as I've been able to see.  I've never come close to that level of cleanliness with blowers and brushes, which can get large dust particles but tend to just move around the smaller ones.  A loupe will expose dust that is way too small to affect images, so looking perfect means being perfect in a practical sense.  The fluid will wet the sensor and then dry up in half a second, leaving no residue.I really like the little zipper case. I added some Pec Pads  and a few Zeiss, foil-wrapped, pre-moisened cleaning tissues for lenses cleaning.  I also added an Arctic Butterfly brush laid diagonally in the case along with the stuff that came with it.  When I travel, the only cleaning stuff that can't fit in the case are a Giotto's blower and a SensorKlear loupe.  At home, I use a large SensorKlear loupe and carry a small one when I travel.  The magic in the loupes is in the lighting, which makes dust stand out like over-sharpening in Photoshop!The reason for the review title is that I lost my last kit (with the Arctic Butterfly in it).  I made absolutely sure I couldn't find my original, and then bought another.  It is small, lightweight insurance that I depend on.

Now I know why this one gets good ratings.  I'm using it on a Nortel IP phone at work that has a separate socket for a headset.  This device has an active amplifier circuit for the microphone, powered through the socket so that it needs no batteries.  People on the other end say I'm crystal clear when I'm whispering.  The Nortel standard handset gets the opposite comments:  ""Can you speak louder?  I can barely hear you.""  The receiver is excellent as well:  everything sounds clear and natural on my end.

"The Arctic Butterfly has a brush suitable for cleaning delicate optics with conducting bristles to help remove statically charged debris.  The brush can be spun using a battery-powered motor to remove the debris from the bristles.  (You never spin the brush against the object you are cleaning.) Spinning helps eliminate some problems with brush contamination and speeds the cleaning process.  This particular kit contains four different brushes:  an APS-sized sensor brush (about a half-inch wide and about the size of the standard Arctic Butterfly brush); a sensor brush that is about 3/4 in wide; a sensor brush almost an inch wide, and a mirror brush about an inch wide exactly matching the size of an APS-C camera's mirror.  The APS brush is supposed to be stored on the motor.  There is one small plastic adaptor for adapting each brush to the motor (not sure why that was necessary).I've used an Arctic Butterfly brush many times before on both APS-C sensors and on a full-frame sensor.  It is very convenient to be able to run the brush over the sensor a couple of times, hold it away from the camera and spin it, and then run it over the sensor again.  You may wisely be asking whether you need all these different-sized brushes just for sensors.  I don't really see the need, even if you have different sized sensors as I do.  It is nice to have a separate brush for the mirror, and that was what made me buy.  I don't like to let a sensor brush touch anything but a sensor.  I've used the same brush on APS-C and full-frame sensors with no problem.  Only the APS-C brush in this kit is small enough for an APS-C sensor.  The larger brushes are definitely too large for an APS-C sensor.  If you want to have multiple brushes for spares and are worried about the spares being too big, don't be.  You could easily trim off the outside bristles to get any of them to an optimum size.  As I explain below, the one thing you don't want is a brush that's too big.  BTW, the mirror brush appears to have the same bristles as the sensor brushes.I use a sensor-cleaning loupe whenever I clean a sensor because it makes all dust visible.  It will show dust that is much too small to appear in a picture.When I have a sensor problem, I'll use a blower first.  If that doesn't work, I'll use a brush.  Normally, if debris hasn't been left on too long, a brush will get it.  Only in severe cases do I resort to cleaning fluid, although cleaning fluid makes a sensor look cleaner under a loupe than any brush.I do want to offer a word of caution.  You must be extremely careful not to let a sensor brush touch anything but a sensor.  I once let an Arctic Butterfly brush touch the inside of my camera at a point near the sensor.  It apparently picked up some grease, because it suddenly started smearing my sensor.  I successfully used Photographic Solutions Eclipse fluid to clean both the brush and the sensor, but it wasn't a pleasant experience.  This is precisely why you must not try to use the larger brushes on an APS-C sensor without trimming them first.  You have probably read the review from the guy who claimed a brush was making small scratches on his sensor.  My guess is that he got some grease on it like I did, and what he saw were grease tracks.  I saw a review of another Arctic Butterfly brush that said the reviewer's brush suddenly started smearing his sensor.  That doesn't happen spontaneously.  The grease doesn't just materialize on the brush.  And I personally don't think it's possible for these bristles to actually scratch a sensor.  That would be like saying you scratched glass with a paint brush.  If there's a hazard associated with these brushes, though, I believe brush contamination with something like grease is the hazard.The kit comes with a hard-plastic case and a lightweight zipper case.  I will use the latter and add to it some swabs, Pec Pads, and Zeiss lens-cleaning pads (which I would never use on a sensor, but I have used successfully on lenses and coated filters).  The kit in this form is ideal for me.  I do pack the blower separately.I'm a believer in the Arctic Butterfly brushes.  They do what they're supposed to and they do it well.  Coupled with a (Giotto's) blower, they allow me to avoid cleaning fluid 99 percent of the time.  Bottom line:  This is a good kit for the money.  I'd get it again.Update:  I have encountered a problem.  This kit comes with a hard case and a soft case, which are both extremely nice.  Both cases came with an extremely strong smell of mildew/mold.  The worst was the soft case.  I've tried everything under the sun to clean the soft case because, as I said in my original review, I had plans for that case.  The case is padded, and the padding is not accessible.  I think the padding is the problem is since I've cleaned everything else.  I e-mailed the manufacturer and received no response.  I'd have returned it for a replacement if it were sold by Amazon, but I didn't want to waste time with a third-party vendor on a matter this small.  Also I thought, given that he is a small vendor, his entire stock may be contaminated anyway.

"I bought this unit to replace an older one by Omron (see below) that was reading incorrectly.  This unit agrees with my physician's measurements when made within a minute of each other.  Its measurements are generally repeatable to within a couple of percent when made a few minutes apart.  Pulse-rate measurements have about 2 percent variation over periods of minutes.  It is critically important to follow the directions to the letter, at least for me.  Blood pressure fluctuates with exercise, eating, drinking alcohol, and time of day.  If you are cold when you take measurements, perhaps because you've taken your shirt off or you're in you underwear, your blood pressure may be pushed up.  I have to sit still and relax for about 5 minutes if I want consistent results.  I have to be careful to position my body properly (according to the instructions) and relax my arm with the cuff in place for about 30 seconds.  If I sit down and start taking measurements immediately, even if I've just gotten up in the morning, my readings will taper off from an initially higher value.  This is not the fault of the monitor, it's just ME.  You may be different.  Remember that when a physician or nurse takes your blood pressure, you've usually been sitting in a holding room for awhile, which allows your blood pressure to settle down.  For me it would be a joke to try to compare the results of measurements taken at home with measurements taken in a doctor's office.  I get the feeling that some reviewers expect that.  After working with it extensively, I'm convinced that this monitor is doing its job exactly as it's supposed to.I had an Omron HEM-712C monitor that was about 6 years old. The Omron unit, which had been stored for almost all of the six years in its original box in a climate-controlled environment, was not producing reliable results.  The diastolic measurements were more than 10 percent low.  I bought the Panasonic EW 3122S because it was from a different manufacturer and had the best reviews of options on Amazon.  I've been extremely pleased with the results.The box and the Amazon listing incorrectly state that an AC adaptor can be purchased separately.  Panasonic no longer makes an adapter, and the accompanying material clearly says not to substitute another adaptor.  The device still has a jack on the side for an AC adaptor, probably because is costs less to keep installing the jacks than to redo the plastic mold for the housing.  The monitor uses 4 AA batteries in series, and the formerly available power supply (EW31225) was six volts DC.  Pictures of the old supply indicate that it was a fairly large supply, meaning it had a fairly high current rating, and a Radio Shack wall-wart substitution won't do the job.  So far, I've made 75 measurements with one set of alkaline AAs, and they are going strong.  For this reason, I didn't deduct a star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7WRHSP8O09H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQKH8I#wasThisHelpful","RQ7WRHSP8O09H","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the earlier reviews before buying or installing this cartridge.  When I opened it, I did all the standard shaking motions, rotating it back and forth, etc., even though there were no written instructions.  I pulled out the orange tape.  I lifted the shield and pulled out the piece of paper.  I also removed the often-discussed orange tab.  I decided to remove it because the OEM cartridge that I was replacing didn't have a tab.  I then gave the cartridge a few more shakes, installed it, and turned on the printer.  The printer did its standard, getting-ready, humming noise for longer than I expected.  Then it fell silent and the printer lights eventually started blinking in the proper pattern.  Using the printer utility on a Mac, I printed the standard demo page.  Voila:  the print was letter-perfect, side-to-side and top-to-bottom on the very first try.  The print was just as black and as sharp as with the OEM cartridge.The biggest single problem with the P1100w is the cost of toner expended per page.

"We have four of these, all of which were bought at Target, so there was no risk of receiving a less-than-perfect-condition item, as happened to one reviewer.  We've taken three of the bags on a total of eight flight segments and on and off a cruise ship.  (Cruise lines tend to be even worse than airports and airlines when it comes to treatment of luggage.)  We've also dragged them a long way, including a quarter mile to a water taxi in Venice.  The three bags still look absolutely like new.  The only mishap has been loss of a zipper tab, which disappeared between luggage pick-up on a ship and arriving at home.  My guess is that a glancing blow on a conveyor knocked it off.  The luggage has a 10 year warranty, so I expect to get a replacement tab and reattach it myself.  (Warranties may not be as good as they sound when you consider the problem of shipment.  If you bought from Amazon, you'd at least have a box.)The bags roll and swivel well.  Spinners, as you probably know, will swivel and roll freely while standing upright.  Unlike some spinners, these bags will roll backward while tilted forward, which can be handy when going on and off elevators where there's not enough room to turn around.  This is what the ad copy means when it says ""Push, pull, or turn in any direction with effortless mobility.""  When on a flat, smooth surface, I can slip my Tumi roll-aboard over the American Tourister's handle and roll the AT upright.  This vastly reduces the burden on long hauls.  The bag did just fine carrying the extra weight, which probably exceeded a total of 75 pounds.The name of the game now in air travel is to make full use of your 50-pound allowance for checked bags.  I've weighed all four of the AT 29s empty, and they come in within a tenth of a pound of 11.5 pounds.  That's about half the weight of some of our older luggage, and it's a big deal, given the 50 pound limits.  The expansion feature will allow you to get the weight up to 50 pounds, even when packing only clothing.  It's obvious that these bags were sized to reach a total weight of 50 pounds, and with heavier (denser) items, you can exceed 50 pounds without using the expansion volume.  Today's savvy traveler who is pushed against the weight limit will put his heavy (high-density) stuff in carry-on bags, which currently have limits on dimensions but not on weight.  Under such conditions, many will use a roll-aboard  and a back pack (or in my wife's case, a large pocketbook) along with a single checked bag.  On a full plane, you won't be allowed to put two carry-ons in the overhead, so one will have to go under the seat.  If the backpack is fairly small, it can fit under the seat without totally constricting leg movement on long flights.  If you use this trick to handle your heavy (dense) items, you'll likely be able to make full use of the expansion feature without going over 50 pounds.  A disadvantage of the expansion feature is that your clothes will be compressed when the bags are stacked.  The expansion goes outside of the basic frame.  I prefer to keep the expansion volume zipped down when possible.So far I'm extremely pleased with this luggage.  If I have problems later, I'll update this review.***Update*** I've now had four of these for another year.  They've been overseas again and on another cruise ship as well as several CONUS trips.  I wouldn't trade them for anything out there.PS:  If you're concerned about weight, you MUST buy one of the little portable luggage scales.  If we lost ours, we'd be in big trouble.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UKT3HPZ24WJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ELBHLM#wasThisHelpful","R2UKT3HPZ24WJI","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read the reviews of people who say the scale won't produce repeatable results.  I just repeated the weighing of an empty suitcase 8 times and every time I got 11.6 pounds.  I found that results are not that repeatable unless you use the following procedure:  (1) switch on the scale; (2) press the left button with the hook hanging free; (3) move the scale so that the hook is under the suitcase top handle; (4) lift up very gradually until the suitcase is off the floor; (5) wait until the number settles out; (6) note the reading; (7) SWITCH THE SCALE BACK OFF and repeat.  If you don't follow this procedure, measurements may vary by plus or minus about 0.3 pounds around a mean value.  The whole procedure takes under 15 seconds if you're really slow.Now let's be real here.  Repeatability doesn't prove accuracy.  A repeatable scale may be repeatably wrong.I bought this scale to ensure that my bags are under the airlines' 50 pound weight limit.  I've noted that airlines will normally let a bag through if it is within two pounds of 50, so the scale doesn't have to be all that accurate.  In addition, I'd bet the airlines' scales aren't good to better than half a pound, especially considering the beating they take.  My rule of thumb is to stay at or below a reading of 49.2 pounds, just to be safe.  So far, I've run 14 bags through that were just below 50 pounds and I've had no problems.I couldn't live without this thing now.  When my family travels they like to live on the edge of overweight.  And then they like to buy stuff and bring it home.  I often end up having them switch the high-density items to carry-ons.  We end up switching things around multiple times to get all checked bags under 50.  Before we got this scale, we actually had to switch items on the floor of the airport when we were over the limit.  We were relying on a bathroom scale.  Now we've solved the problem.  It simply wouldn't be possible without this scale.  If you're trying to stay under the airline 50-pound limit, I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4WLWNRRJO5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KYYB08#wasThisHelpful","R3J4WLWNRRJO5L","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These same tags in different colors have a 4.5 average on three reviews.  One of the the previous reviews on the present listing said the tags ""slide open without trying"" so the reviewer just tossed them.  What the reviewer is referring to is the fact that the tags slide open to expose a complete address form on the back of the name block that is always visible through the little window.  I have two sets of these tags, and mine don't slide open easily at all.  You have to grip them firmly and pull fairly hard.  If they do slide open, you can just slide them back again; nothing is lost.The other of the two reviews that gave one star (the only two on this listing when I'm writing this) said his broke the first time he used it.  I just ran three of them on 4 flight segments and mine are just fine, thank you.  I'm not saying that it's impossible for them to break, especially considering how our luggage is handled.  But these tags are made of a heavy, non-brittle, PVC-like material that would not break when I just jumped up and down on them.  It would probably take a hammer.I'm about to order four more.Update:  I've now run four of them on 4 more flight segments and through one cruise ship.  Cruise lines are harder on luggage than airlines.  Still no problems.  If I do have problems in the future, I'll report them.2nd Update:  I've now run six of them on many more flight segments and another cruise, and still no problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VHS23QVG599/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WYD8DG#wasThisHelpful","R20VHS23QVG599","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had trouble getting MapSource to see my nuvi 2555 on two Windows 7 computers.  I was finally successful on one, but never on the other.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the software comes with no useful map anyway.  I contacted Garmin, who told me to download their free BaseCamp software.  BaseCamp turned out to completely meet my needs.  It has a choice of settings for automotive, motorcycling, walking, hiking, and others.  You use BaseCamp with your GPS device connected, and it uses the maps right off of the device without uploading.Be sure you are using a UPS 2.0 or better port, or it will be unbearably slow.  It is retrieving map data for your large computer screen, which is beyond what the nuvi or other device was designed to support. For that reason, even with USB 2.0, it's not super fast when updating screens or computing complex routes. Basecamp allows you to define and store waypoints, routes and other data and exchange with your device.  When you first plug in the device, expect the software to take a minute to see it.  Also, BaseCamp may take several minutes to process the maps the first time.  After that first time, it should only take about 20 seconds to be ready to go.  It is supposed to support the exchange of maps, but I've not gotten it to upload from the device, and I don't have anything to download.BaseCamp isn't perfect, and it takes a little getting used to, but  Garmin has a series of videos on their site that show how to use it.  You might want to just look at the videos before you bother with download and installation. I urge you to give it a look before you spring for the product under review.

"First of all, the instructions that come with the battery say to charge it before using.  I suggest you follow the instructions, even if it will power your computer immediately.  Given that this battery is 9-cell, and my original equipment battery is 6-cell, I expected to get about 50 percent more time out of this one, and, so far, I have.  I have run it down to about 25% of full life, and recharged it twice with perfect performance.  If I have trouble down the road, I'll come back and amend this review.  If you don't see an amendment here, assume it is still going strong.  My original review date is 29 May 2012.The battery is close to 50 percent heavier than the OEM battery.  Also, it extends downward so that it is not flush with the bottom of the computer.  This causes it to tilt the computer sightly forward toward the user.  This is a good thing from the standpoint of ventilation.  I know people who prop up the backs of their computers just to achieve this effect.  It is a bad thing if you need it to be flat on both sides to slip in to a briefcase or whatever.The seller actually contacted me to makes sure I was satisfied.  That, also, is reassuring.I'm comfortable enough with this battery that I'm about to take it on a trans-atlantic flight.  This purchase has turned out very well for me.

"The Duo replaced a processor in my system that retailed for $4000 and won The Perfect Vision's video product of the year award.  The Duo equaled the performance of that (Optoma) processor in terms of enhanced video performance.  I'm using it on an Optoma HD81 projector that has no built-in processing.  The Duo produced a huge gain in picture sharpness that is dramatic on a 12-foot screen. That level of projection magnifies flaws mercilessly.Of all the video features, the one I like most is the Detail Enhancement (DE).  I've done a lot of work with sharpening (even read a whole book on the subject) in still photography.  In that medium, what goes on is edge enhancement, which sharpens the transition between light and dark areas (by a Gaussian de-convolution, if you speak that language).  The iScan has that capability as well, but the DE is the really surprising capability to me.  I think it may be some kind of frame-to-frame correlation thing.  Anyway, it makes pictures really pop off the screen.  I'll run DE at 80 to 90 percent and edge sharpening at about 20 percent.  If I overdo edge sharpening on my system, I get visible artifacts.  On my 12-foot screen the picture improvement can be spectacular on some material.  It makes everything better.  I haven't found a lot of need for noise reduction, but remember that any sharpening will bring out noise.  I run noise reduction fairly low.You can spend a lot more, but I don't think you'll do much better in picture quality unless you're planning to invest in a professional calibration.  If you want to see what the competition is, go to the B&H Photo website.  You'll quickly conclude that there's no competition in the iScan Duo's price bracket.The Duo has one feature that has made a huge difference for me personally.  It has the capability to split out the audio signal and output it separately, including an audio coax jack, an optical audio jack, and an HDMI jack.  If you want the high-end surround formats, you must use the HDMI audio out jack.  My old processor did not have this feature.  When I used it (or the Duo) downstream of my audio preamp-processor (which behaves like a receiver), I had very serious problems with format transitions that I won't go into.  The Duo allows me to get the audio pre-pro out of the video signal path entirely.  While the Duo is not as slick (and has an ugly display), it has solved my problem, which was a showstopper for watching TV.The Duo will fully support anamorphic lens use, although it is incapable of automatic recognition or triggering a sled mount as my previous processor would.  On the Duo you can set an image for an anamorphic lens by simply switching to the 4:3 letterbox mode.  That mode will spread a 16:9 letterbox image to fully fill the frame with no loss of content.  You can also use the vertical stretch capability as another alternative, but 4:3 letterbox is the perfect solution.While it does offer a nice array of color adjustments, it does not have the flexibility of my previous processor.  It is more than good enough for me in that regard.If you want to do any sophisticated scaling (such as anamorphic lens support), expect to spend some time reading and rereading the manual.  Be sure to notice that the manual has some additions at the end to cover multiple firmware upgrades.  DVDO needs to fold those into the document and not just leave them to be discovered at the end after significant frustration.The manual and menus use some non-intuitive language to describe certain features.  Expect to have to take some notes.  An example is ""Active (Aspect Ratio).""  This refers to the aspect ratio of the incoming signal.  It is called ""active"" because it indicates the amount of the incoming frame that is active as opposed to blacked out as bars above and below or on the sides.  All the manual says is ""This is aspect ratio of content or movie.""Another example of potential confusion:  Turn off Auto AR when you want to work with the Picture and Active AR menus.  That critical tip is not provided in the descriptions of those menus.The front panel digital display is not as attractive as even a cheap receiver, and it only stays on for a short time.  Of course, once you're set up, you'll want it off anyway.I'm going to report one ugly problem that I had, but let me say up front that it should not affect you at all.  I found that putting HDMI switching ahead of the Duo caused the audio output circuits of the Duo to fail.  This happened on two separate Duo units.  Amazon covered me.  They were going to pull it from their shelves, but I told them the problem would probably never affect another of their customers.  I also said I'd write this review and warn buyers.  Message:  if you're going to use the Duo, expect to do your switching with it.I should also report that the technical assistance person that I spoke to at DVDO was outstanding.  He was knowledgeable and courteous, and, equally importantly, he was accessible.One thing you have to understand about putting any kind of device in the HDMI path is that format changes, source changes, etc. will not transition as quickly or cleanly.  HDMI has to redo all the HD Copy Protection (HDCP) handshaking when it thinks something has changed, and adding devices in series can create havoc.  It will happen when you change TV channels and the video format changes (e.g., 720p to 1080i).  If you keep your installation simple, the iScan Duo will work well.The current generation of flat-panel TVs already offers vastly improved processing over previous generations.  For this reason, standalone processors may be a dying breed.  If you need one though, as I definitely do, the Duo is an excellent choice.  I don't give five stars lightly, especially after having problems as I did.  In all fairness, though, this is a five-star product.  I hope it works out for you.Tim","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNEYCVADR2AN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Q8HQHE#wasThisHelpful","R3CNEYCVADR2AN","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The sides and bottom of this case are heavily padded so that the exterior width approaches 11cm at the widest point.  It is not perfectly round, having one flat side to allow it to fit against your body or a backpack without constant rolling.  The padding in the top is somewhat thinner, and I may use the extra top space that I have to tuck in a bean bag (the ultimate lightweight tripod).  The padding only adds about 1 cm to the height, so that the external dimensions are about 16x11cm.  The  exterior cladding looks like ballistic nylon, but it is not nearly as coarse as that material usually is.  It has a vertical strap running up the back that will allow you to attach it snugly to a belt.  The strap can be released and reattached at the bottom reliably and securely with velcro.  This will allow you to loop it through your belt, camera bag, backpack, or whatever.  It has double zippers so that they can come together in front and two nylon tab-loops on either end of the zipper opening to grip when closing or opening.While I've owned may Lowepro products over the years, this is my first lens case from them.  I typically use Zing pouches for lenses that didn't come with cases.  The Zings are less bulky, simply because they have far less padding.  I wanted something more sturdy and substantial for this lens, and this case absolutely fills the bill.  The padding adds bulk, but you can't have it both ways.  I will use a Zing when I'm pressed for space, but I'll treat this case like one of the manufacturers' cases on the high-end lenses.  The padding, I should add, adds no significant weight.  Lowepro obviously made weight a priority.While it is certainly not cheap, the quality of the case exceeded my expectation.  It equals the quality of the lens manufacturers' cases at a half to a third of the cost.  If I were going to change anything about these cases, it would be to have closer spaced sizing choices.  I would happily trade this one for one that was a couple of cm shorter.  I highly recommend the case.  As Lowepro likes to proclaim, they've been making excellent products for photographers for many years.  This product is no exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HA82MXACGZZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KJE8FU#wasThisHelpful","R1HA82MXACGZZ7","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pens write as smoothly as a $400 fountain pen.  In some ways they write better, because fountain pens often have a slight delay before the ink flows.  Notice in my title, I said ""WRITES like a fountain pen.""  These pens are not pretty, and they feel anything but expensive in your hand.  That said, I like the thick grip; I also like the fact that you can write with much less pressure than with a ballpoint.  I've been retraining my hand to hold the pens more loosely and use very slight pressure.  My hand writing has improved (which isn't saying much).The Sharpie Grip Stick pens -- the ones with the chrome caps -- write exactly the same as these to me.  Those are a much better choice for carrying in pocket or purse, and they are much better looking.  These are best for sitting in a drawer or in a mug on your desk.  You can grab them and use them much quicker and with just one hand:  it takes two hands to remove a cap.I think Sharpie should make a high-end model that accepts refills.

"Short version:This model is the sweet-spot for homeowners who want long-term reliability and near top performance but do not need to operate with hot water, which doubles or triples the price.  As far as DPW4240 performance goes, I could never go back to one of the lesser washers.  Performance just doesn't compare.  Things get pristine-clean much faster.  Also, I'm not sure more pressure or water throughput would make sense for a homeowner's use.  A downside to so much pressure is that it will blow the paint off of surfaces.  You can deal with this by selecting a nozzle with a wider fan, holding the wand farther from the surface, and/or throttling down the motor.  The build quality on the unit is excellent.  Like ALL gas PWs, this one requires serious maintenance.  I'll describe that later if you want to stick around.  I'll summarize in this short version by saying that I love the washer.  It continues to be worth the price and more.Long version:This is my third year with the DPW4240.  My previous unit was a 3000 psi, 2.7 gpm washer.  Before that, I had one of the larger electric models.  The DPW4240 is a much more serious unit than the lower-powered variety.  It has 40 percent higher max pressure, has a lot more water throughput (4 gpm), and has a 50 foot hose instead of the usual 25 footer.  I can feel the power difference just holding the wand, since the ""thrust"" force is about 80 percent higher.  Everything about this unit is heavier duty, including the wheels and the frame as well as the motor, pump, hose, and wand.  The only problem I've had has been a leaky valve on a tire.  (The tires come with tubes installed.)Handling the wand and hose on this unit can be like wrestling an anaconda.  If you're doing something easy like cleaning a deck floor without repositioning the hose, you can literally relax and lean on it.  If you're trying to reposition the wand hose while holding the trigger pulled, expect it to be challenging.  If you weigh under 110 pounds and don't have good upper-body strength, this may not be for you.There are two ways to destroy your pump that are quicker than failing to do maintenance.  The first is to run it without the water source turned on.  The pump must never run without water in the chamber.  The second is to leave the engine running for more than two minutes without pulling the trigger on the wand.  In this second case, the water in the pump heats up.  As a rule, I don't stop the flow for as much as a minute without pulling the trigger for several seconds to run cool water into the pump.When you are ready to start the motor, first verify that the water is on by pulling the trigger on the wand or surface cleaner and verifying a steady flow.  If it doesn't start after two pulls, pull the trigger to release the pressure build-up in the hose.  (All PWs that I've tried require this.)  Like any PW, this one can be harder to pull-start when the engine is hot.  If you encounter this problem, find someone to hold the wand and keep the trigger pulled while you pull the starter rope.  This fully solves the problem and allows the engine to spin more freely and start more easily.  The person must not be a child, because the sudden turn-on of the ""thrust"" force can make a small person lose his or her balance.  My guess is that manufacturers never tell you of this trick because of safety concerns.  NEVER tie the trigger in the on position on any PW, ever.  When you attach a nozzle to the wand, push the brass collar forward firmly until it clicks.  Otherwise you can shoot it off at seriously high velocity.Before starting, always check the pump oil level.  You can see it in the little plastic window.  Make sure the gas valve is on, water is on, and engine switch (ignition) is on.Here's my prescription for cold starting:  (1) Turn on the gas valve; set the choke to full; set the throttle for about one-third; and turn the ignition switch on.  (2) Pull the trigger on the wand to verify that water is on and flows through the unit without interruption from air-gaps.  (3) Give the rope a pull. (4) Lower the choke to one-half (center position) and pull again.  (4)If the motor has not started, pull the trigger to release pressure; leave the choke at one-half; and try again.  If, after five tries, it hasn't started, go back and give it one or two more pulls at full choke.  If it still won't start, get someone to hold the trigger down as I described above.  I've never failed to get it started.Now for a warm start, which can be trickier:  (1) Be sure the wand is attached to the hose; the wand hose is attached to the washer; the water is on; and the ignition switch is on. (2)Relieve pressure by pulling the trigger.  (3) Set throttle at half and try to start with choke off.  (4) If it doesn't start, continue pulling, advancing the choke a little more each time, always pulling the trigger in between starting attempts to reduce pressure.  (5) Get someone to hold the trigger if necessary.  As before, when someone holds the trigger, it is much easier to pull, and the engine just starts easier.  Warm starts are all about getting the choke right.  If you've fully warmed up the engine and only had it off for a few minutes, it should start on the first pull with the choke off (as long as you've remembered to turn on the ignition switch).  Even after it has run out of gas and had more put in, it normally starts back up on the first pull.Don't drag the garden hose around by just moving the washer.  It puts strain on the hose connection and it can break.When you are finished, if you've been using a cleaning chemical, be sure to run some clear water through the chemical hose to flush out the chemical injection system.One reason that homeowners' gas pressure washers tend not to last is that the homeowners don't maintain them.  In addition to changing motor oil, which you're probably used to with your lawn mower, you must change pump oil.  Pump oil is easier to change than engine oil, because it's so easy to get to.  The pump oil change interval is every 300 hours or 3 months, whichever comes first.  The manuals also have the gall to tell you to adjust the valves on the engine.  The cheaper 3000 psi washers also require this, and I seriously doubt that many owners do it.  (How many owners have a feeler gauge lying around the house?)  If you store the washer in an area that drops significantly below freezing, you're supposed to take steps to protect the pump as well; see the later paragraph on winterizing.  If this is your first washer, or if you haven't done the full maintenance in the past, please read the rest of this review before you buy.  The good news is that the pump oil is easier and less-messy to change than the motor oil.  You can find the pump oil at your local Lowes or Home Depot or at Amazon.  The synthetic Briggs and Stratton pump oil is better, but it costs double.  If you're going to use the pressure washer less than 50 hours every three months, I wouldn't use the synthetic (even though I use nothing but synthetic in my cars).  I'll briefly describe how to adjust the valves at the end of this review.Now, here's how to adjust the valves.  You'll need a 14mm wrench and a 10mm wrench or a 10mm socket with ratchet (or, best of all, an inch-pound torque wrench as I explain later).  Use a 14mm offset box-end if you have it; otherwise, you can get by with an open-end 14mm.  You'll need a feeler gauge, preferably the offset type (that has a bend on each feeler).  These are available from Autozone or Amazon.  (1) Disconnect the spark plug and remove the cylinder head cover.  It is the silver colored cover with OHV embossed on it.  You just remove the center bolt.  Try not to drop the rubber gasket on the floor.  Go ahead and peel the gasket off if it stuck to the engine.  It's easy to put it back on.  (2) Pull on the starter rope to set the piston to the top of the compression stroke.  As you pull the rope, you'll see the valves move.  When they stop moving with the valves up and the rope gets harder to pull, you're in the compression stroke.  If they start to move again, you've gone too far. You want to get close to the end of the compression stroke, which is where the valves start to move again.  Expect to have to experiment. (This is why you want the spark plug disconnected.)  (3) Now for the adjustment.  There are two nuts on top of each rocker arm.  The top nut (10mm), which may be called a locknut or a jam nut, acts to lock the lower nut (14mm) in place.  The lower nut's position determines the valve clearance. The exhaust (left) valve clearance must be adjusted to 0.20mm; the intake (right) to 0.15mm.  To adjust a valve, loosen the top nut several turns; then loosen the bottom nut a couple of turns.  You should then be able to get the feeler into the gap between the rocker arm and the valve.  Next, hand-tighten the bottom nut firmly, pressing the rocker arm onto the feeler gauge.  If you have an offset gauge, it will be easier to manipulate to be sure that it is not tilted as you tighten down.  When it is secure, it should be hard to move the gauge, but it should not be stuck tight.  Now, look carefully at the rotational position of the lower nut -- you don't want that to change as you tighten the top nut to lock it down.  You'll know if it moves, because you won't be able to pull out the feeler!  Use the 14mm wrench to hold the bottom nut in place.  Finger tighten the top nut on the bottom one.  Then take the 10mm wrench, ratchet or torque wrench, and tighten the (top) locknut down to secure the bottom nut.  If the bottom nut turns, you'll have to back up and readjust it.  This is why you need to play close attention to the rotational position of the bottom nut.  Finally, extract the feeler.  Repeat for the other valve. (4) Replace the gasket carefully.  It must seat firmly on the engine.  Then, when you put the cover on, be sure the fit is snug all around.  You don't want the gasket or the cover out of position. (5) Don't forget to reconnect the spark plug, and if the little hose came loose from the valve cover, stick it back in.It's nice to have an inch-pound (i.e., small) torque wrench for setting the locknut down on the bottom nut.  The manual calls for 7 foot pounds, which is 84 inch pounds and is not much torque.  A big torque wrench won't measure that low.  I picked up a decent inch-pound wrench on Amazon: 1/4"" Drive CLICK Micrometer TORQUE WRENCH 20-200 Inch pound.  It's under $20 and works fine.  It doesn't have a distinct click, but you can see and feel the joint bend when it reaches the set torque. The torque wrench functions as a 1/4 inch drive ratchet, so you'll need a 10mm socket.  Store the wrench with torque set for 0 inch pounds.The first time you do the valves, it may take awhile to get the bottom nut to stay put while you tighten the top nut.  With a little practice, you can do the whole exercise in five minutes.  Of course, you only need to do this adjustment once a season.  If the words in the above instructions are totally foreign to you, you may want to take the PW to a small engine shop and have them do everything for you.  If you do, please go to a shop with a known, good reputation.  They all talk a good game, but I had one shop set the valves on the wrong stroke and then refuse to take the blame when the engine had no power!  I redid it properly and the power was fine.  That was when I started doing it all myself.As I mentioned previously, a pressure washer stored at sub-freezing temperatures requires protection.  There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to use a winterizing compound.  Two of the ones out there are Dewalt DP80 and DeVilbiss Pressure Washer Pump Winterizer.  Both are in pressurized canisters with fittings that attach to the PW.  Note that these compounds are explosively volatile and must be handled with extreme care.  DP80 contains both propane and butane!  Read all warnings provided.  Here are the steps you should follow:  (1) Disconnect the high-pressure hose as well as the water hose. (2) Drain water out of hoses.  (3) Be sure ignition switch is off (allows turning over of the engine).  (4) Note that DP80 is potentially explosive containing propane and butane.  (5) Pull the starter rope a couple of times to drain some of the water.  (6)  Attach the winterizer canister to the pump where you would attach the water hose.  (7) Fill until some winterizer comes out of the high-pressure water port (where you attach the wand hose).  Turn over the engine again to distribute the winterizer.  The whole procedure takes a couple of minutes after the first time.Some manuals recommend using the winterizer anytime you are not going to use the pump for over 30 days.  The benefit is lubrication.  If you cannot find one of these winterizers, you can use RV antifreeze.  To do this, you need a 3-foot segment of garden hose.  The idea is that you attach the hose to the pump; hold the hose up; and pour the antifreeze into the hose.  Next, while holding the hose up (and with the spark plug disconnected) pull the starter rope slowly until antifreeze appears at the high pressure outlet.  Be sure to clean up any spilled antifreeze.  Pets tend to be attracted to it, and it causes kidney failure.I always use fuel stabilizer in all my small engines.  If I'm going to store one over a winter, I'll use double stabilizer.  For storage, I'll also use ethanol-free gas.I know all this service business can sound overwhelming.  Essentially all gas-powered pressure washers require these things if you want them to last.  You may be wondering if PWs are more trouble than they are worth.  Once you've accumulated the things you need, and you've done it once, it will no longer seem like a big deal.  If you are not going to do the servicing yourself, maybe you should call a shop and ask their price before you invest in a PW.  Other maintenance includes the air filter, sediment cup, fuel filter, and tank.  The manual states the service intervals for all these things, but unless you're using your washer heavily, you're likely to find that the air cleaner, fuel filter, and tank are fine and don't need servicing even yearly.  Just be sure to check them at prescribed intervals.  Remember, these reviews are supposed to tell you the things that you don't normally know before you buy.  Now you know.  Don't shoot the messenger.You may want to consider a turbo nozzle.  I'll let you do your own research on those.  Remember you'll need one that will handle 4200 psi.  DeWalt makes the one that I use.At some time you may want to consider a NorthStar Pressure Washer Surface Cleaner - 20in.  It is a perfect match to the DPW4240.  I've had my surface cleaner about 5 years.  It was good with my smaller washer, but it's fantastic with the DPW4240.I have one final recommendation.  There is a product out there called Mean Green, which beats any other cleaning chemical I've tried.  There is really no comparison.  The problem with ordering through Amazon is that it is heavy and shipping costs are prohibitive.  The best sources are the Dollar General stores, who often have promotion prices.  Don't dilute it.  Put you chemical tube right in the Mean Green jug.  The DPW4240 dilutes it to 1 part in 10, which is dilute enough.  Spray it on, leave it for several minutes and then rinse.Good luck and all the best,Tim","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144YET0N0JJI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q49U5C#wasThisHelpful","R144YET0N0JJI4","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to repeat the litany of features on this camera.  You know it has a Leica certified (if not Leica-built) lens.  You probably know that Leica and Zeiss make the best optics in the world.  You know it offers manual control when you need it.  I'm going to tell you my personal experience with it.I bought my zs6 immediately before going on vacation last summer (2011).  I picked the zs6 based on a careful review of the current crop of market offerings for point-and-shoots.  I also took along a full-frame DSLR and an APS-C DSLR, both current models. Both DSLRs were equipped with Zeiss zooms and other high-end zooms and primes.  I'm a very serious amateur photographer.  Since I mostly use my DSLRs around home, that trip was when I really used the zs6.  A minute ago, I was going back over the  1000-or-so pictures that I took on that trip.  I was blowing the images up to greater than 19x13 and comparing.  What I saw was this:  the little zs6 did an outstanding job.  I had lots of images worth printing on my 13x19 printer.  The resolution was sharp, and the colors were rich and vibrant.  I do a lot of tinkering in Photoshop CS5; I even use plug-ins for noise reduction, so I'm obviously picky.  The shots with the zs6 were more than good enough to print as-is.  I could easily pass them off as coming from a DSLR.  No I'm not going to say that I'm going to sell my other cameras, but I will say this:  If you're a serious photographer and you want no-apologies performance from a PnS that you can carry in your pocket, look no further.Update:  A year later, I'm still getting stellar performance.  I just carried the camera all over the Eastern Mediterranean along with a DSLR.  Once again, the little Panasonic came through.  Sharp images, excellent color, effective image stabilization, and never a problem.  This is a huge accomplishment, given the camera's size and wide zoom range.  I really appreciate the build quality too -- like a Swiss watch.  Lately, I've been tempted to buy either a Sony RX100 or a Lumix DMC-LX7 (the Sony will have better pixel resolution, but the Lumix will have MUCH better low-light capability due to lens as well as sensor differences).  Even though I'm generally a Sony person (I gave up on Nikon a long time ago), this little ZS6 may persuade me to stay with Panasonic in the point-and-shoot domain.  There is a healthy trend in point-and-shoots, which I attribute to the ever-improving cell phone cameras making low-end PnS offerings obsolete.Tim Naff","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R995EHDLG1F4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NYRMGA#wasThisHelpful","R995EHDLG1F4E","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this lens as a factory refurb at a Sony store.  Before buying, I tested it extensively against my Sony 16-105.  I made a series of identical shots, on a tripod, in camera RAW on an A580, going back and forth between the two lenses with the camera on full manual.  I took the camera body back to my rented condo (in Destin FL), and compared on my computer, working strictly in RAW (avoiding any sharpening by the camera or by my software and avoiding jpeg artifacts).  I zoomed in to identical magnification at identical original focal lengths at identical f-numbers.I honestly didn't want it to be better than my beloved 16-105, just because I didn't want to spend the money, and I'd rather have the wider zoom range on hand when needed.  The bad news for me was that it out-performed the 16-105 in sharpness and in color.  The improvement wasn't stunning, but it was there when you looked for it.  Did I have to look hard to see it?  Actually, I did have to look very closely to see it, but it was always there.  Please understand that I know and understand what constitutes good optical performance.  I have the Zeiss 24-70, the G70-300, and the 50 F4, as well as the legendary Minolta 17-35.  (In my film days I shot Hassleblad and Nikon as well as testing Leica-M.)One reviewer said the vignetting was a problem.  I can see slight darkening in the corners on my A580, but I wouldn't notice if I weren't looking for it.  The same reviewer said he could see a slim B+W 62mm filter.  I have a slim B+W XS-PRO nano 62mm, and I see no evidence of the filter if I screw the filter in all the way without tightening.One reviewer on Amazon said the build quality was poor, and I've read that complaint from others on the web.  I'd rate the build quality as no better than the 16-105, but not nearly as good as the 24-70, which is in a class by itself anyway.  This lens is far, far, far better than the A580 kit lens in build quality, which is the worst I've ever encountered, although the kit lens optics are quite respectable.  Zeiss put the money in the optics on this lens.  Did Zeiss actually manufacture the lens, or did Sony (or some third party) build it to Zeiss specs?  I have no idea.  You can bet Zeiss wouldn't let it go out with their logo if it weren't to their specs.I bought the lens after doing the test, and I'll tell you why.  I was thinking that I'd get an A77 when they came out.  The A77's high-pixel-density sensor makes demands on optics.  I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to be better prepared for the A77 while I could get the lens at a bargain price.Is it worth the money that you'd have to pay?  Compared to the 16-105, I'd have to say it's a wash.  You give up some zoom range, and in return you get a bit better optical performance and a bit more aperture at 80mm.  Some have said, ""What is Zeiss coming to?""  I say that Zeiss is giving you exactly what you pay for.  This is a very low price for a Zeiss lens.Is this the right lens for you?  Should you opt for the 16-105 or maybe the Sony 18-250?  The prices are all about the same.  I have all three lenses.  They have similar vignetting characteristics.  The 18-250 has more barrel distortion owing to its extreme zoom range, but that's correctable with software.  The Sony 18-250, while not having the sharpness or chromatic excellence of this lens, sets a new standard super-zoom optical quality.  If I were only going to have one lens for anything other than the A77 or A67, I'd probably want the 16-105 as a good compromise between optical quality and versatility.  If I were going for the A66/77, I'd get the Zeiss, both for the sharpness and for the slightly wider aperture.  (The A66/77 translucent mirror costs about a half-stop worth of light, but DxO says the sensor surprisingly seems to lose nothing significant in low-light performance.)I don't think you'll go wrong with this lens or one of the Sony alternatives.  I didn't give five stars, because of the build quality, but the build quality is more than good enough.  Good luck with your decision!Tim Naff","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PAZOR397WU5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JE5CKA#wasThisHelpful","R1PAZOR397WU5E","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The build quality of this device looks great.  The wood knobs are attractive.  It almost looks too good for an office cube wall.  The design is good in all respects but one.  You get two brackets, each of which allows adjustment, so that the adjustment ranges of the two brackets overlap.  All good so far.  The problem with my sample is that the adjustment slips if you put anything with any weight on it.  There is a plastic, strain-loaded mechanism on top that is supposed to hold the adjustment in place.  On mine, it is far too weak.  I couldn't hang a couple of lightweight umbreallas and a light-weight jacket on it without it sliding apart and falling on the floor.  No way it would hold the weight of a winter coat.  The only way I could secure it was to wrap a wire around it to hold down the little black button that you're supposed to lift up when you adjust it.  It no longer looks cool, and it's a lot to pay for a very defective product.  Maybe my sample is just a bad one.  You now know everything I know.  Good luck!**Update**  I just upgraded this review from one star to two.  As I said before, the problem was with the adjustment mechanism.  What I finally did was adjust it to the width of my cube and glue it permanently for that width.  Problem solved.  If you are only going to use it at one width, there is a solution to the loose mechanism.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJUYISJM3554/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C2LC2E#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJUYISJM3554","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Parallels lets you run Windows apps right alongside your Mac apps.  You can swap data back and forth, hassle-free.  I found the program to be stable and reliable running OS X Lion as the Primary OS with Win7 inside as the Guest OS on a virtual machine (VM). I have not found significant problems with slow performance, but read on.There are several ways to set things up.  You can choose your Guest OS from a selection including Windows and Linux.  You can run your Guest OS out of a VM based in a Boot Camp partition, or simply out of a pure VM.  Once set up, you can run your VM in several modes.  These include full-screen (covering your Primary Mac OS X desktop and making it temporirily inaccessible), in a window on your Mac OS desktop, or fully integrated in Coherence mode with your Guest OS apps running in their own frames, just as they would on a normal Windows machine or Mac.  In the latter case, your Windows apps have the look, feel, and accessibility of Mac apps (without the task bar, of course).  These modes are changeable on the fly, without any rebooting of anything.Regardless of how you choose to run your configuration, you should be aware of some things that can cost money.  First, you must have the Guest installation software.  For example,if you want to run Win7 as your Guest OS as I did, you'll have to buy Win7.  For x64, the cheapest option is the Home Premium downloadable version.  There is a comparable x32 version.  The package says it's supposed to be shipped with a new machine, but I had no problem installing.  If you install it in a Boot Camp partition, you'll have to register it twice. You may have to register by phone the second time, but don't worry, phone registration will work, even if you have to register twice.  Just tell Microsoft its only on one computer.  You may want to buy a virus and spyware scanner for your Windows OS, since Windows is always more vulnerable than a Mac.  Finally, and this is subtle but important, you'll need to take a hard look at your hardware resources.  When you set up Parallels, you will be prompted to specify how much system RAM the Guest OS will be allowed to use.  Only you know how much you can allocate.  If you have 4 GB of RAM on your machine, you might want to specify 1.5 or so.  I have 12 GB (RAM is cheap), and I specified 4 GB.  Also, there is the question of hard-drive space if you use a Boot Camp partition.  You should be able to figure that one out for yourself; just don't forget to think it through carefully before you start, because changing is a bit of a hassle (which has nothing to do with Parallels).  There is no free lunch here, if you want to make one computer into two, you may have to beef it up.  If you create a situation where either your Primary or your Guest is starved for resources, performance will obviously suffer.  I bought my extra RAM from crucial.com, and I wasn't disappointed.  You may also want to check out Kingston.Here's what happens with your RAM usage.  Say you allocate 4 GB of RAM for your Guest OS.  When you boot the OS, enough RAM will be ""wired"" to the Guest to allow the Guest to join the party, but it will probably start by using less than 1 GB.  Then, if you progressively open more and more memory-users in the Guest OS, you will progressively ""wire"" more and more RAM for the Guest, making it unavailable to the Primary OS.  The Guest will not ""wire"" more than you originally allocated.  If you close the memory-users, the RAM is not ""unwired""; it remains dedicated to the Guest OS, even though the Guest may not use it again.  Everything starts over when you reboot.  It is easy to watch all this unfold using the Activity Monitor app in OS X Utilities.When nothing is going on on the VM, there is no tax on the processor cores.  Win7 probably doesn't run quite as fast in Parallels as in a dedicated Boot Camp partition, but I haven't made measurements to prove it.  When a Win program like Acrobat reads files from a Mac-formatted drive, it probably reads them a bit more slowly than from a native Windows format due to the translation layer.  I am running an i5 processor.  I run some memory-hog, CPU-intensive applications such as video rendering packages, so I pay attention to these things.  If I'm doing something really intense in Win7, I may run dedicated out of the Boot Camp partition, bypassing Parallels altogether.  In the near future, I may also increase my RAM to 16 GB, even though the last 4 GB-worth of upgrade will cost as much as the first 8.  Unless you're doing something similarly intense, you can probably just stay with 4 GB total.My personal configuration illustrates the adaptability of Parallels. My i5 iMac has a 250 GB solid-state drive (SSD) as the boot drive plus a 1 TB hard-disk drive (HDD).  I put Win7 in a 200GB Boot Camp partition on the HDD to conserve the limited SDD space and simultandously give Win7 room to breathe.  Parallels, itself, must go on the boot drive, so it is on the SDD, but configured this way, it doesn't suck up space from the space-limited, but lightning quick, SDD.  With this arrangement, I can always choose to run in Win7 dedicated mode using Boot Camp with OS X turned off and Parallels bypassed completely.  Both OSs have access to a Mac-formatted 3 TB Firewire-800 external drive.  (Too bad there are no Thunderbolt peripherals yet.)  I can create a Word document in the Mac version of Word, place it on the external drive, and open it in Word for Windows from the same, Mac-formatted drive.  All of this just works.  It's a testament to the flexibility that Parllels makes possible.  Parallels will afford you the same flexibility.One suggestion to the people at Parallels is that they come up with a cleaner way to switch modes.  It's imminently doable, but there's no switch or dial located in one place.  Also, what gives with the check box at shut-down that says reopen Windows when you log back in?  It doesn't reopen Windows when I log back in after a shut-down.I don't care what the books say or what the ads say; file sharing and printer sharing between Macs and PCs is hit or miss when working over a network through anything less than a dedicated server.  (I actually got an Apple Care ""Genius"" to admit that.)  It is particularly true when a PC tries to directly access something belonging to a Mac.  Macs, with their layers of extra security, don't share anything well, unless it's with another Mac.  The parallels solution comes as close as you can get today to resolving those issues, and, compared to the alternatives, the solution has been elegant for me.In summary, let's face it:  it's tough to make the Win and Mac OSs play nicely together.  Parallels has them playing in the same sandbox.  They aren't fighting over toys or throwing sand.  They're holding hands and smiling.  This is one of those rare instances of sophisticated third-party software that really works without problems.  As one who has to deal with the vagaries (vulgarities?) of software development on a daily basis, I'm impressed.Tim Naff","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322NFDRCMSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H8PJ6K#wasThisHelpful","R322NFDRCMSU","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review was originally about Mac issues, but see the update at the end if you're a PC person.  I **Update:  I finally reached a knowledgeable person at HP, who informed me that they don't have a WiFi driver for Lion yet (29 Aug 2011).**When installing this printer on a Mac, everything is not automatic as it is on a PC, which requires no CD.  The Mac instructions say to use the CD or download the latest installation file.  My installation attempted to use the current (Aug 27, 2011) installation package downloaded from HP.  It was for OS X, and not specifically for Lion.  Online installation instructions differ from the quick-start guide (for Mac) that came with the printer. The quick-start guide states that, when installing from the CD, you will be prompted as to whether you want to use WiFi.  (Installation also requires that you temporarily connect to the computer with USB.)  Running the downloaded package, there is no prompt.  The printer automatically installs as a USB device and shows up as an active printer. If you want to use a USB cable there is no issue.One reason for choosing the printer was that it had WiFi.  I found a procedure on the HP site for installing on the Mac.  The procedure failed.  I called HP and they gave me the Apple Care number!  **As I said above, I called again and reached a more knowledgeable person, who said there is no Lion WiFi driver yet.  He said to go to HP.com and sign up for e-mail notification of driver updates.  Based on the competance of the guy I spoke to, I'm raising my rating from two to three stars.The printer works fine in USB mode.  WiFi is the problem.I have used cheap HP B&W laser printers before.  They tend to be quick and reliable, and they are relatively reasonable on toner cost.  My complaint is HPs unwillingness to keep the installation software and drivers current.  I have a 4-year-old model that has been rock solid.  HP does not even have a Lion driver for it, and they have no intention of ever providing one.  Bottom line:  if you're a Mac user who likes to keep up with the latest OS, your HP printer may have a limited lifetime due to HP policy.  I'm sure that HP will eventually provide what is necessary for Lion WiFi installation.  But the next printer model change may spell the end of Mac support for the discontinued model.  This is not, BTW, the case for PC drivers, which are kept current much longer.  Don't expect a ""no customer left behind"" policy from HP.**Update**  I now have two of these and have them installed on Win7, Vista, and XP machines as well as Mac Lion (still via USB).  The printers are all working well.  I have lately run into problems with HP not keeping drivers current for Win7.  They have a work-around:  Run driver software in Vista SP2 compatibility mode.  When you do that, you get in trouble connecting via LAN to printers shared from other computers, even when doing PC to PC.  The  bottom line is this:  HP makes the most reliable, long-lasting printer hardware around, but it doesn't matter because they don't keep the software current.  You may be out of luck when the next OS rolls around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26QUQXL3H8M2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036TGGVO#wasThisHelpful","R26QUQXL3H8M2U","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've never used a computer before, this book should be perfect for you.  If you've never used a Mac before, it will be very good.  If you've used early Mac operating systems, but not OS X, it will still be quite good.  If you already know earlier versions of OS X very well, you won't find a lot here to help you.  There is no section that summarizes changes from earlier versions.  There is no consistent identification of OS or app features that are new with Lion.  This book is generally about OS X, and it is not an in-depth treatment.  If you want in-depth, get the Portable Genius book (which was not out for Lion when I did this review).  Most of the book's space is devoted to the apps included with the OS.  There are some exceptions, such as the page on Mission Control, which is new to Lion.  There is also a very nice treatment of file sharing and printer sharing. On the other hand, there's a whole page on how to save a document!So why in the world did I give it four stars?  Even though I've been working with computers, including software development, since the days when a single computer filled a small room, I'm relatively new to Macs.  And this book does do a creditable job of an overview of the OS and the apps.  Yes, it's very ""Dick and Jane.""  You have to try not to be offended when it tells you things that any near-computer-illiterate would know.  You have to scan each page looking for nuggets.  The nuggets are there ... they really are.  They are easy to find, because a huge amount of effort has gone into creating a good visual presentation. If you are not familiar with an app, you can go through the appropriate section of the book in just a few seconds and save yourself some trial and error.In summary, the book is well organized and designed to make information easy to find and to absorb.  If you're computer literate enough to be reading this review, I can't imagine how you could find anything in the book that would be too difficult for you.  It is a simple book, but that is partly because the author does a good job of simplifying.  The book falls right in line with Apple's own philosophy of simplicity.  Even so, this is not necessarily a book for the simple.All the best,Tim","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HKBU60EHZP4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118022416#wasThisHelpful","R2HKBU60EHZP4A","A3CP1WGNTOSKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CP1WGNTOSKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jay Winik has written a very good, intense,  readable  and  poignant book about the year 1944. The main part of it focuses on the Holocaust and the failure of FDR and his administration to respond to this horrible vrome perpetrated by the Nazi hordes. Did Roosevelt know about the Holocaust? Yes, he did. Did he do anything about it? Very little. Another question related to this aspect is about the failure of the Allies to bomb Auschwitz and the other extermination-cum-concetration camps. The reasons for this controversial decision not to bomb them  vary. And this is the accusation Mr Winik pins on the shoulder of Roosevelt.One also must remember that the State Department was riddled with Antisemites and Breckenridge Long, Mentioned in the book,  was just one of them. Perhaps the problem lay with Roosevelt's character and policies of a juggler, as he preferred to call himself. The establishment of the WRBdid very little to alleviate the plight of those unfortunate victims who were trying to find shelter.Of course the book tells about many other events which were extremely fateful for the 1939-1945 period. Operation Overlord, the Battle of the Bulge and the liberation of Paris  are among those discussed here. In addtion, there is a very detailed descrition about FDR's health issues- issues which in many ways explain why he acted the way he did in his decision-making process.This book reads like a suspense first rate thriller, and, although there is nothing original in it, I awarded it five stars for the style and its masterful storytelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVSS05XSQ9KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439114080#wasThisHelpful","R2XVSS05XSQ9KL","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If  I have to nominate one book as the book of the year 2015, this is going to be my choice. It is different from the other  thousands of books that have been written so far about WW2, because it examines in great depth how the German people reacted to the war in its various stages. The war was far from being popular in Germany when it broke out.On the other hand , there were millions who readily embraced Hitler and his policies. There are many questions which are raised in this book, like: why did the German people continue to fight after 1943 , when almost all the Nazi leadership thought the war was lost?  How did the  beliefs, hopes and dreams of the German manifest themselves throughout the war?This the author does by incorporating many untapped so far sources , most of them belonging to people who wrote diaries, commentaries, letters, notes, tec. They were soldiers, teachers, housewives, cabinet-makers, bank clerks, Jews, Protestants and many more.What stands out in this brilliant masterpiece is also the way the churches reacted to the Nazi regime and the various points of view which  were represented by the many clerics. It is a compelling and superb book which will show you some points that you never thought of about WW2.This book is a must for everyone !!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PR0MPT3R3CVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465018998#wasThisHelpful","R2PR0MPT3R3CVJ","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a comprehensive one-volume history of FDR . Alonzo Hamby has succeeded in telling his readers- in twenty-six chapters- about the strong and weak points of FDR. This he has managed to do after a serious effort invested in researching this book, showing especailly FDR's monumental achievements in his foreign policy by demonstrating how he accomplished them.  Roosevelt, according to Professor Hamby, has generated intense emotions.""Millions of Americans worshipped him; millions of others could quite literally not bear to speak his name"". However, as an American aristocrat born into priviledge, he learned the habit of command from his father and he had also inherited a sense of destiny to lead and strive for greta goals, first as a socially conscious  reformer, then as a world statesman. He displayed courage and determination, whether in coping with the handicap of polio, facing the challenges of the Depression, or dealing with the terrible urgencies of global war. Hamby shows in the final part of this volume how FDR managed to cope qith all the hardships he faced during the last months of WW2 and why he ought to be considered perhaps the greatest American President in our modern times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7ARQZO3Z279/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465028608#wasThisHelpful","RZ7ARQZO3Z279","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main idea in this new book is that  Russian counterintelligence proved so successful that in many ways and times it surprised theiir American counterpart, the CIA. This was especially relevant in the 1960s -1970s. The weak side of Russian intelligence has been throughout the years the technological one. Human intelligence had to make up for this and for communications intelligence.The eleven chapters which are to be found here are arranged chronoligically, starting with the Cheka and ending with the demise of the Soviet Union. One of the best chapters discusses the extent to which Stalin's terroe crippled the abilities of Russian intelligence . The result was in the total failure to graps the Nazi threat. One terrible result of it was the loss of 27 million Russians.Then the history moves into the Cold War era, when Western intelligence crippled Soviet secret communications, but not for long, since  the Cambridge Five made up for this. It was Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin which shifted the emphasis towards counterlintelligence, while military intelligence and cryptography hastened to catch up and reduce the growing Anglos-American advantage in orbital satellites  and high-technology interception of ground communications. Image intelligence was of much importance because Khrushchev's vaunted superioirity in strategic missiles was a bluff.There are many examples in the following chapters showing  the modus operandi of the many known and also unknown agents that we sent to the West.  Yuri Drozdov was one of them. He ran many illegals from the S Directorate  and was also successful in penetrating the West German intelligence .Another agent was Yuri Totrov, who served in many countries . He was extremely successful in running counterintelligence operations. The result was that in 1980, his directorate unmasked 168 CIA  officers and 77 agents in the Soviet Union. At Langley, the joke was that Totrov was ""the shadow head of personnel at CIA"".This book is another good and important addition to the history of intelligence and the role it played in the history of the twentieth century, particularly during the Cold War, where many pieces of the puzzle concerning the shadow wars still remain behind closed archives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LK9VZL5ZLWPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374219907#wasThisHelpful","R1LK9VZL5ZLWPS","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This superbly researched book, based  on new documents and 100 interviews, is about one of the Cambridge Five spies who were in the service of Stalin. Though I cannot agree with the conclusion of the author, I do nevertheless recommend  this book from the bottom of my heart because it is, so far, the best on Guy Burgess. Mr Lownie has invested more than 20 years researching it and the result is astonishing. He shows to what extent the English society was totally degenerate during the 1930-1950 period. The graphic descriptions of Burgess'  male conquests , combined with his bedroom activities, will make you- as it made me- sick, yet this was the reality under which Burgess was operating then. The whole English establishment was extremely naive regarding Russia and the result was that people like Burgess could spy almost everywhere and on everyone. Nobody had suspected that he and his fellows from Cmbridge could actually have been in the service of Comrade Stalin.Burgess was the most important, complex and fascinating of ""The Cambridge Spies"" all brilliant men recruited in the 1930s to betray their country to Russia. The mystery still remains: why did he agree to work for a foreign power, of which he knew very little, as a student, and continue to serve it untill his death some thirty years later? Why did he leave behind those whom he loved, including his mother, to whom he was devoted, for a lonely exile in Russia? Mr Lownie brings out the many and conflicting characteristics of this man who was full of paradoxes. Add the fact that Burgess was a figure that  could not have been more British with his Eton and Cambridge education, hiis many memberships of London clubs, expensive clothes, love of British literature, and his final wish to be buried in Britain.Another excellent part of this book is about Burgess in Moscow, where he spent the rest of his 62 years after running away from England. This is a very big contribution to the role spies had before and  during the Cold War and should be read by buffs and academics alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OSS2PHMF8J2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013V4BJB0#wasThisHelpful","R2OSS2PHMF8J2A","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An endless number of books have been written about Henry Kissinger's foreign policy. Greg Grandin's excellent book proves again and again to what extent Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal for committing the most odious crimes during the period when he served both as the national anvisor and the State Secretary of the Nixon administration.After offering the reader a general overview of Kissinger's theories about history and statecraft, the book centers on Kissinger's crimes. The most notorious one was the decision to bomb Cambodia-an act which can count as one of the most brutal military operations ever conducted in US history. According to one study, the USA dropped 790000 cluster bombs on Vietnam and Cmabodia and between 1969-1973 around 500000 tons of bombs fell on Cambodia alone. Add this to another country, Laos, which was more stunningly hit by US bombers. Laos turned out to be the most heavily bombed country in history-courtesy of Nixon andHenry Kissinger. Defoliation and the use of Agent Orange caused more significant damage. This is not the end of the story. As many as 30 % of the bombs dropped by the USA did not detonate and today, some 80 million unexploded  cluster bombs are hidden ""below a thin layer of soild and packed with ball bearings"".The justification for these crimes was that the bombings were meant  to destroy the sanctuaries which gave shelter to the supporters of North Vietnam-an argument which has no real foundation.Then, Grandin book gives a second catalogue of crimes committed and sanctioned by Kissinger. On the menu there were the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.To quote again from the book, ""what is certain is that individually each of Kissinger's Middle East initiatives-banking on despots, inflating the shah, providing massive amounts of aid to security forces that tortured and terrorized citizens, pumping up the US defense industry with petrodollars, which in turn spurred a Middle East arms race financed by high oil prices, emboldening Pakistan's intelligence service, nurturing Islamist fundamentalism, playing Iran and the Kurds off Iraq"" and many more things hust show to what extent Kissinger has been responsible  to create a Middle East into ""a knot that even Alexander's sword can't cut"".Intrigue,secrecy and lies were the daily basis upon which Kissinger forged his foreign policy, supporting the most corrupt dictatorships in South America.One of the results of this perverted policy was the birth of the Khmer Rouge which was a result of the inferno that the American policy did much to create. Kissinger mocked the principle of sovereignty. According to Kissinger, Barack Obama's drone strikes are a carbon copy of his policies.This book should be in everyone's library and should be carefully read and reread. It  serves as a reminder of the fact that lunatics  and war criminals have not disappearded from history and are still with us. Kissinger is one of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YB52GREJC6EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627794492#wasThisHelpful","R2YB52GREJC6EI","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The USA and Britain led the revolution in this field, but there were other secret services, such as the STASI which were suspicious of the new device and the result was in a 100-kilometer archive in Est Germany, which had details on most East Germans.According to Markus Wollf, computers could be hacked easily.The book has some interesting episodes in the history of cyber-espionage and many technical details about the way computers play the Great Game.

"In this exceptional short but very important book, Stefan Ihrig has highlighted a neglegted aspect, namely the influence Ataturk had on the Nazis and Hitler. In six brilliantly and deeply researched chapters, the author shows to what extent the German far right of Weimar and Hitler have been attracted by the deeds and policies of Kemal Ataturk. Turkey was, in addition to Italy, a model which was to be emulated  in various fields such as authoritarian rule, secular modernization, and the political utility of genocide. In Hitler's eyes, the right way for Germany to rise from its ashes after WW1 was a la Turca. It was Ataturk who defied the Western powers to seize control of the government, and he modeled the Munich putsch on Ataturk's rebellion in Ankara. For the Nazis, such as Goebbels and others, Ataturk was the ""star in the darkness"". Nazi Germany had a lot to learn from the way the Turks had dealt with the various minorities, especially from the way they tried to solve the Armenian problem, which would be the basic platform upon which Hitler and his other bunch of criminals would implement the Final Solution of the Jews.Thsi is a very gripping book and will not be surpassed for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33W0X17035OH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674368371#wasThisHelpful","R33W0X17035OH5","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In what seems to be one of the best-ever written biographies of President Nixon, Evan Thomas wanted to understand who the real Nixon was. In addition, as Mr Thomas writes, the question he kept asking was ""whether Nixon could see the true Nixon"".  Nixon's strenghts were his weaknesses, and vice versa. The drive that propelled him also crippled him. The underdog's sensitivity that made him farsighted also blinded him. He wanted to show that he was hard because he felt soft. He learned how to be popular because he felt rejected. He was the lonely everyman to the end.In this fascinating and gripping biography, the author peels away all the layers of this complex man who eventually would become the 37th President of the USA, showing the so many contradictions of his personality. To his merit one should mention the detente with the USSR, the establishment of diplomatic relations with China and the ending ot the Vietnam War. Watergate was Nixon's own graveyard as a result of his hubris.This is a very insightful history and biography of a man who always showed optimism, written in a very dynamic style.

"According to Dr Munro price, the fall of Napoleon started during the brief but intense years of 1813-1814 .As he notes right at the very beginning of the book, Waterloo overshadowed these previous years, however, 1814 was the year when Napoleon was deprived of hs throne and his legitimacy. Napoleon's fate was decided in a number of battles and the most famous ones were at Bautzen,Dresden, Leipzig and Laon .Why the French Emperor refused to compromise and accept his opponent's peace terms is the key is sues discussed in the book. Was it arrogance? Was it obstinacy? Was it his hubris?In trying to answer these questions, the author used many untapped sources, like the papers of Caulaincourt, Napoleon's foreign minister and many new unpublished letters of Matternich.Other sources are stil awaiting to be discovered, most of whom are in private hands.The book comes in fourteen chapters and each one shows a different chronoligical aspect of those afore-mentioned years.The best chapter is, in my view, the one describing The Battle of Nations which drove Napoleon's armies back to the Rhine. The next year,1814, forced Napoleon to abdicate and to be exiled to Elba, although after some time-for one hundred days-he regained his throne , but this was a doomed adventure which sealed his fate.There are many detailed maps here showing the many and various military moves during the battles, thus enabling the reader to better grasp the events mentioned before. There are also abundant photos and plates and a long bibliographical list.Although Dr Price mentions that public opinion and the voices of the masses were one of his main aims  to be told about in his book, this does not unfortunately happen. What we get mostly is a history of vox populi through the great statesmen of those years, Metternich and Talleyrand.This is an important book which attempts to also understand the complex personality of Napoleon and also tries to analyze his motives, character and the reasons for his failure. Napoleon finished his life in utter isolation and tedium and he became prone to depression compounded by many health issues. On 2 May 1821 he slipped into semi-consciousnees and died two days later. He was 51.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R117V9680AJN77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199934673#wasThisHelpful","R117V9680AJN77","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paul Ham's new book is a gem among the so many books published on WW1. This war killed, wounded and maimed 37 million people and it plunged the world into the bloodiest conflict mankind has witnessed so far.The book has four sections. The first one  is called ""The Tyranny of the Past' and deals with the historical events which dominated European politics up to the beginning of the 20th century.The second part, called ""Wilful Blindness and Blinkered Vision"" touches Schlieffen's plan and the problem of the minorities in the Balkans.In my view, the last two parts named consecutiverly ""In the Salons of Power"" and ""On the Ground -1914"" are the best ones. Here, Mr Ham is giving the reader a panoramic view of the things and affairs which happened on the eve of the war. Contrary to what Professor Clark has written, the leaders of their respective countries ""were not sleepwalkers into war"", but they chose war deliberately. This was the year when the world ended for millions of men, women and children. As Mr Ham writes, ""It was the end of certainty. It was the end of many soldiers's faith in the propaganda of the holy triumvirate of God, King and Country, of lyrical paeans to heroism and self-sacrifice, and all the shibboleths of tired old regimes...which they  and their families would soon tear down as monstrous lies. Many families were with Kipling, who wrote, on the death of his son in 1916: 'If any question why we died/Tell them because our fathers lied"".This was the year when ancient regimes and monarchies that had ruled Europe started their  slide into oblivion.The war Europe's autocracies waged to preserve their regimes in the end destroyed them all. Revolution and reform swepf Germany, Russia and Austro-Hungary.As to the question of responsibility, Mr Ham makes no bones about the culpability of Germany which pushed Autro-Hungary to begin this horrible conflict. The famous assassination  committed by Gavrilo Princip was the excuse and Ferdinand's death just triggered the July crisis that hastened the outbreak of the war. It accelerated forces that were already in motion, which would have culminated in war in any case-unless the men in power behaved differently, i.e. sought to mediate and understand one another, and tried the diplomatic arts of peace-keeping. The leaders were wide awake, sentient decision-makers who knew exactly waht was happening and were aware of the repercussions of their actions. Some went willingly to war and some (France, Britain) accepted it with complacent resignation.This although the fact that European leaders later claimed that war was inevitable, ordained by God or Darwin or other forces. Every major European nation had a share of responsibility for the war. Thus, the Great War was an  avoidable, unnecessary exercise in collective stupidity and callousness, launched by profoundly flawed and unintelligent men, most of whom were neither fit nor trained but bred into rule, and who saw the world as a Darwinian jungle in which Teuton, Slav and their Latin and Anglo-Saxon allies were predestined to bash each other's brains out until the fittest won.What make this book outstanding is the fact that it is highly readable, bringing out the voices of the common people, and this to a great extent. It also shows the many angles and voices  of almost every significant event during 1914, and it includes many new sources as well as older ones, creating a new synthesis about the conflict. It also includes nine very detailed maps to make it easier to the reader to follow events on the various 1914 fronts and also has a detailed bibliographical list.

After reading it, I am more than convinced about the fact that after death there is nothing.The author seems to have made use of the fact that he is a respected neurosurgeon, although he himself has a black sheet on his personal file .Those reviewers who previously wrote about this point were right and there is no use reiterating their words.But the issue is not Eben's credentials but his credibility, which can be dismissed in a few seconds.A certain chemical is released into the body during the condition which was Eben's disease and it is the explanation for his hallucinatory dreams. The sad fact is that we who are mortals are still looking for some consolation afetr the death of our beloved ones, and this is not new. Humans have sought to delude themselves since the very beginning of history in this respect and Eben is not different.  He has just written another book under the cloak of being a scientist .It would suffice to read the antidote on this written by Professor Richard Dawkins in order to understand to what extent a neurosurgeon is trying to fool innocent readers into making them believe in nonsense.

"Jan Swafford's biography is a masterpiece/ He writes in a panoramic style about everything which concerned Beethoven, one of the greatest titans of music. The physical and mental suffering caused by his deafness-probably as a result of some lead poisoning-would mount a sustained assault on Beethoven's sense of discipline and duty, his gigantic ambition. Nevertheless, Beethoven was destined both for triumph and anguish. This genius would undergo many hard times in his life, yet his solitude  and art would be his best remedies, according to Professor Swafford.This extremely long biography inludes many details and is packed with some original insights  on almost every page. The first three quarters are much more dynamically written and my only reservation about this monumental  oeuvre is that sometimes the author dwells a bit too much on Beethoven's relations with his brothers. As one writer penned, Beethoven ""wanted to appear as a new man in each work, even at the risk of making an occasional blunder, or of sometimes being scarcely understood by even a few people. He did not understand people and for approximately the last fifteen years not even their words, and as he did not understand them, neither did they understand him, except in his musical notes"".Indeed, Beethoven  had suffered over his years from deafness the most horrible affliction for any musician), colitis,  rheumatism, typhus, skin disorders, abcesses, a variety of infections, inflammatory degeneration of the arteries, jaundice and at the end chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.He was, in the eyes of Grillparzer,""the greatest of all"".This compulsory book shows  Beethoven's genius and his many flawed sides. It is a most comprehensive biography , written in a lively style, and will be unsurpassed for many years. Bravissimo, Mr. Swafford!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JU4IERB8QPV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061805474X#wasThisHelpful","R3JU4IERB8QPV7","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Nazi  ideology of  ""Geomedizin""-that illness was as irrefutable and inevitable result of culture- had a significance for the Jews and other peoples in Eastern Europe. The louse, carrier of typhus, was a symbol of the Jew :a filthy, parasitic, blood-sucking disease element which had penetrated the German nation long ago. If so, according to Julius Streicher, the infamous editor of 'Der Sturmer', the Jew as a bacillus and a plague is not a human being but rather an enemy, a criminal and a disease carrier, thus he must be eliminated.In addtion, Hitler and his bunch of criminals were afraid that typhus might be a serious hindrance which could stay in the way of achieving their dream of mastering Europe. Because the disease plagued the Nazi troops in Eastern Europe, the Nazis were desperately looking for a solution.For this they turned toRudolf Weigl, the Polish scientist who had a world reputation thanks to the fact that it was he who succeeded in creating a vaccine which was effective against the disease.In February 1940, no less a figure than Nikita Khrushchev visited Weigl at his laboratory, offering him  a job at the Soviet Academy of Medicine in Moscow. Weigl declined.After the departure of the Russians from Lwow in 1941, the city where Weigl was working in, the city  became a ""Hobbeian theater, every man for himself under a ruthless occupant, the Nazis.Typhus was rampant there, and Weigl even considered leaving the city, but eventually decided to stay.It is estimated that at least 3000 people were working for his institute, which became a tool of deceiving the Nazis and a shelter for many victims of the Nazis. The tens of millions of lice used in the vaccine during the war descended from a cross between lice gathered from the clothing of Russians in Austrian POW camps during WW1, and an Ethiopian variety that Weigl had obtained in Addis Ababa. Wegl employed doomed scientists,writers, doctors and others and thus saved their lives. In addition, he and his workers shipped ton of a weakened serum to the Wehrmacht.Among those saved was another scientist,  the Jewish immunologist Ludwick Fleck, who was sent to Buchenwald. Fleck was forced to create  and re-create a typhus vaccine  under the direction of Erwin Ding, who was called ""a Dummkopf who earned a dissertation only on the basis of his services for the party"". Being so, Fleck and his colleagues produced two types of the vaccine: one that had no value and was perfectly harmless, and went to the front; and a second type, in very small quantities, that was efficatious and was used in special cases for the comrades who worked at Buchenwald.All this continued until March 1945.Weigl died in 1957 of a heart attack, while Fleck immigrated to Israel.The book is based on many new and untapped documents as well as many interviews with some relevant persons and is a good read,original and well written, although somehow  in a dry language. All in all, I recommend it. very much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEJPOSSC6881/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039308101X#wasThisHelpful","R3HEJPOSSC6881","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Operation ""Valuable Fiend"" was conceived at the end of the forties in the previous century. Its purpose was to overthrow the Communists from power in Albania. By doing so, it would signify the first open revolt behind the Iron Curtain and would encourage other anti-Communist elements in the Soviet bloc, would knock out Kremlin's sense of security and show the Soviets that the West could match in kind their tactics for supporting guerrillas and subversive activities in their area of influence. It would also save the situation in Greece by cutting off Albania as one of the remaining  two sources of support for the Communist guerrillas, the other source, Bulgaria, would be intimidated and cutting off the flow of men and supplies through their borders for fear of risking a similar fate.Mr. Lulushi has written a splendidly researched book on one of the less famous episodes of the  CIA's Cold War covert actions. He comes to remedy Nicholas Bethell's book ""Betrayed"" on the same subject, by examining previously untapped sources, dismissing almost totally Kim Philby's role in the whole affair.Who were the key players in this operation? Where did they come from and how did their background influence their choices and actions durind the operation? What happened to them afterward? What did the agency learn -or not learn- from this failure?These are only some points discussed widely in this book, which incorporates new material as well as interviews with sons and daughters of some key figures in this operation, which was the first one of its kind in the history of the CIA.Unfortunately for the West, the whole operation was one of total failure for many reasons, as stated in the book. The CIA and  MI6 did not accomplish the goals they set, because the Sigurimi, the Secret Albanian  Police,and the KGB turned the tables on them and used and killed or captured  agents for propaganda purposes for years to come.. The Albanians who took part in the affair suffered terrible losses. Dozens perished, and several more who were captured spent the rest of their lives in Communist prisons or hard labour camps. The regime uprooted their families and persecuted hem for decades, generation after generation.Operation Valuable Fiend never developed beyond the reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering stage.The result of this experiment showed it was extremely hard to achieve the goal of overthrowing a Communist regime. Rollling back the Iron Curtain was too hard. Other operations, such as those in Guatemala and Iran were far more successful, but had eventually turned out to be preludes to disasters, since Guatemala sank into a civil war, while the Shah of Iran was run out of power in 1979.The Albanian affair ended in 1954, when the CIA virtually abandoned all infiltration operations in Albania and dismissed the handful of Albanian agents still on its rolls in Greece.The book, which has eighteen chapters, each one devoted to another sub-topic, includes maps and many hitherto unpublished photos.

This view is extremely wrong and it distorts the real motives which were responsible for the unleashing of the war. Mr Jenkins ignores all the various aspects such as the diplomatic entanglements, the imperialistic factors, the clashes between the various ideologies and many more things and offers the reader a minimal view , supported by a limited number of clergymen and what they thought  about the war. True, there were religious manifestations and characteristics which took place during 1914-1918.

"During the Cold War, the CIA was engaged in relentless global warfare with the Kremlin. The agency  used a host of front organizations and phony foundations, spent many millions of dollars to fund concert tours, art exhibitions, magazines, academic research, student activities and book publishing. All theses were weapons in the covert action against the Soviet Union masterminded by George Kennan, who was the intellectual author behind this. One estimate says that some 10 million books and periodicals were distributed by the CIA in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  ""Doctor Zhivago""  was one of those books which was printed and distributed clandestinely in the main  Russian cities.This book, which is just one episode in the colossal ideological battle between the two superpowers, is excellent and is very original. The authors have put in a tremendous effort in researching its topic, using many untapped archives and interviews. It reads like a fast  best-selling political thriller.  This is a fascinating account of the propaganda machines the USA used against the Eastern Bloc, showing Pasternak's  and his friends' courage and it shows to what extent the battle for the minds of the readers in the East  was conducted. It is also a detailed story about the cultural and intellectual background of the thirties to the fifties in the USSR.This  battle over the publication of ""Doctor Zhivago"" was one of the first efforts by the CIA to leverage books as instruments of political warfare. It was Khrushchev himself who admitted in the end that the Russians ""caused much harm to the Soviet Union ""and added that he was ""truly sorry for the way he behaved toward Pasternak"".There were additional writers who followed Pasternak's way, among them Solzhenitsyn and Brodsky.This book is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39PCKT6ZELGHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908003#wasThisHelpful","R39PCKT6ZELGHS","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was exactly this day  almost one hundred years ago when all hell broke loose and the gates of Armageddon opened. The First World War started and the world would not be the same. Empires disappeared, a new world order was established, 9 million people died, 30 million were injured or maimed and  this war, which was supposed to end all wars, was just the prelude to another more devastating and disatrous tragedy, namely that of WW2.Enter Gordon Martel's brilliant study which examines that fateful month, July 1914, in which the principal players of the tragedy were responsible for the unleashing of it.The author claims that his purpose in writing the book was to provide the reader with the story of ""how Europe got from A to B; how it moved from the assassination of the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary on the 28th of June, 1914,to the declaration of war by five of the Great Powers of Europe at the beginning of August."" It is a book of how it happened.This study is divided into four main parts, starting with a long introduction on European politics at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. It then commences with the killing of Franz Ferdinand and the reaction to it and then moves on describing the fateful days in July and August 1914. The last part gives the reader on overview of the historiography on the question of who was to be blamed for the outbreak of the war.Mr. Martel is quite honest when he writes that to this day there are many unsolved questions regarding the Great War, but also makes it clear that a combination of hubris, chance and circumstance caused it.The author gives a very detailed description of how the descent into the abyss of war  came about, by providing a very good background of the principal players involved. He also shows to what extent the war might have been avoided every day, and this he does by writing about the every minute-to-minute decisions which were taken then.. He examines the dilpomatic , military and political records  as well as the process of the decision makers, among them Tsar Nicholas 2, the Emperor Franz Joseph, Sir Edward Grey and many other famous  personalities .This book is brilliant because it is written in the style of a first- rate thriller and is researched in depth . It also includes a good bibliographical list and many photos and is highly recommended for those who would like to know the essentials  of World War One.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5G0Z6YUQKI46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199665389#wasThisHelpful","R5G0Z6YUQKI46","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

True, it was Vesalius who demolished many of Galen's theories, nevertheless Galen has made a huge contribution to the development of medicine by the very fact that he conductued an endless number of dissections and vivisections, demonstrating again and again the way the anatomy of monkeys was similar to that of human beings.

"Sometimes you may have to wait quite a  long time in order to read  such a masterful book like Professor's Schrad gripping book. It is about the way in which vodka and other spirits have influenced the long, rich and arduous history of Russia.His main thesis is that since the days of the Vladimir  the Great of Kiev, alcohol has been used to make the Russians happy. The traditional drinks of Russia were naturally fermented beers, ales, meads and kvas. The imposition of the more potent artificial, distilled spirits came only with the imposition of the modern autocratic state, which used vodka to siphon off society's wealth into the treasury, making this drink the central pillar of Russian autocratic statecraft. Vodka, corruption and autocracy have been intertwined  in Russia ever since.Its secondary thesis is that, in a way, Russian rules conducted a kind of controlled schizophrenic policy vis-av-vis vodka: on the oned hand there were those who encouraged the masses to drink(Stalin being one of them) and on the other hand there were those who were against it(Lenin who was really paranoic about it, and Gorbachev). The reason: vodka was a powerful tool to control the masses and also served as a principal source of income for the state.What is great about this book is the vivid style of writing, demonstrating again that only some people belonging to the academia can also write not only for their peers but also for the history buff as well. The author demonstrates that since its inception, Russia was drenched in alcohol. This fact created the tragic consequences for the Russian society. It hastened the demise of the Soviet Union itself and caused what Professor Schrad calls ""the literal demodernization of a twentieth century country"".Just to give you an example: after Gorbachev announced a crackdown on the sales or production of vodka, which claimed the lives of tens of millions (mind you, this is no mistake), the most hard of drinkers turned to alcohol surrogates; from mouthwash, eau-de-cologne and perfumed to gasoline, cockroach poison, brake fluid, medical adhesives and even shoe polish on a slice of bread.Another example: ""Soldiers in the Soviet Army would offer their last piece of bread to their comrades in order to get vodka and they drank everything just as during the Civil War: aftershave lotions, medicines and liquids containing poisons"".Alcoholism runs like a red thread throughout Dostoyevsky's novel ""Crime and Punishment"" and Marmeladov is only the first noteworthy drunkard. Tolstoy suggested that it was alcohol that clouded Raskolnikov's judgment and led to his inhuman axe murders. The pervasive drunkenness of the Russian soldiers contributed to the military defeat of Russia in the Crimean War during the nineteenth century. Forty-four percent of all military deaths were attributable to alcohol. One can conclude that the chief contributory cause of the Bolshevik Revolution was the prohibition in 1914 of the sale of spiritous liquors.As stated by its author, this book does not pretend to say that vodka was/is everything in Russian history, thus it it not a monocausal explanation of Russian history and culture, but ""vodka politics means a lot and it is an alternative lens through which Russia's complex politics and development is seen"".By using newly dicovered documents hitherto classified and by integrating them with an in-depth examination of secondary sources, by incorporating studies from many fields such as sociology, political science, literature, memories and various diaries, anthropology, letters  as well as demographic studies, Professor Schrad has managed to write a book of twenty-four chapters (overpacked with many details and anecdotes in addition to excellent analyses) which is both a masterpiece and will definitely become a classic of its kind. This book is more than highly recommended for anyone who would like to enjoy reading about an original idea, examined almost microscopically, leaving no stone unturned . And in addition, it is also a great read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVG6K77WKYIIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199755590#wasThisHelpful","RVG6K77WKYIIN","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had George Orwell read this book, he would have changed a lot in his famous novel. The book is made up of three long essys and each focuses on another aspect  in connection with the brutal and totalitarian Ceausescu regime.The first chapter is about the Securitate and its ""conspirativity', that is :the comparmentalization or secrecy of its practices. Here Professor Verdely describes in great detail what the twenty-four kilometers of Securitate files contain and the characterization of these files.The second chapter  discusses one main question; what did the secrecy  for the Securitate mean? Here the author uses a term previously used by Hannah Arendt -a term which defined the secret police as a secret society. By using anthropological terms, Ms. Verdely gives the reader a very broad description of the consequences of secrecy for socialism's legitimation.The last chapter is about the field work of officers and informers of the Securitate.The author herself was subject to surveillance during her many years she had spent in Romania. She was regarded or suspected as a spy working for the CIA and she had the good luck of examining her own files culled from those newly openedarchives.A word of caution merits to be written here: this is not an easy read and the reader is asked for a lot of patience for this book. There are many details and many analyses as well  as the use of  many terms taken from anthropology. Second, the author has done a great job in describing almost microscopically the daily routine and the modus operandi of the Securitate men and informers. Just to whet your appetite here are some statistics. There were 525000 Securitate workers for a country which had 23 million people. This meant one Securist for every 42 citizens. Compare this with the Stasi. They had 271000 workers for a population of 17 million. This meant one Stasi worker for every 62 citizens. Romania was well endowed with informers.This exceptional  and well researched book, which has also many photostats, is more than highly recommended not only for its contents but also for a better understanding of what a security state can mean for the present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJCTN9UWCQHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6155225990#wasThisHelpful","R1EJCTN9UWCQHP","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"John Judis has writtten a very good book about the beginnings of the Zionist movement and its influence on world leaders and Jews alike.The first half of the book is about the history of the Zionist movement and the second is about Truman's decisions on the establishment of Israel.It shows the complicated way the many advisors of Truman and the Zionists have gone in order to influence Old Harry to support the establishment of Israel.What was supposed to become a solution to the Jewish problem in the world turned out to be not only a tragedy for the Jews but it has also become a Palestinian tragedy due to the changing and brutal policies perpetrated by the followers  of those descendants of Jabotinsky (a big admirer of Mussolini, mind you) and the religious fanatical parties. These things were never on the agenda of the Fathers of Zionism.Israel is to be blamed for the fact that in contravention to the UN resolutions and interantional law, it sent people to colonize the occupied territories of 1967. This is forbidden according to any international law. Israel's Jews have gained a world of their own, but at the expense of another people. The Palestinians have paid dearly for this and have become a displaced people.Today Israel has become a state which curtails and limits the rights of the Palestinians- those Palestinians whose very existence was  ignored and despised by Golda Meir already in 1969. The Palestinians have no political rigths today and are subject to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and even torture by Israel's military, and ""the continual harassment from the Jewish settlers. That's not the outcome that many of the early Zionists envisaged"", concludes Mr. Judis, who has written a very interesting , brilliant and stimulating book about the paradoxes of the Arab-Israeli conflict, using known and new sources in this myth- breaking and highly recommended book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRHHTSCYC1NG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374161097#wasThisHelpful","RRHHTSCYC1NG4","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there is one book you should read about the many crimes in which the Vatican was involved during the Second World War, Deschner's book is the right choice. Although written many years ago, it was recently updated and is still very relevant and important today.The author, mind you, is a Catholic who does not  hide his disgust of the Catholic Church and is courageous enough to slam incessantly against the Vatican and Pope Pius 12. The reason is extremely simple: the Catholic Church has not done anything to try and stop Hitler  and other mass murderers from executing their devilish plans and extermination programs. No one is spared in this book, not even those  so-called ""resistance"" priests or bishops in Germany who knew about the horrible crimes perpetrated in Russia and against the Jews  during the Holocaust or in Croatia but all they did was to keep silent. This well researched and documented book can only be called a mini-masterpiece and it is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYFLQ5X1FRJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616148373#wasThisHelpful","R1EYFLQ5X1FRJJ","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The extermination of  one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe was that of Hungary. Dry statistics figures show that all in all, 570000 of Hungary's 825000 Jews fell victim in the Holocaust, 437000 of them in the course of less than two months in the spring of 1944.Winston Churchill wrote that thet persecution of Jews in Hungary and their expulsion is ""probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the history of the world.`Enter Raoul Wallenberg. He grew up in a wealthy banking family and his father died of cancer before he even saw his son. Raoul was raised by his mother, but the main figure who was responsible for his upbringing was his paternal grandfather, Gustav Wallenberg. According to Professor Jangfeldt, Gustav adviced his grandson to carry out the duty ""of those who have the talent to carry out the great tasks to rise above their contemporaries"". Thus Raoul was sent to study architecture at the University of Michigan. After graduating, Raoul took some jobs both in South Africa and in Palestine- to be precise: in Haifa, and after some months he chose to work for a Hungarian Jew who had an import-export business in Stockholm. The name of Raoul's boss was Kolman Lauer and he would be the turning point in Raoul's life, since Lauer, backed by the Americans, was engaged in an effort to save the Hungarian Jews.Raoul arrived in Budapest in July 1944. after being appointed secretary to the delegation and representative of the War Refugee Board. From this point onwards, Raoul would implement his granfather's wish. He worked incessantly in order to save as many Jews as possible by doing several things.  He issued provisional passports called ""protective passports (""Schutzpass)"" to Jews who had some connection to Sweden. He found thirty-two safe houses where Jews would be housed. He provided food for the Ghetto inhabitants and also began a Swedish hospital in his private flat. Ten specialist doctors worked full-time in the hospitala nd it opened on 2 December, after only five days' preparation. He managed to save the lives of some 8000 Jews in addition to housing tens of thousands of them in those abobe-mentioned safe houses.These are just a few examples taken from this fascinating and extremely well and deeply- researched new biography by Professor Jangfeldt.However, the last one hundred pages of this important volume are much more interesting, since they deal with Raoul's arrest and fate. Why he was arrested remains an enigma. It is here where the original part of the book starts, because there are many new sources which were discovered by the author on this point. The warrant for Raoul's arrest was signed by Deputy Defence Commisar Bulganin and addressed to Marshal Malinovsky with a copy to the head of SMERSH, Victor Abakumov. It said that Raoul "" shall be arrested and brought to Moscow"" . This happened in January 1945. According to the author, Raoul's possessions contained documents pertaining to the activities of the Swedish delegation in Budapest; his plans for the reconstruction of Hungary after the war; photographs of atrocities committed by the Nazis and the Arrow Cross party. ""We also know that he had with him money in various currencies as well as gold and valuables"". The Soviets knew about those valuables through a spy in Wallenberg's intimate circle and there is no record of what happened to them and the gold. In all probability, they were stolen by soldiers and officers on the spot.Raoul was sent to the Lubianka prison and the given profession on the arrest card was ""diplomatic overseer or observer"". Raoul arrived here from another prison, Lefortovo. He shared his cell with the German Gustav Richter, also known as Romania's Eichmann-with the difference that Richter's plan was never implemented. It was Richter who, in 1955, supplied information about the three weeks in which he shared his cell with Wallenberg, who was accused of being a spy in favour of the Germans.The author includes some new photostats of testimonies given by other citizens who saw Wallenberg. The fact that some papers found proved that Wallenberg had connections with various Nazi officials-Kurt Becher and Himmler-worked against him. The Soviets kept Wallenberg in jail for two and a half years without being interrogated more than five times. According to Jangfeldt, Wallenberg was suspected of collaboration with the American and British intelligence sservices-a suspicion which fueled Stalin's paranoia.Raoul died as a result of a heart  attack on 17 July 1947. This  official report is also raising some questions because there are some testimonies written by some Russian officers and  found by the author which deny that Raoul was suffering from a heart condition.The last part of the book asks why the Swedish authorities did  very little for their citizen and maybe there were some economic factors or interests which were responsible for this behaviour. As he concludes, Professor Jangfeldt writes that ""much greater resources could no doubt have been mobilized, considering the Wallenberg family's position and influence"".This book, which is based on original research, includes tens of never-before-published new photos and is a must for all those who would like to know more about one of the most intelligent and noble persons who was ever alive and has justly deserved the title of"" one of the righteous""  during those horrible days in the annals of humanity.

"Operation Paperclip is about the connection between Nazi scientists and American government secrets. Under this program, more than a thousand of Nazi scientists were brought to America  immediately after the end of World War Two. Those scientists helped develop rockets, the NASA program, chemical and biological weapons, aviation and space medicine and many other weapons of mass destruction.They came to America at the behest of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Some officials believed that by endorsing the Paperclip program they were accepting the lesser of two evils-that if America didn't recruit theses men, the Soviet Communists would.The book comes in five parts and each part is about another chronoligical era . Most men that were brought to America were accused of war crimes. Most of them were found guilty of war crimes by the various post-war trials at Nuremberg. Yet the USA wanted them on American soil to work for the American people despite their horrible past.Opposition to Operation Paperclip gained momentum with America's scientific elite and  many scientists were outraged when the details of the secret project came out. Albert Einstein was the most esteemed figure to publicly denouce this operation and wrote directly to President Truman on behalf of his FAS colleagues:""We hold these individuals to be potentially dangerous...Their former eminence as Nazi Party members and supporters raises the issue of their fitness to become American citizens and hold key positions in American industrial, scientific and educational institutions"".Another famous scientists, Hans Bethe, who fled the Nazis, asked: ""Do we want science at any price?""Among the various and many scientists and their respective projects they were working on, Ms. Jacobsen mentions Dr. Walter Schreiber who was the surgeon general of the Third Reich and developed  intravenous lethal phenol injections. He was finally exposed by an ex-concentration camp victim and as a result had to leave the USA. Another criminal, Kurt Blome, was Hitler's biological weapons maker, while Kurt Debus was a V-weapons engineer who oversaw mobile rocket launches at Peenemunde. An ardent Nazi, he wore the SS uniform to work and became the first director of NASA's JFK Space Center in Florida. Hubertus Strughold was in charge of the aviation research in the Reich Ministry and despite his war crimes was hired by the Americans only to become America's father of Space Medicine.These and many more criminal scientists people the pages of this fascinating  and fast-paced written book. In it, Ms. Jacobsen has incorporated a wealth of post-war interrogation reports, army intelligence security dossiers, Army intelligence armaments reports, declassified memos, diaries and journals. She also used-for the first time-materials supplied to her by the descendants of some Nazi scientists. She definitely shows to what extent the CIA agency had been involved with these monsters and the various ways those Nazis trained and supplied vital information to the CIA. The various and notorious  interrogation techniques and other programs and projects had their beginnings in a camp near Franfurt called Camp King. It was there where Operation Bluebird experiments involving LSD and other drugs started.The army's herbicidal warfare program during the Vietnam War, inwhich 11.4 million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over more than 24 percent of South Vietnam was the brainchild of Fritz Hoffmann, another Nazi war criminal. On his deathbed, Hoffmann, according his daughter, was quiet and said nothing about it. Unfortunately, many details about additional projects initiated by the Nazi scientists who were flown into the USA are still classified.For anyone interested in the  history of the postwar period and for those who would like to know to what extent the USA became involved with the Nazi past, this long book is ""a must"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3619DGA58IM88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031622104X#wasThisHelpful","R3619DGA58IM88","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is one of the best written ones on the subject of Napoleon. It describes in great detail the many battles of the Emperor, with particular emphasis on the bitter fate of the French soldiers in Spain and in Russia, where almost  more than half a million  French soldiers died there.It also takes a deep look into the private life of Napoleon, his loves, his health, his problems with his brothers and with his wives  and also has many quotes, quips and speeches by him.Was he a dictator or a liberator? This depends on the reader's choice, although the author is inclined to show him as a cruel and oppressive leader. The controversy over this point will probably go on in the future.Mr. Dwyer has written a marvellouly researched book, incorporating new evidence about the battles in Russia. It is intended for the academic and the lay reader alike.

"Common wisdom claims that the Cuban Missile Crisis(CMC)  was the most dangerous event in the annals of humanity. To quote Dean Rusk's words, it was so  ""...because the two superpowers were at each other's jugular veins and it was not easy to see a way out. With fumbling on iether side, this could have resulted in nuclear war"".Enter Mr. Pardoe's magnificent book which demonstrates that the contingency plans and the likely scenarios could have been much worse than previously omagined. I believe this is the first book to discuss in such great detail the military preparations for the upcoming conflict. Although limited by a ferocious policy of declassification, the author has managed to tell the reader for the first time about Operation Scabbards. This included a number of frightening possibilities devised by the supreme commanders of the USA army concerning the various ways to fight in Cuba.Had this war happened, one of the biggest losers would be the countries of Europe. There would be no winners in the event of a full nuclear exchange and both superpowers would have been crippled to the point where they may have never recovered.Worse yet, the Cubans and the Soviets both had plans to fight on after the battle for Cuba was lost, waging a guerrilla war. The US occupation of Cuba was not a one ot three month effort; it was destined to drag on potentially for years with a long string of casualties.The book discusses in great detail to what extent the US commanders were naive and knew very little about the real situation in Cuba. Ditto for the CIA, save its head, John McCone, who was perhaps the only one who deduced correctly what the Soviets's intentions were.Many materials which could have expanded the panoramic views represented here were lost or weren't properly archived. This presents any researcher with many problems, since the picture of the CMC is still far from being complete. Many questions still remain open or unclear, although the CMC has been analyzed microscopically so far.Thus Mr Pardoe's archival request for information from the Cuban authorities were politely ignored.The book contains extremely detailed tables concerning the USA army units and their order of combat  as well as many relevant maps, although some of them are not printed clearly. In addition, the author has interviewed many persons who were part of this ongoing crisis, among them marines, sailors, soldiers, officers and analysts. It also has  a chronological list of photographic missions over Cuba and many new photos, hitherto classified. For history buffs and professionals, this is a much highly recommended book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM5QN4NHE8SKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781551960#wasThisHelpful","RM5QN4NHE8SKR","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book puts the emphasis on Beethoven the man and not his compositions. Mr. Suchet writes about what Beethoven ate, drank, smoked and many other things which show that the genius also had human attributes. He also writes about some episodes which were unnoticed by other biographers. Did you know - for example -that once the great Beethoven was a kitchen aide?Mr Suchet points out the weaknesses and the positive as well as the negative characteristics of his subject. The main parts deal with Beethoven's  life and deeds in Vienna and its suburbs. It is here where he got  achieved his fame and it is here where he composed, directed, took walks ( mainly by himself), ate, quarreled  and died. The main thesis behind this volume is that one can better understand and definitely enjoy Beethoven's music only after knowing even trivial facts about the man. Beethoven was extremely complicated and complex. He would sometimes leash out at people without any regrets for having done so. In his famous and great pieces and small he was the only composer who wrote for anyone and thus became perhaps the greatest of them all.Highly recommended for those who would like to know not only about his music, but also about the man behind the composer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REOWNGNUI3SKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080212206X#wasThisHelpful","REOWNGNUI3SKH","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is well researched and gives the reader a panoramic view about one of the most tragic and least understood episodes in the history of WW2. The AK's arranged Warsaw uprising and the destruction of Warsaw stand in the focus here.The author who is living in Poland had access to her father-in-law's vast archive about the events which transpired in the summer of 1944 and she writes about the immense scale of beastly brutality perpetrated by the Nazi hordes against the Polish nation. The tragedy of Poland has been already told many timeds, yet this book is a very good microhistory about the fate of those living in the hellish conditions in Warsaw during August, when the uprising was a total failure and, as a result, the Nazis simply decided to erase the city. This was a unique decision and no other city suffered the same fate during the war.  The decision to do it was taken under the auspices of Hitler and Himmler, and Ms. Richie is extremely good when describing the whole background of this tragic event, which claimed the lives of at least 200000 Poles.But why not award this book five stars? There are some things which could have been incorporated here but are missing. First, there is a lack of relevant maps. Even those that are to be found here are simple and do not give the lay reader the information so much needed when reading  about microevents.Second, the fate of the AK's leadership is almost non-existent during this long book and all we get is a good introduction the the topic.All in all, this is a book I would recommend to those who know something (or nothing)  about this tragedy and would like to expand their horizons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20JSFNGXYJ2FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374286558#wasThisHelpful","R20JSFNGXYJ2FV","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leo Damrosch has written an outstanding book on one of the greatest writers in English literature. Swift was a man of many contradictions and his life was full of complex relationships. The author has incorporated new things which were discovered about Swift during the last thirty years and he offers his readers a very lucidly written book which is divided according to many topics which do not come in partilcular chronological order.He starts with Swift's early and tragic life and commences with his first attempts to write various treaties and poems.The author claims that so far the authority on the writer was Irvin Ehrenpreis's monumental biography, which fills two thousand pages by the time the third volume came out, yet there were new aspects of Swift's life and writings that emerged in the last decades. Damrosch also criticizes his predecessor for relying much on Freudian interpretations of personality, which can distort Swift's relationships in general.Damrosch is excellent when he provides the reader with the various backrounds of each new person who entered Swift's life. In fact, sometimes the reader is confronted with many details, which sometimes might be a hindrance  during the reading of the text, but ,all in all, this biography exaust each and every angle of Swift's life, carrer, his friendships and his enemies, his relationship with Sir William Temple, where Swift established a relationship of more than twenty-seven years with Stella, the woman who was thought to be Temple's daughter and perhaps the woman who many thought got married to Swift.Thus one of the greatest enigmas of Swift's life.We also get a fascinating description and history of London in the eighteenth century, to quote, ""Street life was aggressive. Carts and wagons were dangerous, herds of livestock pushed past pedestrians, and since there were no sidewalks, it was impossible to avoid the traffic and the dirt"". There was a good deal of crime and Swift was captivated by the human comedy in the streets, but was  also disgusted by the London stink. There he wrote two anti-pastorals and there are many descriptions of London's political life which served as the basis for Swift's satirical writings and poems.There are just twenty pages which are devoted to Gulliver's Travels"" and, in my opinion, this is a pity because this book is central in Swift's writings and in general. The last years of Swift's life are  detailed as well and the doctors who conducted the autopsy of Swift found the reason for the disease Swift was suffering from.This oustanding volume is extremely well and deeply researched and documented. It also contains tens of facsimiles and photos . It is highly recommended to those who want to know not only about Swift and the times he lived in, but also to those who want to enjoy a very stimulating biography, which is fast-paced and highly enjoyable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11PKBHABF1QAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300164998#wasThisHelpful","R11PKBHABF1QAM","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start this time from the end. If Mr. Farmelo would have clarified his main thesis, I would have given this volume five stars. Unfortunately, this did not happen and it is a pity, because the efforts and amount of research invested in this book are worth praising.Churchill was deeply influenced by H G Wells in his views on science as Mr. Farmelo makes it clear from the very beginning. Then there are so many chapters devoted not only to Churchill bit also to his friend and main advisor in scientific  matters, Frederick Lindemann. The Prof , as Churchill called him, was despised by many of his colleagues and was an anti-Semite, although he had done much  to rescue and bring to England Jewish scientists who were trying to escape from the ferocious regime of Hitler. Isaiah Berlin even remarked that he would have liked to kill Lindemann. The Prof knew at some point that he would never be able to compete with other physicists such as Einstein and Rutherford.Mr. Farmelo makes it clear that Churchill's total dependence on Lindemann was a hindrance rather than a blessing when coming to decide matters about the best way to work on the A-bomb. The bureaucratic process which this subject gave birth too was long, endless and arduous and Churchill is regarded as the main culprit for not  obtaining the bomb for England in 1941, when Roosevelt made his famous offer to Churchill. It was much later when both countries decided to co-operate in this matter but the US had the upper hand.In fact, this book is a dual biography of both Churchill and Lindemann, with a lot of relevant information about the other and many physicists involved in the project whose final station was at  Los Alamos. The second part of this good book explains in detail what Churchill's stand  vis-a-vis Stalin and Communism after WW2 was. Mr. Farmelo is in the know about the many efforts of Stalin to get information about the bomb from his many spies who were sent or worked for him. One of them was Klaus Fuchs and there are many details about him and his betrayal.To sum up, Mr Farmelo does not clarify his thesis and one has to infer what exactly the main thesis is in this important  and engrossing book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQOI1HRYEWZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465021956#wasThisHelpful","R3IQOI1HRYEWZ8","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the annals of humanity, there were many hideous crimes committed against various gropus or peoples. The Black Holocaust stands out in its uniqueness because it was extremely long and took almost 450 years to terminate it. In addition, not only were the Blacks marked to die, they also had to serve as production beasts for the White man before being exterminated. In fact, most Blacks who were enslaved were subjects to humiliation, torture,beatings, rape and economic exploitation by their masters.This magnificent volume by Professors Gates and Yacovone is a gem because of many reasons, but particularly because it gives the reader  a glimpse into the lives of those unfortunate slaves who later on were released form their horrible ordeal, not before enduring those various afflictions mentioned before.There are nine chapters, chronologically starting im 1500 and ending with the election of Barack Obama. In other words, this book takes the reader on a journey where he-or she-is transported to Africa, Europe, the Carribean, South America and the United States.The journey to freedom was far from being smooth and had many bends, like  the ones found in a river. These bends -one should say:too many of them-included rebellions, hardships, slave trades in which most slaves were regarded a piece of property, escape routes,redemption, thousands of lynchings at the beginning of the twentieth century, discrimination, the Harlem Renaissance and finally the ultimate destination-the White House.Superbly illustrated, this volume is also well researched  and  is surely to become a classic of its kind. Its subtext, in my opinion, is that if you stand up for your own rights, you will finally achieve them, no matter what.

"This book is one of the best books which appeared during 2013. It is written like an elegant thriller and tells the story of two famous public figures in American contemporary history. It is the story and history  of the Dulles brothers, one a masterspy and the other a foreign secretary. It is also, as the writer mentions, the story of America, of its myopia and hubris. The two brothers wanted the world to go  their way, thus they had invested all their efforts in doing anything legal or illegal in order to achieve this. Allen has conducted numerous covert actions, and was the head of the CIA, which made sure to remove all the obstacles in favour of the United States. Foster has done the same.  The fault with both of them was that they saw the world in Manichean terms only-perhaps a result of their rigorous religious upbringing. There were only two kinds of people or nations in the worlds: the bad ones and the good ones.  In the end, both started to lose their grip on reality, and the humiliation of Allen, who was dismissed from his post by Kennedy, was bigger.This book should be mandatory reading for anyone who likes a good history book, which is extremely well researched and brilliantly written.

"This slim volume is a gem and includes a lot of insights which  could only be written by a master historian, He gives the reader a brief overview about Mozart's life, dismissing some famous myths about the composer. He does not discuss in depth  almost anything , however he has a vey good (and long) chapter on Mozart's operas.Some years ago, I attended a lecture on music. The professor who delivered it told us that Bach wrote heavenly music; Beethoven wrote music for the people; Mozart just wrote music. His words will remain with me forever.This book should be read not only by Mozart fans but also by anyone who wants to understand more about the humane part of a genius' life and his optimistic outlook on life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIAWT5D3ERJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026379#wasThisHelpful","RXIAWT5D3ERJF","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I concur with one of the critics here who had previously mentioned the fact that this book needed a serious editor. Instead of reading an interesting story about a fascinating and dynamic part of American history, we get a book  in which things repeat themselves in an endless number of the same pattern. The writing style is awkward, boring and repetitive and one gets the impression that the book was written for those who have a very big problem with understanding reading comprehension. What could be stated precisely and concisely in some pages is unnecessarily told in tens and sometimes hundreds of redundant pages, missing the whole point. This is not how history should be written. I do believe that had this book been shortened by at least  sixty percent, the final product would have been very good indeed, Instead, we get a heavy volume of things which remind one of a dog chasing its tail in order to catch it-all in vain! There are much better books on Theodore Roosevelt and suffice it to mention the works of Edmund Morris. Spare you money! And, mind you, isn't the author Goodwin the one who has been implicated in plagiarizing while writing about the Kennedys? Methinks the answer is in the affirmative.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J12UCKO7A182/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=141654786X#wasThisHelpful","R3J12UCKO7A182","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start with a confession. I was born in Romania and from time to time  I happen to read books about Romanian history and Communism. My speciality concerns the Cold War and whenever a new book  about it is available, I try to read it.This book,  by Tomek Jankowski , is  different. It is a book about Eastern Europe and has many short chapters on almost every facet of  Eastern European history. But this is not another book just about dry facts. It will be enjoyed by many readers who have almost no knowledge about this topic. Even those of you who know much about that part of the world, will find an endless number of gems among its pages.The writing is dynamic, up-to-date, with many new and unusual aspects  and it includes many trivia windows which inhabit its pages.It starts with a journey starting in 500 BC and ends in 2009. The roots of the modern world are to be found in Eastern Europe and an awful lot of peoples, technologies, trade goods and languages that came to make up modern-day Western Europe probably flowed through Eastern Europe first.Rich with pictures. diagrams, figures, jokes, aphorisms , poems, maps and even recipes, you will enjoy a very quick and conciseintellectual journey  in one of the most beautiful yet complicated parts  of the world. This book can serve both as a superb introduction to the topic or as a new a refreshed , stimulating and non- conventional look at Eastern Europe , written by  someone who is a master in his field.

"Intelligence has played a significant part in the history of the Cold War. Spies, as the author mentions, did not change the political balance between the superpowers, but they were responsible, to a great extent, for letting the other side know of the opponent's intentions.This volume, being  supplementary to the first volume which is a history of espionage in America between  the nation's birth to the Cold War, is superb and contains a lot of well known cases in which American citizens betrayed their country.  The author displays not only a very good command of each case, but also analyzes in depth many cases  of espionage which happened during the last sixty years. The main reason for spying was money. As Mr. Sulick writes,""American disbelief in espionage reached its heights in the decades preceding World War Two"". The Soviets invested a lot of efforts  to extract vital information about each facet of America, thus they were willing to pay huge amounts of money to anyone who would deliver the merchandise. The years between 1945-1970 were justly called ""the Golden Age"" of espionage, since the Soviets' network included spies from all walks of life, from inside and outside the government, from the highest levels to low-ranking clerks.Elizabeth Bentley, The Rosenbergs, Harry Dexter White, Theodore Hall, the Venona Project, Aldrich Ames, Ronald Pelton, John Walker and Robert Hanssen, as well as other less famous spies people the pages of this book.Mr. Sulick discusses in great detail the motivations of those spies, the access and the secrets they betrayed, their exposure and the punishment given to each of them and the damage they caused to the national security of the USA. One major conclusion of the author is that the Americans were extremely naive about the possibility-or rather the impossibility-of American citizens spying against their own country.It was not all about money, and some spies had other motives, such as ego, romance, thrills and revenge.The book is divided into six parts, and in my view the best ones are the  last two which discuss panoramically the last vestiges of Cold War espionage and the spy business of the twenty-first century, where a lot of emphasis is put on the Chinese efforts to gain secrets from the USA.The author also makes it clear that the counterintelligence services of the USA almost totally ignored the possibility of China getting involved in the Great Game. This can be due to the fact that the efforts to make it hard on spies to gather classified information were mainly devoted and focused on the Soviet Union and the Eastern block countries. For millenia, Sun Tzu's emphasis on the importance of espionage ""has been a pillar of Chinese military and political strategy. His advice about using spies everywhere would be applied relentlessly in the United States in the last quarter of the twentieth century. During that period, Chinese intelligence flooded the United States with students, scientists, businessmen, and emigres from all walks of life to harvest America's political, economic and scientific secrets."" One of these spies was Larry Wu-tai Chin's espionage for the Chinese regime and it lasted longer than any known American spy. Another case was that of Katrina Leung who was exposed as a double agent working for both the FBI and the Chinese.At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Chinese pursued operations to infiltrate young Americans into positions of access.They were recruited on Chinese campuses.In 2010, six out of seven cases of economic espionage involved China; estimated of losses in these cases touched the stunning figure of one billion dollars.These days  there are 140 foreign intelligence services which spy against the United States and, according to the White House officials, economic espionages cost US companies an estimated 100 billion dollars a years in lost sales.Cyberspying is in vogue these days, while spy hunters now confront a far broader spectrum of threat from hostile states and groups, including numerous threats from terrorist organizations. Hacktivism is mainly used  to manipulate data for political purposes or economic ones. It is expected that in the future, the number of cyberespionage attacks will grow and become increasingly sophisticated. These attacks could be launched by terrorists to destroy vital infrastructure systems, including the banking industry, telecommunications, electrical grids, and air traffic control.This book, written by a former CIA couterintelligence chief, is a treat, extremely well researched  and profusely documented and reads like a first rate spy novel.

"Among so many books published  so far about the Kennedy presidency, this one merits to be called the best of them all.It is divided into three parts, and the best one is the third, which discusses the impact of the Kennedy legacy on the other presidents.The first two thirds are about the Kennedy administration and the second one is a dissection about the assassination and the various theories connected to it. Mr Sabato spares no one and  offers his intepretation of the events which happened on the day of the assassination and afterwards.This book, which is superbly researched, is a real gem and reads like a fast-paced thriller, full of surprises on each and every page of it.

The whole murderous episode is far from being resolved, because, as the author points out, there are still one million files pertaining to the case and waiting to be opened at some point in this decade.This book is brilliantly written and it does not matter if you agree or disagree with its thesis.

"Many people , specialists and history buffs alike, claim that  World War One changed the course of modern and comtemporary history. It  is considered the first modern technological war and when it ended, at least four empires disappeared from the world.Many problems which concern the world today have their origins in this war and its aftermath.Margaret Macmillan has written a brilliant book about the background of this horrible conflict which claimed the lives of more than nine million soldiers. This immensly readable book  is  not only a synthesis of things which have been published before, but is also a very broad and deep analysis of various aspects of the events that led to this tragedy.True, Professor Macmillan does not offer any verdict as to who was to be blamed  for the war. She asks many questions, offers many solutions and lets the reader decide for himself  who the real culprit is, but her tendency is to support the Fischer Thesis, or in other words, she more than once hints about Germany's culpability.This is one of the best book that were ever written about WW1 and it is more than highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H6IIGS2Z5K9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140006855X#wasThisHelpful","R2H6IIGS2Z5K9","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is another important addition to what was called in the past ""the missing dimension"" of Cold War history, namely the history of intelligence during the  that era. Mr. Bagley has written a book about one of the most famous-perhaps the most famous -spymasters who ran espionage operations  for his Kremlin masters. This was Sergey Kondrashev, who was the handler of another famous British spy, George Blake. In fact, this slim volume is about the revelations dictated to Bagley by the Russian superspy, and since he could not write about his past in Putin's Russia, he had to find another way of doing so. Some years ago, Kondrashev died and now Mr. Bagley could publish his adversary's memoirs without any hindrance.Kondrashev headed two of the most important KGB stations abroad, in London and Vienna, and he was chief of the KGB'S German-Austrian Department, overseeing its penetrations of the West German government and other clandestine actions in that area of prime Soviet concern.He also commended the secret intelligence operations of Soviet border troops along their vast frontiers in northern Europe, Central Asia, China and the northern Pacific.His forces contributed to Moscow's effortd to desatbilize China. Small units would clandestinely enter western Chinese territory to plant tower-like transmitters to broadcast calls for autonomy from Beijing's rule. He also adds some surprising information regarding the Nosenko case and I will not spoil it for you. There are some revelations about the fate Hitler's body and his part in this affair.Another important chapter reveals how and to what extent the Soviets conducted disinformation operations aimed against the West.If you want to understand how the great game was played out in different countries and locations during the Cold War, this book is a ""must"". It also helps clarify some more controversial issues about various angles in the annals of the Cold War history, starting with the revelations of an American traitor who helped ignite the Korean war.This book proves again and again to what extent the importance of intelligence was in those times and no serious historian writing about the Cold War would ignore this dimension.

"Ian Buruma has written a short volume about the year 1945, in which he describes the end and the beginning on a new period in conteporary history. The most vicious and brutal war in the annals of humanity has changed everything and Professor Buruma is excellent when describing whatever happened to the common people immediately after the end of this horrible conflict, which took the lives of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians alike. The chapters are organized thematically and in the background there is the personal history of the author's father who was sent to Berlin during the war.It would be a waste of time to describe again the contents of each chapter, since previous critics have already done so before.I would say that the conclusion of the author is not original and he is extremely careful  and honest to point this out, and the things that matters most is  his optimism about the future of Europe, in particular. This is mandatory reading for any intelligent man or woman who cares about the human race.

"This is another excellent book written by a very talented and erudite writer whose books have so far managed to attract many readers and admirers.This volume is about the brutish and hellish conditions under which miliions were to be found during 1914 in Europe. To be sure, Mr. Hastings does not doubt at all who was to be blamed for the start of the hostilities and by this is he much credit, again, to the Fischer thesis. In other words, the blame goes to Germany and he proves it again and again, dismissing all the other revisionist historians who tried to rebuke this claim. I must say that he is very convincing in presenting these arguments.Sir Hastings also does a superb job in trying to convey the day-by-day ordeal and battles that soldiers and civilians alike had to undergo, and he offers the reader a very broad picture of everythings that happened on the front, be it the Western or Eastern one. This he does in a very simple language,which does not include a lot of military jargon and terms-a rare thing for a military historian.He also analyzes the outcome of the first 5 months of the war, and is extremely critical of the BEF.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYW124RGBDTDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307597059#wasThisHelpful","RYW124RGBDTDE","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a strong indictment against the many abuses  of the law the CIA and other American intelligence units have perpetrated in the last 40 years.It has ten chapters and it starts with the famous ""Family Jewels"" which were revealed in the 1970s, leading to the establishment of the well-known Church Committee.What is new here is the scope and breath of the excellent analysis offered by Mr. John Prados, a senior fellow at the NS Archive in Washington. Not only does he describe in great detail what those jewels were about, but he also adds new dimensions to them. This is not only a book about the Year of Intelligence. It demonstrates,step by step, to what extent those people who were in charge of intelligence gathering and dissemination were involved in illegal actions. These actions, which among others, included domestic operations aimed at American citizens, are still in the making these very days.The book is also about the spooks who conducted those illegalities, the efforts to uncover them, the politicos who ordered them or attempted to stymie them and serves as a kind of warning. In particular, Mr. Prados makes it clear that suppression of the truth will only backfire at those who try to hide it, in the same way it acted against them in the past. He attacks mainly the American Presidents who knew or pretended not to know about illegal actions which were undertaken by the CIA. How the Presidents tried to prevent, limit, curtail or outflank investigations is revealed here in great depth.The author makes a distinction between ""Family Jewels""-the famous documents revealed to the public in the 1970s and the Family Jewels of today, meaning the controversial actions or operations currently in use these days. He identifies a certain pattern of spy activities which tended or tend to replicate each time. Among those mentioned, one can find political surveillance, eavesdropping, harsh interrogation, assassinations (today targeted ones with the help of drones) and many other things spanning from the days of the Cold War to these very days.The main thesis of the book is that efforts to evade accountability will not be successful.Another aspect is that once projects which are illegally initiated will be extremely hard to shut down. Thus NSA's program called ""Minaret"" whose purpose was to tap or listen to phone calls of American citizens in the seventies continued for more than a year after a court decision rendered it plainly illegal. The follow-up is today in the ""Enhanced Interrogation"" techniques against various suspects, or, if you will, the famous ""Terrorist Surveillance Program"". As Mr. Prados writes, ""Presidents and their staff are some of the most dangerous violators of secrecy, because they know what the public does not"". Or, to put it otherwise, ""the White House plays the same games as does the CIA"".The final chapter offers a schematic attempt to remedy this flawed situation and, in addition, is an attack on the classified documents declassification methods used today, which are not appropriate anymore.This immensely readable and well-researched book is more than highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VULNK1KPMU8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0292737629#wasThisHelpful","R1VULNK1KPMU8K","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is almost nothing positive one can say about this book. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the efforts invested in it, particularly in trying to write an interesting narrative.On the other hand, there are many problems with this biography. As one of the previous readers has already remarked, Berg cannot make up his mind as to whether Wilson was a positive or negative president. Soetimes he portrays him as benevolent, sometimes Wilson is a negative politician or president.In addition, there are many statements written which cannot be supported by any evidence. For example, Mr. Berg claims that the Black Death was taking its toll for some 400 years. This is a figment of his imagination, since in the best case one can speak of some 100-120 years of non-stop death cases as a result of that horrible plague. Another example has to do with a statement allegedly uttered by Churchill, claiming the the USA should not have interfered with other countries' business or affairs, which again cannot be proved by any reliable source.Add the fact that the footnotes are arranged in a terrible manner and they, in the majority of cases, do not correspond to the written text. Some other  essential sources which should have been mentioned because they are a sine qua non in writing about Wilson are totally disregarded. This is a pity and I can only recommend another, older biography, which  is still very good, that of John Milton Cooper.In short, don't waste you time and money on this volume!","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36ZYFT0VR1C4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159215#wasThisHelpful","R36ZYFT0VR1C4Q","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They say that when the cannons roar, the muses fall silent. But in the following case, the muses weren't silent at all, on the contrary, they were more than active.""Shadows of Combat"" is a very original book and is an extension of the authors' previous excellent book called ""In Our Duffel Bags"".Mr. Geschke and Mr. Toto have this time undertaken a very interesting  and, one must say, original project: to offer a poetic version of their wartime experiences-one which took place and spanned over three continents. The style of writing is far from being conventional and does not conform to any specific rules of poetry writing. Since poems are a personal matter, so are feelings, emotions, thoughts and the reader will find them all here. As young officers sent to Fort Benning, Georgia, these two maintained a laudatory friendship since then.The book is nicely organized with short, precise and concise introductions and complemented by relevant photos for each segment, starting with their period when they were training as officers and proceeding with chapters about  their service in Germany, Panama and Vietnam. Some poems are full of irony, some evoke sad memories, some contain connotations of despair and others serve as a kind of protest against many domestic issues connected in particular to the Vietnam War-a thing which mattered tremendously to both authors/poets. You may like or dislike their poems, yet you will never remain indifferent. Each one of these pieces encapsulates another kind of experience written, I believe, from the very bottom of their hearts.This book has another advantage over others. One should remember that many readers were born after the times described here, therefore they will gain a lot of insights and a hands-on experience about the various episodes in the lives of these two courageous fellows and their comrades, whose mission was to serve their country, no matter what.I personally liked the poems written about Germany, named ""Spandau"" and ""The Wall"".In the second half of the book there are poems about the harrowing experience as well as about those horrible times when both men were in Vietnam. Many poems in this section will hammer at you directly. Reading and rereading them will cause you to undergo various emotions. You will laugh, you will cry, you will feel anger or joy, you will be sharing helicopter flights or be a witness  to nature's wrath or beauty. And suddenly, without any previous warning, you will be tranported home, where""...no one cared!Only our families cared. Only our fellow veterans knew and cared.Our plights were sealed. No welcome home.No thanks for our service"".Yet out of these desperate moments, you will also find hope and optimism, as demonstrated by Mr. Geschke's son, Scott, who urged his father to relive those times and spread his and Toto's truth for us all. Thus the end of a deep, touching and everlasting journey.Reading this short but poignant volume will definitely whet your appetite for some more poetry from those times, and I beseech both poets/ex-warriors for a follow-up. Chapeau, gentlemen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3SLMOJ7B73S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVX9VAC#wasThisHelpful","R1S3SLMOJ7B73S","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's September 21, 1927. He is in his bedroom. A woman has just left. A disordered bed. An overturned scent bottle. A little gold box in which few traces of cocaine remain. A cold supper laid out on the table. D'Annunzio hasn't yet touched the food, but the woman ate some of it during the night. Now, alone, he eats ravenously. The fig and the prosciuto each remind him of the intimate parts of the woman he shared last night.This is just one almost complete entry which appears in this fascinating new book on one of the most colourful characters in modern history.Who was D'Annunzio? He was a poet, a seducer, a womanizer, a pilot, a writer, a playwright, a rebel, a leader of proto-fascists and of mutineers. He worshipped Napoleon. He admired Carlyle who would confirm the poet's veneration for great men and reinforce his conviction that it was not economic forces, as the socialists maintained, but the action of superb individuals that shaped history. Born in 1863, he wrote many novels and poems amd spent some time in Paris at the beginning of the twentieth century. These were the times when poets still had a say and were admired. James Joyce called him ""the only European writer after Flaubert to carry the novel into new territory"". He was also a journalist and yearned for public adoration. He was a notoriours womanizer who took care to document even the tiniest intimate moments of his sexual acts. His sexual appetite was insatiable. He enjoyed drugs and mysticism. And airplanes. And fast cars, courtesy of Fiat. The masses loved him. He was a demagogue and a kind of a Duce; at least this is how he referred to himself many years before the people and history made the acquaintance with the name of Mussolini.Then, in September 1919, he marched into what he called ""The city of Holocaust, Fiume. This episode forms the second part of the book. A city ""with a staccato history and mongrel population"" sited at the northern part of the Adriatic, which has been one of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's two great Adriatic ports. At the end of WW1 it was occupied by Allied forces, but D'Annunzio thought it should belong to the Italians. He commanded over 200 ex-soldiers in the city until the Italian navy bombed him out. Afetr he left in 1921, over 200 people were killed and about one thousand were wounded in clashes between fascists and socialists. After this episode he would lead a lonely life, still enjoying sex with an  endless number of women. This was the man who considered death of the so many young soldiers not only dulce and decorum but also sublime.The many notebooks he left, his huge correspondence and literary output make it easy on his biographer, since he, and in this case Ms. Hughes, can render D'Annunzio's thoughts, tastes, emotions and physical sensations. As for the style  of writing this book, let me quote the author's words verbatim:"" I have made nothing up, but I have freely made use of techniques commoner in fiction writing than in biography. I have not always observed chronological order; the beginning is seldom the best place to start. I have alternated legato narrative with staccato glimpses of the man and fragments of his thoughts"".Because he was a public figure for over half a century, the author has been able to draw on dozens of others' records to show the  of him outside as well. In short, the book has many viewpoints about D'Annunzio.This is a splendid biography; in addition, is is also an excellent cultural histoy of Europe between 1880-1930. It shows to what extent other writers and philosophers have influenced D'Annunzio. Among those there were Nietzsche, Rolland, Dostoyevsky, Flaubert and Proust. Written in a very unique and special style, in-depth  and superbly researched, this very long biography containing over 700 pages of written text, will be unsurpassed for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NI7GH05U3LJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307263932#wasThisHelpful","R1NI7GH05U3LJK","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I  must confess that at the beginning I thought that I would give this book 5 stars. It is well written and the style is extremely elegant. Add the fact that there is not even one boring moment during its 362 pages of text.But.. Here come the ""But"".The problem with the book is at the end of end, ot to be more precise: with the last chapter, called ""After Dallas"". There, on page 353, Mr. Clarke remarks that:""What might have been"" is speculation, but what Kennedy intended to do is not"".To follow this line of thought and to develop it, one is supposed to supply evidence for such a statement. However, there is nothing which could satisfy the professional historian, since in the best case, this book takes a U-turn and becomes a counterfactual history.To discuss what Kennedy intended to do, one must have proof for it. Here Mr. Clarke produces some statements uttered by some presidential aides and other figures, but all in all, he sounds extremely unconvincing.On the very contrary, there is evidence that Kennedy has never given up the plan to get rid of Castro, and the best proof for this is the ""Mongoose Plan"", which was the brainchild of his brother, Bobby, and there is not even today one iota  of evidence in the archives to refute this claim. The Presidential Recordings of those times augment this view.I therefore rest my case. One can say that, in the best case, this book is a hagiography of Kennedy and nothing else. Or, it had to carry another subtitle called: ""An  intellectual exercise in counterfactual history"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRWV9909685A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420425X#wasThisHelpful","RLRWV9909685A","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most of us think of Victorian England in terms of conformity, imperialism and industrialisation, but this view is extremely limited. In the last years, historians have succeeded in demonstrating that Victorianism was not monolithic at all. It also included undercurrents such as feminism, anti-imperialism, occultism. environmentalism and other ""isms"". Thus the stable world of Victorian England was seething with many and varied ideas and ideals.In this fascinating and almost thriller-like written book, Professor Bloom presents a great number of some very unusual, peculiar men and women who did not conform to the rules of the masses and whose norms were different from those of the majority. Some of them are known; some of them are not. Some were considered insane, some were dispatched to asylums, some became gurus for a while, and others had utopian dreams and schemes. Among those you wil find here Arthur Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, Richard Dadd and other madmen, Arthur Machen, Annie Besant, Charles Braudlaugh, Dan Chatterton, Aleister Crowley, John Hargrave and many others.Generally speaking, this is the history of how personal alienation and social revolution went(or didn't go) together during the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The people mentioned above wanted to shake the foundations of the stable Victorian world order, and the culmination of this was to be found in World War One, when modernism was progressing rapidly, tearing down all the conformities of the previous century.As Professor Bloom writes, Queen Victoria ""saw much, did nothing and said nothing, choosing, when convenient, to interfere in matters of lifestyle or of state, and to record her impressions in private journals'. To some, the old woman ruled for too long, causing England to freeze. However, even before her death, there were those who wanted a change. they rebelled against almost everything, and secularism was the religion of the intellectual mid-Victorians. Everything would be settled from now on by science and scientific methods, but there were those who despised science.Many have lost faith not only in God, but also in society itself, therefore they had to find other solutions to solve this problem. These included new diets, occultism, new utopian settlements, vegetarianism, nudism, while others looked to the East, to the Arab world or Hinduism to release them from the bourgeois desire and delusion. The city of God was to be replaced by the city of humanity.Darwinism solved nothing. Victoria's reign was haunted by rebels and revolutionaries. These are discussed in 19 chapters, each devoted to another aspect or angle. They include spiritualists, theosophists under the leadership of Madame Blavatsky, false Messiahs such as Joanna Southcott, socialists, the Fabian Society and its followers, anachists (some of them from Latvia) and emigres who came to England from Russia and other countries of the Continent, imperial adventurers, communists and many more. The old world order had to be blown into pieces, sometimes by violent means, sometimes by various pamphlets or writings. The revolutionary voices of the margins spoke against the center, a center seemingly so powerful as to be unshakeable.To quote, ""the Victorian and Edwardian periods saw the fermentation of ideas regarding the state of the self and the meaning of the state that had far-reaching consequences; whether they came from Oscar Wilde's invention of celebrity or T.E. Lawrence work for Arab nationalism, from Crowley's Temple of Thelema or from forgotten anarchists whose incendiary methods punctured the century, the age was dedicated to an ideology of the realisation of the future which would be realised in deed and thought as the only future"".In this nightmarish England, one could find escape or comfort in the inner world of the imagination, the world of self-consciousness, and Thomas De Quincey was to embody this trend. It was he who made the use of drugs respectable. Victorian morality was essentially based on personal and social restraint and a personality determined by restricion and guilt. If such restricions were breached, they might lead to indulgence and vulgarity. Having broken with society, the ego has nowhere to go except inward into a solipsistic and ever-neurotic search for the values beyond good and evil.People also wanted to return to a simpler life and reinvent themselves in natural surroundings, therefore John Ruskin's call to the workers to return to a healthy life of toil. Ruskin founded communities, workshops and workers' education schemes, but most failed.This book shows to what extent those outcasts had an influence on Victorian England, capturing the unrest bubbling under the surface the a strait-laced society. It is extremely well written and my only criticism is this: it lacks footnotes and some photos, although it contains a satisfactory bibliography. But all in all, this book is brilliant!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VI5Y24G3ZLIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230313825#wasThisHelpful","R3VI5Y24G3ZLIG","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is just excellent and extremely well- researched and balanced, offering its reader the opportunity to see the other, most unpleasant  and racist side of Churchill who was, in the eyes of his comtemporaries and in the eyes of Truman and Eisenhower, an anachronism of Victorian England. Churchill sustained two blunders: Gallipoli and Singapore. Though obstinate, he could not come to terms with the fact that already in the forties, his empire was disintegrating, and this process has gained additional momentum particularly after the end of WW2.The adjectives used by him to describe various colonial leaders were notorious, even horrendous.One is not even allowed to use them in this review. Almost everyone of those politicians was prone to be attacked by him, especially Ghandi. The Bengal famine could also be attributed to Churchill, although Mr. James does not say so specifically.Enter the second part of the book which deals with the special Anglo-American relationship. Here Mr. James offers a splendid analysis and his conclusion is that there were almost no smooth waters running between the two countries when coming to deal with the problem of freedom and imperialism. On the contrary, Roosevelt has always abhorred  the idea of British colonialism and made no bones about it.Each and every page of this book is a jewel and it is more than highly recommenced!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOPAN5N1S7MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0297869140#wasThisHelpful","R2TOPAN5N1S7MV","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These days only a handful men and women who are professional historians can interest and stimulate. The reasons vary, but I believe the main one is still the adage: Publish Or Perish.Thus most historians rush to publish books-histories or monographs-that are meant to be read by only some of their colleagues, in the hope of gaining some more kudos and perhaps earn some more points in order to advance at their respective departments.However, here comes Professor Fleming and proves that in spite of being a very erudite man  and one who is a famous Professor, he can also write for the masses a most enjoyable and readable book without any specific academic jargon.Indeed, this book is a gem and its purpose is to show that alonside the Enlightenment there was a Counter-Enlightenment, which contained many facets and elements. If one were to sum up the purpose of the anti-Enlightenment activists, one could easily say that those alchemists ,conmen, occultists and wizards wanted to attain a complete knowledge of everything.The book has many chapters about Contortionists, Kabbala, esoteric texts, weird persons, charlatans, writers, impostors, seances-you name it. You will meet many unknown figures and some very famous ones along the way.You will be in England, Germany, France and Italy and also in Egypt.Read this book and will get an insight into the mentality of some of the masses during the 17th to the early 19th century.

"Many books have already been written on almost every angle and aspect of the Roosevelt administration. This book takes a look at the Roosevelt years from the perspective of five men who went on fact-finding missions to Europe. Their assignment was to find out about various things, especially  those connected to England and its leadership. Roosevelt did not trust the State Department and thus had the opportunity to bypass it by sending these men to various countries.Although the book is an interesting read, it suffers from two very serious flaws. The first: it is only a collection of semi-detached biographies. The second: it leaves the reader to ponder about one question, which is as follows: so what?

"General Pacepa must be praised for being a very courageous man. In his capacity as chief of the Securitate, he had demolished the security sevices of an entire country, which was ruled by th  barbarous monster Nicolae Ceausescu. Now, with this new book, he demolishes some other myths perpetrated by the nefarious KGB with the aid of its main tool, namely that of disinformation.The book has several sections dealing with various instances in history. One myth which this book destroys has to do with Pope Pius 12. So far, many people were-and are still- convinced that the Pope has remained silent during the Holocaust and did nothing to help the Jews who were massacred by the Nazi hordes. This is a myth which was well concocted by the Russians who did everything they could in order to besmirch the Catholic Church and its clergymen. In fact, the truth is that the Pope has done more than enough in order to help the Jews and Pacepa offers a very good explanation as to how this disinformation propaganda against the Pope's image came into being.Another interesting chapter has to do with the Kennedy murder. Kennedy was murdered by Lee Oswald, obeying an order from the Kremlin. No other evidence has been produced so far to counter this evidence. But there are still those who have pleasure in perpetuating the myth that the CIA and even  other US high officials have been reponsible for the assassination.Another part discusses in detail the anti-Semitic propaganda sown by the Kremlin and the Putin regime as well as the modus operandi against Islam and to what extent Russian propaganda is used against the Obama presidency.This is an excellent book, written in conjunction with Professor Richlak, and is packed with information nuggets on each page. This is mandatory reading for those who want to know and mainly understand how monstrous regimes produce propaganda campaigns whose aim is to falsify the truth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB6KLB0WRRC6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936488604#wasThisHelpful","RB6KLB0WRRC6W","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start the review by quoting a sentence which is to be found in the epilogue: "" The purpose of this book has been to strip away the posthumous glamour and to bring alive the true genius of Disraeli"".Indeed, the purpose of both authors has been achieved and they have done a very good job. The introduction is followed by eleven chapters, each dealing with another aspect of Disraeli. The book is written in chronological order and is a pleasure to read, due to the fact that the language is very vivid and the authors not only inform but also entertain their readers.Who was Disraeli? What is the reason that his personality is still fascinating others? In what way was he special? All these points are discussed in detail, although the volume is very short.Disraeli was a very complicated man. He was full of paradoxes and his deeds and personality still evoke a lot of controversies, in spite of the fact that previous authors had already written and covered any possible angle of his long life.Disraeli's main purpose in life was to become famous. Politics was the best and shortest way for him. But this was not enough. He was also seeking for constant excitement and, as the authors point out, this ""could not be achieved in the solicitors' office where his father had secured him a place at the start of his career"". Nor was it enough to enter the literary profession. Almost all his life in debt, Disraeli's name was soon known to everyone. He was a great womanizer who courted mainly married  and older women, perhaps due to the fact that his mother mother did not bestow upon him sufficient love. He finally decided to marry a woman twelve years older than him. Her name was Mary Anne and Disraeli remarked that she was more like a mistress than a wife. She would later die of stomach cancer and Disraeli never married again.He had many friends but also many enemies, the main one being Gladstone who was called by him ""the Arch-Enemy. His other bitter rival was Robert Peel.On the other hand, Disraeli became the darling of Queen Victoria, because he very well knew how to flatter her.We are informed that there are eighty-eight quotations by him in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, compared to only fifty by Churchill.He was the first Jewish  Prime Minister and it was he who established the foundations of the Conservative Pary. Although baptized, he had never forgotten his Jewish  roots and was extremely proud of this fact.He presided over many social reforms and scored a famous triumph at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, thus enhancing British prestige. Disraeli despised the liberals and the middle-class values. As a matter of fact, he was far from being progressive and wanted to revive but improve the old ways of doing things.Both authors bemoan the fact that a figure like Disraeli is missing from today's politics. They mention the fact that he used his imagination tp make politics interesting. The public was fascinated with his speeches in the Commons. As Lord Curzon put it later on, Disraeli ""was like a conjuror on a platform whose audience with open mouths awaited the next trick"". And this is precisely  the problem the authors identify with today's politicians.The authors dispel many myths surrounding Disraeli, such as the phrase ""One Nation"" which, they claim, was never used by him. In fact, much of the book is devoted to the mythology of Disraeli and the reasons it has been growing over the years after his death. We therefore have two lives of him, the real one and the mythological one.The book, which is a fresh look at one of the greatest British Prime Ministers , is extremely well-researched and also a great pleasure to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R344259E2WOUKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0297860976#wasThisHelpful","R344259E2WOUKX","A1IH4ZQ0R434X7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH4ZQ0R434X7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is perhaps the best book that has ever been written on the Vietnam war, documenting the most hideous crimes perpetrated by the USA army against innocent civilians. It is just enough to give one example from the hundreds listed in this brilliant book. The son of General Patton, who was part of the US army, kept on his desk a skull and many other body parts of Vietnamese civilians who were brutally murdered by the American troops. Like father, like son, for his father was the one who in 1943 slapped the face of some soldiers who suffered from battle fatigue.This book will make you sick but at last we have an almost complete picture of what had really happened in Vietnam. But one should not only blame the army. One should consider Johnson, Nixon, Mcnamara and especially Kissinger as war criminals, since there is no difference between them and the Nazis who faced the judges  at Nuremberg.

"The name of Dr. Clemens Benda does not say much to many people. Benda emigrated from Germany during Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s and would become one of the most respected doctors in the United States. However, this respected physician was in fact a monster who was responsible for injecting radiation into children's bodies in order to see its effect on the very young. These experiments were conducted at the MIT with the help of other facilities and in this respect he was not alone. Some children aged between one and eleven years old, who were found at various institutions, were given other lethal doses of radioactive iodine, while this time the project was being coordinated by researchers from Harvard Medical School and the Boston University School of Medicine. Some of these miserable children suffered from Down syndrome and other forms of mental retardation. All this happened during the forties when the Cold War was played out between the major powers. One of the sponsors of these experiments was the CIA. One of its physicians informed a class of recruits in the 1960,""Our guiding light is not the Hippocratic Oath but the victory of freedom"". It was clear that the USA had fallen behind the Soviets with regard to its chemical warfare capability and the immediate need to come up to speed in preparation for some future enemy attack. It was also equally clear that research scientists ""could not fulfill this mission by animal experiments alone. Human test subjects would be needed; fortunately, most experienced reserchears already knew where to look for volunteers"". Nearly seven dozen institutions took CIA money 'many of them for the purpose of plying American citizens with hallucinogenic cocktails and more"".One American neurologist, Walter Freeman, would become a leading figure and a specialist in carrying out lobotomies on children.  He was a disciple of Egas Moniz, a Portuguese physician who proselytized the attributes of lobotomy in the fight against a variety of psychological disorders. Freeman once performed lobotomies on 25 women in one day. Ergo, if lobotomies could produce improvements in adults with serious mental problems, it could do the same for children. Hundreds of lobotomies were performed on a vast array of patients including ""11 individuals whose schizophrenia developed before the age of ten"".Other feebleminded children or idiots placed in American orphanages were also subject to various and hideous experiments-all conducted in the name of scientific progress. This was the extension of the eugenic movement ideology which ran wild during the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th.This book demonstrates the huge hypocrisy of the American scientific establishment. On the one hand, it criticized heavily the atrocious deeds committed by the Nazis, as has been shown by the Nazi trials after the war. On the other hand, the same critics perpetrated almost the same crimes, but this time their motivation was the Cold War ideology.Some doctors wanted to conduct clinical trials and were motivated by noble causes, but others were motivated by greed and fame. By behaving in this way, they forgot or gave up their Hippocratic Oath and routinely trafficked in children to operationalize some bit of medical research. The guinea pigs were poor children who were given tests to see how vaccines worked; in what way radioactive foods had an influence on the body, and  some were even injected with LSD. Others were subjected to lobotomies and electric shock treatments.If you thought that at the beginning of the 21st century things like the ones described before stopped, you are wrong. As the authors point out, American institutions have been replaced by China, India, Tunisia and Nigeria as sites for Phase One drug studies. Drug firms now travel to ""places where regulation is virtually nonexistent, the FDA  does not reach, and the mistakes can end up in pauper's graves"".To tell the truth, this book will make you sick. It becomes a burden on the reader and it shows to what extent the most noble and respected scientists and doctors became monsters. This book is about science gone absolutely mad and the authors have written an excellent book documenting for many years the horrible deeds committed in the name of scientific progress. This book can also serve as a severe warning of how a respected community of men and women can go mad when nobody controls them. It is about moral amnesia and ethical paralysis of those in the medical and psychological reaerch professions who became totally perverted.

For a patch this expensive I'd expect a little bit better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6JIQUSA58WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKEEKI6#wasThisHelpful","RU6JIQUSA58WD","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the original banana slicer in order to cut my banana up and found that I was unable to get through the peel. I ended up returning it and purchasing this one. I figured two banana slicers would double the slicing power, however I suffered mixed results. I looked online and found out I needed a Hutzler Banana Peeler 621q to use in tandem with the slicer 571b. I wish they would just package them together. It's how they rope you in, first you buy the slicer only to realize you need the peeler. I'm currently saving up for the Hutzler Banana Masticator 821h. The banana is not going to chew itself, is it?","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T6CSFEASLLDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXVWW8I#wasThisHelpful","R2T6CSFEASLLDW","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this cover shortly after purchasing my samsung galaxy tab 3 and wanting to protect my tablet. I'd prefer to get something nicer, but I really haven't found anything that fits my tastes within my price range yet. I can say the product works. It holds the tablet and protects it. It allows you to stand the tablet up as well, however, it does not do a good job the this. All it gives is a small cloth crevice for the tablet to sit on, and it's not deep or sturdy enough to keep the tablet upright while doing anything above light tapping on the screen. Don't expect to be able to type on the tablet with this case holding it up.The case falls apart pretty quickly as well. The case still works, and although the plastic ring that holds the back to the fold over part together ripped apart, I was able to put it back together and it hasn't ripped apart again. The edges where the case folds is cracked from age. Furthermore, there are several chunks on every edge where the green has worn away to the plasticy black underneath. This is only with about 4 months of wear and tear here. So this doesn't really hold up too well.Surprisingly, the black strap that allows you to close the case totally has held up. I would have expected that to stretch out to uselessness or rip very quickly, and so far its held, so that is nice. Two other issues with it, first, it covers up the Infrared port, so if you like to use it as a remote when your in bed and lazy, you'll have to pull it out of the case. Secondly, if you really drop your tablet while the strap isn't on, it's about a 50/50 whether the tablet jumps out of the case and goes teetering off. So it will protect normal wear and tear, and if you remember to close your case when you walk around it's fine, but during use when it's open, the case can potentially not protect the tablet at all.Anyway, with all that, I think 3 stars is fair. It's cheap and it's still the case I am using. Short of the otterbox, which doesn't make a 10.1 tab3 for some reason, Its good enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FLRRPXGI3M4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6TY8V8#wasThisHelpful","R2FLRRPXGI3M4B","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second massage table I've ever purchased and I honestly have no real complaints. It is stable and light enough for my needs. My wife and I simply use it at home to pamper each other and it has worked fine for that. We weigh in the 300 lbs range and haven't come into any problems as long as we are careful getting on.The previous similarly priced ($100 shipped) massage table I purchased didn't have the arms and consisted of a metal bottom. In some ways I like the wood legs better than the metal. The ""height"" adjustment knobs on each leg isn't easy to adjust, but it seems slightly easier than my previous massage table. The arms on the sides fit with cheap wooden dowels as well, one of which is difficult to slide in because it's blocked by the handles that allow you to pick up the table when it's folded, but once again that is a minor thing.Finally, there is a bit of chemical smell that I get from it. I haven't made a major attempt to completely clean the table with something to counteract the smell, so I can't say how badly it prevails, however, it is less overpowering than many other cheap products I've purchased before.All in all, it's a nice, professional looking table. It serves the purpose I keep it for and that's really all I can hope for from it for the price spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCBCQTJBHBCV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YB0AHQ#wasThisHelpful","RCBCQTJBHBCV0","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With kids I had two requirements for getting a TV stand. First, it had to be flush with the floor so I wouldn't have to dig out all of the stuff my kids drop there. Second, I wanted glass/plastic across the front so I could use remote controls but keep my devices in relative safety from my kids. The Tv stand met these criteria perfectly.I should have read the finer print a little closer, as it ended up being a bit smaller than I had expected. I suppose it's my fault for mistaking this with it's larger cousin that is frequently sold at Walmart. However, at the price they sell it for, I was a little disappointed. It's really quite small and not worth more than $100. Still, it does what I wanted it to. The cinnamon cherry color comes off as close to black. Except in a very light home it will probably appear very dark in color.There is assembly required. I was able to assemble it fairly easily. Oddly, the way it's assembled only makes it flush with the ground on 3 of the four sides. In the back, it has no piece, so the entire tv stand rests on only 3 sides. It was not a big deal, but still a little strange. Furthermore, the stand I received turned out to have other issues. One of the edges was unfinished. It is not noticeable when fully assembled unless you open the glass doors, but it is still a mistake and I am certain not a result of something I did wrong in assembly.Other than that, the TV stand seems to work fine for a TV stand. I would probably not have boughten this if given a second chance, but I can make due and it is OK.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31M5K30SH77YX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R9VPKW#wasThisHelpful","R31M5K30SH77YX","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's benefits, bigger than average letters and bright yellow coloring is very apparent. It clearly meets both of these needs, which is the primary purpose of this keyboard. It has the clickity clacky keys rather than the soft kind, so don't expect typing to be ""quiet"". For some reason, they decided to make the delete key much smaller in exchange for a slightly larger enter key, which seems counter intuitive to the point of the ez eyes portion of the keyboard.One of the reasons I went for the keyboard was the claim to being spill resistant. This was a complete hoax. As a matter of fact, this broke down more easily than previous keyboards. A single spill, not directly on the keyboard, completely decimated it. A completely false claim. It also lacks the finger divots at F and J for guidance when performing ""proper"" typing, another thing that I'd expect from a keyboard designed to make keyboarding easier.Other than that, it works like any other keyboard. If it fits the aesthetics of your home or if you have bad eyes and need it, this can be a functional keyboard for you, but it's claims are a little exaggerated. It's like every other cheap keyboard except it has yellow keys and bigger bold letters. It loses a star for the spill resistance claim, and it loses a star for the delete key being smaller.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Z42WQUFVM0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZSV9XM#wasThisHelpful","R18Z42WQUFVM0N","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently started playing Bully Scholarship edition on the xbox 360 and found the game to be an enjoyable experience. I did not have the pleasure of having played the original so I cannot compare it to that. I have however played GTA4, GTA3 through San Andreas, and many other open boxes like it, so I can compare it to those.Graphics: The graphics are not top notch, but I have no real complaint here. They are adequate and don't detract from the game experience. I can tell that things are what they are, there are no creepy disfigured heads like you might see in a bethesda game, so it is good enough for me.Gameplay: The gameplay is very similar to what you might face in San Andreas. The ""scope"" of the game has certainly been peeled back substantially. The only vehicles that you can use are bicycles, skateboards, and mopeds. The handling isn't great, but you won't be thrown off at every turn with half of your life gone like the GTAs. The university combines with several little towns to make the map you can travel around on, and in Traditional GTA fashion, the map gets unlocked 1/3 at a time as you play. They add emoticons allowing you to interact with people in your environment. This is quite nice, allowing you to grab and bully people, harass them, approve, or threaten them. It's reminiscent of the Fable series in that respect and does very well.Story: This is a major faltering for me. The story is essentially about a troubled boy sent off to a ""boarding school"" of sorts while his mom goes on a honeymoon with his new step dad. He possesses a lot of angst as a result of his rough upbringing. Through the help of a boy named gary, he ends up getting involved in clique wars. All of this is interesting and fine. What isn't is the cohesion in this story. Hint, it has none. Pretty much every mission in the game involves you being called to someones office, an event that happens completely off camera with no beepers/cellphones/text messages to tell you why you are going to this spot and starting this mission, or they occur as a result of you randomly walking by and getting pulled into something.In GTA games, it's usually a natural progression of things. Missions you do for this guy causes you to meet the next guy who in turn introduces you to the next guy. And when a friend you haven't quested for in a while wants to meet up, they send you a text, beep, ect... and say something. In this game, you just wonder to each other checkpoints, often based on time. All and all, the complete lack of cohesion really hurts and otherwise great story.Timing: This is a major gripe with the game, the day/night cycles. The first thing that is frustrating is that many many missions are timed based, so you can seriously be stuck for 4-5 hours (game time) waiting for a mission to repop up so you can do it. During the day you are required to attend classes, doing so prompts great bonuses and not doing so gets people searching for you for being truant. Then, you have a few hours and then you are up passed curfew and violating that. But wait, there is more. Assuming you are fine having to constantly dodge the teachers and cops, you will simply pass out unconscious if you stay up any later than 2ish. Prompting you to have to race back to a bed less you collapse in the street. Which is fine if sleeping in a bed saved the game as it should, but it doesn't. So to recap, about 3/4 of the day you are ""breaking the rules"" and will be chased down by anyone who sees you, and you pretty much HAVE to go to the bed every night for no reason other than cause you have to. The ONLY way to save is by logging it in a book near the bed, so no autosaves after missions.Glitches: I don't really care about visual glitches, and so far my game has never frozen completely, but even now, on the newest xbox system, on a hard drive installed version of the game, with all of the patches they have done over the years, the game still has significant slow down issues. This is especially frustrating during the dozens of minigames the game offers, I've had it happen during rhythm based games and completely lost as a result.Minigames: Loads and loads of them. It's one of the main things that GTA4 lost and I am glad this place kept. There are tons and tons of minigames, from ""mowing the grass"" to arcade games to dodge ball. They are all simplistic and I can't say any of them are as time consuming or engaging as Blitzball from FFX, but they are all mildly amusing and I don't think I was sick of any of them by the time the game was over.Other Annoyances: The other annoyances is that most of the other weapons you can get don't really do much. You'll be finding yourself always using the slingshot with it's infinite ammo, as the eggs are limited, the itching powder and stink bombs are practically useless, the firecrackers can occasionally help on a surprise, but once an enemy is running after you it is basically pointless, you will never get enough distance from them to really make use of it. So all and all the many options you can wield only come to play when filling specific mission criteria. Another annoyance is the shear number of people that run up to you demanding that you ""help"" them. A few is fine, but it's almost as annoying as the cellphone from GTA4, and you'll quickly find yourself ignoring them and their constant pleas for help, especially with a day so limited in time, where doing what they ask means missing out on your class/mission.The final ""annoyance"" comes down to the lack of replayability. In the GTAs, it used to be fun going crazy and ending up with 6 stars while you outrun/avoid swat trucks, tanks, and the army; or trying to make crazy leaps, or jumping out of an airplay and going sky diving. You get none of that here. You are just a single guy with fists, and if you warrant stars you either run and hide or face the consequences. Very little options in the ways of mayham here, and very little worth doing other than to acquire the 100% achievements.Overall: So overall it's a good game. It gets 3 stars for the complaints I have with it, but it still has a good story, fun gameplay, and some unique things. The social aspects and the capacity to bully people is really fun, and a feature I wish they'd add to GTA. The story and play is very unique and with the number of minigames it has it is well worth a try. I would definitely consider it if you can get it for cheap, but I wouldn't spend more than $10 on it at this point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16W0XQ5JRR2QQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WPXQSQ#wasThisHelpful","R16W0XQ5JRR2QQ","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had purchased Xcom UFO Defense many years ago back when it was first released. In fact, it was one of the first video games I had ever beat. I continued playing with Terror in the Deep and even tried Interceptor during it's time. These games are strategy games. You are an elite group of soldiers battling back an unknown alien enemy that threatens earth and every government. Using government funding, you purchase supplies, build a base, shoot down ufos, land at the sites and mop up any survivors, then take their technology, research it, and build better weapons to rinse and repeat.Every level is a little different. The ufo crash sites are randomly generated and you function via turn based combat, using statistics to make your shots and cover to block theirs. The game is a clever mixture of inventory management, turn based strategy, with a little bit of base building thrown in. Some of you may  have heard about Xcom Enemy Unknown, essentially a remake/reboot of the original, and while I am excited to see that coming, it will be hard to beat the original.Anyway, this is a great game package and easily one of my favorites. The graphics are incredibly dated, so do not expect pretty sprites (think preNES), but for all 5 games this is a great package.The download process is performed through steam. I only mention this because of several one star reviews I noticed. Steam is an online gaming management program offered (and required) through valve... and is ""the"" way most people buy games these days. Complaining about it's existence is kind of like complaining how you have to rent games through netflix or redbox because all of the blockbusters are disappearing. Sure you CAN complain about it, but it isn't going to change anything. This game CANNOT be played on any modern computer without some significant skill using DOSBOX and modded installation files. Steam, and other sites like it, are pretty much one of the few ways to play this game now a days (plus the hard copy of these games run $100+).So a great game if you can get passed the fact that it uses the modern convention of steam and is an old old dated game. However, certain games; FF6, Civilization 2, Super Mario Brothers 3; seem to survive the tests of time and I definitely see these as being part of those games. I of course speak mostly about UFO Defense and Terror of the Deep... the other three games never really did it for me, but they are extra gravy for those who love this IP and still worth the price of admission.I also should add I was able to pick it up for $2.99 during a sale, and you can purchase it for $14.99 regularly at most places. If you absolutely hate steam, I'd recommend heading over to gamer's gate to get it, since it uses a ""less unified"" system to download your games. I actually already own the game and deliberately repurchased it so that I had it on steam with the rest of my games, but that's all just down to personal preference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRHI8FVIF71L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00846E6X4#wasThisHelpful","RRHI8FVIF71L4","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife purchased this apron in for the Kitchen because she occasionally works with things messy enough to require it and thought it would be fun to have. As it turns out, it's a pretty decent Apron. It's made out of a good strong material, rather than something cheap and flimsy. The print is as depicted, so if you like the print I see no reason you shouldn't like the apron. Its a good size, so if you are a plus size woman it should fit fine as well.

"I had an old N64 for that we decided we wanted to get up and running for my son. We thought it would be a good way to get him to use a system a little simpler than the xbox 360 to move his way up. We previously found he didn't like the Wii... and we sold it besides. So the N64 is what we got.The cord I received was broken. The audio played, but the video would not. Since the system hadn't been up in running in years, we weren't sure if it was the system or the cord. Instead of sending a replacement, as I expected, they wanted to send us a refund, which seemed more effort than it was worth for a $2 refund. So in the end I ended up buying one from someone else on ebay.The cord works as expected for an N64... presuming you get a working one. It is a cheaply made cord and probably a bit shorter (only 3 feet), as most cords were back in the day, so take that into account. If ours had arrived working, I probably would have given it four stars. The other star is taken off simply because it is composite, short, and cheaply made, but if you have an N64... this is what you need to get it working.As a side note, you can plug a composite cable into a component. Simply plug the yellow prong into the components green and it ""usually"" works. So if that's a concern of yours, it can be done with most TVs, even if you don't have enough composite inputs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFIPQ715E7YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DS6LRC#wasThisHelpful","R1HFIPQ715E7YU","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father needs reading glasses these days and typically purchases them in bulk at the dollar store, tossing a pair away whenever he breaks it. That has always worked for him, but I decided it would be nice to get him a better pair, especially since he seems to be using them more often than he used to.There isn't too much to say about the Magnivision Hyperflexx. One of the ideal things about it is that it comes at the strength of 2.25, which turned out to be my father's newest prescription. 2.25 is a harder to find number at your typical department store kiosk, where 2.00 and 2.50 seem to be the only numbers available. My father had to settle for a 2.00 because he couldn't find the 2.25, so first off it was nice to be able to find a set that was his prescription.The lens are a thin plastic; unobtrusive and nice looking. They are not too large as to look ridiculous and are actually a tad smaller than I would have thought from the picture. However, they do seem to match up to the picture pretty well in appearance.The final thing to mention would be the frames themselves. By Hyperflexx, I am sure most people are thinking in the back of their heads that it is a frame with memory metal like the flexon brand where you can wrap them around your finger and have them snap back into place. These are a cheap knock off and I doubt they are really memory metal despite the claim. Now, I wasn't going to put the frames to the test and risk breaking my father's birthday present, but I did play with it slightly. The frames do have a certain degree of ""give"". You can bend them a bit and they will retain their shape, but bend too much and you will bend the metal. So they seem to be made more from a ""pliable"" metal more than a ""memory"" metal. Still, they are the best available if you are not interested in buying a $100 pair of reading glasses with full price frames, and could probably survive you accidentally sitting on them (which I believe is how my dad loses most of his reading glasses).So to sum it up, they are a cheap knock off of the flexon brand that flex to an extent. They come in prescription sizes not easily found in a store and of a better quality than most. A great purchase for someone who needs reading glasses and doesn't want to break the bank, but still want something a little better than your kiosk variety glasses at your local walgreens.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EN2WHQO21X28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LQKIAU#wasThisHelpful","R3EN2WHQO21X28","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You'll find numerous reviews talking about how this product was manufactured many years ago, and the rechargeable batteries that make it up have since expired. I trust this is true as I had trouble finding a pink remote at the time that I wanted one, so they seem to be out of make. The price at $4.99 which is $5 less than most of the other batteries reflects the potential that it may not work.In the end, I decided to chance it both because I didn't have too much to spend, and had a pink remote without a matching rechargeable battery. I suppose I ended up lucky, as the battery charges fine and holds a charge for as long as I'd expect. Is it worst than one I purchased brand new from a store? Maybe, but if there has been any discrepancy I haven't noticed it yet.It is the normal microsoft xbox battery still in the original packaging and it costs me half of what any other color would cost me. I have no regrets purchasing this product, but I do acknowledge that had I been one of the unlucky ones that uncovered a dud I might not feel that way. In the end, you will have to decide if the risk is worth it.

It accomplishes it's job pretty well.It can be very messy with the destruction left behind, but I suppose you can expect that from a toy designed to be destroy.Here's the warning I provide.

So if you know your bird is a light chewer, then this might be a nice toys to rebuy whenever the last one is gone.

"I have a Debryan Parakeet and wanted to give her a way to eat that utilizes her foraging instinct. The foraging sphere looked like it would accomplish this.Like many bird toys, the forage sphere feels pretty homemade. In order to open it to put food in it, you have generic nuts that you unscrew, then pull the entire metal bar out to pull apart the plastic. I can't say it's the most innovative or effective system. You have pull out the entire sphere, pull it completely apart, then put it back together every time you need to do a food fill.The holes themselves are pretty large, and there is a fairly limited selection of items that would be a good fit. We found millet sticks do not work well, as it gets pushed up and becomes out of the birds reach. We found that most of the seed based foods we give her would simply fall right through the cracks. I think that most fruits and vegetables would be a pain, particularly as I expect the moisture from said vegetables would rust the metal component over time.As a result the best food I have found to effectively use the sphere are nuts. Peanuts work great, but most kind of nuts (still in the shells) seem to work well for this system.The Kabobbed food in the picture is a suggestion and I suppose you could spear something to put up there, but you run into two issues. First, you have the loop on one side and the bell on another, so spearing any food would require you to remove the bell. Second you still have the concern that the fruits you could spear would rust the metal over time.For my bird, she typically uses the system by hanging from the ceiling and munching on it from above with her head wrapped around the ball. The issue is, since the entire assembly is put together by a bolt that you are expected to rebolt and unbolt every time you want to add food, it can vary easily unscrew. More than once my bird has sent the toy plunging to the bottom of her cage.So does my bird like it? I suppose it's an innovative way to give her nuts. I would probably buy it again if I had to, but it does have it's faults. It feels (and looks) very handmade. The drillhole the metal bar goes through has microcracks coming from it like it was a poor job. The whole thing is assembled by universal nuts and bolts. But it is still a decent system. I give it 3 stars, because it's decent at what it does, and because I didn't expect that much from it. The bird seems to like it (or at least the nuts in it) and it gives her something to do during the day when she is in the mood.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NWCX76UB747/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001MWZF7S#wasThisHelpful","R16NWCX76UB747","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The following item is a Gender Prediction Test, and I was naturally interested in taking a closer look at it. Some people argue that is it 100% correct 50% of the time, declaring that it randomly picks a specific sex, and that it is always right with half the people who buy it. This is not how the test works at all.In reality, the test is a scientific analysis of a wive's tale. The wive's tale is this, A person with acidic urine theoretically is more likely to carry a girl, where as a more alkaline or basic urine would mean you are carrying a boy. This test just boils down to a significantly overpriced set of litmus paper, which you can buy here at amazon for $2 or so.Urine is typically considered a 7.0 in pH, ranging from slightly basic to slightly acidic, where seven is roughly the same as water. If your strip reads in the 8 or 9 range, the wive's tale suggests it should be a boy. If it reads 6 range, the wife's tale should suggest it's a girl. If you are REALLY on top of things, you can take the readings BEFORE you get pregnant to establish a baseline, and then see whether it is higher or lower when you actually get pregnant.However, in the end, I must point out that this IS a wive's tale, and nothing more than a fancy way of practicing the dozens of other inaccurate ways to predict if it's a boy or girl from peeing on baking soda to heartbeat speed to where it sits in the uterus. The only accurate way to tell the sex of a baby is by ultrasound, and even that's not 100%, the error spawning from that pesky human element.So save yourself $20 and buy the $2 litmus paper if you are looking to have a little fun ""trying"" to predict the gender of the baby, but if the color coding and plastic casing are enough to motivate you to spend the extra money, you are welcome to it.I'd recommend for the most accurate readings to restrain yourself to a very bland diet a day or two before trying the test, don't want a glass of orange juice or a spicy chipotle potentially effecting the pH of your urine and giving your test a ""false"" result.Good luck with the Pregnancy! The ultrasound says mine is a girl, and 75% of the wive's tales pointed to girl, so you never know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCE7T4CE7AE59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YT6KEO#wasThisHelpful","RCE7T4CE7AE59","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you don't feel like reading what I wrote, I put the pro's and con's at the end of this review. I have recently been eating healthier and one of the many changes was to give up soda and sugary drinks and dedicate myself to the art of tea. As much fun as it is to constantly brew tea with the coffee machine, I really wanted something that did it a better job producing ice tea, and after much looking I found it here.There is a rather limited number of ice tea makers at the consumer level, I've tried just about all of them. My parents are big tea drinkers and have had a pitcher of tea always made since I was born. One of the main things I was looking for was a ""universal"" tea brewer. In other words, one that does not require the pitcher to function. I found that with this ice tea maker, which offers a drip function that you can be used with any pitcher you want.So far, this is a great tea maker and I love it for most of it's properties. The pitcher has measuring aids on the side, and a screw on top that functions as both the brewing top and serving top. This tea maker consists of three cups with handles that fit together within it's main compartment. The first cup handles ""loose tea"", which is absolutely perfect as I recently switched to loose tea (as it contains more of the health benefits than processed tea bags). Having a compartment specifically designed for it is wonderful.The second compartment contains the area you would put tea bags. Finally, the third compartment underneath those first two contains where you would put a sweetener. The first thing I need to mention is that this is NOT a sweet tea maker. For those of you who don't know, sweet tea is tea with insane amounts of sugar in it. So if you are expecting to dump cups of sugar into this machine and expect it all to trickle down and mix perfectly, it won't happen. In fact, I expect the machine to clog and flood, accounting to half of these one star reviews.This machine is designed to make iced tea, not sweet tea, so while it contains a compartment for sugar, you are only expected to add a couple tablespoons to give it a sugar accent. I personally use honey, and it works splendidly with no clean up after. I imagine if you are creative you could also use berries, mint, or other fruits if you wanted to add a hint of another flavor.All three compartments easily slip out, allowing you to actually clean every part of the filter. The issue with this is if you don't put every piece back perfectly, I can see it becoming a leak disaster. The tea tastes good, the brewing is quick, and this ice tea maker takes up a lot less space than most of the other brands out there.The tea maker isn't perfect though. There are three issues I had with it. The first issue is that when filling the water basin with water, there is no indicator of how full you should fill it or whether it is full. You are required to keep pouring until you see the water rising and pray you don't overflow. There is an indicator on the pitcher which you can use as a guide.The second issue is that this tea maker is designed to brew everything then mix with copious amounts of ice. It's kind of designed to make ""instant"" ice tea. This means the tea it brews is relatively less strong (relative to the coffee maker). Mind you, the coffee maker tea needs to be diluted down. I don't feel that the tea from the Westbend needs to be diluted down at all... although it gets a little bit of dilution from all of the ice you are expected to add.The third and final issue is that the pitcher top is designed to receive the tea (through holes on the top), but those holes are always there. So when you switch from brewing to serving, you have a pitcher with a lid that has enough holes that it might as well not be covered at all. I know a normal pitcher doesn't exactly make a airtight seal, but I still like the comfort that hair, dust, bugs, and ""fridge smell"" are at least being blocked a little by a pitcher, and this gives none of that comfort.So I give this a 4 star review because I think it's the best ice tea maker I have bought to date, but it still has a few issues, enough to knock the ice tea maker down a star.Pros:-Takes up less space than most teamakers.-Can use any pitcher you can fit under it to brew.-Has a unique compartment for adding sweeteners/flavor enhancers.-Can disassemble entire brewing compartment for cleaning.-Includes a loose tea basket-Makes tea immediately, no need to dilute or mix with water(presuming you have the amount of ice it asks for)Cons:-Brews a weaker tea than it could.-Has no indicator when filling the water basin.-Pitcher top provides insufficient protection to external elements.-Can only put a small amount of sweetener in sweetener tray or it won't absorb.-It can't make sweet tea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P8A96X3C4MK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036WS1FU#wasThisHelpful","R2P8A96X3C4MK5","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife purchased these dryer balls for Christmas and I personally don't know much about the alleged things that dryer balls can do for you. My clothing doesn't really suffer from static cling. I imagine fluffiness is a pretty subjective term and the type of cloths you use, temperature of the water, detergent, and softener all effect the fluffiness of your clothing far before a couple of balls.The reason we purchased these balls is because our dryer isn't the greatest, we tend to load it up with clothing, and occasionally some of that clothing gets knotted up or stuck in other pieces of clothing (sheets, towels, ect...) causing the material to stay wet. The natural agitation of the machine is insufficient for all of the clothing to dry completely some times.In comes these balls, which add greater agitation and help keep clothing knocked apart, as a result the clothing dries faster and more efficiently. For someone who uses autodry with a sensor, this might even save you energy. You might even be able to have shorter dry cycles, which considering that drying is the slowest step of doing laundry, is a definite plus.I give it 5 stars because these are cheap, plastic balls that go in your dryer. I don't know why anyone who expects miraculous changes to their wash and I can't imagine one companies dryer balls functioning better or worse than another (unless it actually causes real damage to the washer, which this one doesn't seem to so far.)So for the capability of dryer balls and a price of only $5, I say it's a 5 star product, as it does exactly what a dryer ball does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXSU8H81KG1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TMLF5K#wasThisHelpful","R3OXSU8H81KG1L","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Sony Walkman mp3 player which I love to use. To me, it runs superior to any modern ipod or ipod touch. The one problem with it is the lack of internal Bluetooth.I actually use my mp3 player a lot at work. However, the cords often got caught on things I was working with or on clothing and more than once I suffered my mp3 player crashing to the floor or headphones being ripped out of my ears. My goal was simply to prevent this by happening by purchasing both the Blubridge here and a pair of bluetooth headphones. The bluebridge will plug into anything with the appropriately sized audio jack.The device uses bluetooth. For anyone still questioning what bluetooth is, the easiest way to describe it is the USB of wireless. It's simply wireless connection that tends to be very stable and more importantly uninterrupted by most other signals (like wireless phones). If you have a computer or TV, and are looking for a wireless solution, there are better options out there for you. For a simple mp3 player, this seemed like my best and only option.So how does it function? Well enough. I use it all day at work, and after letting it charge over night, it remains functional for about 6-7 hours of continuous use. It plugs into the mp3 player well and feels sturdy and reliable. It seems to work better when on a stable nonmoving surface (as opposed to your pocket) and will cut out sometimes when in the pocket. It also seems to have trouble functioning outdoors, as sometimes while I am outside it will become unusable. The range doesn't handle corner at all, so if there is a wall between you and it, the signal cuts. Range seems to be roughly 20 feet, give or take.My biggest complaint about the blubridge is that it's design is too simple. You only get one button for on/off and connect. It constantly flashes it's LED light when on, and there is literally no indication of it's battery life is up until a red warning light comes on, only occasionally.On the plus side, it does transmit signal well, and when I am listening to my music or audio books, it is clear and good.So I give the device 3 stars. I might consider 3.5 but I think it just falls short for me. Considering you still need to buy the blutooth headset in order to use this device, it is a bit pricy and simplistic for a $30 item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VH2I3ZQHAVYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HHLOWC#wasThisHelpful","R2VH2I3ZQHAVYQ","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cheap affordable grill set for two. I can't say I was overly impressed by the quality of the tools it came with. The bag is quite small and portable when zipped up, great for taking to the park or a grill-out, however zipping it up is pretty awkward as the bag has one zipper to pretty much do the job of two.The brush is standard hair bristles, so once you use them a handful of times that is about it. The rest of the tools are sturdy enough to use, and will probably hold together a couple of years, but if you are a heavy griller you will probably want something else.I am content with it for what it was, a cheap, easily portable grill set so that we have something to work with. It's compact case might make it perfect for campers and light grillers, but anyone serious about grilling should probably avoid it. If it was more expensive or I was bigger into grilling, I might have given it a 3 star, but I am pretty content with it for what I expected at $10, so I give it a 4 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SV95VN4BSTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055FSE1C#wasThisHelpful","R39SV95VN4BSTB","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Avenir Velcro seat bag works well for it's intended purpose. It attaches, holds well, and will carry your things. I give a three star simply because it is much much smaller than I expected it to be. The pictures available, at least to me, are very misleading. I expected the bag to be about twice it's actually size, but upon receiving it, realized it is actually very small.At best, the bag will hold particularly small things, like keys, or a cellphone. If you expect it to hold larger things (in my case, I wanted it to be able to hold my bag lunch), I believe it would prove to be insufficient.Just be careful when you are looking at the size, 106 cubic inches is not as large as it sounds. I can't imagine, being as this claims to be the ""large"" size, how small a small size would be. I knock off two stars because of the size, but not any more because that is partially my responsibility to ensure the item is big enough.Other than that, it feels sturdy and functional, so there is not much else you can say about a bag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1STA435Q4LLL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00165P4X6#wasThisHelpful","R1STA435Q4LLL8","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought it might prove beneficial for people to read a review from someone who essentially does genotyping(this test) as part of his job.I ordered this test because we purchased a dog from the pound and had no clue what breed she was. The test is a pretty simple one, providing you with two q-tips that allow you to gather DNA from your dogs cheek. You essentially get two chances to acquire decent DNA to send to them, so make sure they count. This is the first point where I felt the instructions could have been better. Contaminating DNA is easy, and many people who complain are most likely contaminating their DNA and then wondering why it's getting false calls.The instructions remind you to not feed your dog 2 hours prior to doing the test, what the instructions DO NOT tell you is that you also shouldn't let your dog chew on anything like a dogbone, lick anyone, or genuinely be allowed to touch anything. Any of these acts could potentially hurt results, and while unlikely, can cause a great deal of these errors. I would personally recommend giving the dog some water, then taking the water away and quarantining the dog for 2-3 hours without anything. Put him in a crate or spare room if you have to, make sure she/he has nothing they can lick, eat, or chew. Then take the dog out, and make sure they don't start licking your hands while you are trying to give the test. It also would be a wise decision to wash your hands thoroughly before using the test, and never let the qtip touch anything but the dogs mouth and the inside of the plastic piece it is placed in.The second thing I wanted to mention is with regards to how genotyping works. Essentially, the ""testers"" have positive controls which show a spread of bands they picture. They run the DNA through something called PCR in order to search for markers(bands) present in your dog, usually indicated by size. Dirty DNA can lead to bad bands, hard to read bands, and in the long run, bad calls. What many people don't realize is that the test only determines how much a dog is of a certain breed. These means that if the dog turns out to be 25% beagle, this DOES NOT mean one of the grand parents was a 100% beagle. This means that your dog has 25% beagle in him, which could theoretically be possible if you have two half beagles breed. Also note that recessive genes carry through, so even though all the dogs they determined in your lineage are big dogs, this in no way means your dog can't be small or vice versa. So just because 50% of your dog is Great Dane, yet your dog looks like a poodle, doesn't necessarily mean the test failed, as you have 50% of your potentially dominant DNA unaccounted for from any number of breeds. Likewise, a dog could have a parent with 50% beagle and end up with essentially no beagle in them. This is simple genetics. In reality, two dogs, both 50% beagle could theoretically have a dog with no significant beagle DNA, or a dog with 100% beagle DNA(although unlikely as the genes that make up a breed are a little more complex than a punnett square)..This test DOES NOT determine lineage... merely the higher percentages of DNA present in the animal. They might call them ""parents"" and ""grandparents"", but that is just a reference for ""has X% DNA"" and has no baring on what the parentage is. This also means that any breed that makes up less than app. 12.5% of your animal simply doesn't show up. So a true heinz 57 dog with 20 breed of dog in it's genetic makeup would render no result.Furthermore, there is no way to determine what your dogs parents are, unless your dog turns out to be exactly 50% one breed and 50% the other.If you strongly disagree with the results of your test, I'd highly recommend that you call the company or amazon and demand a replacement test. If they refuse to offer one, then file a credit card dispute and get your money back however you can. If you retake the test and receive the same results, it might be about time to start reconsidering how you see your dog. If the results differ, you can always question them on the differing results and get to the source of ""which one is right"", which might even include a 3rd test. Don't be angry if you need to repeat this test three times (presuming they are willing to provide you free kits twice). All this is doing is confirming the information and reinforcing your data, which is always a plus in science.So that is my two cents on the subject. With respect to my dog, we adopted her under the belief it was a border collie lab mix. However, over the course of a year, it seemed to lose any border collie appearance and my wife wondered if the dog possessed any pitbull in her due to people often believing she is a pitbull. Turns out there was no breeds associated with pitbull in her, at least none over 12.5%. The test is what it is. The report is well done. I would have appreciated more information regarding how the test is done and what genes they are testing for, and in truth, I am tempted to call them and see if they can tell me and maybe even provide me the data from my animals test upon request. I suppose I can forgive them for not including that data, as it would most likely just clutter things and make them confusing to read, although I am curious as to how well their lab keeps a record and would I be able to obtain my dog's data on request.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IK5S0V6BW0XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GFN2ZA#wasThisHelpful","R3IK5S0V6BW0XX","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard to hate on this game when you ""should"" pretty much know what you are getting into when you pick it up. This is Halo, the original xbox game, with updated graphics, achievements, and a few other perks.Immediately before putting this game in, I spent 7 hours strait playing Halo Reach from start to finish. What I found when I finally put in this game was that I was surprised by how different it was. One needs to realize that this isn't Halo ""reimagined"" with completely updated graphics like you'd find in Reach. The AI, the level designs, and the flaws from the original Halo are all kept.Some of you will LOVE that they kept the game completely intact instead of tweaking and modding it ala the George Lucas treatment. Others will be disappointed by the incredibly stupid AI, certain abnormally overpowered weapons, poor repetitive level designs that make you feel lost (particularly in the beginning), and a bland environment. While yes, the graphics are ""better"", they didn't add to the preexisting environments, so when they design a level that is bland because that is all the xbox could handle at the time, upping the graphics didn't resolve these issues. The game is exactly what it was on the xbox, flaws and all.So if your question is ""is this game for me?"", you will need to look at a few things. If you own Halo CE on the Xbox, you'll need to decide whether a facelift, achievements, 6 ""new"" Reach Maps are worth a repurchase. If you don't own Halo CE and you like the Halo series yet haven't played 1, then it's a definite buy. I personally found that at $40 price tag, it's a bit steep for anyone who already owns Halo CE, so I pulled off a star for that. At $20 though, I think any potential Halo fan should pick it up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBAT0UPQZTGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SYY5E#wasThisHelpful","R1GBAT0UPQZTGT","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before you get excited thinking this is the Dr. Ned Zombie Island DLC fleshed out into a full modern day game, realize that this game suffers from four design flaws that prevents it from being as good as Borderlands.The best way to describe this game is borderlands exclusively with zombies and an emphasis on melee. From the cardboard cutout quest handing NPCs, the quick travel, the ""safe"" zones, the re popping enemies, to loot grabbing, the fetch missions, to being built around coop, to allowing someone to jump into your game at any time, to the skill tree (1 skill point per level, three trees to put it in), the weapons all leveling up from rusty to devastating and beyond, dying causes a quick repop with some money missing, the enemies all leveling as you do, to the quest selection screen(you can pick up multiple quests at once)...well you get the idea. This game is everything borderlands is, plus it adds the occasional escort quest and has random junk like fallout 3, which you can use for weapon mods or selling for cash.So for anyone who is a fan of Borderlands and the MMORPG style level and item grind, this is a great game right? Well, I haven't mentioned the four things that prevent this game from living up to its' potential.1) No Local Coop: Some may disagree that this matters, but that's only because you happen to not live in a family of gamers. You can system link the game, or play on xbox live, but there is NO splitscreen, which is made more upsetting by the fact that the back of the case suggests splitscreen. The inability to play with my wife is frustrating beyond imagination, especially since ""all the bits and pieces"" are there to do it. If you base a game around coop, as dead island is (to the point several missions refer to you as several people), then they should actually have included coop, borderlands could handle it, so don't tell me it was a limitation of the hardware/software.2) Rapid Weapon Degradation: Having any weapon degradation in a game where you are killing hundreds of zombies was stupid enough, but they ramped it up in this game. Quite literally, you will be able to kill maybe 5 or 6 zombies per weapon. Some weapons are ""disposable"" and you will simply drop them. Others will simply stop doing damage, and you need to be careful else you end up surrounded my zombies with a weapon that does no damage.3) Rapid Zombie Repops: Very forgivable, as you'd expect a game like this to have repops. But where borderlands enemies only repopped when you left the area or quit and reloaded, dead island pops enemies at random, even in the same area you are in. The pops are sporadic, sometimes you can clear an area of zombies and come back 45 minutes later to find it still cleared, other times zombies will literally repop while your still in the same area. I remember killing a thug in a building, walking to my nearby car and walking back to find the thug repopped. If they cut the repopping down a bit, it would have made a big difference, especially with the rapid weapon degradation.4) Gameplay: Gameplay is a loaded word, so I will simply say this game is clumsier than other games of it's caliber, maybe this was to add suspense and fear, I don't know. Hits don't always register, which is frustrating for a game based on melee. Guns have very limited ammo, so using them is especially frustrating. Some zombies will latch on to you, forcing you to beat them off, from an indecipherable distance that seems to change from zombie to zombie. All in all, things just don't run as smoothly in this game.So, there is my opinion on dead island. This could have easily been a wonderful game, and certainly set itself up to be, but these four issues make the game fall flat on it's face. They took the general layout from borderlands, but made some choice decisions that prevented it from living up to potential. I didn't have any preconceived notions that this was a Fallout 3 with zombies or anything, so that doesn't effect my score. Still it just isn't as good as it could have been.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LW6JZEEM7GB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PAGJOC#wasThisHelpful","R1LW6JZEEM7GB5","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On stranger tides follows the continuing story of Jack Sparrow after the end of At World's End. Taking place several years later, after Jack's map lead him to a dead end, he continues the search for the fountain of youth. I could say that the movie was OK, but suffered from several issues that just did not put it on par with any of the previous movies.The first issue was the antagonist, Blackbeard. Although he had a dramatic intro, after that, his character just waned. He was not intimidating, scary, or even particularly piraty. At no point could they decide what supernatural powers to give him, so they toss him a giant hodgepodge of whatever was convenient at the time. As a result, one minute he has the mystical power to control rope, another moment he can shrink ships into bottles, another moment he can resurrect the dead, no, he can make voodoo dolls, wait, he can control the wind? His ship has... a flamethrower? They claim him to be evil, and spend the entire movie declaring how evil he is... but he doesn't perform a single evil act in the entire movie. He kills a mutineer and captures and leaves to die a vicious mermaid who murders people... that's it. Other than that, for a pirate, he was actually a pretty decent guy.This leads to the next problem, they make all the other characters ""good"" so that Blackbeard seems evil in comparison. Pirates and thieves are suddenly altruistic and noble. Blackbeard's evil deed is being the only character in the movie that actually acted like a pirate, and not even a good one. This comes nowhere near the backstabbing, thieving, and traitorousness of the pirates of the first three movies. Suddenly Jack and Barbossa are best chums, this new girl which people keep saying added ""much needed sex appeal"" Angelica looks like a Latino stunt double of Swan. Her motivations, once again, despite being allegedly corrupted in evil, are completely altruistic and unpirate like.The final issue is how every scene was done. I swear the directors and writers sat down with the scripts of the first three movies and said, what is your favorite scenes from each movie and how can we shove them all into one? Oh, I loved the scene where the Kraken grabs all those people up. Ok, let's have that scene with magical ropes instead. Oh, I love that scene where will and jack fight on the roof planks in the blacksmith shop. Sounds good, let's do that again with Jack and that Angelica. How about that scene where Davy Jones pulls out the long cannons. Great! We'll make it a flamethrower instead! What about the scene where Jack escapes the soldiers. Sure, but we'll have him escape from the middle of the estate now! What about the turner/swan love interest. Yeah, we can throw some altruistic guy in their so he can sloppily be corrupted by pirates while falling in love with an ""unattainable"" woman outside his station.So yeah. That was the story. We have the antiheroes who have just turned into heroes, the bad guy that is little worse than any of the good guys, ""needed"" sex appeal that looks no different than the last 3 movies, except latin now. We have almost scene for scene grabs from the original trilogy, more poorly done and in the case of the relationship, was so out of place it could have just been left out.I give it 3 stars, because it was an OK watch, had it's fun moments with Jack Sparrow, and there was occasionally some witty dialogue or interesting scenes. However, ultimately completely unnecessary and anyone who love the trilogy could completely go without watching this.Edit: I figured I should add that Angelica, the latin girl, played by Penelope Cruz, an established actor, acts like, dresses like, and functions like swan from the second two movies. I am not comparing the actors... but that she was clearly a shoed in replacement for the swan character (scriptwise) and never really developed a personality of her own, I hope that solves the confusion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5OVI5FY4VA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005COPWZW#wasThisHelpful","R1D5OVI5FY4VA1","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is honestly the first anime I have ever watched where I would have to say there was too much fan service. Now, I don't have anything wrong with fan service normally, but this show had so much of it that it was basically distracting from the show.Which is really a shame too, because the story itself is excellent. It follows the story of a series of woman, all looking to compete in a kind of tournament to elect one of them as the next queen of the nation. Each person has their own reasons for fighting, and although the tournaments only officially start in the final episode, matches can be held in route to knock out potential competition.I was a little confused regarding the mechanics of the matches, since losing a match does not seem to disqualify someone from competing again. In fact, the main character is constantly getting her butt handed to her. It is actually pretty silly, as her character keeps getting beat over and over again but never gives up. It is also a little confusing as to who is participating and why. The main character insisted that she wasn't going to participate numerous times yet kept doing things to show that she was going to participate.Anyway, the story was pretty decent, consisting of a fair amount of fun, including an angel that champions the matches continually doing unangelic things. The fighting is OK and the story tends to flow pretty well with each of the characters stories. The end of this series does not end the show, as it is ongoing battle.The biggest thing that annoyed me was the ridiculous amount of fan service. Every character except one wore exceptionally revealing and impractical clothing. For example, one character wore a snake as her underwear. The only thing covering her lower half of her body was a snake wrapped around her nether regions, and she frequently sent the snake away for errands, leaving her completely naked. Other character wear things things that barely cover their chests, including a demon with a second pair of hands that cover her breasts least she want to squirt acidic breast milk at them (yes, this is the basis of several episodes).And that doesn't even touch on the nudity. EVERY fight scene consists of at least one characters clothing being ripped off. There is not a single fight scene that does not have someone's breast bare by the end of it. It is laughably ridiculous. That is where I feel the show fails. Even when they are trying to do serious scenes, everyone is either naked or wearing clothing that might as well make them naked, so it is so ridiculous that it is unbelievable, making what should be powerful emotional scenes a joke.Had they cut the fan service back a couple clicks, this show is pretty good and has the capacity to be a great anime, but like others have mentioned, the sheer amount of fan service is distracting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZI040F9BXXK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045O2PH8#wasThisHelpful","RZI040F9BXXK2","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Baka and test follows the story of class F. They go to a unique school where classes are split based on test scores. The best students get all the money and equipment in class A, while the worst students get stuck with nothing in Class F. However, students can earn better supplies and equipment by quite literally battling other classes, using their test scores as their battle points.This anime is absolutely hilarious, filled with tons of visual gags. This is the first anime I have ever watched that I would have no problem watching again and again. I watched one episode twice in a row, and found tons of hilarious things I had completely missed the first time through.The season, in and of itself, is very satisfying. The story starts out strong, sits for most of the mid season, but with good reason, and then ends strongly. You will most likely be satisfied with the ending to. There is another season in progress, but I wonder what will happen to continue the series, which seems to have finished up pretty well.There is not any complete nudity although the anime possesses of some partial nudity. The language is OK as well. The comedy is often very visual with a fair amount of slapstick too. I would highly recommend this anime for anyone who wants a couple of laughs and is OK with some stupid humor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3567O3BYYSM0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TP55T8#wasThisHelpful","R3567O3BYYSM0Q","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Catch N Release in order to provide my son with more toys to use in the bathtub for his third birthday. He seems to enjoy catching things in nets and I wanted him to be able to do that with this toy. So far it has worked well. The net is small, fat and has no threat of being a chocking hazard for younger babies. The other toys also seem to work well floating on the surface until they can be picked up by the net.I imagine younger children would lack the dexterity to be able to pick up the pieces, as the net hole is barely larger than the pieces it picks up. For my son it seems to work fine. It's a cheap, simple toy and I give it it's due for what it is. It should hold up and is unlikely to break under normal circumstances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIJBH4603UW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TOKHGM#wasThisHelpful","RLIJBH4603UW3","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this watch because I was in need of a good watch that I knew would hold up to abuse. Most of my watches tend to break within months, so I was hoping for a watch that would last for a few years.This G-Shock atomic watch met my demands.The display is clear and easy to read. It offers a night light, atomic settings, alarm, stop watch, and timer. All of the things you'd expect from a digital watch. It feels sturdy and the band feels like it will hold up well. I have had it for about 3 months now and it has shown no evidence of cracking or breaking like some watches. I have taken it into water at a water park and always wear it when I take my showers and the seals have held perfectly watertight.So why do I give it a poorer rating that I otherwise should? Because of the Solar charge. Most solar watches I have are able to keep a charge and run perfectly fine. The only issues I ever had were when a watch was broken and the nightlight would randomly turn on over and over again, draining the battery. This has none of these problems, but I find it unable to hold a charge.I live in wisconsin, and it has been spring for most of my ownership of the watch, so no exactly sunny days (mostly rainy). Nonetheless, I'd expect a watch to be able to keep a charge. Instead, I find myself needing to charge the watch up by leaving it in an window during the day every 3 to 4 days. So for every 3 days I wear the watch, I have to spend one day letting it charge.This might be a problem unique to only some of the watches, and it may not be something I will face in the summer months or someone else would face in their sunnier location. However, for me, a watch that can't keep it's charge and dies every couple of days is not a great experience, and it has cost this watch 2 stars in my book. Other than that, the watch is a great one and I would recommend it. If you live in southern California, this is a great watch, if you live in Washington... maybe consider another.Update: Having owned this watch for a longer period of time, nothing has really changed. It still is constantly dying every couple of days. It is summer now and that seems to make no difference. On days I am outside it stays working, on days I am inside it drains and dies. Perhaps the battery just needs a larger capacity than casio gave it, but either way, I expect a solar watch to remain charged most of the time, not be constantly dying everyday I don't spend outside.Update 2: I had the battery replaced and ever since the watch has run fine. It will still power down sometime at night under really low lighting, but by the time I check it again the next day the watch is already back on. I wonder if it has some kind of power setting or something. I increased my score a star because it looks like I just got one with a bad battery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PY9SKRQ7UL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AZXN4O#wasThisHelpful","R35PY9SKRQ7UL9","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is really no surprise here. It is exactly as described, a black silicone cover specific for Sony Walkmans. It covers all of the buttons and even came with a screen cover that was not advertised when I bought it. The cover has a poor indent where each of the buttons are, but no indicator of what button does which, so if you are not familiar with you device, you may find yourself pressing the wrong button every now and then. You may also have to push harder to get buttons to register than you might have once had to.Other than that, it works as it is.

"As far as relaxing ambient light goes, this Himalayan salt lamp is the best. The picture doesn't really do it justice for the lamp's beauty.The lamp has an adjustable dimmer switch which influences the orange glow that the lamp emmits. Don't expect the lamp to be able to light a room, but if you are just looking for a night light, a romantic backlight, a relaxing light during a massage or romantic dinner, Or something to calm your nerves after a long day, then this would work very well.Allegedly, the lamp's salt, when heated by the lamp (although it never gets particularly hot on the outside rocks), is suppose to have an ionic effect, removing the ""bad"" free radicals from the air and allowing for cleaner breathing and the removal of allergy problems.I would honestly believe this to be a placebo effect, as my wife still is suffering from allergy problems even though we have run the lamp nonstop for a week. Then again, I have a full fledged air filter that hasn't faired any better at providing her relief this spring.Regardless of whether the ionic effect is a wivestale or a real effect of this lamp, it is still a recommended purchase for anyone looking for something to produce a calming ambient light. Definitely a great addition to any massage parlor, and my wife wants a second one for upstairs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9S4X4U90KOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025VO3DW#wasThisHelpful","R1L9S4X4U90KOS","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased two of these stuffed lambs for Easter baskets. They worked well for my 3 yo son and 2 yo nephew. The song plays fine, and the lambs are sufficiently well built and cuddly.The lamb's music is controlled by a key that is easily usuable by a toddler. The one odd thing is that the key allows you to unscrew it. So if you turn it the wrong way, you'll have to turn it back before it starts cranking.There is not much to say other than that. This is a music box in the form of a stuffed animal, NOT  a stuffed animal with music. So this isn't meant to be played with by a baby or to be someone's carry around toy. It is better suited for being sat up on a shelf and played to help a baby to sleep, or played with your toddler to expose him to the song.I dropped the rating a star because of the oddity of the key being able to be unscrewed, which can be frustrating when you have to screw it 5 or six turns before it starts winding up. Other than that, treating it more like a music box for kids and less like a stuffed animal would be the key to making sure this is the product for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OR4CL8AVOFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EB1JB6#wasThisHelpful","R10OR4CL8AVOFX","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the case when the paint on my mp3 player began scrapping off a bit. I thought that using this would keep my mp3 player from getting as beat up as my previous one had before it died.So far it has worked well at protecting my mp3 player, which looks as good as the day I put the cover on for all the areas the polyurethane wrap covers. The area it covers is the back of the mp3 player and the edges. The speakers, including the holes in the back of the player, are not covered, along with the screen and the buttons. A screen protector comes with this set to cover the screen, really only leaving the buttons uncovered and speakers uncovered. The case is well built though, allowing easy access to all of the ports and buttons. The only button covered is the volume button, and while changing it sometimes requires a little more work than it did, it is acceptable. The case doesn't offer any protection for the transfer port, so if you wanted to keep it from getting clogged with dust, you'd need to look for something else.The clip that attaches to it is very subpar. It falls off or clips off with incredible ease, and I gave up on it fairly quickly. It is difficult to maneuver the clip where you want it without it popping off the mp3 player, so it is not too effective.The misleading part comes from the color. The blue color of the case is faint, very faint, so after putting it on your mp3 at best it will have a slight bluish tinge. Mostly youll just have that check board pattern on the back of your player with clear squares and bluish snow squares.  So the picture is nothing like what your mp3 will look like with it on.In the end, I give it a 4. Despite it's shortcomings, it works and it is very cheap, if it was more expensive, I might be more disappointed, but at a couple of bucks, it's as good as I would expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34K3PSCVREJEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XRNXIO#wasThisHelpful","R34K3PSCVREJEL","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to purchasing this product I was very familiar with the Sony walkman line, having owned an 8 gb for the last 4 years. It broke so I searched for a replacement and eventually found this nextgeneration device. The color wasn't particularly important to me so I went with this model, which was cheaper at the time. I found the device to be more than adequate for my purposes, which is listening to music and audiobooks.The sound has been of high quality, new features that did not exist on my previous model include external speakers and fm radio. The external speakers are not particularly loud, so it isn't something you can really use instead of, say, a car radio. The radio also seems to work well. As others have mentioned, their are issues with it's sorting and making playlists, which don't really effect me, so I won't rate it negatively due to these flaws. It would be nice if more forms of media were supported, particularly in the video category, but regrettably that doesn't seem to be the case. I still love the ease of syncing files with windows media player, and not having to sync or maintain your entire library on a computer like iTunes forces you to.The one complaint that I have seems to be the quality of the device. My previous one lasted for many years, and while it did get beat up, it took quite some time for it. With this one, specifically the paint job seems defunct. I don't know if I specifically got a defunct one or if all of the RED onces have this problem, but it feels like the paint job was missing the protective gloss layer. Within days of owning the product the paint on the back of the mp3 player began rubbing off. I purchased a case to delay the speed of this, but in the month I have had it, the buttons (the only non covered part of the player) red color has already started rubbing off as well. I have treated my device well, but it already shows wear and tear as if I had been using it for many months in a matter of  weeks.So it's a good device, and I like everything about the hardware behind the device nd the software in the device, but I would have expected it to hold up a little better with regards to the paint. For that I drop it a star. Other than that it is solid and I'd recommend it, you might want to avoid the red color though.Edit: The device eventually unexpectedly broke down. Sony wanted $30 to do an exchange on it, which is honestly a lot more than I would have expected for something supposedly under warranty. I'd probably drop the rating a star, but I feel I was responsible for it breaking. I grabbed it once when I had a wet hand, then it started acting up, I let it dry out and it started working fine, then 3 weeks later it suddenly died and would not start.As far as the issue I mention, the ""new"" paint job on this refurbished one seems to be holding up a little better. The paint is already rubbing off again, but to a smaller degree around the high wear areas and over a longer period of time (several weeks versus several days). So just about everything I said about the device stands, I DO like the device, just don't grab it when you hand is wet, it doesn't quite have the waterproofness of say, an ipod touch (for obvious reasons), not saying that ipod touches are waterproof, just that they are more water resistant than this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLZV58Y1MSDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IPHA3A#wasThisHelpful","R3LLZV58Y1MSDC","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you keep in mind the relative price of this dog kennel compared to others, you have to respect the value of this product.This is a simple dog kennel for traveling with a dog. Whether you go on a road trip with the dog, or something bigger, this is a great kennel for the purpose. The size of dog this is designed for is large, which cover border collies, labs, retrievers, and other dogs along this size. It offers plenty of room for my dog, who is still in his puppy stages, but has plenty of room to grow.The remington comes in three basic parts. I was able to figure out assembly pretty quickly without instructions. You simple put the top and bottom together with the door fitting into it's respective holes. You then use a plastic clip to lock the kennel together along the sides. On the up side, you can probably dissasemble the kennel if there is ever a need, on the downside, the assembly is with plain plastic clips that could probably break easily if you assemble it wrong.If someone fell on it or some other accident I could see it breaking... but other than that it is a pretty stable kennel that will hold a dog. As an added plus, it comes with a food bin if you need to provide food or water on the go.The only complaint I have for it is that I found no means of attaching the handles that came with it in an actually useful way (on the top). The kennel is big and bulky and don't expect to be able to lug it around by it's handles. I honestly am not even sure why they provided handles.Other than that, which I can live with for something it's size, it meets my needs. It is the cheapest kennel I have been able to find, and it is well built enough that I don't mine the cost. Most other kennels will run you over $100-200 easily. I was able to get mine for $60.

"I can really only say it is about as good as Awakening, but not Origins. I have beaten the game now, although I wrote this review after 8 hours of play, I still agree with just about everything I wrote. So the game hasn't picked up or ""gotten better"". I have dropped the score to 3 stars.Story: This is the first failure in my book. The story seems to lack cohesion. Where the first story was steady and true, you had a purpose and followed that purpose, and each of your companions were met in turn, this story is just a mess. You meander around picking up quest after quest and companion after companion, who follow you for no particular reason whatsoever other than ""I owe you one"" . For example, one of them becomes a captain of the guard, but still remains your companion, as if that even makes sense, like she/he could make week long expositions while having a steady job.Gameplay: For the most part, the gameplay remains relatively unchanged. The commands, giving commands, and the abilities all feel and run the same. It's faster pace, with you swinging you sword or casting spells wickedly fast, but other than that, it is surprisingly familiar. The enemies are weaker, but they throw more of them at you at once. This leads to another one of my problems with it. They have your enemies hidden until you run into them. You can't scout out and see your enemies ahead of you; Instead, they simply pop up in front of you. You then proceed to fight waves and waves of enemies that magical appear all around you. They literally jump from the sky and land, as if every attack was a carefully planned execution from the rooftops.Menu and levels: The new menu is mostly a slicker less gritty version of the old one. It isn't better or worst. The ""level up"" options are almost the same, except that you can now see more clearly how each change of your stats effects you. Rather than having all the ability placed on one page, they are now scattered by section and ""gridded"" so that in order to learn some abilities you need to learn others. In the end, it is just a fancy and less efficient way to display the same thing with the same abilities. I preferred to be able to read my options and see all criteria on one page, so in my opinion, this is less enjoyable. The new dialogue wheel, taken from the concepts of Mass Effect, is something I hate greatly. More often than not, the few word summary they give you does not accurately represent what your character says, so you end up saying things you didn't intend to, and there is no way to predict when and how much the text deviates from the words spoken.Maps are reused shamelessly. Not only do you need to repeatedly go through the same areas over and over again (at least once per act), but they also reuse the same maps as different areas. You end up with a large elaborate map for a mansion or cave, then each different mansions or cave with certain doors passable and other doors locked, thus allowing you to travel through a unique path... but you are really just repeating the same map over and over again, but might be going through it backwards, or having these two doors blocked instead of these two. This hits the score the hardest of anything in my mind. They shameless reuse the same maps over and over again for different environments. Origin did do this, but not nearly to this extent. Within 8 hours of play, I had repeated a single map 3 times for 3 different areas. That is very inexcusable.Other Changes from origins: Other changes include the dog now being a ""summon"" rather than a character that actual takes up a form slot(I believe this is an addon), which I prefer. You can no longer speak to your companions except in their own ""location"", so no having conversations when you are out and about, even in a city. The companions no longer have traditional armor, but wear an unique upgradable single armor piece, you are the only one that needs all the pieces of armor. Also crafting, including runes and herbs, is now done at shops unique to that purpose rather than by individuals...Overall: So all in all, the game hasn't impressed me so far. The lackluster introduction of each of the companions is put together so sloppily that it is discouraging at best. The story has no real direction. Nonetheless, the game is still fun, offers a faster past version of the combat system you may have learned to love, and there are some things they have gotten right. It's still a game worth looking at, but you might consider waiting for a price drop.I know it sounds pretty bleak from my diagnosis of the game, but everything else about the game is classic Dragon Age, and if you like that, and can dismiss every thing I mentioned as not a problem or inconsequential, then you know this is the game for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRY3QYT27I57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047TG2R0#wasThisHelpful","R1XRY3QYT27I57","A1ITCVZ46MUB3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ITCVZ46MUB3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She changed him for the better, but it wasn't an easy process. She stuck by his side through thick and thing.

"Can I scream on how much I love this series? Seriously, it just seems to get better and better. I mean Edge of Danger is AWESOME! Loved the last book, and I didn't know how Katie would top after Levi's story, but she managed.Edge of Danger is a heart pounding non-stop action story, that has you holding your breath at times. To say the least it's one hell of a page turner. Anyway, we meet Tucker Pankov who happens to be an undercover DEA agent. You think he's new character, but we actually have met him in Shattered Duty as Grisha. As Grisha he's one scary dude. Anyway, a storm hits him and his team, and they have go dark while they figured out why their boss was murder and why they have target on their backs. No problem right. WRONG! No clearance  to figure out what the heck is going on, and to top it all off wanted terrorist acts. Everything is awesome. Anyway. They need help and try to get a hold of Burkhart of the NSA, but seem to have trouble about that. Next best thing is kidnapped Karen Stafford. Totally brilliant idea, I mean they are wanted for basically treason what's a little kidnapping after all. We have met Karen before, she's one of Burkhart's NSA analyst. At first, she doesn't know what to believe, but slowly starts to whittle away the doubts she has about Tucker and his buddies and decides to help them figure out what the heck is going. However, it all come at the cost, after all they are all being pursued by some bad guy.I repeat I don't know how Katie does this, but she has manage to make the bad guys crazier than the last. So, we have Karen and Tucker on the run and figuring out what the heck is going on, and we are introduce to the bad guys. Hillenbrand wants a certain guy to reach the presidency and basically will do anything to get to his goal. Cheat, steal, frame, you name it he will do it. Of course, he has his cronies to do all for him. It amazes me on how unstable this guy is, and I thought the last guy was pretty bad. Nope.Anyway, the writing in Edge of Danger is phenomenal. Totally blows me away on how this story just sucks you in. Heart pounding, edge of your seat read. Karen and Tucker are awesome. The more you get to know these two, and just go ""WOW! They are awesome!"" Yes, LOVED Edge of Danger it's a re-read kind of story. The great thing about this series, you can read each individually. Yes, you will get more fulfillment out reading the series in order, because you see some of the same characters reoccurring. However, it's not going to be detrimental to reading experience. Each couple has their own HEA by the end of the story and the bad that was a problem in the story is taken out. Read, enjoy, and have a blast with Edge of Danger.Copy provided by Signet via NetGalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3R7CP5MDIKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475453#wasThisHelpful","RX3R7CP5MDIKQ","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, His Work of Art is an adorable read. It's a super cute. We have are geeky girl who loves DC comics and has dreams of writing a comic herself. There is one problem, she can't draw. She enlists the help of Adam Hayes. They've had a quirky friendship building after all he likes Marvel comics. Those difference in comic book ideology. However they start working together on Reese's project and draw close to one another. Yet, there is a road-block in the way which would be the color of skin. Yep, you wouldn't have gotten that from the blurb or the cover.Take a little detour on the cover art. I personally think cover is ADORABLE, but (yes it's a big but) it doesn't fit the story. Cause the guy could look hispanic or a really tan guy on the cover, he's actually black. So, this cause a little confusion. That is my little gripe about the book.Overall, it's a cute read that is light fluff. However, it did touch on a few issues. Like an interracial couple. I personally, didn't have problem with them being together, neither did Reese, but Adam had a few issues. We come to find out it stems from childhood. Childhood issues. Another issue was Reese entering a male dominate world and being able to standout from the rest. Tough task. His Work of Art skim over possible huge issues that might come up. Yet, it was cute to watch this couple draw close to one another through some might consider geeky pursuit. So, if you are looking for something quick and light, you might consider giving His Work of Art a try.Copy provided by Lyrical via NetGalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S958EJ00A6IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFYGDVQ#wasThisHelpful","R2S958EJ00A6IT","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm totally in love with the Playful Brides series. Oh my goodness, this book was sooooooo good. It was one of those stories that once you start you can't stop. This series has been a fun read, and The Irresistible Rogue is just as much fun that it left me on a book high. Amazaballs!In the story, we meet up with old characters and new. However, the story focuses a lot on the main characters, but there are few secondary characters that need to be mention. Here we go:Daphne Swift: Our heroine. She's been in love with Captain Rafferty Cavendish forever. However, he sees her as a sister. *hangs head down* She has decided to move on to new guy Fitzwell. One problem, she's married to Rafe. Huh. Oh the plot thickens. Plus, she's a feisty young woman who likes adventure.Captain Rafferty Cavendish (Rafe): Married to Daphne, because of situation. Secretly loves her, but doesn't believe he's good enough to be with her. He has some issues with the upper ton. Plus, he doesn't like Daphne latest pick for a future husband.Fitzwell: Courting Daphne. He's only important for the first half of the story, and he disappears after a certain. He's just there to court Daphne and elevate his status, which he would have been able to if he stuck around.Delilah: OH MY GOODNESS! She's HILARIOUS! Absolutely love this 12 year old cousin of Daphne's. She's feisty, fiery, and troublemaker in the making. She can barter  with the best of them. She's precocious, and that's the best way to describe her. For a 12 year she does put some things in perspective. She's going to be a wild one once she makes her debut. It would be world lookout.We also have Daphne's brother, his wife, and their friends that play a part in the story. They add a little here and there. The story focus on Daphne and Rafe finding justice for Daphne's brother's death. The others are supplementary, but they add to the fun mix.The Irresistible Rogue entertained me as I watch Daphne and Rafe find their way back to one another. Yes, they both have issues. Rafe doesn't believe he's good enough for anything, and he tries to do everything on his own. Daphne is use to getting what she wants and in a way Rafe resents that. This is one of the sore points in the story. When they work together they are undefeatable. Their interaction is explosive. Overall, I absolutely loved The Irresistible Rogue, and definitely left me on a book high.Copy provided by St. Martin via NetGalley","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9P0NAEVTTJVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072573#wasThisHelpful","R9P0NAEVTTJVS","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating 3 1/2I have to say that Nowhere to Hide is a good start to a new series. Basically, we are laying the ground work for Delos Home School Charities to combine forces with Artemis Security. However, it wouldn't have happen if a deadly drug lord decided to take out his revenge for Delos Home School Charity. He is targeting Lia Cassidy. In the story we learn quite a bit about Lia. Her backstory is pretty kind of rough. During her time in the army she was attacked and she hasn't been the same. The attack made her leery of men. I do like her, because she's stronger than what she believes. If she let the incident take over her life, she would have been shell of a person. Instead she decided to work and try to put the past behind her. We also meet Cav Jordan who is assign to protect Lia. I adore him, because he didn't see Lia as a walking scar, but the person.In Nowhere To Hide, we watch two people get to know each in the face of danger. I liked how patient Cav was with Lia, he truly wanted to prove to her that he saw the sweet person. One of my favorite quote came Dilara to Lia about opening up to have a relationship:""No one is perfect, Lia. They make look like they are, but they aren't. We're all imperfect and we carry a number of scars. Some are just more obvious than others. Cav has his share of scars believe me. You need to realize that your scars don't make you who you are, and they never will.""That quote pretty much the define majority of the story. It took both Cav and Lia to realize that scars don't make the person, they may shape a person, but they do not define them. Overall, a good way to lay the groundwork for the rest of the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNM0YN75XSEPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1929977077#wasThisHelpful","RNM0YN75XSEPB","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a perfect story to read on all Hallows Eve. Seriously, We have Jenna and Samuel heading to Salem close to Halloween to solve a questionable suicide. Of course, they find themselves caught up in a murder investigation. Yes, this a quick read meeting up with Jenna and Sam, if you are like me and haven't read Krewe of Hunters books.So, if you are in the mood for a quick read that centers around Halloween with a little mystery and suspense this might be your cup of tea.

"I have to say that I did like The Professional. It did have action and suspense. However, at the same time I felt like I jumped into a middle of a plot, which I did. Whoops. I was blinded by the hot cover. Anyway, I'm guessing there are more to overall plot, because one of character's step-father is trying to get some rubies and basically will do anything to get them. Overall plot of story is center around these rare rubies were from Britain (yes, I'm over simplifying this). During this mess, Max needs to rescue Violet, because Tripp Lange (the bad guy) will do anything to get his hands on these jewels. It looked for the weakest link, which happens to Violet. Basically, we are galavanting about East Texas to make sure Max and Violet stay safe.Even though I was playing catch up with my mind, the plot was pretty easy to grasp, and I wasn't too lost for not reading the previous stories. I wouldn't recommend going this way, I would probably suggest reading the previous books to get the full grasp of Tripp's diabolical tendencies. Now the romance aspect of the story, I liked it. I mean we have Max and Violet who kinda of rub on each others nerves. Actually it was more Violet was getting rubbed the wrong way, which has to do with her wall. Those darn emotional walls, they seem to get in the way. Both have issues and have to overcome, Violet has more of a trust issue. Both of them compliment one another. Overall, The Professional is a pretty good read, but don't forget my suggest. There is a plot cliffhanger. Max and Violet get a happy ending, but the overall plot goes on. After all one more person needs to find a happy ending.Copy provided by Harlequin via BookTrib","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0B5TNRFNF6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXGZ6OM#wasThisHelpful","R2P0B5TNRFNF6M","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adore Brightwater books, because they are sweet, heartfelt, and bit magical. Okay, magical might be over doing it, but they are heartwarming stories. Anyway; today we are taking a look at Lia Riley's latest Brightwater book Best Worst Mistake. Let me just say this might sound like a falling off the beaten path, but stay with me. At first Best Worst Mistake kind of reminded me of the Disney version of Beauty and The Beast. Yep, you read that right. I'll explain why, and it's okay to totally disagree with me, I'm okay with that after all these are my thoughts. Here we go:Wilder Kane: He's pretty beasty and antisocial after the fire accident. Plus, he has shut himself off from the rest of the world, living all alone in a cabin. His family would be like the objects that make his life comfortable.Quinn Higsby: She's totally like Belle. She's beautiful and smart. Yes, they might find her a little cuckoo. However, she's sweet and tries to take care of her father who has early onset Alzheimers. Plus, she likes reading and heaven forbid a woman should start reading, and getting ideas in her head.Garret: Oh my goodness, he's so much like Gaston it's not even funny. Totally believes he's like god's gift to women. Seriously, the guy couldn't understand why Quinn didn't like him that way.Lenny: He's Garret's buddy and would do anything for him, sort of like Lefou.There you have it the main characters of the story of Beauty and the Beast, I mean Best Worst Mistake. I liked this story and a modern retelling of Beauty and the Beast without the Stockholm Syndrome. Yep, Quinn isn't held captive against her will unless you count being stuck in a cabin with Wilder and her father during a blizzard. Anyway, Best Worst Mistake is a sweet story and heart melting. We have two characters that couldn't be more different. We have Wilder who is living with guilt and remorse for the past and trying to make amends for what happen. So, he puts on his grumpy pants so everyone can give him a wide berth. We have Quinn who is dealing with a lot on her plate and can't give anymore than she can. Yet, she opens up to Wilder.So, if you are looking for something sweet and heartwarming, you can't go wrong with Best Worst Mistake.

"From the first moment we met Maggie in Forever Your Earl, I have been intrigued by her character. It stems from her snide remarks about the upper echelon. So, I have wonder what would cause snide remarks and we find out in Scandal Takes the Stage. Of course, it's like any sad story of ruination, but instead of being a lady of the night she ended up being a play writer. Even that isn't quite right, it would be more like a musical writer and that's explain in the story. So, when Cam starts sniffing around her skirts, she rebuffs him. Gotta love Cam and his willingness to continue the chase even after so many rebuffs. However, loves life to the fullest, and he loves the theater more. It's awesome to see a rake love something that wouldn't be consider rakish. He actually loves Maggie's work, in fact he finds her brilliant when it comes to her writing. You would say that he's her number champion. I actually adore what he does for her when he finds out that she's suffering from the worst case of writers block. Those temperamental muses.Overall, I found Scandal Takes the Stage a wonderful story that takes on a tour of the theater. Where we have our lovely heroine believe that you can only find true love only in stories. A hero that has a bit of a romantic side. Yes, you read that correct our rakish hero has a romantic side. Yet, these two go to battle of wits, because one is jaded towards the upper class and believes they care nothing of but themselves. We have a hero who proves that not all men are created equal, and there are some good aristocrats out there.

"I received a chance to read a highly anticipated read by Lisa Kleypas Cold-Hearted Rake. Okay, here's a little secret, this is my first Klepas book. Yes, I hear all your gasps, and the funny thing is I have a few of her books in my Kindle. Go figure. Okay, the secret is out of the bag now we can proceed with my thoughts.Actually, it's an amazing opportunity I have to check this book out, and at the same time scary. Here's why: THE HYPE. There can so much pressure going on with this book. Fortunately, I fell in love with the characters and the story. Cold-Hearted Rake is a well balanced book filled with characters you will grow and love. Let's meet the characters:Devon Ravenel: Everything was going smashingly until he inherited a crumbling earldom. He was about to cut his lost and move on. Yes, it's explain how he could cut his lost and get out. Anyway, he goes through quite bit of change throughout the story. He's still a rake, but he starts to assume the mantle of responsibility.Kathleen: Lady Trenear. She's the widow of the late earl. She's worry about the new earl casting them all out. She's getting ready to expect the worst. There are quite of few battles between her and Devon. She tries to show Devon he needs to care for all the tenants and the land. Not an easy task since Devon is use to carrying for himself.So, we get to know the main characters and how they influence are minds. These two were absolutely fun between their banter. At times they seem to bring out the worst in one another, but that's all sexual tension. Then we need to meet the secondary characters that will eventually lead to future stories.The Twins Pandora and Cassandra: These two will be fun to watch, because they are a handful in the story. They will be spirited young women by the time we get to them.West Ravenel: Brother to Devon. He goes through a major change in the book. I love West, after all he has to act as mediator between Devon and Kathleen.Helen: The younger sister of the late earl and sister to Pandora and Cassandra. She's meek, quite, and another peacekeeper between Devon and Kathleen. Not as much as West, but she tries to defuse situations. I'm curious how her book will play out. I guess I will be learning patience this year. ;DOverall, Cold-Hearted Rake is a fantastic story for Lisa to make her return to the historical romance a triumph. The characters will capture your heart and will get you anxious to see what happens to the Ravenel family and how they will be able to conquer the challenges that will lie ahead. Fall in love with Devon and Kathleen's battles. After all one is a rake and the other is proper, and they always make the best stories.Copy provided by Avon","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJ6147IE9ZOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLULO7K#wasThisHelpful","R3RJ6147IE9ZOK","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I started Mia Marlowe's The Curse of Lord Stanstead, I thought it started a little slow. Then again we are building this world where we have people that have extraordinary powers among normal people. Actually, the characters reminded me of another group of extraordinary people know as the X-Men. Yep, this would be the regency version of the X-Men. So, if you love romance and X-Men you have met your match.Anyway, we have Duke of Camden (kind of like Professor Xavier) who searches out this people with extra abilities, brings them in, and helps them harness their powers. He notices that there is someone with powers in the Darkin home, but he's not sure who. He sends Garret Sterling to find the person and bring them back. Garret finds Cassandra and is about to cause fire Almacks. Basically Garret and Cassandra begin their relationship shortly after meeting. It's not because of love, but out of necessity of controlling Cassie's powers.So, the first part of The Curse of Lord Stanstead is helping Cassie to control her powers and she has to release some of her energy through relations with a person. I don't know how that all works, so I'm going to let that go. However, each assignment leads up to what happens to at the end. Yep, going vague here. Things start to speed up towards the end and something terrible happens to Cassie. What happens to Cassie breaks my heart, because she finds someone she could love and it's taken away. I have to say that I do love how Garret was willing to sacrifice himself to be with Cassie.Overall, The Curse of Lord Stanstead is pretty good once you get passed the halfway point. First half they are building a working relationship and once they enter the field together things start to change between them. We also have Garret trying to shield himself away from Cassie, because he doesn't want the same fate to happen to her as his last girl. So, if you like the X-Men and romance novels you might checkout The Curse of Lord Stanstead out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162L49X2JRH3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111GVTA6#wasThisHelpful","R162L49X2JRH3I","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In The Rebel we meet David Hennings and Amanda LeBlanc. David comes from this prominent family, but he doesn't quite fit in with the family. He finally moves back to Chicago trying to make amends to his family. However, that is a challenge. When you meet them they are all opinionated. What do you expect in a house full of lawyers. I actually admire David, because of his beliefs. When you get to know why he feels like an outsider, it's like wow that's kind of cool. Anyway, his mother has him try to convince this artist, Amanda, to help solve this cold case. At first she didn't want to because of what happen to her mother. In a way she was living half a life when David pops into her life. Amanda uses her mother's death in a way that it's better to live in neutral and let nothing cause drama. What kind of life is that? Life is drama. Anyway, she has a hard time with David, but Amanda gets use to him.The Rebel starts off a little slow, once Amanda's life starts falling apart the story starts to pickup. It does get a little interesting, because you start to figure out that has to do with skull. I have to say that I didn't expect the outcome of who was behind the attacks on Amanda. Adrienne did a great job on hiding the bad guy.Overall, The Rebel is a fairly quick read once Amanda life starts to fall apart. I really liked David. At first he's a little strong, but once you get know his character he's actually not a bad guy a bit overwhelming at times.

We also found out that she use to have a crush on Cameron, but became angry when he knocked up her sisters child. She still held on to this resentment. However, there is more behind how her sister ended up with a child from Cameron. We cant forget to mention Camerons daughter, Alexia. Boy that girl is trouble. Being thrown into immediate father roll hasnt been easy and he says some hurtful things.In the story, we see Cameron trying to build a relationship with his daughter and draw closer to Josette. We have these two relationship develop. This a good story, because we didnt have Cameron and Alexia instantly bonding. Instead we watched them learn to trust one another, and that wasnt the easiest thing to do. After all, Alexia is practically a wild child during the book, and had to learn boundaries. On the romance part, we didnt have Cameron and Josette jumping into bed right away, but you say the attraction between. I would like to see them to get together sooner, but it was a nice simmer between the two. If it wasnt enough to find out you have a long lost daughter, but throw in the fact her uncles are former enemies. *Snickers*Overall, Josette is a mix of Louisiana goodness. You get see a lot through this story along with the new relationships Cameron is making. We see New Orleans, but we also get to see the scary part of the bayou. Plus, you have secrets reveal that concern Josette and her brothers. I hope we get to see stories for Josettes brothers and a few other characters. Kathleen does an amazing job on transporting you to Louisiana that you might have a hanker for some toufe. Yep, Josette is a pretty good read.Copy provided by Zebra via NetGalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WK48569KXY79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT312Q#wasThisHelpful","R2WK48569KXY79","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every time I see this title I think of Asia's Heat of the Moment, and I even sang that part in my mind as I was reading The Heat of the Moment. I have to say that the story is a sweet read, because we don't have Jessica and Gavin jumping to bed with insta-lust. Actually, they build a nice friendship. They both are attracted to one another, but Jess was burned by an ex who just happen to be a baseball player. Basically, she threw every ball player in the box = PLAYER. That's a horrible generalization. Yes, there are some guys are totally like that. Poor Gavin getting lumped into PLAYER category. He had to prove that he was a good guy.Seriously, poor Gavin. He's was an All-Star bound to make a big name until his injury. He ends up getting traded and gets dump by his girlfriend. During first 1/3 of the book he's pretty mopey. He was bringing me down. However, Jessica started him that it's not the end of world and he could end up back on top.Most of the book is a sweet read, because they become friends in the story and they stay friends for 80% of the book before even cross into couple territory. Jess friend zone the poor guy, because of douche of an ex who was too full of himself. We watch Gavin learning to take things slowly in everything going on his life. It's not steamy like the last book, but still a good story. Overall, The Heat of the Moment is a feel good kind of story.Copy provided by LoveSwept via NetGalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FS1VEH93YEIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKWAJSO#wasThisHelpful","R1FS1VEH93YEIO","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never knew how much I would have loved Ryker's book until I started it. Ryder's story has a lot going on with it. When we first met Ryker, he wasn't in a good place. He had just got transfer and he's getting up there in age when it comes to hockey players. However, by the start of his story he's starting to put the pieces to his life back together. We see him as a great father and astounding goalie. We also know that he's loyal to those he respects, and he respects Gray Brannon quite a bit. She's the one to get him out his situation in Boston, so he's loyal to her. Not only that he has the hots for her.I love that Sawyer writes strong female characters, but that they aren't overly strong that they cross into bitch territory. They are strong and capable at accomplishing things, but not afraid to ask for help. In Ryker, Gray is given an incredible opportunity to become a GM of Cold Fury, not only that but one of the first female. Ground breaking in the world of hockey. Being a male dominated sport she's going to be under a microscope for every decision she makes for the time. Yeah, a lot of pressure. Gray is an awesome character.Even though Ryker and Gray's relationship has to kept on the down, they are one hot couple. However, we couldn't just have the secret relationship be the only issue, we have to toss in the ex-wife factor. Boy Hensley isn't a likable character, and she tries to manipulate the situation. Fortunately, Gray handles her like a pro and I love Gray even more.How can you go wrong with a hockey player, and woman who knows how to play with the big boys. Let's add a little drama with the team. I think this happens to be my favorite story in the Cold Fury books. Ryker is just so damn lovable.Copy provided by LoveSwept via NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SP1MRE8PBMRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OXC0#wasThisHelpful","R2SP1MRE8PBMRS","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You gotta love when the sexy beefcake is a genuine good guy with a little bad boy inside him, a perfect combination if you ask me. Yep, Connor is a great combination, but I do have a soft for the guy since The Return of the Bad Boy. He's just a funny guy, who loves to kid around. At the same time he has this seriousness about him that he has seen more than he would have like to have seen. Connor is a fun guy who loves to tease, and absolutely loves teasing Faith. Now Faith is a sugar fiend who just came out a relationship, and starting to believe she's cursed in the love department.Anyway, Connor has a crush on Faith and Faith doesn't want to get into a new relationship. Man that totally sucks for Connor. However, the guy is persistent, and not in the annoying way more like I will be here if you need me kind. Faith has her own issues. For instance, Faith believes in order to be independent she needs to do everything on her own, and if she has a man in her life she has to change her personality to fit him. Okay, if you have to do that, the guy is not right for you. When she was with Michael (douche bag ex), she wasn't herself, so she's afraid to be with anyone else. This fear plays a huge part of the book. She keeps a fence up when she's with Connor. Connor does the same, but his fence is a little easier to climb than Faith.Oh my goodness, Faith and Connor are one hot couple in A Bad Boy For Christmas and a lot of fun.

"Let me start that I enjoy Katie Lane's books. They are filled with great characters that fun and lovable. However, I had a fear about this book when I met the heroine. Oh boy, Jacqueline Maguire isn't an easy character to love. Actually, I was afraid I was going to crack a tooth cause I clenching my jaw so tight. She infuriated me with her behavior. At the beginning of the story, she seems like this money hungry woman who just after her inheritance and would do anything to get it. She sounds like a real winner. However, once we get past her motives and get to know her, she actually is a surprise and sweet caring person. She's someone you could like, but getting to that part is rough. Trust me, I seriously wanted to jump in the book and beat her. Then we have the confirm bachelor, Patrick McPherson. He has no desire to marry or have a family, but fate has other plans for him. It all starts one Halloween night. I like Patrick, because he's just straightforward and gruff. He's not an easy guy to penetrate his walls. Yet, somehow Jacqueline does.These two characters are like oil and water, but somehow they mix well together. Jacqueline is a dreamer with an overactive imagination that gets her into a little trouble, while Patrick a stick in the mud (seriously that's probably the best way to describe him). Anyway, they need to work out there issues cause Halloween night left a bun in oven.All right, Unwrapped is a pretty good story about two people that need to learn to compromise and work together, which isn't easy for either party. Why not toss in a little holiday magic, because it seems to find it's way into the story. You have McPherson clan that just adds so much to the story. It wouldn't be the holiday's if Aunt Wheezy didn't find herself matchmaking or trying to solve everyone's problem. So, sit back grab something to hold onto, because this holiday read make you realize that family shenanigans are just part of the holidays.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VKY5SCYBR2RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0BDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VKY5SCYBR2RF","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a way to kickoff a new series. In A Little Thing Called Love we meet to Fyclan Morris and Jennifer Tarleton. Now Fyclan has gone into this belief that he would find the one woman that is suppose to make his world complete, and he finds her. Now Jennifer is this beauty that is suppose to save her family from ruin, which isn't easy because they view her as an oddity. Granted she was blessed with looks, but she has intellect. We all know that is looked down upon, so she has to keep her true thoughts to herself.I love A Little Thing Called Love, because we have two people who are star cross. Jennifer's father wants her to marry for power and wealth, believing she could save them from ruin that he has cause. She realizes that she's nothing more than pawn. Her family treat her abominably. However, Fyclan views her as a treasure and should be treated like so. I love how he finds a way to show her that his love is true. Seriously, he's what a true hero is made. Even though it's a novella, it's a beautiful love story that gives hope that true love will conquer all.

"Yesterday, I finished Dance With The Devil by Angela Dennis, and I liked this story a lot. Okay, we have Carrick and Jillian who are both running from their past, but they both get called home. They didn't know they were technically enemies until they reach their pride lands. When they return chaos is in the air and Jillian needs to pretty much assume the roll of Alpha. However, she never thought this to be possible since she's a half-blood. Man there is a lot of politics that go into this pride. She needs to find a mate, and the conclave has chosen one for her. However, it's a little late, because she had accidentally mated with Carrick. Boy does it all get all kinds of crazy when she needs to ignore that she mated with Carrick and pretend to mate with his brother Lucas. Say what. Yep, and this is for the good of the pride.Jillian is faced with the challenge of staying with her actually mate or try to mate with Lucas for the good of the pride. Definitely, a hard choice. She's always been consider an outcast by her kind, but she's willing to protect them from whatever course.I did enjoyed the story, but it did have me biting my nails at times. It's pretty intense at times and sitting there hoping she picks Carrick. There are so many risk factors if she chooses Carrick, and she weighs all the options. She does have wonderful friends that help with her choice. I like how they break things down so she can see that it would be a disaster if she didn't stay with Carrick.Dance With The Devil is a great start to Angela's new series. You see the politics of the pride and how they are challenge on all sides of the story. We have Jillian and Carrick trying to see what is the best for everyone, which isn't always the easiest. By the end, we have a happy ending for Jillian and Carrick, but at the same time gearing up to face the conclave. Not a cliffhanger per se, but leads to the next book. By the end of Dance With The Devil, I'm clamoring for the next book, because I want to see who gets mated next and what happens with the concave show up. Cause they are not going to be happy with certain events. Now I have to wait and be patient. Ugh. Other than the issue on waiting, Dance With The Devil is a pretty good read, and Angela does a pretty good job building this world with lion shifters.Copy provided by author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XMKOXGJC8U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CEIPLC#wasThisHelpful","R12XMKOXGJC8U2","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Worth the Risk:I liked this story, because we have to former lovers reunited. They fell apart, because of ambition and pride. Now they get a second chance, but the question is will ambition and pride separate Dean and Sam again. It sucks to be them, because they are both pitching their ideas to Dean's father. They both still have lot of chemistry, and is it enough to keep them together after everything is said and done.Yep a quick little read, and these two are great together.Risky Surrender:I actually thought Risky Surrender was a delightful read. Basically, you have a nice story line that isn't too complicated and works well to give you a satisfying ending. Sometimes novellas can be little rush to get to the happy ending, but Robin manages not rush the story. Honestly, it has a nice pace. Lucy and Keats are great together. One thing Lucy isn't fawning over Keats, because he's rich and handsome. Instead she's trying to go under his radar. Yet, Keats isn't going to have that. Actually he wants to help Lucy, but she just needs to be forth coming in whats going on in her life. They do have a great dynamic together.Overall, an enjoyable novella. So, if you are looking for a quick read that isn't too rushed, you might want read Risky Surrender.His Million Dollar Risk:His Million Dollar Risk is an adorable read. Oh my god, such a cute story and makes it cute is Charlie. Her enthusiasm is infectious. The way she sees Route 66 is like a child seeing an amusement park for the first time. Her joy spreads over to Connor. Now Connor is a stick in the mud. At the beginning of the story he's rigid and unmovable, and totally has a hard time with Charlie. However, he lets loose and starts seeing things like Charlie. Yet, there's a slight snag in their budding relationship, he believes her to be the reporter that's suppose to interview him. Whoops.Oh my goodness, His Million Dollar Risk is so freaking adorable. Charlie is adorkable. No one can help falling in love with her, even Connor.One Night of Risk:One Night of Risk is a little more steamier than other stories, but still a pretty good read. We have Malia who is trying to find hope for her mother in a form of a crystal. However, there are risk to getting this crystal like the fact that it's on sacred ground and it's protected. Yeah, it could be a problem. The other problem comes in a form of a former lover who works for the company that is trying to protect this area. Yep, good times. At the time Clay broke Malia's heart he thought he was doing the right thing. Silly men.Anyway, steamy yep. Reunited lovers, yes. Is there happy ending for these two, it's a romance it would be pretty crappy if there wasn't. Anyway, one of the sweetest ending that choked me up.Overall, the bundle is a pretty sweet deal, because you get three previous novellas put together with a new story. We actually met Clay in His Million Dollar Risk. All the stories tie together in one way or another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXWL2NQQINBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140Q31UU#wasThisHelpful","R2IXWL2NQQINBR","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OH MY GOODNESS, AMAZING! I absolutely loved Rescued By The Ranger by Dixie Lee Brown. I had a rough time with the beginning, and a lot of that stemmed from heroine, Rachel Maguire.She totally rubbed me the wrong way, and the reason was she feared for Garrett Harding life. There were times I wanted to shake and tell her ""He's an Army Ranger they just don't let any guy be a Ranger."" So, you could see my frustration. It was good portion of the story that I just wanted to smack her upside her head. That wasn't the only reason I had a hard time with Rachel, the other reason was she wasn't willing to forgive Garrett for something he didn't know about. Basically, she formed an opinion that he was a selfish jerk. The poor guy had to prove to her that he was a good guy. She didn't make it easy.Now you are wondering why I loved this story when I couldn't stand Rachel. Excellent question. It was Garrett and his pal Cowboy, they truly won me over. Also the last six chapters had my heart pounding. Garrett and Cowboy showed Rachel that they can be their for her and anyone else that needed him.So, for the majority of the story we had Garrett trying to prove to Rachel that nothing bad is going to happen and she needed to trust him. Trust is not an easy commodity for Rachel to give, and its a good portion of the story for her to give it to Garrett. Once we hit the last six chapters, talk about a twist in the story. I didn't expect to see the stalker. An excellent twist to the story. We know that their is a stalker in the story, but it's not who would expect to be. I was kind of shocked. Those last chapters really had my heart pounding. The big lead to the end was just amazing. Definitely worth the read.Rescued By The Ranger is definitely worth a looking into. Yes, I did have issues with Rachel and I struggle with her character. However, the story is just amazing. I love the interaction between Garrett and Rachel, because she didn't easy up on Garrett. When she was dishing him crap, he took it like a standup guy, because he could understand where she was coming from and he wanted to prove her that he was good guy. I hope we get a story for Garrett's brother and possibly a few other characters more.Copy provided by Avon via Edelweiss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GV43YQTJ2XW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6TVQ8A#wasThisHelpful","R37GV43YQTJ2XW","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, y'all fans of Toni Aleo or Sawyer Bennett Delayed Penalty is a milder read than those two. So, if you are looking for hot, crazy shenanigans this might not be for you. However, if don't mind a sweet story, this is right up your alley. Okay, we got that taken care now lets dive into the story.All right Delayed Penalty is written in first person, and we spend all the book in Auden's mind. So, we get go through all her feelings and what is happening in her life especially when it comes to Aleksandr. We get to know Aleksandr the way Auden sees him. We watch Auden views on Aleksandr go from douche bag guy to love interest. She has a hard time with Aleksandr, because she doesn't know if he's being genuine. Which takes him a while to tear down the walls she has built up over the years. Truthfully, Delayed Penalty is pretty easy going throughout the story, we don't see a lot of drama. We see some emotional break throughs with Auden, which aren't that easy. However, the drama does escalate towards the end of the story. We need to have a reason for Auden and Aleksandr to have a sweet ending.Overall, Delayed Penalty is a pretty good story. However, I wished we were able to dip into Aleksandr's mind. I think it would been nice to see what he was going on in some areas of the story. This also not so heavy in the romance department. I think a lot of it has to do with Auden not being emotionally ready, and I do like how Aleksandr was patient with her. Yes, Delayed Penalty is a sweet story. Once Auden and Aleksandr got over a few bumps they were cute and sweet together. I do  look forward what Sophia will bring to the rest of the series. There is one character I would like to see how she will write (if it happens), and that would be Pavel Gribov cause the few times we see him he's not very nice. We a little better understanding about his hate towards Aleksandr. So, if you are hankering for something sweet and hockey read, Delayed Penalty might be right up your alley.Copy provided by LoveSwept via NetGalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJX5W35VNFAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7O6#wasThisHelpful","R1GJX5W35VNFAZ","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a fun time reading A SEAL's Temptation. First off, we have Sara deciding that her friend, Lark need to end her dry spell. I mean 17 months, 11 days, and 9 hours is a bit long for not having any bed fun. Who better than to get her brother, a HOT Navy SEAL to solve Lark's problem. She just happen to have a birthday coming up to convince him to come out. Sounds all logical. That description just makes the story sound so much fun.I was laughing out loud as I read this story. Oh my goodness, it was hilarious. We have Shane who doesn't want to go home, but his sister asked so nicely. It's hard for him to be home, because his mother. Bless her heart. She has a hard time with Shane being a SEAL that she has convinced herself that he's a traveling salesman, and her daughters have let her do this. WHAT! Dude, that's pretty jacked up. It's a huge deal that he's a SEAL. However, we get an understanding why he's ""traveling salesman"" not that it makes sense, but it helps his mother cope. At same time it causes strain on their relationship. Moving on from Shane's family trouble. What made laugh out loud was when Lark meets Shane and word vomit starts flowing. An example:""If you liked the muffins, you'll have to try our sugar cookies. Everyone loves the. They're soft and sweet, but everyone says they get a guy hard and horny.""Lark didn't realize she said anything like that until she looked at friend's face. Priceless. We have little things like that in the story that makes this so fun. There is more to this book than the sex deprive Lark and having fun with Shane. Both of them have deal with personal issues. For instances, Shane doesn't believe that a girl is going to want to be with him, because he's a SEAL. What I mean is they aren't going to handle some of his assignment. Truthfully, it's not easy being with a military guy and it certainly takes a special kind of person to deal with all that it entails. Lark is still dealing with her mother's death and hasn't fully overcome her guilty. This causes a little strain on their relationship. Another factor is Lark believes that the thing between Shane and her is only for fun.Overall, A SEAL's Temptation is a fun read. I enjoyed the story between Lark and Shane. This left me with a smile on my face.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3XOVFEO9FP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVWX5CO#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3XOVFEO9FP1","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved the first book in MacIain books, so I was super excited to read Scotsman of My Dreams by Karen Ranney. However, it kind of fell flat for me. Scotsman of My Dreams is still a good story, but the problem I ran into was the pacing. I had a hard time getting into the story. It felt like I was racing a turtle as I'm reading Scotsman of My Dreams. It wasn't until it got a little over halfway through the story that it started to pick up.Other than the pacing the story is really good. We have Minerva Todd who is in search of her brother, and she has gone to the Earl of Rathsmere, because he was the last person to see her brother alive. Now Dalton MacIain, Earl of Rathsmere, is wallowing in self pity. He's a hollow shell of his former self. Use to be known as this notorious rake who did what he please, and he was so full of himself he decided to take off to America and fight in the Civil War. Yes, that's such a brilliant plan *eye rolls*. Anyway, he comes back practically blind, secludes him, and wanting to forget the whole American incident. However, he won't get any peace until Minerva finds her brother. Now they need to work together to find her brother.Oh my goodness, do these two get on to one another's nerves. They bicker a lot. Not really bicker, but more like point out one another flaws. We have Minerva who sees nothing but a rake, and Dalton who sees a harridan. That right there makes this an interesting read. As the story progress, they start to see one another in a different life. However, they still have to deal with Minerva's brother, who Dalton believes tried to kill him, and Minerva trying to get him to listen to what he has to say before jumping to conclusion. We see that inner struggle. At the same time we have someone in the background who is trying to hurt Dalton.Overall,  Scotsman of My Dreams is an all right read. Other than the pace of the story, plot is pretty good. I did like that we have an older sister looking out for her younger brother; it's always nice to have a champion even you don't believe you need one. I enjoyed the banter between Dalton and Minerva, because they try to needle at one another. I also like that we have a hero who once was consider a perfect specimen of a man to fall and wallow in self pity. I like that Minerva was able to pull him out.Copy provided by EdelweissRating:3 1/2 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187ZVKLCVQFJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFOBLK8#wasThisHelpful","R187ZVKLCVQFJT","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been reading You're the Earl That I Want by Kelly Bowen. This is a third book in The Lords of Worth series. The stories have been good and cleverly written. They really aren't your typical romance. In todays selection we find a girl who has been in love with her brother's best friend since she was little. If that wasn't all, we also find ourselves in the midst of danger, so lets get started.Heath Hextall, the new Earl of Boden, he has decided he needs a wife. Not just any wife, but biddable, kind, quiet, who's not cause havoc in his life, pretty much a boring wife. He has asked his best friend to find him this woman. Of course, the Duke of Worth accepts this challenge. Now we know Hextall's main goal. However, it's thrown off course a bit with a murder and Josephine Somerhall (Joss).Now Joss is an awesome heroine. She might be a bit on the wild side, but she has a good heart and clever. She has this ability to be able to do anything that she puts her mind to it. She also has this vulnerability, but she refuses to let anyone know, especially Hextall.Why I liked You're The Earl That I Want? First off, we have two people that would complete each other, but one doesn't see it. Instead of letting it affect, she decides to press forward and help Hextall in solving the problem that landed in his lap. Poor Hextall, he's just too honorable at times, and letting the wait of the earldom weigh on him. Good thing he has Joss by his side. I liked the light (very light) suspense that was the story. All they are trying to figure out why Gavin Smythe was murder, but they find themselves in a bit of danger since they started to uncover something bigger than what they expected.Overall, You're the Earl That I Want held my attention through the story. I found myself wanting to read a little more. I love the interaction between Joss and Hextall. I mean they were a fun couple. I was a little worry that Hextall might pick the wrong girl, but thank goodness it all worked for everyone. So, if You're the Earl That I Want sounds like something you might like, give it try.Copy provided by the publisher","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M12MSK5KV2QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145558388X#wasThisHelpful","R3M12MSK5KV2QE","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I basically spent most of the early morning (before the sun had the decency to grace us with its presence) reading Andrea Laurence's Seduced by the Spare Heir. I have to say that I enjoyed the story immensely, and it has me wanting to go back and read the other stories from the other authors that are part of this dynasty collection. Anyway, in Seduced by the Spare Heir we meet Gabriel Montoro (Gabe) who is about to have his world turn upside down. He is now forced to be come the King  of Alma after his father is no longer in line, because he didn't followed the correct procedure in a divorce and his brother abdicated the throne. Lucky him. Now he has change his playboy ways and he's going to need help. Fortunately, he knows someone who can help him, Serafia Espina. Now Serafia use to be a model, but her career was cut short due to health issues. Now she's teaches young ladies or whoever in need of help in decorum.Yes, Gabe is selfish, but he's the second son and normally they live a life whatever goes. However, we learn that he used to follow the rules until an incident that happen which changed his attitude. I can't fault the guy for being a bit selfish and willing to do whatever he wants to get his way. Then we have Serafia who was working her way to the top of modeling when her heart gave out. She actually had to learn how live again. I liked how she helps Gabe to become the man his country needs. I liked the story. I actually, like how Andrea incorporated Serafia health problems to be anorexia. It's something you hear about, but we kind of gloss over because the thing that is talked about is obesity. Anorexia can be just as scary. I knew a guy who actually died of health complications due to anorexia when he was younger. I liked that Andrea was able to work issues into Gabe and Serafia. I did like that they weren't perfect, but looked on the outside. Looks can be deceiving.Overall, Seduced by the Spare Heir is a pretty good story. I did enjoy how Gabe decided he needed to fix things with Serafia and make everything right. Like I said it makes me want to read the previous books in the series, and the future stories.Copy provided by authorRating:4 1/2 Stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGKG5OB5DB0FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFSL9KY#wasThisHelpful","RGKG5OB5DB0FU","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a feeling that the Still Harbor stories aren't going to be an easy reads. What I mean is that they might be a bit emotional. We meet three sisters of the heart in Falling for the P.I., and they have bonded when they met at a shelter. Each of these women have a past that might be little dark. However, we are focusing on Kate Abbott (Alex McAllister and Cara will have their own books).Now Kate is a sweet woman who cares deeply for her adopted daughter who happens to have Down Syndrome. However, she has no social life outside of her sisters and the kids. So, Alex and Cara thought it might be time for Kate to have some fun and find a guy. She stumbles upon Matt Lane. Matt Lane is a private investigator who doesn't do relationships. However, he's drawn to Kate and is willing to take a chance. When he finds out she has a kid, he's still willing to see what happens next.Sounds pretty simple, right? That's what you are led to believe until we dive deeper into the story. Kate's past isn't an easy one. Actually when we find out the truth behind it, it's pretty rough, and we grasp a better understanding behind her mistrust with cops.I liked this story, because we have Matt who is a decent guy, but Kate past kind of puts up roadblocks in the relationship. Actually, one of guys that Matt knows is the leading cause to Kate's issues. I know super vague, but I just don't want to give too much away. Anyway, I just adore how Matt is understanding to Kate and her daughter. Overall, I found Falling for the P.I. a sweet read. It might have taken sometime for Kate to trust Matt, but he was patient. He definitely won me over with his patience. It's a feel good book, but towards the ending is a little rough with Kate's past being reveal.Copy provided by Entangle via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MH7FGH78VA9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105POSMK#wasThisHelpful","R1MH7FGH78VA9C","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked most of Not Always a Saint. We have widower who is trying to keep her daughter safe from her wicked cousin. She's willing to marry anyone that is kind and willing to take her daughter and herself and love them. However, the task is not always easy, especially when you have striking beauty. So, this is the problem Jessie is dealing with.We have Dr. Daniel Herbert who just found out he inherited a barony. He's not too thrill about it, because he concern about his medical practice. So, he goes on the search for the perfect wife that isn't gorgeous and vain, but can be a helpmate. However, when he comes across Jessie he's struck by her beauty. Yet he was willing to toss her aside cause she's too beautiful. Good thing he got to know her a little (key word a little scandal ensue).I liked the first part of the story with the chase of Daniel and Jessie. We have two people who are attracted to one another, but find each unsuitable per their needs. Jessie doesn't want a young husband due to her jaded past. Daniel doesn't want a beauty, because he's afraid that she might vapid and no help at all. When I got to the middle I felt the story stall a bit. We have trouble stirring at the beginning and it sort of fizzles during this part. The middle is calm even with the coming to terms of the past it's still pretty mellow. As we approach the ending the story picks up again and danger arises. We see the trouble that was at the beginning reemerging.Overall, Not Always a Saint was an all right read. I guess I wish the middle a little more engaging. However, I don't know how we could possibly make that happen. However, this is just my feelings. There are others who absolutely love this story. I did like how Daniel stood by Jessie's side when she went to confront her past. I actually thought it was sweet.Copy provided by Zebra via NetGalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17LE8SMRXGOS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDYVA8S#wasThisHelpful","R17LE8SMRXGOS5","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I found Here All Along to be a sweet romance. Here's why:We have Gideon who has been in love with his best friend for sometime, and he would love to see it progress. However, Sarah (Red) doesn't want to ruin their friendship. Also she's his personal assistant. Basically, Gideon would do anything to have at the more than friends level. While in Vegas he has Gabe kind of talk him to letting him help win Sarah over to his court.Truly a sweet story about two friends that love one another, but afraid to move from the friend zone to lovers. It's scary transition, after all what happens if the relationship sours. Eek, no more of anything. We see Gideon taking his sweet time with the situation, but moves a little quicker when Gabe enters the picture. Actually, Gabe is like the catalyst to it all. In some ways it's good, and others it's like he needs to be smacked upside the head. We also have Sarah who has been picking up the pieces of her life after it spiral out of control. She even has a plan called Operation Independence. She wants to feel like she has her life in order before pursuing a relationship with Gideon.Okay, there are somethings I wish were part of the story: For instance I think it would have been helpful to have a prologue of what happen prior or the night of the accident. However, this just my thought. I kind of wish that she didn't fall off the wagon, and handle the situation a little better than she did. Then again some of the things that happen in the story might not have worked as well.Overall, Here All Along was a pretty good story. We have friends to lovers, overcoming the past, and happy ending. However, I did like when Gideon punched Gabe. Seriously, it had to be done. So, if you are looking for a feel good story, you might consider Here All Along.Copy provided by author via Tasty Book Tours","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QV7N6M82GMRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLNDHAC#wasThisHelpful","R1QV7N6M82GMRA","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mix feelings about What To Do With a Duke by Sally MacKenzie. I liked the story. It's actually a pretty creative idea, I mean you have Marcus, the Duke of Hart who is living with his family curse that once they marry they never get to see the birth of their heir unless they marry with for love instead of money. So, he's trying to his death sentence as long as possible, but he starts the feel the call of settling down. Sucks to be him. Then he finds out he needs to go Love Bridges to find a new spinster for the Spinster House, which becomes a big mess of an ordeal. Instead of one candidate there are three. One being the delectable Miss Isabelle Catherine Hutting (Cat), which happens to be related to Isabelle Dorring.Anyway, in What To Do With a Duke we see Marcus drawn to Cat and vice versa. Yet, Cat doesn't want to tie herself down to the Duke, because he truly believes in the curse. Marcus believes he should be happy that Cat turned him down, but he feels empty and kind of lost. After all, so many young ladies have tried to capture Marcus knowing about the curse.Like I said the story is pretty creative. Now you wonder about my mixed feelings about the story. There is a lot that actually goes on What To Do With a Duke, we have three friends that want the Spinster House and they pretty much would go to any lengths to get the home. I don't care what anyone else says, but girls can be mean vicious even with friends. If some tells you otherwise they are LYING. They are a bit contentions between Cat, Jane, and Anne. We also find Marcus trying to convince Cat to marry him, but she's a bit stubborn at times through the story. I understand why she saying no when she wants to say yes, but it gets drawn out a bit. By the end of the story, I wasn't sure if I quite believe that their is a curse, but more like a series of unfortunate events that happen to the Duke of Hart. I'm hoping that we get the true answer to what happen to these dukes by the end of the series. What To Do With a Duke is a good story with an interesting premise, and leaves me curious to find out what happens in the next book. I truly hope that Marcus and Cat can break past the curse and live happy-ever-after.Copy provided by Zebra via NetGalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SU4VCQOB6A4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420137123#wasThisHelpful","R39SU4VCQOB6A4","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's always good when a story can put a smile on your face, and Truly Sweet certainly does that. We have finally arrived to final Wilder boy, Jake. Now Jake has just returned from the sandbox and has no clear direction to go. However, he knows that he's damage goods can't save anyone, after all he lost his best friend.Now Annie has been loved with Jake forever, but she would never really reveal that. Nope she rather exchange barbs than reveal her true feelings. Yep, we hide those feelings just in case they don't reciprocate them. She also has to lookout for her son, who is the most important man in her life.Truly Sweet is definitely a sweet read. It will have you laughing out loud and make you feel all sort of feelings. We get to watch Jake try to avoid his feelings for Annie cause she's just not a one time kind of girl. We watch Annie trying to be the friend Jake needs. Good thing they see that it's perfectly fine to fall for one another. One of the things that helps Jake is:""Verbally giving it life changes a lot. Admitting the truth. Lashing out at the unfairness gives you the power to fight back. To breathe. To live. To find happiness you might never have imagined.""However, true to Wilder men standards it takes Jake a few tries, and he's lucky to have Annie who is truly patient. In essence Truly Sweet definitely has that sugary sweet ending that makes you wish there was more to come, but all things must come to an end.Copy provided by Avon via Edelweiss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESSJI8QR31T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006235115X#wasThisHelpful","R1ESSJI8QR31T2","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every Dare book I have read, I have enjoyed. Dare to Rock definitely rocked as a read. Basically, this is a reunited lovers story. We have Avery and Grey who use be a couple in high school, but Grey wanted to make it big in the music world. So, he left everything behind without looking back. Which was pretty crappy on how he handle Avery. He realizes that he was wrong and now he needs to go back and fix things with Avery. The question can he do it?Yes, this is one hot read, but the story is pretty awesome. We have Grey trying hard to win Avery back, but his super-stardom is kind of getting in the way. His manage isn't too happy with his decision  on leaving, so he's being a bit of a challenge. Seriously, Simon is a sleazy guy, and would do anything to keep Grey inline. Not only do you have the hot and heavy parts, but you have Grey trying to combat Simon's actions. Definitely a challenge within itself. We also have Avery, who isn't quite sure if she could trust Grey. After all Grey did abandon her right after high school without looking back or try to make contact.I also liked the secondary characters, because they bring to life what is going on in the story. You have Ella who basically stands by Avery when she needs her best friend for that sounding board. We also have Lola who is like a sister to Grey and is willing to have his back. However, my favorite part is when daddy dearest comes in making Avery and Grey's issue about him. On some level you have to admire Robert Dare for his ego, on the same hand you just wish someone would knock his lights out. Just wishful thinking there.Dare to Rock is a pretty good read. If you love a rockstar that wants to come home and try to win the woman he left behind. I was a little disappointed on the outcome of Simon, but I still enjoyed the ending. A nice touch for a happy ever after.Copy provided by the author via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SM27GSAAO83Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990584186#wasThisHelpful","R2SM27GSAAO83Q","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must be on a runaway bride theme, because this is the second book I have read that had that theme. Okay, we have Alyssa like some brides have pre-wedding jitters. However, she has been ignoring the nagging feeling, and her friend/assistant is like ""Dude just call off the wedding."" Of course, she doesn't until she overhears something that just isn't right. Like the fact the Nate is getting paid to marry her. Yep, pretty jacked up, and she tries to break it off with him and he goes all psycho. Yes, Alyssa needs to escape and she calls in the favor to Hunter, her best friends brother and long time crush. This is the gist of the story, and they are trying to figure out why Nate wants to marry Alyssa so bad.I think this story needs to be broken down to two parts of focus, if that makes any sense. We have the relationship between Alyssa and Hunter, and the threat Nate is causing to get his way. We need both in order for the story to be really pulled off. Take one away and you are left with a dull story. Basically, we see the budding romance between these two while Nate is being a terror. Alyssa is all for getting with Hunter, because she's had the hots for him forever. However, Hunter is dealing with his own demons and he doesn't know if he can handle being a normal person. Seriously, being normal is overrated. As they get closer, something happens that triggers Hunter to pull away. He has a fear that he will go on sniper mode and scared Alyssa away. At the same time we have Nate, making threats to get his way, and he's willing do whatever to get his way. Clearly a sociopath. You don't find out why he's doing all this till the end. It makes total sense in a nonsensical way.Overall, I enjoyed Exposing The Heiress. I did like the relationship between Hunter and Alyssa. I like that Hunter try to put his feelings on hold to try to protect Alyssa. You get to see Alyssa painted as this princess who does whatever she wants, while the truth she's pretty selfless. Plus, you get to see a slimy bastard getting taken down.Copy provided by Entangled via NetGalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIWEBWTU18Z91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM591MC#wasThisHelpful","RIWEBWTU18Z91","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to read Kimberly Dean's Courting Innocence, because had elements that screamed read me. I mean you have Erin who believes the Luxxor is a matchmaking service instead of an escort service. I mean that's kind funny. Then you have the forbidden attraction with Colton who happens to be the Erin's brother's best friend. Can't go against the bro-code. See that's the making of a fun story. However, I didn't fall in love with Courting Innocence. There are some good elements to the story, but there were some parts that had me go ""What!?""I guess I should get the thing that bother me the most off my chest, which was her best friend working at the Luxxor and not being up front about it. Yes, I understand that she had to keep it on the download, but Erin was her best friend stuff like that goes to grave. No repeats stuff like that. On the same token, Erin would probably still be waiting to make a move on Colton. I still don't have to like that part. The other thing that kind of bother me was Erin and Colton's relationship. It felt kind of like a dirty little secret. Okay, I get it, it was about honoring the promise Colton made when he was younger, but take it like a man get punched in the face by the brother. Yes, I was thinking that. Those are my gripes about the book.The things I liked about the story. Even though one of my gripes was Erin and Colton's relationship, I still liked the relationship. They were hot and heavy when they weren't focusing on being each others dirty little secret. Plus, they were adorable. I also liked Erin's friends Sienna and Jason. I liked them so much I want to go back and read their story. The other person that played a big part in the story was Nina who was Erin's sounding board. Even though she was owner of Luxxor, she provided reason and a good friendship for Erin. Especially, when she need advice when it came to her relationship between Colton. I believe Erin would have left everything as the status quo, because it was something she wanted for so long. Why rock the boat. Plus, the ending kind of left me believing there might something in the future between Nina and a certain detective. Let's hope so.Overall, not a bad read. It was hot and sexy at times. Okay, majority of the time. However, I did have a couple of hang ups, but it's not going to stop me from checking out other books from this author. Plus, I want to see how Sienna and Jason develop, so I have to go back to Courting Trouble. Maybe I'll gain a better understanding on Sienna being silent on the whole escort thing.

"OH MY GOODNESS! Talk about a BER CUTE READ! I absolutely LOVED Right Wrong Guy by Lia Riley. First off, you don't have to worry if you haven't read the first book yet, because Right Wrong Guy focuses on Edie and Archer.Why I love this story? Honestly it has a lot of fun elements, and here we go: 1) Runaway bride 2) Sleazy ex-fiancee 3) Manwhore hero. Seriously, that fun it in itself. 4) Heiress 5) Small Town charm. So many ways you can take small town. That's a lot of elements packed into this read. Each of those elements make this story a fantastic read.At the beginning of the story, we find our manwhore of a hero, Archer Kane, with two women and he can't remember what the heck happen. Gotta love a manwhore (not really, but they make great heroes in books). Basically, the man is running for his life. While Eden Bankcroft-Kew (which is a mouthful to say) is having second thoughts of marrying her sleazy of a fiancee when she over hears him calling another person baby. Yeah, for ease dropping. She needs to make her mistake, before the smooth talking sleaze tries to talk her out of running. Of course, they meet by chance. Luck must be on Eden side, because Archer is from the area her cousin is living. YAY! I love their chance meeting, because this is the point wants to change. Later in the story he tells Edie:""All I want to do is be the kind of guy who is worthy of someone like you.""You have my permission to melt into a puddle of goo. Love Archer, because he wants to be the hero Edie needs. It's not easy for him, because living in a small town doesn't offer that luxury.I love small town stories, because you can go in so many directions. However, they embraced Edie, but she did find a little conflict with one Marigold. Fortunately, they were able to work the difference, and I hope Marigold will get a story. Just wishful thinking.What really won me over with this story was this particular quote at the beginning of the story:First off, life was no box of chocolates. Boxes of chocolates came with helpful identification charts that allowed you to choose the chocolate-covered cherries and ignore the nougat.Seriously, I have always hated that line from Forrest Gump. I instantly fell in love with Edie with that one quote. Honestly, Right Wrong Guy has everything that will make you fall in love with Edie and Archer and leave you with feel good feeling.Copy provided by Avon via Edelwiess","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFL3QW23MS5JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFXLEYI#wasThisHelpful","RFL3QW23MS5JI","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a perfect ending to a series. We have been watching as the mystery of Copper Creek has been unfolding. Which each book we draw closer to who killed Bear MacKenzie, and we finally find out who did it. Of course there have been clues along the way, but you really put them all together in The Legacy of Copper Creek. You start to see everything fall into place and go oh my goodness I think I know who did. At the same time you wonder if you believe what you suspected. So, that aspect of the story is awesome. Okay, now lets get to the lovey-dovey part of the story.I love this story. So, we get Whit who actually doesn't mind the solitude of being out in the high country where there is no where around. If you have been to Montana there is a lot of that. For a guy who likes his solitude he can get a bit grouchy when someone is encroaching on his area, especially when he's too tired. It was kind of fun to watch him stumble upon Cara and she's scared out her mind because there is this big burly angry guy coming into a cabin she was squatting in. Good times. She has been dealt some rotten cards, so she doesn't know how to handle the situation at hand. After all she's on the run from the guy with evil eyes, and she doesn't know if she can trust Whit. However, she slowly learns to trust him and he takes her to meet the family since she has no place else to go. Here is where she starts to blossom.I absolutely love Whit and Cara characters. You have Whit who likes his solitude, but he doesn't mind being around Cara. He finds his protective side coming out, once he starts to get to know her. He's an overall good guy. Like I said Cara has been dealt a pretty crappy hand. I have mention she was on the run from evil eye guy, and she screwed by some wealthy jerk, so she's a little leery when it comes to guys. However, that is not all. She's also creative and vivid imagination, but she's afraid to share that with anyone cause some jerk basically told she was a nobody.The Legacy of Copper Creek is a great ending to the series, because we find out the reason behind Bear's attack, and we have Whit and Cara who find each other. Both believing they wouldn't someone that would care so much about each other. We even see the things start to bloom between Willow (Whit's mom) and Brady (Ranch Foreman), but that has been in the works for a while. You kind of notice it the other books, but it's a little more clear in this story. Finally, there is a happy ending with closure (by the way the epilogue is sappy but oh so good. Very nice touch). Overall, a great read. However, I would suggest reading this series in order, because each book adds a little more to the piece of the puzzle on who killed Bear. Other than that the romance aspect can be read as a standalone (if that makes any sense to you all).Copy provided by Forever Romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18LI6LDR8O36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQYFAQY#wasThisHelpful","R18LI6LDR8O36","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I would strongly suggest reading the previous books in the series. Since we all know me and my habit of starting a series in the middle, I personally felt a little lost. However, I was able to figure things out, but it took a little time. So, I would strongly recommend reading the previous books, but that is a personal choice. Even though I felt a little lost, I was able to grasp an understanding of the story to enjoy.Anyway, in this story we are focusing on Linc and Risa. They are soul mirrors. Basically, they will complete one another and make each other whole. However, there are few problems with these two, both have to be willing to trust one another in order to make link complete. Yet, both of them have personal issues that might hinder this. For instance, Linc doesn't believe there is a woman out there he can fully trust. Mommy issues. Mother was a druggy that basically sold her own son for a fix. Yep, mother of the year. Risa comes with family issues and she used her magic to shield herself from the pain, which cause with some pretty gnarly consequences. Both of them have trust issue and in order curse to be broken they need to trust one another. On top of everything they have to get rid of a demon spawn. Linc also doesn't know that Risa is harboring the demon spawns baby. Oh dear this just got complicated.All right, I did have a little trouble get into Caged Magic, but I think it has to do with not reading the previous story. However, I did start enjoying the story when the action started to get good. I liked seeing the vulnerable side of both the characters. Each of them had to deal with there personal issues and learn to trust one another. I liked that it wasn't an instant love, but they had to work towards. I enjoyed seeing the secondary characters and they helped each of them helped Linc and Risa draw close to one another, I felt bad for Linc, because it just seem like the dude was suffering from the worst case of blue balls in history until he mated with Risa. True be told I kind of want to read the previous books and I can't wait for couple of the other characters to get their happy endings or as close as it can be.Overall, Caged Magic is a pretty good read, but strongly recommend reading the previous books. So, happy reading.Copy provide Author via NetGalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW968XQA1YAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MO0NTG#wasThisHelpful","RW968XQA1YAH","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is possible to be just friends? In Chasing Jillian, we see Seth and Jillian develop a friendship. Actually, I thought it was extremely cute on how Julie went about to write this story. So, we have Jillian who is a little overweight and would like to change that, but she doesn't have the funds so she goes into Shark's weight room. She ends up getting caught by Seth and he's gruff and kind of scary. LOL. Seriously, I would probably crap my pants. Anyway, he kind of puts her at ease. Not really, because he's a hot guy and she sees herself a frumpy nobody. However, she wins him over with her charm and their begins the an unlikely friendship.I adore the story, because we have these two characters who have an unlikely friendship that slowly blossoms to something more. I mean SLOWLY. Each of them develop feelings for one another, but they don't know how to deal with it. Which causes them to stay in the ""friend-zone"" longer than necessary. However, it was important that they stay in this zone for more of the majority of the story. You wondering why: 1) Seth had just ended a relationship 2) Jillian is a little self-conscious and doesn't believe a guy like Seth would want her. A lot of Jillian insecurities stem from growing up in foster care. It's hard for her to overcome these insecurities.These two are just so adorable, because they do everything together. I love that they developed a friendship, before diving into relationship this showed what they really wanted in life. The friendship helped Seth see that he was willing to let Jillian in his life. Overall, Chasing Jillian is an adorable read. If you are hankering for a football player and a friends-to-lovers story, you might have found the winning combination in Chasing Jillian.Copy provided by Avon via Edelweiss","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLYMUQI0MT29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEYI3CS#wasThisHelpful","RTLYMUQI0MT29","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I enjoyed The Highlander's Choice. Truly a wonderful story. I don't know where to beginning with my thoughts on this story. So, we have Lady Sybil and she has some personal prejudice against the Scots. She totally believe's that they are overbearing barbarians and her friend doesn't know what she's getting herself into. However, she comes to realization that they are just like her. They we have Liam who also has person prejudices against the English and that their woman are nothing but silly air headed women. Like Sybil he learns he's beliefs are incorrect. Okay, they make it over one hurdle and he wants to marry Sybil. Now this is where the story gets interesting. Oh boy, I would rather take my chances with wolves or even the Loch Ness monster than deal with Liam's mother.Prejudice starts at home. I personally think Sybil was just uneducated on other cultures, because her family is unique when it comes to differences. However, Liam's family has years of prejudice and his mother didn't help the situation. Personally, I wanted to strangled the woman. Oh my goodness, there are few characters I want to cause bodily harm and she's one of them. She was a bitch. She makes Cinderella's stepmother look like a saint. Awful person and she made no attempts to be nice. I have to give Sybil props because I would have said screw this I'm out of here. Sybil was trooper when it Liam's mother's torture. Poor Liam was walking a fine line he just wanted to keep the peace.Anyway, I enjoyed The Highlander's Choice, because it was good story that showed two characters overcoming prejudice and finding what matter most, love. Even though love is the answer to overcome prejudice, it's not always easy. I did enjoy Sybil and Liam's relationship because it didn't come easy, and they had to work through their issues before they found their happy-ever-after.Copy provided by Entangled via NetGalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16A8FAH0ZK5T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7USAE2#wasThisHelpful","R16A8FAH0ZK5T0","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating 4 1/2 StarsI have enjoyed this series immensely, and The Maddening Lord Montwood is definitely the perfect ending to the series. I adore how Lucan story reveals so much more that relates to the series and gives the insight of why the wager was made. Actually, the insight why Lucan needed to win the wager.Throughout the series we saw Lucan as the main instigator when it came to trying to push Rafe and Gabriel into marriage. We actually don't see a lot of them in Lucan's story. They are there, but they don't play a huge role into the story. The story focuses on Lucan, Frances, Lord Whitelock, and Hugh Thorne (Frances's father). There some twist to the story I didn't see until the end.The Maddening Lord Montwood is trying to help Hugh Thorne, but he can't tell Frances anything cause of the slime ball Lord Whitelock. Whitelock manipulates the situation for his benefit, but no one knows. Throughout the story he's described as""he's too good to be true. Never heard a bad word so much as a whispered about him. No one is that crisp and clean on the outside without a wrinkled soul on the inside.""Personally, he reminded me of a snake in the grass, I don't like snakes, and he gave a creeptastic vibe. We slowly learn about Whitelock's character. However, Frances doesn't believe he's an evil guy at first, but slowly starts to realize.I adore Lucan and Frances. I like that we got to know Lucan a little better. He's charming, but it's an act. I like that deep down he cares about people. He goes out on the limb for Hugh, but he doesn't tell Frances the whole situation. Frances is an interesting character, because she took all the lessons of her mother to heart. However, she does get blinded by Whitelock's character at first. Snaky like. I'm so glad things started to click together.Like I said, a perfect ending to the series. We have a snaky villain, and hero that doesn't consider himself a hero. Yet, when it boils down he saves the day and gets the girl. This can be read as a standalone, but I think it's funner to read in order. Take a chance on Montwood and watch him take on the challenge that is Whitelock.Copy provided by Avon via Edelweiss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WOXAS4C27JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTSRCRA#wasThisHelpful","R7WOXAS4C27JX","A1I5JKKMD84DRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I5JKKMD84DRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Serious issues installing side marker and fog light guards. Fog light guards simply will not fit on my 2009 Jeep Wrangler Sahara. Needed to remove air dam (no issues, except broken fasteners). When installed according to the instructions, one is supposed to use the old screws to reinstall the lights. Problem is the stock screws are way too short, and as another reviewer noted, the silver bumper insert prevents installation (Rugged Ridge DOES say that on their website)Side marker installation instructions are so vague as to be useless. Again, the fit of the guard puts serious strain on the marker lens with the possibility of damage. Tip: don't have to remove the light lens, pull away the light housing and slip guard in place...just BE CAREFUL not to crack the lens.The rear, headlight and turn indicator guards all were a breeze to install -- though the turn indicator guards need a bit of manipulation. These guards look great, but the side marker and fog light guards are very difficult to get rightLike many do it yourself automotive products, ease of installation is the key to successful completion.

"I really wanted to like this but the combination of stereotypical characters and unlikely plot development made the Pilot a disappointment. Throw in the gratuitous skin scene and it reminds me of the early made for cable movies that required at least one topless actress per hour. This is Chris Carter? C'mon the dialog is too forced to be from the same guy who created the witty repartee of the X-Files. The ending was a shocker and yes, I would watch more to see if the characters develop beyond their shallow beginnings. Lots of hooks...but the writers need to step up.

"I loved this wrap so much I ordered a 2nd one!  I keep it in the freezer and always use it cold, to ice a sore knee or shin after my long marathon training runs. Believe me, I have SO many ice packs, and this one is THE most comfortable I've ever used. It is so soft and fits so well, I hardly know it's on! I love that the velcro closures adjust to basically any size you want. So it would fit a kid as well as an adult who has a huge leg. It's not only good for knees, but also shins, ankles, arms as well. There is only one thing I found a bit annoying about this. The inner gel pack has seems that are very wide and scratchy/pointy.

"I decided to try this on the recommendation of a friend. Well I suppose we have very different tastes, because I just could not take this one. First of all, it did not mix well in my blender bottle. Secondly, the aftertaste was bad.  I tried mixing it with: water, regular milk, coconut milk, and almond milk. And I even added things such as chocolate syrup, orange juice, or vanilla.

"I am a runner who (after rolling foot on a twig) ended up with a partial meniscus tear, and bone bruising.  After several weeks of rest and recovery, when I was able to start back up running again, my doctor recommended a knee brace. A friend of mine had this same brace and liked it, so I decided to order one. I don't know what I'd do without it!!!  I tried various types of braces and none of them were as good as this one. It is very supportive, comfortable, doesn't slide down, and fits well. It does not bunch up or pinch the back of the knee like some others did.  I ordered a size S and my knee circumference is 12 in. under kneecap.  I really like the silicone grippy line inside that helps hold it in place. I've been running and training in this regularly for the past 3 months now with no problems. I've even run 2 half-marathons with it on, and don't even notice I am wearing it! But I am sure if I did not have it on, I would end up with pain.

"I am recovering from a femoral bone contusion and partial meniscus tear that happened while running. I was cleared to run again by the doctor, but have to wear a brace for support. I have Mueller's other model of hinged knee brace, and just bought this one because I thought it would be a bit shorter and less bulky for summer, since they do tend to get sweaty. It is not really shorter than the other one, though.  I like that you can just wrap it around instead of trying to pull it on like the other one I have, which is pretty hard to push off after it gets all sweaty inside. However, this one does not stay up as well as their other (pull-on) hinged brace.  I think that is because it does not have the silicone grippy strip around the inside like the other brace. This one also does not fit as tightly, so I found it to be less supportive. I don't have huge legs (my knee circumference is 12"" under kneecap), and it is hard to get the straps tight enough (there's just not enough velcro fabric to adjust it that small). The only other thing that I did like was that the side hinges are removable and there are 2 slots for them (1 for XL size, and the other for smaller sizes, closer to the kneecap).  I may use this for some occasional walking, but will return to my other hinged brace which works much better for running.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOS8S504VF96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00267SFKM#wasThisHelpful","R2BOS8S504VF96","AY1NUCXXJ5WD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY1NUCXXJ5WD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very soft and comfy socks. However....  on short runs (1-2 mi.) they were fine. As soon as I wore them on a longer run, they slid around so much I ended up with blisters (and almost worn-through socks) at the arches. I never have this problem with socks made only of wool and nylon. But I think because there is less wool in these (50% vs. 65-70% as in some other brands), combined with the ""nanoglide"" and lycra in these, it makes them smoother and slipperier in your shoes. And for me at least, this causes blisters on longer runs.

"I really wanted this magnetic sleeve to work. I am having knee issues with a partial meniscus tear and badly bruised knee bone, so I decided to give this a try since I've read some things about the positive effect of magnetic therapy.  When I received this, it was a little large for me (one size fits all really stinks). It did not fall down, but was just too loose I think for the magnets to get close enough to my skin.  Being that the fabric is very stretchy, it could have easily been 2-3 sizes smaller and still fit my 12"" knee/calf.  That being said, I figured if the magnets were strong enough, it might still be effective. So I decided to test the magnets for polarity. Everything I've read states that North side of magnet should face toward skin. What I found with this sleeve was inconsistency. Some magnets were North, and some flipped South. In addition, one of them was not even magnetically charged enough to register a polarity!  Considering where the product was manufactured, I must say the lack of quality does not surprise me, especially since this was not an overly-expensive product (""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind). However, I really was hoping the magnets would be of greater strength after reading some other reviews on this. After wearing it for an entire day, I can't definitively say that it has helped much. But I will give it a try for a couple more days and update this review if I find any obvious changes.

"WHAT WE LIKED:Bought this for daughter's sleepover parties. She is 12  years old, and 5 ft. tall. This fits her nicely, without being too big like the adult sized bags seem to be. It is not as small as a ""kids size"" bag. It's just in between, and perfect for someone her age. I am only a couple inches taller than she is, and I even crawled in it and found that I could also use it! It feels warm and comfy. The inside is satiny so it will also keep you cool in warmer months. It is easy to zip/unzip, and an easy size for a kid to roll up. It unzips fully flat so it could even be used as a comforter. My daughter loved the hot pink colors and the little interior pocket. I machine washed this on delicate cycle, cold water, in a machine with NO agitator, and it came out fine. I put it in the dryer on very low setting about 30 mins, then hung it to air dry the rest of the day, and it still looks like new. Very nice bag for the $40 price point!WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE:As with most sleeping bags, the sack they provide is never big enough, so you have to roll it up very tightly to stuff it back in -- which is pretty hard for a kid to do! So I ordered a larger (24"") stuff sack here on Amazon, and that worked much better and prevents it from getting wrinkled/ruined.  The only other thing we don't like much is that when you roll/unroll it, you get a lot of static electricity... it's like a dust/lint/hair magnet.All in all, I'd still recommend this bag, and would buy another (if it came in a different color) for my other daughter, because Heaven knows they can't have the same color bag! *gasp*I think anyone who buys this bag would be happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DD1RD1GGBM1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3WKR4M#wasThisHelpful","R1DD1RD1GGBM1K","AY1NUCXXJ5WD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY1NUCXXJ5WD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this to flip my huge sized pancakes, and it definitely fits the bill for that. I was not a fan of silicone turners because they were always too flimsy for me. But this is metal covered in silicone, giving it more strength. And after many uses, so far there are no issues with any melting. I also like the ""normal"" size handle. I was never a fan of OXO's overly-large handles (nothing ever seems to fit in my drawers because of those huge handles!!). But this one is not overly-large.  The description does have an error, however. It states the size as 11 x 5.

"None of the sacks that came with any of our sleeping bags are ever big enough to easily fit the bags back into. Huge problem when the kids have to do this themselves! So we ordered these, and they are the PERFECT size for a regular size sleeping bag, or a kids' size sleeping bag with a pillow on top of it! My daughter went to her first sleepover and had no problem fitting her bag and pillow back into this bag. Love it!!!!! I ordered several so we'd have one for each of our bags.  The only thing I am deducting a star for is because the cord could be thicker. I can see in a couple spots where the cord is wearing/thinning after opening only a few times and could possibly break somewhere down the line.

"Astonishingly, those words are uttered by Leonard (Martin Landau) to Phillip VanDamm (James Mason) as he warns his suave, impossibly handsome boss that he suspects Mr. VanDamm's mistress  (Eva Marie Saint) to be a double-agent. ""Are you jealous?""  VanDamm responds. True, I never noticed that homoerotic angle until I watched the movie a second time. Although NORTH BY NORTHWEST is ostensibly a ""wrong man"" chase thriller,  Hitchcock is a master of telling good stories laced with an undercurrent of sex and desire...second to none. How the director suggests ... rather than spell it out explicitly...has always made him a superior director than just about anyone today.And the Bernard Hermann score is heart-stopping - one of the best fusions of music to film in the business.  Just minor alterations of tone, pacing, and volume changes moods from mysterious to romantic to dangerous and back again. The music can make you grip your seat.In the last 50 years, no action movie has topped the desperate escape attempt on top of Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock captures the scene as if the very souls of the Great Presidents were helping Cary Grant in his patriotic mission.There are precious few movie lists that won't have this film among the top 100.

"The bells are tolling to wake up the town that a witch is being hunted down.  Herlofs Marte, an old herbal healer, learns that she is the prey, she is the one, and she slips out a door to desperately seek shelter. But she won't escape.To whom does she turn?  She goes to Absalon Pedersson, a respected pastor and village elder of the town who once before saved a woman accused of witchcraft. That time he did so in order to seize as his wife the teenage beautiful daughter of the accused.  Herlofs Marte has nothing to offer but a threat of exposure for the minister's indiscretion.  He does not protect the old woman.  The horrible pain of torture compels her to gasp ""yes"" to anything the village elders ask her to admit - no matter how ridiculous. ""It is a good confession"", one satisfied elder remarks. So she is sentenced to be burned alive.  This is the fate she fears more than Heaven or Hell. The minister approaches - like a shadow or even a vampire  - past a black cross. He tells Herlofs Marte ""I have come to prepare you for death.""The elders and the town folk gather to watch the burning of flesh, almost like a holy celebration.  Another elder of the Lutheran church is leading the choir boys to sing at the event.  As the ecstasy of music is perverted so are the morals of society twisted in assumed service to God.  We hear the excited crowd anxious to experience the spectacle.  One elder, in dissent, refuses to watch and leaves. But all the other village elders remain, including Absalon Pedersson.  After the innocent old woman expires in torment, he writes in balanced handwriting, gorgeous penmanship, ""ON THIS BEAUTEOUS DAY, HERLOFS MARTE WAS SUCCESSFULLY BURNED AS A WITCH. GLORY BE TO GOD.I can't think of any other film that better illustrates the appalling self-righteousness of men who murder in the name of their chosen ideology.  In every respect the film is timeless ... even though it plays out ostensibly during 1623 in Northern Europe.  Astonishingly the film was actually made when Denmark was under the Nazi boot...and likely Jews and Resistance Fighters were hunted down with the same efficiency and self-righteousness.However this film is not only about Herlofs Marte but about the family of the minister. At first we believe his young wife (Anne) is humble and courteous. But underneath her skin, she burns with carnal desire which cannot be satisfied by a husband nearly 50 years older than she is. The unfriendly, plain faced mother of Abasalon Pedersson considers her son's lustful marriage to such a pretty young girl to be a scandalous thing and the mother further resents and resists any threat to her personal domination of the household or of her son.Call it inevitable.  When her husband's son Martin (the offspring from an earlier marriage) returns to the home, Anne sees a man who is  nearly her age, handsome, interesting, and virile. He is the type of man a young girl would long for in her dreams....and she admits as much.  Anne seizes the opportunity to seduce Martin so she can taste joy and sex and a sensation of being alive. Like a gorgeous plant, she flowers.  ""Hold me, make me happy"" she tells her men.  Short lived.  Eventually she confesses the affair to her husband and, when pressed, tells him that she secretly wishes he would die.  The shock of learning about his wife's adultery, her incest, and the shock wave of her explosion of repressed feeling causes a stroke, then death.  To be expected, the terrifying forces of this oppressive society will attack Anne like a black storm.One of the important aspects of this masterpiece is that every major character has strengths and flaws...and that the film can be interpreted quite a few ways.  When Anne causes her husband to die, she starts to wonder whether she - indeed - has the power to control the life and death of individuals...as a witch might.  Her mother was said to possess this power. Those who practice voodoo today profess to own this power.This story could have been told by anyone...but in the hands of an artist like Carl Theodore Dreyer he creates an experience of drowning, a struggle to breathe just above the waters of a warped, nasty society.  Not a scene is wasted. The actresses dominate the screen among the straitlaced men. More than that, the movie is beautifully framed like a Rembrandt painting where the characters move just a little and then a little more.  No director has greater ability to tell a story with so little movement. A haunting gesture. A telling laugh. An enigmatic glance. The austere black and white cinematography is essential because it corresponds exactly to the starkness of a religious culture where happiness is sin and even the dress code is just about pure black.  At the beginning of the film, Herlofs Marte tells her patient that the herbs she has collected have come from under the gallows.  She reflects ""There is power in evil.""  The purpose of Carl Dreyers' film is to force us to confront this and prove the opposite....""there is power in good.""  But that must need wait for another day, not the Day of Wrath.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29XS7HCPSNMHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BTP2NK#wasThisHelpful","R29XS7HCPSNMHS","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film grows on you...or possibly more accurately, closes in on you.  It is the intense claustrophobia in the quarters of a submarine - brilliantly filmed in black and white, that is unforgettable.  So the more I think about it, the more I like the movie.The movie is clearly influenced by the short masterpiece of Jean Paul Sartre's ""No Exit""  (French translation - Huis Clos) in which a group of people who can't stand each other are forced to live in close quarters with no exit.  They are in Hell.  This unsavory collection of Nazis and Nazi sympathizers boards the U-Boat in Olso to escape from the Allies as the war is just about to be lost.  Some of the characters are a sadistic SS officer, his young homosexual lover and petty criminal, an Italian industrialist, a Swedish nuclear scientist (and his unwilling 17 year old daughter), a Nazi general, his mistress, and a French businessman.  However, each individual has his or her own selfish agenda.  When the submarine boat faces difficulties, these agendas manifest themselves and the individuals kill off each other or themselves, one by one. On the journey, the sailors and the crew learn that Hitler has died and the Germans have surrendered.  The different reactions by various characters is fascinating.  Some sailors are overjoyed that they can now go home...but others still want to pursue a neo-nazi future.One of the themes of the director Rene Clement is to provide a microcosm of the evil personalities that conquered France during the War or were ready, willing, and able to assist the Nazis.  In the midst of all, an innocent doctor is kidnapped and brought to the submarine to provide involuntary medical assistance to the General's mistress; he plays the role of a captive desperately searching for an opportunity to escape.I give the director five stars because - no one before or since - has created a mood of claustrophobic panic better than he has within the dimensions of a submarine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGM1KO3DOZ4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3XMIS8#wasThisHelpful","RHGM1KO3DOZ4T","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is it possible? In the 20th century, the best singer of the Arab world was really Jewish and homosexual?  Yes. And not only that...he survived Nazi persecution because of the aid of a Muslim religious Imam of the Paris Mosque - Si Kaddour Benghabrit.This is but one of the story threads of a movie focused on the assistance offered North African Jewish refugees by the Paris Mosque during World War II, defying the Nazis and bringing these two groups together.  In my view, with the renewed possibility of peace between Palestine and Israel, it is valuable to learn that these two groups should, indeed must learn to live like brothers again.Most of the movie centers around a young Arab man, interested in making money in the black market of Paris, who develops a conscience in his encounter with Salim Halali, the singer I began this post talking about.  It is not a perfect film - think of it as an Arab/Jew version of Fascist Resistance in the mode of Rosselini's Italian Neorealist classic - ""Rome - Open City.""Don't let me forget to say that Arab music permeates just about every frame of this film - and that is the best part for lovers of this genre.

"For as long as I remember, I watch this film every 5 years.  Something about the imagery pulls me into its alternative world, unlike any other movie I have experienced.  (Yes, that is the right word).  Mirrors that turn into water...mirrors that can seize a life...mirrors that reform themselves after being broken.  Magic?  Not quite.  Dream? ... absolutely.Like the Song of Songs where ""Love is as Strong as Death"", both the Biblical Poem and the Film use dreams within dreams to fuel our imaginations and desires. In Jean Cocteau's vision, Death is incarnated as a beautiful but mysterious women dressed immaculately in black and white. (These reflect her association with the ETERNAL FEMININE, the colors of the MOON). She commands - and others must obey.  But once she glimpses Orpheus (played by the impossibly handsome Jean Marais), she herself falls in love. The forbidden act of love induces Death to violate the rules of her other world, to bring Orpheus back with her, and to go so far as to orchestrate the death of his wife.  Ashamed by his lack of attention to his wife or, more likely, drawn by an inexplicable desire for death itself, the poet Orpheus voluntarily passes into the hidden underworld of Death - perhaps to comprehend the other, perhaps to fulfill his own wish to escape an ordinary life.I disagree with Roger Ebert who opines that the female who incarnates Death should have been played by Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich.  Had that been so...the personality of Death would have been mixed with the personality of one of these stars of the silver screen, With Maria Casares, we experience her anew, untainted by other associations. Part of the charm of the film is that Death herself is vulnerable to but one thing, and that is love.Maria Casares as Death does not commit any misdeeds personally.  She gives orders to two leather clad minions on motorcycles who literally take the lives of others. They remind me of Nazis, emotionless, who unthinkingly carry out the commands of their higher-ups. Nevertheless, DEATH herself is not All Powerful. She is required to obey orders from above and is even  answerable to Judges if she does not.  Orders are passed from one being to another, so that the ORIGINAL source of the orders becomes unknown or unknowable. Ultimately, then, this becomes a religious film because it involves GOD, but never shows him. As for DEATH, is she a CHRIST figure?  She sacrifices herself so that others may have life.  Or perhaps the film might be interpreted as the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal spirituality.There are other important symbolic references.  Although the film has a timeless feel, nevertheless it was written at a certain time and place -  The bureaucracy of the underworld is set within the (actual) bombed out remains of France's officer military academy.  (Imagine an American film set within the actual bombed out remains of West Point - and you get the idea).  One organization that gives and carries out orders replaces another organization that gave and carried out orders.  In addition, the ruin of that military school reminds the viewer of France's initial failure in the war.  Is the resurrection of the poet, at the end of the film, then a resurrection of FRANCE itself after the occupation.  The film works on so many levels.In five years, I will see the film again.  My mirrors will show death at work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXNW1SPSNFT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005152C82#wasThisHelpful","R1SXNW1SPSNFT4","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the 1990's, both my parents took a whirlwind tour throughout the Far East.  When they returned, I asked them what they thought of Japan.  My dad adored the country...but my mother told me this was her least favorite destination.  ""Why?""  I inquired. My mother responded that Japan was the most patriarchal culture of all the ones she visited...and she certainly deplored any (mis)treatment of women as second class citizens.The director Kenji Mizoguzhi obviously shared my mom's sentiments...and this theme permeates most of his films. In thinking about the director's life, he was deeply disturbed that due to failing finances, his sister was literally sold to be a geisha...yet she helped him greatly in his early career - sacrificing herself for a male of the family. And he never allowed himself to forget that moral debt.Now to the film itself. Except for the framing sequence, Oharu starts her adult life as a valuable court attendant for the Imperial Court. Alas, she allows herself to be seduced by a man of lower class and even falls for him. This relationship violates feudal standards so much that it triggers a disturbing future of humiliations, one after another....from being a concubine forced to bear a child for a lord and then discarded, to becoming a high priced courtesan, and (near the end of the film) to becoming an aging street walker begging for clients. One of her unhappy fates is to be rewarded with a glimpse of her son ascending - who is a powerful lord - yet be prevented from meeting him.  The hidden subtext of sex is common throughout the series of vignettes...since it is sex that starts the downward spiral.  One of the factors that makes the film extraordinary is the exquisite acting of the lead actress Kinuyo Tanaka, who maintains a quiet, resigned dignity of Buddhist acceptance of her painful fates. The essential theme, the contrast between her true self (a good human being) versus her public self (a cheap and immoral human being), is masterfully established. It is important to note that not all indignities are committed by men...often women are equally unjust to her - and in some cases, the men come to her rescue.  She even has a brief, happy marriage that is interrupted by tragedy.The cinematography is absolutely stunning...sometimes with interesting angles from above which allows the viewer to imagine himself or herself as an angel in the sky. So many frames are perfect in terms of composition and lighting - that the whole is breathtaking.  And this remains true, even though the movie proceeds at a slow but deliberate pace.  When the film ended, I was more profoundly moved by it than by the better known ""Sansho the Bailiff"" or ""Ugetsu"".  In my book, it deserves to be listed among the top 100 masterpieces of foreign film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CG566IC91R47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEIOH8C#wasThisHelpful","R3CG566IC91R47","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I can say about this film is that I was smiling all the way through.  Although it is many years since I went to college, this one really hits the mark.  It works so well because it avoids many of the usual teenager cliches and actually attempts to view the experience as it is really ""felt"" by the characters.  Another ""plus"" for me is that the University itself is based upon the University of California at Berkeley.  Because here I went to law school and my offices are nearby, all brings back good memories.Despite the many interesting monster characters, three stand out.  Mike is the student who everyone picks on. His success depends on applying himself every day for school through hard work and study. Obviously, he does not have the look of a ""scarer"" and thus has to work harder (and smarter) than everyone else. (Students who are a little ""different"" from their fellows will definitely relate to him).  ""Sully"" is the jock in the class, a true monster with natural talent but he cares little for actual studying. It's likely he was admitted to university because his dad was a famous student. When Mike and Sully eventually become roommates, they seem a mismatched pair...who don't even like each other.  But they learn and grow and find ways to respect the other.  ""Dean Hardscrabble"" is the tough teacher who thinks neither of them have the ""right stuff"" to succeed and, boy, is she frightening in her own way. Helen Mirren injects real menace to her voice as a caterpillar/dragon figure. (Don't forget the librarian - who has some surprises of her own).  Every college student encounters at least one tough and mean professor - think Dr. Charles Kingsfield of the ""Paper Chase"".  The students at Monsters University must figure out how to survive under such an intimidating teacher. Mike Wazowsky plans on winning the annual scare contest to prove himself worthy. But...he has to assemble a team - including Sully - to win.  The problem is that most of the team members are weak...so each has to improve. Few cartoons make you care about the characters as people...this one truly succeeds in that department. Truly, Pixar's most impressive achievement with this feature is that the team developed true-to-life personalities for the ostensible monsters. That's why I prefer this prequel to the original.  Perhaps not as clever, but more down to earth.Another ""plus"" for the film is the attention to detail such as recreating the real look of a dorm room: The cheap desks, the posters on the wall, the bunkbeds, the claustrophobic feel of those rooms.  On the lawn, characters throw frisbees, the library is daunting, the celebration party in the fraternity illustrates the fun of the madness.  All the animators paid a lot of attention to their own experiences to make a college look right.Like many Pixar films - the humor is directed at the young, teenagers, and the mature - so there are connections for everyone.  Yes, this is a perfect family film and one of the best Pixar offerings in years.  I hope it finds a large audience. The ending is quite astonishing...with intriguing lessons for the viewers...but to reveal it might spoil the importance of seeing the film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O4GSU01ZMX52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUPLC#wasThisHelpful","R1O4GSU01ZMX52","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"100 years later, one can easily forget how difficult it was for a women to forge her own path through the obstacles of every societal norm. Indeed Leonie Gilmore was not only ahead of her time, but even our time.Leonie Gilmore - an educated female at the turn of the century - was not an idealogue, as let's say Emma Goldman. She was not trying to convert anyone to a particular point of view but instead trying to live her life - totally independently of the social values or patriarchal constraints of both the American and the Japanese world.The two leads Emily Mortimer (as Leonie Gilmore) and Shidu Nakamura (as Yone Nagachi) are exceptional in their roles as two loves mismatched in their views.  He is a poet of Japanese birth who is still tied to the customs of his world and believes that women should walk behind the man and even consent to being a mere mistress of someone important.  She is a fiercely intelligent woman who walks behind nobody. However the child actors in the film are very weak characters, and I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars for that deficiency in the movie.  The color cinematography is glorious, with an Asian flair for color and texture.Like the Japanese tea ceremony, this film has many ""moments"" that made me reflect on important societal issues.  Leonie's mother is entirely self-sufficient in California on a farm, rooted to the earth, but fails to appreciate the importance of a father/male influence for her grandson. Leonie gets pregnant from another man, after moving to Japan, but refuses to tell her husband who the father is.  Leonie recognizes the artistic gifts of her son, and urges him to follow that path, even when he thinks that medical school is the better choice.  Leonie returns to the land at the end of her life...becoming unified in spirit and mind, with her own mother.If you can consider this film as poetry, rather like a sequence of Haiku poems, it will interest you.  If you expect fast dialogue or narrative movement, it will disappoint.

"The problem with Westerns is that they glorify the ""gun"", marginalize women, oversimply characters, and reinforce racial bias.This film does none of these things.I could easily argue it is the best Western ever made...and certainly the best in black and white.  I could not take my eyes off the screen.  As some have noted, the cinematography is outstanding  - the scenes of grey trees against white snow covered hills might have been taken by a Zen photographer - they are that good!  And the scenes in the interiors have that ""anxious claustrophobia"" that we usually identify with film noir.  (Andre De Toth was known for his skill in making noir film).But the best parts of the movie, along with the cinematography, are the performances by the character actors.  Neither Robert Ryan as ""the hero"", nor Burl Ives as ""the villain"" quite fit their labels.  They choose to act - either well or badly - depending on the moment or the crisis at hand.  When Burl Ives (as the leader of a gang of sociopath bank robbers) arrives in town, he protects the women and children...but only up to a point.  Mortally wounded by a bullet, he has to decide the fate of the small town, not anyone else.  Indeed Robert Ryan starts out as a villain himself, and then decides he did not like what he saw in his personality and decides to change.When the bank robbers insist on dancing with the women and get very aggressive with them, the visual experience of observing such naked violence against women is more distressing than most rape scenes in cinema.In every sense, this is a tense, fascinating, psychological thriller that just happens to be set in a Western landscape.

"There are very few full length animation features that tackle the social issues of living under totalitarianism.  I can only think of two - this film and  ""Animal Farm""  the British cartoon from 1954. Both use animals to show the harsh nature of these social realms.  The story in the British film is easier to follow ... but ""Le Roi et l'Oiseau"" is richer in meaning.This film is so loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale, the original is unrecognizable.  The tyrant - monarch King Charles of Tachycardia uses mechanical gadgets and spies in black coats to find and quash any threat to his power.  The irony is that the ruler is actually killed by his own picture - and the picture becomes alive and turns into the same tyrant.  (The symbolism makes me think of Stalin and Mao, rulers who insisted their portraits be put up everywhere).  Two of the persons he has ordered captured are the only other characters who have magically come alive from their paintings. They are in love with each other but the King desires the woman for himself alone. Will love triumph? Can the monarchy be overthrown?The castle of King Charles has endless chambers and trap doors...and operates as a complete city.  The animator is not only critiquing modern style communism but old style monarchy.  He would fit in quite nicely as part of the intelligentsia during the French Revolution.Overall, the animation is brilliantly colorful and endlessly creative...with the crow (the L'oiseau) being the voice of conscience in mocking the King. As others have noted, the language is ""French Only"" as there are no subtitles.  Since the story is superbly revealed through the animation itself, it should be relatively easy to follow the narrative.Recent animation from Pixar or Disney are far less ambitious.  For something entirely unique in the genre...I can highly recommend this offering","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3741JVMY4JG80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009XZTTA#wasThisHelpful","R3741JVMY4JG80","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crazy birds, competent animation, and particularly a smashing South African soundtrack....this is one of the lesser known films for the whole family.  This is a movie where the story unfolds only between the animals.A young falcon (Kai) is brought up by his father bird alone in an African desert, but dreams of becoming independent and meeting friends.  His father is anxiously overprotective, wants to isolate the young bird from danger, but ultimately Kai learns that somewhere in Africa there is a ""bird oasis"" - a world where birds flock and are safe from harm.  Dad (Tendai) knows about the bird sanctuary...but has never encouraged his son to travel there or learn from the other birds.  Curious.  Bored and lonely and rebellious, Kai decides to wing it on his own to see Zambezia for himself.  Here,  the young fellow learns about his birth in Zambezia, falls in love, and struggles to prove himself worthy in the avian community.  But there are predatory birds and lizards who have other plans...for the falcon and for Zambezia itself.I reduced my score from 5 to 4 simply because the plot elements are predictable. Notwithstanding, the animation is done with panache and charm.Every once in a while, I don't want to watch ""Citizen Kane"" or some other profound, complex movie.  Just want entertainment - Think of this film as a fun adventure, and definitely enjoy the music!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JAN64GHUSMTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMLGEKK#wasThisHelpful","R2JAN64GHUSMTH","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are hundreds of films about the Arab/Israeli conflict, but this one definitely rises above the pack. A bottle from a 17 year old Israeli girl is thrown into the Gaza sea.  It is discovered by a 20 year old Palestinian man. The simple note inside the bottle asks the finder to email the girl if the bottle is found. Obviously, the girl wants to communicate to the other side of a war...and to understand someone as a person, not an enemy. (Later she is referred to as ""Miss Peace""). In every way, the acting by the two young people feels authentic to me.  The 17 year old girl has a boyfriend, has sex with him, but no real connection.  But through just the internet, and the will of their personalities, the two young people persevere to get to know one another.  Arguably, ""Bottle in the Gaza Sea"" offers some of the best teenage performance in years.This is not a ""coming of age"" film. Instead, it is a movie about two open-minded strangers who find a way to relate to each other as friends, despite the fact that so many in their lands prefer to stereotype the ""other"" just 80 miles away.  The brother of the Israeli girl is quite blunt about the stand he takes....them or us.  However, these two - tentatively - want to discover each other as individuals, not as Israelis or Palestinians, but as ordinary people with hopes and fears and struggles.  In so many ways, the film is universal in scope.  I don't think about it explicitly as an anti war film but rather as a movie to help us understand the humanity of the enemy, if we can escape labeling them.The scene where the male teenager Naim travels from Palestine into Israel, ALONE, through a maze of security checkpoints and procedures, could be considered one of the finest set pieces of world cinema.I also appreciated the fact that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians are lionized nor demonized.  In fact, their strategy of angry retaliation for violence, then retaliation again, and retaliation again...graphically and brutally illustrates the utter meaningless of that political approach.One caveat, though. The subtitles were very poorly done. I actually had to stand while watching the movie - so as to read everything.  Hope that problem can be corrected in a reissue.  In the 21st century, that oversight is inexcusable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SKP3EWQ88PEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009V0LRJI#wasThisHelpful","R3SKP3EWQ88PEC","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1916, New York City. When he died, there were 200,000 Jews lined up everywhere, even on lamp posts, to commemorate him.  America took notice that the Jewish community was large and could even be organized. It was now a political force to be reckoned with.  There would not be a similar outpouring of grief in the city for a Jewish person until Leonard Bernstein passed away.What makes this documentary so excellent is that it examines not only the personal life of Sholem Aleichem, but his impact on the world.  It explains that he was the individual who ""gave birth"" to Yiddish literature. Of course, it was the language of the street Jew, known throughout Europe, but no one thought of using that vivid language as a literary form.  (Israel chose Hebrew over Yiddish). Sholem Aleichem supported the new generation of Yiddish writers, and probably a million books were written in the language after him.  He communicated uncommon enthusiasm for the common man....so both democracies and communist  regimes celebrated his writing. One of the most fascinating aspects of his biography is that he did not teach his daughters Yiddish, considering that he was Yiddish people's leading light.  He taught them German and Russian to make it easier for them to assimilate. Real treats in this documentary are the memories of Sholem Aleichem by his grandaughter.He was a man whose fortunes truly fluctuated all the time...starting rich, then poor, then rich, then poor, then sick, then middle class. He failed in America, he succeeded in America.  His humor, best known through his character ""Tevye the Dairyman -  is tinged with tragedy.  This DVD states it best - that he was that kind of Jew who questioned his place in a changing society and like Job and Abraham (and yes in the form of Tevye) questioned God himself.All Jewish families with European roots should see this...but the story is truly universal. The Rotten Tomatoes website lists it as on its top 100 films of all time and while that is too high a score, nevertheless, it is the best documentary I have seen in years. The music is well thought out - and so are the 200 archival photos of Yiddish shtetl life that are necessary to illustrate the kinds of personalities that appear in Sholem Aleichem's forty books.  The commentators give opinions on why his stories touched so many souls, why he saved Yiddish, and how he used parts of his life experience to create unforgettable characters.  He saw the roots of the Holocaust in the pograms in Russia and described their horror. But he also could communicate infectious enthusiasm for the real dignity of the average man trying to make a living and raise a good family.  That is why Sholom Aleichem was popular when he was alive...he became an international success in the 1960's and 1970's...and he will always be popular in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFN7UL0WQOJOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6HHJNS#wasThisHelpful","RFN7UL0WQOJOA","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It seems nearly impossible. Take some really talented actors - William Holden and Lee J. Cobb and give them a film noir script.  Can't be ""that"" bad?  Alas, it is.Lee J.

"I am writing this review during the week that the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing two landmark cases on the right of gay and lesbians to marry.  But when this film was produced, homosexuality was definitely a crime in both Britain and America.Film noir is one of my favorite genres...but, to be frank, most of the stories are somewhat far-fetched...or the characters are types, such as hard-boiled detectives, corrupt officials, and femme fatales.  Not so with this film.Arguably, this is one of the most character-driven movies in the film noir collection.  Dirk Bogarde plays a well known barrister of the upper class who has received news that he is being promoted. But alas, at the same time, he discovers that he is the subject of investigation by the police as a young man with whom he is infatuated has just hanged himself over blackmail.  Although there is ambiguity whether the barrister ever performed sex with a man, there is no denying his sexual orientation.  The news devastates his wife, utterly.What makes this film so distinctive, in my eyes, is the acting. Just about everyone in the film is so believable. Gay men are discovered in all walks of life - upper, middle, and lower class.  They are all terrified of going to jail if they are discovered for being who they are.  I would argue that some of the best portrayals are the blackmailers themselves. One of them is absolutely chilling as a sociopath. I use the word chilling because he thinks himself as so clever if he succeeds in cheating others of their fortune ..and the other villain feels totally justified in hurting homosexuals to clean society....just as anti-semites justified the deportation of Jews to death camps.The discussion about the nature of sexual orientation is very advanced for the 1960's.  This is not only a landmark film but it is one of the most intelligent on its theme. I want to add that there is no depiction of any sex in the film because the issue is homosexual nature as a crime - not homosexual acts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLTKTFJE6VK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007ELDE#wasThisHelpful","RMLTKTFJE6VK0","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We hear this expression often enough, but is it true?  This movie explores that possibility - or reality -  or fantasy - in the life of a troubled man living in Persia - Nasser Ali Khan.Let's be clear, this fellow is not a particularly nice person.  He does not support his kids, emotionally or financially. If that is not enough, he is openly vicious to his wife, a suffering woman who tries her best to love him.  He dreams of making beautiful music, but does not have an instrument to play. And yet, there is more to the man...and his history.  Once, he was a great musician, whose every note vibrated with meaning. What went wrong?This film uses every technique in film - animation, live action, voice over, visits by saints or demons, forward narration, back narration, to give a full picture of, what shall I say - a life, a love, a desire to offer art to the world.  It is a beautifully looking picture.In my mind, it is an extraordinarily inventive movie. But it can be painful to watch because the subject is so hard to take. Most of the film involves the husband's decision to give up on life - and it takes him eight days to slide to oblivion. He just stops living...goes to bed, and refuses drink, food, advice, or comfort.I was terribly impressed that a filmmaker would even endeavor to make a movie on such a difficult topic.

"This film is a continuation of Michel Ocelot's  ""Princes et Princesses"". Both offer a selection of six short, brilliantly colored fairy tales in the style of The Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen.  The tales share a theme where the obvious choice of the hero or heroine is not the correct one...instead the right choice must be made from the heart, wisdom, and compassion.It is a matter of taste, but the story set in Africa was the most unusually beautiful and the one set in Tibet was the most conventionally pretty.  I found no appreciable difference in visual quality between the Blu Ray and the DVD.  What I have to discuss is the choice of voice options.  There are three - English dubbed,  French original, and French with subtitles. My strong recommendation is French WITHOUT subtitles...even for younger children.  Why so?  The English version is spoken by untalented actors - like most dubbed films.  And the subtitles for the French version interfere with the visuals. This leaves only the French stand alone option.  Lest one think this is unacceptable...the stories are simple enough to understand in a foreign language with the help of the animation...and the French is spoken beautifully.  After all, when I was young, I went to the opera and listened to the music without worrying so much about plot.  Michel Ocelot - as an inventor of stunning cartoons - is all about the VISUALS - as no animator has ever reproduced the kind of bold color designs he delights in.Recommended, yes...but oddly enough, this movie does not even come close to the first full length animation film ever made.  That movie (almost 90 years old) is a must see - it's titled ""The Adventures of Prince Achmed.""  Both use clever silhouettes against multi-colored backgrounds.  But the imperfections of the cut-outs in the older film give it a greater earthiness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P4P28K4520FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NP1ZVG#wasThisHelpful","R2P4P28K4520FH","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably the only film where a crocodile and a ghost sit side by side next to a river. ""Tabu"" is quite an oddball effort, divided into two parts - one is Lisbon in winter and the other is the steamy landscape of colonial Africa. Though both are in black and white, the African sections are filmed as silents, even using a different film stock to make the transition to an older time feel more distinct. The connecting link is the story of Aurora, now a dying woman who asks a friend to inquire about her former Italian lover.It's a film - like a moving impressionist painting -  about loneliness, longing, memory - of forgotten love affairs and dangerous places - in the world and in the heart.  Since this movie does not follow any typical familiar Western narrative structure, you simply will have to experience it as...texture, music, and mood. Portuguese ""Fado"" is like that.  I particularly looked forward to the African sequences which have no dialogue other than the old lover's monologue and background sounds, even some popular music.In summary, the director, as artist, is dramatizing how our imperfect memories reimagine the past. Now ""that"" is using cinema in a creative way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DH8U9BNPBNBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009K568WK#wasThisHelpful","R2DH8U9BNPBNBW","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This film wowed the critics when it first came out in the 1950's.  The extraordinary medieval costumes and exquisite color compositions dazzled the audiences.  Today, even Martin Scorsese ranks the movie among his top 10 of foreign films. It must have influenced so many Japanese directors when they attempted to create their own epics.Obviously, I prefer the masterpieces of Kurosawa or Kobayashi or Mizoguchi. This is a very good film rather than a great one. Nevertheless...this movie grows on you.  Other reviewers discuss the basic plot:  Moritoh, a warrior who quashes a revolt,  is to be rewarded for his bravery by the emperor's regent. He is asked to choose any gift from the emperor. During the revolt, he encounters the beautiful Lady Kesa, who is kind to him.  Like a fool, he demands that he be given Lady Kesa as a wife, even though she is already married to a lord of higher class.  Everyone asks him to desist.. but pride, madness, and desire prevent him from doing so.  He vows to destroy anyone who stands in his path and goes so far as to kidnap his prize. On the other side of the wall, rather than defend his wife from such outrageous conduct,  Lady Kesa's intellectual husband takes no violent action to protect her.The scenes are enhanced by the exaggerated dramatic, strong movements of Moritoh against the delicate movements of Kesa. Notwithstanding,  she is just as strong a character as he is.  I give this movie 5 stars because I felt this was Machiko Kyo's best performance.  Every gesture of hers can be studied for meaning.The ending of the film grabs me so much because it is pregnant with so much significance. Don't rush to judgment - think about it. There are secrets to the ending.Postcript:  The Blu-Ray  quality is marvelous - don't even think about seeing the movie in any other format.

"I have always thought that some of the most captivating art is hidden in childrens' books:  Jean de Brunhoff's ""Babar"" or James Thurber's ""Fables for Our Time"" or Marc Chagalls' ""Fables of La Fontaine"", Camille Rose Garcia's ""The Magic Bottle"", or Alice Provensen's ""Punch in New York"".This book is a quite a treat...as it deals with the themes of concrete urbanization and the need for hope.  In a colorless world, a young boy finds a single book on lovely flowers and is profoundly moved by it.  He gets some seeds, starts to grow a plant, and later discovers an unknown section of his neighborhood with green plants.  Although it is a simple story, it will resonate with young children who have grown up in projects and inner cities, and truly do not know the natural world.I know this because I was a deputy park assistant in one of the green parks in Manhattan when I was a teenager and was shocked that young children from the ghettos could not distinguish a snake from a worm!

"One thought kept tugging at me while I was watching this film...no way could an actor perform the way these kids did. Not possible.  These had to be the authentic, lost children of the streets. I was right.The movie is raw, gripping...most of all...intense.  The person who plays a gang leader who torments a few kids who dared to leave his gang is one of the most frightening persons I have ever seen on the screen.  The eyes.  When you see the eyes of a man who is indifferent to the suffering of others, you will feel a fear that is unlike anything else.The plot is simple, but the film is not simplistic.  When one of the kids is accidentally killed by a rock thrown by members of his former gang, his few friends decide to honor him as a prince...to give him a death equal to the fantasies of his life. To turn him into a sailor who sails his boat to a special island where there are two suns.  The kids really have no clue how to do this - but ultimately with the help of a captain of a small boat, they succeed.  No movie I have ever seen memorializes the significance of a ""proper burial"" better than this film. Subconsciously, it echoes one of the themes of Homer's ""Iliad.""Ali Zaoua ran away from home...partly because his mother was a prostitute, and he was ashamed.It appeared that she still cared for her son deeply, but I could not understand why she did not come back to fetch him from his miserable life on the streets.This movie pulls no punches about what life is like for a homeless child in an urban jungle - trading sexual favors for cash, eating discarded food, begging, stealing, selling cigarettes, sleeping under a filthy bedspread. All of this depicts an ugly portrait of poverty that Hollywood prefers its viewers don't experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FFRMA17LAYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006U0RQ6#wasThisHelpful","R18FFRMA17LAYD","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quite a few Asian films - Korean, Japanese, Chinese - explore the meaning of old age and specifically the cycle of life. This is one of the great themes of this film. The essential fact of this movie is that, through custom (and religion), the parents who reach age 70 are to leave the society and meet their end on the top of the Mountain Narayama. In a sense, it is both frightening and sacred. The cycle of life continues with the younger generation.Everyone who sees this provocative movie will talk about its striking visual beauty. But more importantly, it strikes a nerve - how should society allocate its scarce resources. Ironically, the fact that the old are left to die by exposure is not necessarily a statement that the elders are not valued by the society. The old are valued...but they need to recognize their function in letting the young take their place. The act of death, therefore, becomes a sacred rite. This is very vividly presented in the last frames.I am glad that this visually arresting film is now available in Blu-Ray. While the movie was remade by Imamura Shohei, I actually prefer the striking sets of this film over the more naturalistic settings of the other.This is a thinking person's film. It also depicts in visual form a very primitive society, letting us have a picture of what the world must have looked like 10,000 years ago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMG6HGPHF3HGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8QDHZG#wasThisHelpful","RMG6HGPHF3HGO","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nostalgia.If you have ""ever"" been a New Yorker and Central Park became part of your life, then this movie is right for you!Not only does this film have some of the very best color footage of Central Park that I have  seen, but it covers three topics very effectively...First what makes birders ""chirp"" ...so to speak.  How they think and connect to the natural world. Second, information that the entire park is a  landscaped fantasy, not a natural world.  Strange, when so much looks like it might have been wild New York back in the days.  And third, the essential need to preserve wildlife habitat - because the Park attracts 25 per cent of all the birds in the United States as well as many migrants because there are no other good places to go.There are four characters that play a role in the film.  The birders, of course.  One of them is an elder woman with cancer who has spent most of her adult life taking groups of people on bird walks through the park...despite the discomfort...revisiting her colorful winged neighbors gives her life an essential meaning. Every day with them is precious.  A second character is the seasons...the Park is shown through all the brilliant four seasons and the changing birdlife that one might see. Then there are The birds...lovely photographs of the birds that live or visit the park..and there are two hundred different species.  There is an amateur quality to the cinematography that actually enhances the enjoyment of the film.  These are pictures by a birder of the creatures he loves...not National Geographic or Disney homages to birds.  And lastly, the habitat itself.Though I live in California now...I grew up in New York. This movie made a difference to me. You learn about the ""unicorn effect"",  learning about a bird in guidebooks or audiorecordings, and then encountering it - for the first time - in the wild...Discover a new way of seeing the world...this is what the film is really about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CBK76P3GEJC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VRVGLK#wasThisHelpful","R1CBK76P3GEJC7","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a pagan, mythic quality to this film...even though we first meet the beauty Grazia in a Catholic Church.  True, her name means Grace, symbol of Jesus' power of resurrection and kindness, but the actress actually mirrors the image of the ""Three Graces"" of Greek mythology painted by the Renaissance artist Raphael. The resemblance is uncanny. Therefore, the film can be translated into both religious systems.As in Greek myth, Death himself is a personality. The Greeks called him Thanatos.  As Homer describes him,  he is a swift messenger who delivers corpses to new destinations. In the film, Death is originally portrayed as a grey shadow - not quite black, but rather like a gateway to a mysterious world. The pagan texture of the film is enhanced by the Renaissance villa in which the events take place - with its blooming gardens, ancient clocks, winding staircases, and stone lion figures.As the reader of this review knows, Death decides to assume the mantle of a mortal being for three days; he is curious to discover what is so special about human life. During his lonely centuries of work, Death accepted lives indiscriminately, believing that all human pursuits were pointless.  Only at the end of his three days, when he falls deeply in love with Grazia, can he comprehend this wonderful aspect of humanity.  This, then, is why the film is always recognized as a romance.A symbolic scene: When Death translates himself into a prince, he arrives at the villa and announces himself. All the other guests of the villa bow to him...but when he first sees Grazia, he first bows to her.  This is evidence of her quasi-divine status.In fact there is no violence in the film at all.  When Death takes a holiday, people do not die.  We learn the reasons they do die usually occur because of their own negligence, recklessness, or stupidity.  When one of the guests at the Italian villa remarks that in a battle, the weapons of both sides are not working, Death assures him that mankind will not give up wars. Death is only giving man a temporary respite.This particular movie cannot be made in color - it needs the haunting quality of its gorgeous cinematography of black and white...and the exquisite costumes that Hollywood created in the 1930's.  Evelyn Venable as ""Grazia"" is an ethereal beauty.  I never understood why she did not become a major star of the movies.  Nevertheless, in this film she will be remembered forever.Ask yourself this question - to obtain eternal love, would you embrace Death?  The women in the villa are given this choice....and they provide their own answers.In the 21st century, the word ""love"" is misused and dishonored.  People say they love their new clothes or love their amazing smart phones.  See this movie and discover what love is really supposed to be about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NIH6U7R3BZGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033PSH5E#wasThisHelpful","R3NIH6U7R3BZGV","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I offer a litmus test.  If you adored Sylvain Chomet's ""Triplets of Belleville"" but were bored with ""The Illusionist"", this film won't work for you. Myself, I thought the colors and drawings were artistically incredible ...  something like Arabic or Hindu painted miniatures. Alas, there really is not much of a story.  It is instead a tale of a journey by a Sephardic rabbi, an Islamic musicologist,  and a Russian Jewish painter who are searching for a hidden Jerusalem in Ethiopia where Blacks and Jews co-exist in peace.  Along for the ride is the rabbi's ""talking cat"" - a creature which loves arguing and commenting on everything when he's not being pampered by the rabbi's voluptuous daughter. Since the rabbi is a religious man, they discuss differences in customs and spirituality and beliefs...and why that matters.The half of the film that take place in Algiers, 1930 is simply stunning. Beautiful blue pools,  Persian carpets, exotic buildings, and mosaic tiles.  For that alone, I give it 4 stars. As well as the fabulous music!  The discussions between the characters were engaging but they did become didactic after a while.  One of the great moments is the decision by the cat to obtain a bar-mitzvah, and the objections of the orthodox community (in whatever land) to such an insanity.The major problem of the movie is lack of a coherent narrative.  Perhaps that is life itself - lack of a coherent narrative  - form speaks substance.I wish to highly recommend the extra - the autobiography of Joann Sfar - which is a fascinating exploration of how vision is reinterpreted into art.  For example, the voluptuous Rabbi's daughter in the animated film  (and the book upon which it is based) is based on the ""personality"" of the artist's grandmother, if not her looks.  How interesting. And the look of Algiers is shaped by the artist's memory of the colors of his birthplace on the French Riviera.  We learn that 100 per cent of the Jews of Nice are originally from Algeria.This is animation for adults...worth a peek!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387CC9SNNREDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATK0024#wasThisHelpful","R387CC9SNNREDE","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most Amazon customers know of Patrick Tull through his stirring narration of Patrick O'Brian's sea tales (e.g. ""Master & Commander).True, he narrates some other works, such as the writings of George Orwell and Charles Dickens, but among his best is his reading of ""The Jungle Book.""  I loved listening to this book in the car, as Mowgli is befriended by wolves, a bear, and a panther, but is hated by a tiger who felt cheated from his dinner. The episodes when Mowgli lives with humans are filled with humor as he struggles with concepts foreign to the ""jungle people"" such as money, caste, and superstition.  Rudyard Kiplings' work is poetic and nothing like the Disney movie. Happily, there are many tales of animals ""other"" than that of Mowgli...some which take place in different areas of the world.  The book made me respect how carefully Rudyard Kipling observed India - the land and its inhabitants. This is a great gift for children over 6 years, and even adults.  I have rarely been disappointed with a book narrated by Patrick Tull, and this is no exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37M7ORURXY6ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419359924#wasThisHelpful","R37M7ORURXY6ZW","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Made on a budget of $250,000, this movie is far better than films made with 1000 times the money.  The reason?  Truth. Authenticity.This is one of the few movies that accurately depicts the African American experience during the early 1960's. I can't imagine it would have been shown in the South...and it may not have attracted many white audiences in the North.  A Black railroad worker falls in love with a preacher's daughter and decides to settle down.  He is a flawed man, but with goodness and pride. Earlier he had gotten a woman pregnant and casually abandoned his young son...a pattern quite similar to his alcoholic father who did the same thing to him.  Taking the plunge, he has a chance for a new life with a good woman...but what distinguishes him are two things: First, he will not swallow his pride when he is disrespected by white bosses or others, and second, he will not solve the problem easily by just going North.  Most of the time, he is either fired or walks away from a job. He is not belligerent, but he will not bend his head like a dog. In essence, he won't prejudice his basic dignity.My word, how much drama there is in a scene where a white man calls him ""boy"", and he asks to be called by his real name, simply but firmly.  There are no histrionics in the film...nothing but a man.This was Malcolm X's favorite film ...easy to understand. It is quite remarkable that almost all the cast is Black. That is most unusual during this period in this country, when there were very few African American actors. Quite effectively, the director uses non-professionals. (The same approach is used in the great Italian NeoRealist films like ""Bicycle Thieves"")  The location shots work. So, for example, there are marvelous shots of gospel singing in a Black Church.  And some of the acting is unbelievably good.  The man's father as a long-gone drunk is one of the finest performances of this type I remember in film.As it turned out, this film was created by two Jewish men, one of whom had to escape the persecution by Nazi Germany to survive.  So it was with that solid understanding of racism that the film was made with profound sensitivity.I truly enjoyed the extras which has interviews with some of the actors, the cameraman, and the wonderfully charming director 40 years later. The extras are essential.This is not just a good film, it is one of the greats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38C48H0KKOJZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JUX42#wasThisHelpful","R38C48H0KKOJZB","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My parents were French Jews during this period - and fled shortly before this terrible incident when the French police and politicians cooperated with the Nazis to ""round up"" most of the Jews in Paris for eventual deportation to the death camps. So this important movie had special resonance for me.An astounding film in many ways. What makes it so interesting is that it does present the French people in all their guises - those who protested the round ups, the doctors and nurses who tried to deal with the medical needs of people being crowded into the Paris Velodrome, the children who could not comprehend the cruelty around them, the suicides of Jews who knew what the end result was, the apathy of Marshall Petain who gradually bent to the Nazi demands, the antagonism of the anti-semites who were delighted by the elimination of Jews from Paris, a priest who wears the badge of the yellow Jewish star.In the way the movie approached the events, I felt dark, deep, terrible horror. And yet there are radiant moments of heroism displayed in the film.More than one-third of the Jews who were supposed to be sent away by the French and Germans to death escaped with the help of other French men and women who protected them. This is the story of the children, mothers, and others who did not escape. Harrowing, yes...but necessary.Possibly the most compelling scene is the rampant, wild chaos in the Paris Velodrome as the troubled Jews try to figure out what is happening to them as they are being denied water to drink. Just about all the events in this film are true. (Don't miss the extras and also watch ""Sarah's Key"", a fictional story about this seminal event in French 20th century history).The New Republic called this one of the best films of the year.  A DVD that works in Region 1 can be purchased from Amazon Canada.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4TTW5EZ44EQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P9MUNM#wasThisHelpful","R4TTW5EZ44EQ0","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's a line that Isaac  (Woody Allen) whispers to Mary (Diane Keaton) in the NYC planetarium as they walk between the planets and the stars on the screen.  Such an existential moment.  Alas, it seems to be the one thing that Woody Allen can articulate but not adopt - really deeply - in his soul.  We know him from his wisecracks about God, death, movies, intellectuals, sex...but what this film is about is nostalgia - what we remember of what we think we love.The film begins with Woody Allen exclaiming how much he loves THE CITY.  Yes, I think that is true. One theme is whether he knows how to love  something entirely different - another human being.  His characters always seem to be reaching for that goal - just out of his reach. From my experience, loving another requires unqualified unselfishness, full acceptance of the other, compassion, and a sparkle of wisdom.  Would his character offer his kidney to his wife or best friend?  One senses no.So many reviewers have praised the glorious black and white cinematography. They are right on the money. Gordon Willis did the photography for Woody Allen - and he is justly known for also doing ""The Godfather.""  The opening sequence may be one of the most sensational I have ever seen on the silver screen....nostalgic shots of Manhattan against the background of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.  The opening concludes in a burst of light from fireworks over the city.  Orgasmic. (Gordon Willis also shot ""Stardust Memories"" for Woody Allen, one of those films that doesn't get much mention these days)It is striking to me that Woody Allen's character does not ever smile. He offers a smirk, yes, but not a smile.  That's an interesting observation about a comedian, about ""this"" comedian.  Perhaps at this time in his life, he was going through his immature mid life crisis.  That occurs when a man believes he is losing his virility, ponders growing old, and foolishly thinks he can resurrect his life by dating a young, pretty girl.  It is a risque move - as a director - to put your true flaws right into a picture, but there it is, for all to see.  A 42 year old man having an affair with a 17 year old high school student!Mariel Hemingway - the 17 year old - is a revelation.  Of all the characters, she (Tracy) speaks simply from the heart.  The others go about lamenting their relationships, criticizing themselves or their lover, but none of them really seem to be loving anyone. Other than one scene (in a horse carriage in Central Park) when Isaac says that Tracy is ""God's answer to Job"", Isaac generally does not respect Tracy as an equal. In public, he makes disparaging comments about her. And he is always warning her she is too young for him and the relationship has to self-destruct. So when Tracy finally leaves Isaac, he suddenly realizes he may indeed have lost the one love of his life. At the end of the movie, he begs her to stay.  But the deed is done; she will travel away to London.  Isaac - or Woody Allen - lost the one person in the film who really could love him back, if he had chosen to love her first.Unlike other films which are tied to their moment, the truths in this film will remain valid 10 or 100 years from now. And that's one reason it is a masterpiece. This is not Woody Allen's funniest film, but it may indeed be his best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP1T0NGRU6X2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0792846109#wasThisHelpful","RP1T0NGRU6X2Y","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background history - Give applause to Franklin Delano Roosevelt who started the WPA during the Great Depression to help real Americans earn money and keep their dignity.  All of us know about the bridges and Post Offices and roads. Amazing - nine million people received money from the U.S. Government and they paid us back with over a million projects.  Jobs were handed out even to unemployed newspaper reporters, novelists, and poets. They were paid to support national patriotism and give birth to a national identity.  One assignment - travel the American heartland, towns, and ports and document the way Americans feast - talk about the food at the harvest fairs, political and community fundraisers, square dances, or religious revivals.Washington D.C. did not want recipes, it wanted stories. This book is about those stories. These colorful accounts are important historical material. After all, ""politics and barbeques go so naturally together because it takes the same amount of time to cook the meat as it does to stroke the voters.""Some gems: A group of African American women argue about a fund raiser where the participants plan to serve pig feet: A woman resists:  ""Who wants ole pig feet? They give you indigestion. The last time the pig feet were cold and half done.""Or a huge salmon barbecue where the salmon is ""dunked in a big tub of water with lots of brown sugar. After about half an hour the fish is removed and placed in the barbecue pit and covered with ferns and grass.""  Sounds wonderfully tasty.Or a religious revival where the master of ceremonies shouts to the crowd:  ""Who danced before the Lord until his clothes fell off?  [The crowd replies] -  ""David!""  Later they will feast on ""fried fish and chicken, roasted corn, baked ham, all kinds of long-cooked greens, meat in red-hot sauce, and custard pies.""Or an Irish tavern in Olde New York where the innkeeper believed ""in the right of the male to peace and ease while enjoying his standard delicacies of ale and onions...""The book takes us back to a time when large gatherings of people celebrated food - events that helped create communities and neighborhoods and churches.I did not live during those days in the 1930's and 1940's. And no, I don't eat squirrel stew.Still I believe something terribly important is at risk in our culture.  I see too many young people spend lots of time looking down at their smart phones rather than making new friends across a long table groaning with good eats for all to share.A last thought - ""It's worth it to see so many folks eat their part of wholesome vittals.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFGMEK6R663SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596916230#wasThisHelpful","RFGMEK6R663SH","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes...I think it is....although obviously the movie will not change the way you view the world.Brigitte Bardot electrifies the screen whenever she appears. It is just NOT POSSIBLE to take your eyes off her.  One reason is that she simply is ""that hot."" But the director deserves credit too.  Knowing how to dress and undress his stars is talent. Vadim understands what makes a woman sexy - perhaps more than any other director (after all, other than King Solomon, he married more beautiful women, one after another, then anyone else in history).I cannot say enough positives how colorful the film is....the scenery of St. Tropez is breathtaking, and the mixture of colors and lights in the film is restored magnificently by Criterion...with as much care as, let's say,  ""Black Narcissus.""Like many French directors, an underlying theme is missed opportunities for love.

"Because we are repeating history...As explained by Ken Burns, the terrible near ""end of the world"" disaster of THE DUST BOWL was the worst man made ecological mistake in American history. This aspect of this chapter of the American Experience was not told to me when I learned American history...and I thank Ken Burns for explaining it so well.  As he documents the facts through archival films, letters, and interviews with survivors, we harmed the land through ignorance.  Men and women wilfully destroyed the necessary wild grasses that evolved over time to hold the soil together in the Great Plains. Without those grasses, the newer soil would no longer hold moisture.  As it turned out, the most shocking scenes in the film are those of black, long walls of new tractors destroying those grasses, upturning the valuable soil.  Forget horror movies....this is real terror. {Not unlike the 1918 influenza pandemic}.  Man's most dangerous enemy...is himself.In the documentary, Ken Burns reminds us that Native Americans of the Great Plains experienced their ""end of the world"" disaster when we recklessly slaughtered their buffalo herds.  Did we think we could not do this to ourselves? The plague of grasshoppers that ate everything in sight in the Dust Bowl is of equal ferocity to the one predicted by Moses in the Old Testament.In 1956, Life Magazine had a cover which warned of serious global climate change if Americans did not make modifications to wasteful, destructive lifestyles.  That warning to respect the Earth was ignored. Today, the victims of Hurricane Sandy experienced first hand what devastating effects of global warming can do to Americans - miserable droughts. ferocious storms, and unimaginable floods.

"For most of the 20th century, Native Americans were demonized..  Perhaps as wrong, modern films such as ""Dances with Wolves"" have over-sentimentalized them.  This picture fits right in between.  An alcholic manipulative rodeo man takes on an inexperienced young Native American to ride wild broncos in Rodeos...and the young man does spectacularly well. He truly enjoys his relationship with the animals.  I think of the film as an American Indian version of Paul Newman's ""The Hustler"" , but instead of a pool hall, it is the Rodeo Circuit.All the performances seem believable, and the heart of the movie is the personal quest of the Native American to learn his roots.

"Most of the positives of the film have been discussed in other reviews...but one aspect of the movie is likely to be hushed up. By voicing an orgasm, Natasha Richardson sexually arouses all who watch this movie. And she does this fully dressed!  What a lesson in eroticism. [Jane Fonda could do that...in ""Klute""]Natasha Richardson fans know her from other films such as ""Haven"" and ""The Handmaids Tale.""  Her co-star, Bob Hoskins, is also fantastic.  He offers a humble, understated performance as a photographer of cheap religious images.The scenes of his bungling efforts to photograph the great stories of the New Testament - whether of the LAST SUPPER or ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI - are hysterically funny.  The apostles, most of whom are drug addicts or skid row bums, are depicted as models of devotion.  One factor that makes the movie so funny is that Jeff Goldblum's character takes his role of playing Jesus so seriously,  he slowly comes to believe that he is the Son of God. Astonishing - with a beard and long hair, he really does look like Jesus!Because the movie does not hold back from poking fun at religion devotion,  it is likely to offend a crowd of fundamentalists.  Notwithstanding, the film examines the ""big questions"" more deeply than let's say, the better known ""Life of Brian."" I actually think it is funnier too.This is a unique film, for the reasons stated.  I recommend it to cinephiles looking for an offbeat satire outside the mainstream of Hollywood fare.  Consider the funniest line when Jeff Goldblum dressed in a white robe starts to walk slowly into a lake and sinks.  A skid row drunk wakes up his neighbor - ""I just saw someone trying to walk on water.""  The other responds:  ""It happens.

"Individuals are so used to ""narrative cinema"" unfolding a conventional story that something entirely different becomes incomprehensible.  This movie rates with ""Grapes of Wrath"" in honestly depicting the dignity of those laborers who brought us the commodities that we all take for granted - whether coal, copper, or corn.  But these coal fields are now replaced by a newer world - which although less bleak is also less meaningful. The beginning of the film shows the present...but what forms the heart of the film is the past.There is no dialogue.  Accompanied by a haunting brass score, the film is a sequence of slow motion archival footage of coal miners, their union organizers, and their families.  One scene bleeds into another and another so that time is suspended.  Watching and listening, the film operates as a life experience.  And that experience made me meditate on the true meaning of community - one that lives together, works together, feasts together, and dies together.  Without speech, the film speaks instead to our subconscious. As to the photography, we witness the coal miners descending a shaft to enter a narrow dark hell, we cheer their parades, we sympathize with their union solidarity,  One of the most emotional images is a mass of faces waiting for news of survivors in a mining disaster. The music repeatedly evokes those long forgotten brass bands celebrating the laborers.This is raw cinema ... in an old form - e.g. the silent Soviet film ""Earth (1930)"" ... or is it new?

"What unfolds is a story of an 11 year old boy in a strict household  - maltreated and unloved - who is emotionally harmed over and over again by his parents.  Knowing that other children are loved, this state of affairs simply cannot go on forever. Eventually, this leads to a suicide attempt which is one of the most shocking, choking moments in cinema.

Only 30 years later have I experienced a terrific child actor in French cinema that equaled this peformance - Patricia Gozzi in ""Sundays and Cybele.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5W49SJQ0JWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6303184251#wasThisHelpful","R1X5W49SJQ0JWC","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went to the multiplex with no expectations...having been generally disappointed with Hollywood offerings this year.  I was very pleasantly surprised how outstanding this film is.It is among the most spectacular computer generated animations ever created...every time the multi-colored tooth fairy shows up on the screen (or her baby fairies) I smiled.  And that is the point of this movie..it makes you smile. ""Wings up, Ladies!"" (Yes, this is one of those movies that the BIG SCREEN and HIGH DEFINITION enhance enjoyment).  I believe that the astonishing look of the film has something to do with Guillermo del Toro, executive producer - because he is the man responsible for ""Pan's Labyrinth"", the film that changed the rules on Computer Animation in movies and made an indelible impression on world wide audiences.A perfect movie for children - with no annoying bathroom humor - a (religious?) battle between good and evil that is not too dark. No one gets killed or wounded because the matter in controversy is the quality of dreams.  My favorite character is Santa Claus - with gang tattoos of ""naughty"" on one arm and ""nice"" on the other. Instead of the usual stereotype, he turns out to be Russian or Ukrainian.  We know this from his accent and expressions (When upset, he will say something like ""Shostakovich""). And...part of the fun is that Santa uses Abominable Snowmen to make the toys rather than the elves who don't do much work at all. The purpose of the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Santa Claus is to bring hope, cheer, and wonder to children.  Enter  - - - Jack Frost --- who has not taken sides yet. Like so many of us, he is seeking the answer to why he is here on earth... his spiritual journey is the core of the film and his quest will determine the childrens' fate.The characters are adorable, perhaps even the villain (The Bogeyman) was once himself.  The reason he has decided to change happy dreams to frightening ones derives from his loneliness.  He believes dark dreams is a way to achieve recognition....alas, an unhappy characteristic that is a dangerous one in our times.  Our heroes, or shall I say superheroes, won't allow that since their mission as GUARDIANS is to protect the children always.Hey, let's get a real family movie for the kids..not ""Bad Santa.""  This is a wonderful choice. Friendly warning:  The beginning of the movie is very important so don't miss the first few minutes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWJA2GQC4OGUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIFS#wasThisHelpful","RWJA2GQC4OGUC","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What ""SkyFall"" offers to its audience is Bond, James Bond, as an espionage agent...not as a cardboard character or a flawlessly dressed superhero. Back in the 1950's and 1960's, that's how Bond was imagined by his creator.  Go back to the books - start with Casino Royale or From Russia with Love - and you will see that Bond is a tough, loyal, hard-edged spy.  Daniel Craig brings this kind of Bond back.  Sean Connery was glamorous, Roger Moore was silly, but Daniel Craig acts, moves, and thinks like a spy.And the villain in ""SkyFall"" was once an important asset of MI6...perhaps a friend of Bond once.  He is the enemy today because he wants revenge. Why? He was cruelly betrayed by Britain and M when it was expedient for him to get captured and tortured.  He was traded for 6 other British agents. See the film ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" to get an idea how governments will and do make these choices at the personal sacrifice of their agents.  When my father was a spy against the Nazis for the French this was a real fear when he operated in enemy territory. Can you really trust your own side, when you live in the shadows?  And so Raoul Silva (Javier Barden) - the new enemy of MI6 - was born by surviving his betrayal. Governments do create their own Frankensteins.Both the flawed psychological, hurt natures of Bond and Silva are explored in this brilliant thriller. As Judi Dench (as M) puts it, orphans make the best spies.Although there are some extraordinary stunts in the film, gone are most of the spy gadgets that helped Bond get out of trouble.  He has to use his brains, not only his courage, to win this showdown.  I love the part when he goes back into time, and drives his ""Goldfinger"" vehicle again.  The gadget that villian Raoul Silva uses, is one we live with everyday - the computer.  For he is an expert in cybercrime.Now we have reached Bond at 50 - Daniel Craig nails it. Although I must confess that this Bond is someone who doesn't smile or enjoy luxury wines - something I miss from the Sean Connery days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNCQCD0DJNA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007REV4T8#wasThisHelpful","R1NNCQCD0DJNA1","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have all wanted, at some point in our lives, to be a fly on the wall at a moment of historical significance. The fly - this time - is a servant to Queen Marie Antoinette played magically by Lea Seydoux.  The entire film revolves around ""her"" point of view.Sidonie Laborde reads books to the Queen and is summoned at all hours of night and day to respond to Marie Antoinette's whims. It is apparent that Sidonie, a naive girl, has a schoolgirl crush on the Queen but is emotionally hurt by the fact that her majesty is in thrall to another beautiful woman, la Duchess de Polignac.  There is a telling scene where Sidonie opens the chamber of la Duchesse when the other is fast asleep and nude, and she examines the woman from almost a clinical perspective - trying to understand where is the charm?  But the love triangle takes second place to the reality of the urgent news that the Bastille Prison has just been stormed by the people of Paris and its jailer mutilated by the mob.  The very existence of the monarchy and the nobles is on the precipice.The plot imagines three days in which the idea of revolution swims in the heads of the nobles and servants of Versailles; they realize that their carefully shut off existence is coming to an end and scramble to figure out a way to survive.  Most act badly...full of self interest...or even disloyalty.  Reluctantly, Sidonie Laborde accepts the request of the Queen to act as a decoy by getting dressed up as the Queen's lover and leaving the palace in a lavish carriage.  The purpose of the order is to allow both Queen and her lover to escape safely.  Some palace servants wisely warn Sidonie to refuse to be a decoy...since they fear their companion is going to be killed within the day. As these servants see it, the harm the royalty inflicts on the people they rule is just a minor nuisance to King and Queen.Impressive highlights of the film are the gorgeous cinematography and costumes. (Yes, opt for Blu-Ray to capture all that wonderful detail).  The director shoots two sides of Versailles - its dark rooms and its splendid chambers.  The rapid disintegration of palace life is tangible and realistic like the discovery of water rats running through the corridors.Most of all, I was moved by Lea Seydoux's underplayed emotional performance as she struggles to grasp the enormity of all these events - intimate and historical.  On balance, I recommend the film as one of the better entries of 2012.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MB8VJ11G4F1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009TT0BSE#wasThisHelpful","R2MB8VJ11G4F1I","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up to now, you could only see this film on VHS.  Gerard Depardieu plays a straight and very tough cop (Mangin) trying to investigate and capture the members of a Tunisian drug ring. Expect violence since he is more than willing to beat up his subjects. Then suddenly before him he is asked to interrogate a quite beautiful Arab girl-woman (played intensely by a young Sophie Marceau). He tries the same technique.But although this police officer wants to do his job - and truly loathes criminals - he simply cannot control his dark attraction to his new suspect (Noria).

"When I was very young, my father owned a French LP of ""Igor Stravinsky - L'histoire du soldat"" which was unquestionably his favorite recording.  So I grew up on this.  Of course, his version has only French narration...and so I have never bought a recording without stunning voices - in French. Those versions include one narrated by Jean Cocteau and Peter Ustinov (and) another recording read by Georges Descrieres.In this version, the fable is voiced in English...but the animation is endlessly intriguing. I have remembered images for years.  Most persons know the story - it is a Faustian tale of a simple Russian soldier who sells his violin to the devil in return for a book that predicts the future. With that book, the man can make untold wealth...but he can never capture true happiness. Although he finds a way to get free of the devil, the dark spirit has just one last chance to capture the man's soul again. Will that opportunity arise?For those willing to be engaged with a cartoon as much as with a live film, I cannot recommend a better movie.  Of course, the music is by one of the twentieth century's greatest composers. Even Walt Disney was fascinated with Igor Stravinsky's music - so he used ""The Rite of Spring"" as the foundation for one of his famous cartoon sequences in ""Fantasia.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL58L8E6CKE52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001Z9366#wasThisHelpful","RL58L8E6CKE52","A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a short list of films that have actually changed political life - and this is one of them.  (Other films would include ""Victim"" which changed Britain's view of its criminal persecution of homosexuals - or - ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" which sparked interest in changing the harsh treatment of prisoners)  This is a shocking documentary of the culture of rape in the military and the 5 star brass ignoring it. The film discloses the really large percentages of women (and men) who have been sexually attacked by their fellow soldiers - with nothing being done about it, or even worse - expect it - part of the job.

"The first thing you notice when you try to use these things is that the release levers don't work the way you probably think they will. In order to separate the jaws, you first have to twist the handle to loosen the pressure and THEN pull on the little lever to slide the jaw around. You also have to wiggle the thing back and forth a bit to get the angle exactly right or you'll be lucky to move it by more than two teeth on the bar. Once you get a feel for it, you can slide the jaw all the way up and down the bar fairly quickly, but before you get a feel for it, you'll probably get angry once or twice. This mechanism is honestly pretty annoying, but in actual usage, it's typically a one-time annoyance. The tradeoff being that you will absolutely never have that jaw slip and fall to the floor on you when you're using the clamp vertically while you've got glue drying on you.The handles are pretty nice, but honestly, they're not so much better than the Besseys that you should go out of your way to pick them up. If somebody sells them near you, great. If they don't, you're not really missing out on anything especially revolutionary. I definitely wouldn't ever order them from any giant warehouse store that doesn't really know how to pack anything bigger than a Blu-Ray. They're not exactly delicate, but the form factor of the jumbo parallel clamp is so inherently awkward that they're not very likely to survive the kinds of impacts they will be subjected to in transit unless they're really well padded.

"This is a pretty good edge guide in the sense that it's wide, fully adjustable and built to stand up to some serious usage, but there are a few things that bug me about it.For starters, you're twisting those screws straight down into the rods. Unlike the very nice tightening mechanism on the router base itself, Festool took the opposite approach here and gave you something that's guaranteed to put nicks in your rods, hastening their demise unnecessarily. This is crazy disappointing considering the price.The other issue is the amount of slack in the fine adjustment knob. If you need to switch directions because you overshot your adjustment just a hair, you've got to give it almost a full turn before the threads actually engage and begin moving the guide. Not the end of the world, but again, look at the price tag. Come on, guys.Nevertheless, pairing them up is a truly great way to route narrow stock without a table, keeping with the overall system philosophy of bringing the tool to the work rather than vice-versa. I found the stock fence a little too short and stubby to *really* resist tipping given the weight of the 1400, so I made my own 1.75"" tall one out of a scrap of 3/4"" acrylic, and it's like a completely different tool. With that much surface area contacting the reference edge it honestly glides better than it does on the rail. Because of that, I still think this is one of those must-buy accessories even if it is disappointing in other regards.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R3ZXQVN7PE3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VMUPGO#wasThisHelpful","R3R3ZXQVN7PE3R","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heat guns are not complicated tools. Unfortunately, most manufacturers use that fact as an excuse to not even try when they design theirs and you invariably wind up with a cheap, flimsy piece of junk that finds its way into the landfill within a year's time. Metabo's are plenty light in the hand, but the build quality gives it a far more substantial feel than the orange things you find at the orange stores, and the fan runs quiet with no serious rattles. This particular model lacks a digital display so you're dialing in your temperature by feel alone (obviously, don't ever stick your hand right in front of the nozzle), but the temp *is* continuously variable rather than being locked into a ""low"" and a ""high"" mode. There are no attachments in the box, so if that's something you're hoping for, you'll have to pick them up separately.What's it good for? Melting frayed nylon down without setting yourself on fire, drying out drywall mud so you can move on to sanding and painting the same day, giving that coat of waterborne stain, sanding sealer or grain filler the kick in the pants it needs to set up quicker, heat-shrink tubing the tar out of anything, bending thin pieces of metal and plastic, thawing out pipes, softening glue, starting charcoal briquets without lighter fluid and probably several dozen other things that require high heat without an actual flame.It's a little pricey, but it's built to last.

"It's an expensive vacuum. You can get by without it, and I did for quite a while. Slap a Bosch hose on a regular old shop vac and you're pretty much good to go with most tools you're likely to pick up at a fraction of the cost. Sounds great in theory, but in practice, it tends to wind up costing just as much in the long run.For starters, no shop vac on the market generates as much suction as this thing. Not one. It's really staggering how strong it is, and how quiet it is, too. Don't need all that power? Dial it down and the noise level follows suit. Hook this up to a sander and dust will not be able to escape the vortex. You can sand toxic coatings full of silica in your living room all day long and leave no trace whatsoever.But what it really saves you from is context switches. Say you're making a cut with a homegrown budget solution. You mark the cut, line up the track, make a dry pass with the saw to make sure everything slides the way it needs to, and then... You have to go switch your vac on. Easy enough, but whoops, your shirt snagged the track and scooted it off the line. OK, double back and clamp it this time to make sure. Now switch the vac on and dig in. Halfway through, your hose snags because you inadvertently moved something very slightly while you were digging for the clamps. Now you've got scorch marks at best, blade deflection at worst. Can you salvage your workpiece? Maybe you can, maybe you can't. Not a big deal if it's pine, but if it's something you drove a long way to pay a lot of money for, you're not going to be very happy.A vac that switches itself on automatically sounds like an utterly pointless luxury for incredibly lazy snobs, but it's not about the effort involved in flipping a switch, it's about the distractions doing so can create which interrupt your work, cause you to make stupid mistake after stupid mistake, eventually snowballing into a runaway boulder of frustration that encourages you to rush through everything else to make up for lost time, leading to... Yes... More mistakes. Turning a vacuum on is not hard. Concentrating on 5 different things at once is. Get rid of one of those things, and it's pretty amazing how much more you can get done.Bag and filter changes are effortless. They're not cheap, but for the level of filtration they provide, not completely out of line, either.Things I don't like at all:1. The brake is annoying. You have to lift the thing up off the ground to really engage it because it just doesn't have enough of a toehold on it to keep a boot on.2. The hose is really rigid and not especially durable. For as much as they charge, it should at least be as easy to work with as the Rigid kit I got at Home Depot for 1/8th the price. Sure, it's green and anti-static, but it's kinda lame when one of the most critical components of the system is also the weakest.3. Wheels aren't big enough to travel up or down stairs very easily. You have to pick it up.4. Even the simplest of accessories, like the steel tube handlebar thing that lets you dolly it around without stooping, are optional and obscenely overpriced. I don't mind paying for quality engineering at all, but you cannot tell me it took a PhD to come up with a piece of bent metal.5. The suction adjustment knob rotates so far past the markers in either direction that it's easy to mistake the max setting for the minimum setting from a distance because it really could be pointing at either one depending on how you look at it. A Sharpie can fix this in a jiffy.I would absolutely not bother buying one of these for use with a router, jigsaw or miter saw--you can get along just fine without it in most cases--but for sanders, track saws and domino joiners, you're really doing yourself a huge disservice with that chimeric assortment of duct taped adaptors and extension cords we all know you've got going in there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P2561BRCQHNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XWAZ9S#wasThisHelpful","R1P2561BRCQHNY","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't read any instructions anywhere, but upon my first encounter with the product, it was fairly obvious that it wasn't going to behave like most grain fillers as it looks a lot more like the acrylic varnish one would use to seal a canvas painting. I slathered it onto my stained maple parts fairly thickly with a foam brush and let it dry about six hours. After that I hit it with a bit of 220 paper until the brush strokes leveled out and all the glue seams and fine pores were gone. Two coats took care of whatever was left. I dunno about drying for four days--seems a bit excessive as it sands very well for me with far less time, and I live in a cool, humid coastal town. Hand sanding is definitely preferable to electric--the dust gums up every paper known to man under the heat of all the friction, and it's really, really, really easy to sand right through the stain even on the slowest speeds.I think all the complainers are just trying to scrape it flush and it's a little too thin to work that way. Treat it more like a really thick sanding sealer and it delivers in spades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36S3NF5QV1DSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DT3LN0#wasThisHelpful","R36S3NF5QV1DSW","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like a lot of Festool products, but this is the first one I've ever used that left me completely awestruck. I saw the videos boasting about how the dust extractor's suction would help support the weight of the tool, but I figured ""support"" meant there'd be just a little bit of assistance involved. When I took the Planex out of the box and put it together, I lost even more of that cautious optimism as it is not a lightweight tool by any means--it's mostly metal and there's a considerable heft to it even without the extension tube added into the mix. I switched it on with the vac on high, approached a damaged, textured wall I didn't care about ruining and the thing sucked itself up against the surface so violently and so firmly that I could barely even move it let alone pull it away. Keeping the extractor dialed down to roughly half power is more than enough to keep the dust out of the air.While professionals who sand massive amounts of drywall in commercial installations on a daily basis should probably invest in the auto-cleaning dust extractor, if you're a homeowner who's just doing a room or four, one of the smaller, cheaper models with the HEPA certification will do just fine. If you happen to be digging into walls that may or may not have lead paint on them, I'd even go so far as to say that you're way better off with the cheaper ones in terms of safety. You don't really even need the fancy locking hose if you don't want to pay for it. The regular hose that comes with the regular dust extractors fits just fine and you have to give it a pretty good tug to pull it loose.Oh yeah, and the paper's like a dollar a sheet. That's less than Home Depot wants for a decent 5"" disc.The price tag seems ridiculous, but ask a marginally competent drywall contractor how much they want to do one room and it's not so threatening anymore. Add in the fact that you won't have to evacuate the house, board the pets or spend the next year cleaning dust off of everything you own and I think it's a highly worthwhile investment regardless of whether or not you're a pro.

"The blade you get with the TS55 isn't bad at all, but it cannot reliably rip 3/4"" maple without bogging down and scorching. Festool recommends their ""Panther"" blade for this task, and while it will make the cut faster and without burn marks, your edges are going to be so horrendously scarred that you'll have to plane both edges down at least 1/16"" to get rid of the roughness, so you have to plan to make all of your cuts 1/8"" bigger than they really need to be, wasting more material and more timeI tried this Freud out in a hunk of the very same maple that gave the multi-purpose blade the fits and got *all* of the effortless speed of the Panther with none of the horrifyingly deep marks. To be sure, the edges I was left with needed some smoothing out, but it was nothing a few quick passes with a sanding block couldn't fix.The blade says it's got a 2.5mm kerf, but I cut it on a track with a splinter guard set up for a 2.2mm kerf and I didn't see any plastic come off of anything. Haven't gotten out the calipers to really scrutinize it, but in my anecdotal experience, it's a painless switch out with no need to shell out for another splinter guard for either the saw or the track.It's also cheaper and easier to re-sharpen. The geriatric ""green Kool-Aid"" purists infesting the FOG forums may sneer at it, but I find the Freuds I've used on several makes and models of different saws to be vastly superior to anything Festool's currently putting out blade-wise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RE524IA2LD9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IPH968#wasThisHelpful","R3RE524IA2LD9C","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"But if you wanted fast, dirty rip cuts, you probably wouldn't have blown your paycheck on a Festool saw.I didn't expect perfection from anything with this low of a tooth count, but the deep gouges this blade creates in both maple as well as the track's splinterguard are just unforgivable. Whatever time it saved me in making the cuts was negated dozens of times over as I planed the scars out of what is now some expensive scrap material because it ended up nearly 1/8"" narrower than it needed to be. I'll hang onto it in case I ever find myself wanting to cut up some thick slabs of bamboo, but it caused far more problems than it solved for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318F6LB5ODBEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VGV6J0#wasThisHelpful","R318F6LB5ODBEV","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you use the ultra-thick FSG blades and adjust the guides properly, this thing really can keep the blade absolutely perpendicular even in material that is several inches thick. If you don't use the thick FSG blades, your results may vary greatly as it is still, fundamentally, just a jigsaw. Introducing the blade to the material still requires a practiced, steady hand as even the most outlandish of the swappable shoes are pretty conventional in design--not much contact length between the front of the shoe and the blade, so it remains pretty tough to tell when you've got it riding flat by feel alone.By far, the most interesting of the different shoes that can be slapped onto the bottom of the Carvex (not included in the base kit) are the one that can be formed into a V at varying angles and the one that slips onto a Festool guide rail. Unfortunately, using either one of these things means giving up dust collection as there is no way to affix the port to them. Of course, even with the obstructive shroud dropped, the dust collection port isn't as good as it is on many of their other tools, so you might not really care. The other shoe surfaces are kinda tough to feel much difference between them. I just keep the phenolic on and forget about the others most of the time.The strobe lights seem like a silly gimmick, but they really work pretty well at higher speeds and help you see where the teeth are in relation to your cut line. Anything below 3 and the time-stopping effect just isn't there. I'm not sure if it even tries to oscillate the LEDs when it's that slow--they seem to be on pretty steady.The zero clearance inserts are both a gift and a curse. While they keep you from blowing out the top of the workpiece, they also keep you from ejecting the blade. For me, this more-or-less negates the benefits of the tool-free blade ejector, as you still have to get in there with your fingers to pull the little piece of plastic out, and it doesn't exactly glide effortlessly. You *will* touch a hot blade at some point in this process, so gloves or a pair of needle-nose pliers are a must.The circle cutter that comes in the accessory kit is a really cool design, but I have concerns over its durability. Just pulling the tape out a couple of times results in lots of little curly-cues of clear coating scraping off of it at several of the contact points inside. Time will tell how long it holds up.If you need a jigsaw, you'll have a pretty hard time finding anything that beats this, and thankfully, Festool refrained from inventing a proprietary blade design--any T-shank blade will do. If you generally dislike jigsaws, I'm not sure the Carvex is revolutionary enough to change any minds. The improvements Festool's made over the mass-market players' offerings are substantial and noticeable, but I don't think anyone would fault you for saying something about lipstick on pigs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC56BCTCRTXZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZT2ER4#wasThisHelpful","RC56BCTCRTXZJ","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hated everything about this line. I'm not entirely sure how anything can be both too stiff to stay wound *and* too soft to last more than 30 seconds, but somehow, Cyclone figured it out. The rigidity itself I could have lived with if it worked at all, but since it didn't, the fact that it insisted on straightening itself out inside the head every time it stopped spinning caused the ends to suck themselves right back inside the cap at least six times in 20 minutes was intolerable. I resolved to just never let the head stop spinning to avoid this problem, but I then found myself having to bump it every three feet or so because so much of the line had been chewed off in the process of actually cutting weeds. I swapped it out with some cheap Black & Decker junk line I had sitting in a drawer just to make sure I hadn't somehow forgotten how to wind a trimmer spool or something, and whattya know, it worked beautifully and I only had to bump the head twice before I was done with the entire yard.

"There's a fair bit of hyperbole involved in most of the ""game changer"" reviews you'll see out there, but it really is a well thought out piece of machinery that excels in situations where pocket screws fail, and I know of no other way to make an absolutely flawless locking Parson's joint in ten minutes or less. If you build enough stuff to even know what it is, then odds are good you stand to benefit from owning one. I like it a lot, but there are some things that really, really annoy me about it as well:1. The calibration process detailed in the manual is simply ridiculous. Rather than bother with any of that trial-and-error nonsense, take a little pocket sized square (Woodpeckers makes a good one) and line up the edges with the markings on the different surfaces. I really think Festool could do something to make this a whole lot easier, or at least put some degree of effort into setting it up correctly before they put it in the box.2. The spring-loaded registration pawls are great when you want them, but unbelievably upsetting when you don't. The XL lets you defeat these things, but the 500 does not. Aside from making it slightly more difficult to keep the tool flush against the surface to be cut, if you happen to have an edge that lands right at the point where that plastic starts to bevel, you're going to get frustrated enough to rip it out of there entirely.3. The fence height stops are of no particular value. Even if you happen to have a piece of stock that is exactly the same height as one of those stops, it's still easier to just let the fence drop until it rests on the surface and lock it down there. I think they added these things just to make people feel important when shooting YouTube tutorials about all the settings.4. You can only adjust the mortise width when the motor's running? Really? Why make it a huge green control begging people to touch it, then?5. It's not that easy to hold steady when plunging. Not impossible by any means, but it takes more practice than you'd expect it to. I've seen people swap out different, larger handles to assist with this, but I haven't tried it myself. A small dab of Silly Putty can supply some much needed friction here without marring anything.6. The power switch will pinch your fingers every time you shut it off. Would a plain old rocker switch really have killed some industrial designer's pride?7. The trim stop and extension bars are a little flimsy for the price. Sure, they're essentially half off in this set, but I wouldn't fault anyone for expecting more metal than plastic in something this pricey.The XL is a significant improvement in most of these areas, but I work small more often than I work large, so being able to use the 4mm cutter most folks seem to not take very seriously is more important to me in the long run.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFRTLA21X0FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SETSXE#wasThisHelpful","R1QFRTLA21X0FO","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The unboxing experience is pretty awful--there's no packing material whatsoever so everything scrapes against everything else, all of the stickers on the thing are half peeled off, and the head is only loosely attached so if you make the mistake of checking to make sure the motor works before you charge everything up for actual work, it's going to fly right off.Assembly instructions are not very clear at all, but there's only a few parts and only so many ways they can go on, so no big whoop. The usage instructions on the other hand are horrible and self-contradictory. One page tells you to NEVER use the trimmer with the motor positioned to your left side and then the illustration on the next page shows a dude using the trimmer with the motor on his left side. Great. Just do what any sane person would do and wear a heavy long sleeved shirt when trimming and forget about whatever nonsense the GreenWorks clowns felt like mashing into their keyboards that day.You get about half an hour's worth of trimming out of each battery charge if you keep the thing on high speed, and you should really keep the thing on high speed if you have anything bigger than a whisp of grass ahead of you. Charging it back up from empty takes about an hour and a half, so this is obviously not something professionals with lots of yards to do could ever rely on. Even after running it down on high speed from a full charge, I never found the motor anywhere near too hot to touch, so there's another reason I'm not going to pay attention to anything the manual says about which side I swing it toward.Once it gets going, it's almost as good as gas. The line is still a bit on the light side, but it plowed through some seriously thick clumps of foxtail-y things without a problem. It would probably do even better with a brush cutter blade in it, but there's another area where the manufacturer contradicts themselves all over the place. All their promotional materials show brush cutters being used, but there's a big sticker on the tool itself telling you never to install a brush cutter blade. What?Two things about using the thing actually bug me a lot: the buttons and the main trigger. Turning the power on and changing speeds is done via two small bubble switches, and if you're out in the sun and wearing hearing protection as I'd bet 99.9% of all users will be, it's impossible to know when you've actually pressed one of them because you can't see the LED or hear the little electronic chime. Add a pair of gloves into the mix, and you've got one seriously frustrating experience in store for you.The main trigger just isn't big enough to be used for long periods of time. My hands are pretty small but squeezing the trigger is something you can pretty much only do with your index and middle fingers. Doesn't seem like a big deal at all for the first five minutes, but after 10, you'll really start wishing you could use the rest of your fingers to help out.I have no regrets about purchasing it as I haven't seen anything better without a cord or a gas tank, but having put it through its paces, I'm not convinced the price tag is completely justifiable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7B2W75J1AEOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPA151K#wasThisHelpful","R7B2W75J1AEOZ","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The adjustment wheel is tiny and very difficult to operate, but with this style of clamp you ideally won't be adjusting it very frequently, so that's not too much of an issue. By and large, it does exactly what it claims to and you can pretty much set it and forget it no matter how severe the thickness varies in your workpieces. What's a little annoying is the fact that you have to open the handle really, really far to get the jaws apart. That means you probably can't operate it one-handed unless you're an 8-foot tall basketball player, which is a little bit annoying. Whether that's more annoying than having to adjust the pressure repeatedly is largely dictated by the task at hand, so while I'm not getting rid of my other face clamps just because these came out, I do find them handy enough to justify the expenditure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MRNLSFOTFFG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3IQLWM#wasThisHelpful","R3MRNLSFOTFFG7","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My experiences with the standard-issue ratcheting track clamps were not especially positive, but I thought I'd like them a lot better than this goofy thing. Turns out I was dead wrong. If you're cutting down 3/4"" sheet goods with a single-piece track, this gizmo works a whole lot better and is much less error-prone to set up. No running back and forth from end to end to see if the track shifted while you were tightening one of the clamps down, and no amount of vibration knocks them loose. It is a little snug in the track, but it's not especially difficult to position, and you usually don't need to move it around a lot once it's on.If you're cutting thinner material, however--like sheets of polycarbonate--it's completely useless. The only thing I've found to really work well there is T-track mounted hold-down clamps on both the track *and* the plastic. That stuff likes to scoot around on you as soon as the teeth start biting into it, leading to jagged edges and kickbacks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HS9KEU2DO0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00149B7W6#wasThisHelpful","R22HS9KEU2DO0D","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate random orbital sanders with a passion. The only reason I ever used one was to polish plastics and finishes with MicroMesh discs because they're just so profoundly underwhelming otherwise. Few of them ever remove enough material to be genuinely useful as sanders, they all suck at flattening, and you can never really get away from the horrible pigtails they leave all over the place. While most of them nowadays come with little dust bags or compartments, about five minutes worth of smoothing out an epoxy repair on a window sill is all it takes to cake them up so badly that they might as well not even be there.The Rotex sanders absolutely obliterate three of these problems and substantially reduce the rest. In Rotex mode, you're going to come very close to the aggression level of a belt sander on a lower speed. Not quite the same, but more than enough power to be dangerous. Thick layers of paint and/or silicone polish infested wood just vanish before your eyes. It is somewhat hard to control when it's up full speed, though, so two hands are pretty much required. It could definitely benefit from an accessory handle/knob on the head somewhere, but it's not too bad off without one.In eccentric/random orbital mode, you're still going to get a surprising level of aggression but the unit is much easier to control on high. You can still get some pigtails now and then, but they are nowhere near as prevalent as they are on Bosch or Makita's, and given the aggression level, you can get rid of them almost as soon as you switch grits. Whether this is due to the travel pattern or the abrasives, I'm not qualified to say; all I know is they're not a problem for me anymore, even in soft pine.Having an edge guard is an absolute godsend. The one in the box is just big enough to keep you from accidentally sawing into adjacent perpendicular boards, but others are available if you need even more clearance. It seems like a small, pointless detail, but I can't count the number of times I've accidentally cut a tiny little notch into something I then had to go back and fill, losing 8 more hours of potential finishing time as that stupid little repair cured.Switching over to the triangle pad is quick and painless and it does a much, much, much better job of sanding out corners than a plain vanilla oscillating multi-tool. It's not the most amazing corner sander you'll ever see in your life, but it is very good, and the convenience more than makes up for any of its shortcomings.Of course, the dust collection is a serious selling point for the remodeler/renovator. Put a good, strong vacuum on the end of this thing and you can sand right over uncovered carpet without fear. I still see a fair amount of dust collecting on the surface as I work with the RO 90, but it's not flying around and coating everything within a 100-ft radius the way it would with even a dumb vibrating sander. A respirator's still the best protection for your respiratory system, but if you're the kind of person who absolutely hates wearing them, you'll be much safer around the Festools than anyone else's so long as your vacuum's got an adequately fine exhaust filter. Noise levels are high enough to warrant hearing protection with extended use but the vibration is quite minimal. You can sand for an hour or so and put it down without feeling like your hands are still going at it.The downside is obviously the diminutive size. The RO 90 is mostly for cabinet/finish work where this is more of an asset than a problem as it ends up being much more versatile than some gigantic beast that wears out your shoulder and doesn't fit anywhere you need it to. It's completely unsuitable for a number of tasks, but if you *really* need to do huge table tops then you're probably much better off with something else--like a nice jointing plane instead of an electric sander.It's profoundly disappointing that Festool decided to raise the price on this thing *and* simultaneously take the abrasive sampler packs out of the box, but my local dealer was sympathetic and willing to throw some in for me. The hard pad is the only other must-have accessory I've seen for it, and it's pretty reasonably priced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FMAPK3J5FNH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FPALG4#wasThisHelpful","R2FMAPK3J5FNH0","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This router has a whole lot going for it, but I don't think it's for everybody. What it absolutely excels at is eliminating most of the guesswork associated with routing for you. There's a very clear center mark on every single face of the base so you can just line that up and go to town without fumbling around dividing a bunch of fractional measurements, and you can dial in depth adjustments with an utterly obscene amount of precision. Nothing in a blue or yellow housing can even come close to competing with Festool on these points, so if these are features you need, it's absolutely worth the cost. It's also got plenty of power to drive all but the heaviest of rabbeting bits, so don't concern yourself with its lack of a horsepower rating. It'll scorch pine on 3 so be careful.But if you don't need any of that because you're either not really into cabinetry or are just going to stick the thing under a table (something I wouldn't advise even trying with this model as it's not made for that at all), I don't think I'd let any of the other features sway me. Dust collection is nice, but come on... It's a router. Nothing is ever going to get it all. The one-wrench bit/collet changer does actually work unlike many others out there, but is it really hundreds of dollars worth of hard to use two wrenches? The plunge action is super smooth, but that's not entirely unheard of at lower price points, and the plunge lock knob is definitely not my favorite thing in the world to deal with. I had no trouble getting used to the unconventional handle at all, but twisting is one of the last motions you want to be performing when plunging down into something expensive, so I can't say I completely understand that design decision at all.Its ability to slide down a rail (if you purchase the optional accessory that makes this possible) is great, but not of as much value as it is with a saw. The one exception would be drilling shelf pin holes with one of their special rails geared toward this purpose. That is really fun to watch and makes me wish I'd gotten the rail with said holes when I bought my saw. The MFS rails (also not included) are so simplistic in concept that their value is easily dismissed, but they really are pretty nice to work with. I really wish they included the edge guide in the box. They give you the rods, but nothing to use them with. Those parts are not that expensive to make and they could really make the package a lot more attractive.As much as this tool is geared toward (and priced for!) hardcore pros, I honestly think it's best suited to beginners. If this had been my first router I know I would have gotten much less frustrated with the concept of routing in general.

"I think it's perfectly fair to say that this is made primarily for finish carpentry. If you're framing a house or installing cable, then really, what's the point? Get a cheap hammer drill you're never going to worry about and get on with your life. Nobody likes a showoff.I do not, however, think it's fair to say that it's underpowered in any way at all. This thing generates plenty of torque and for much longer than any Makita I've owned in the last 15 years. Try punching several dozen 1"" holes into 3/4"" MDF with a forstner bit (yes, you *should* be using a router for that--so what?) and you'll need to recharge the Makita battery 2-3 times before you're done. Adding insult to injury, it'll only get worse after your first few dozen charges on the thing. How many batteries will you need to buy before the motor burns out? Probably more than enough to make up the price difference here.And let's be honest, the price is... Considerable. But considering the fact that you get two batteries (with 3-year warranties no less) and four, count 'em, FOUR different chucks in the box, it's really not as bad as it seems at first glance. Buy a good, regular drill and a right angle drill and you're out nearly as much money with two tools to store, and the right angle drill probably won't be cordless. With the Festool, it's all one thing and there's also an ""eccentric"" chuck for getting to those shelf and cabinet screws that end up landing right against the wall. Again, not a problem for house builders, but a serious problem for house livers and fixers. You're not going to use it all that often, but when you do use it, it's going to save you many hours of frustration and grief.The Centrotec chuck is just not that interesting to me. I understand the engineering benefits of their proprietary little system, but I also don't care. With the possible exception of the super-cool ""stubby"" brad point bits, the Centrotec accessories are crazy expensive for consumables, not that impressive in terms of selection or performance, and you can't buy replacements when they break or dull down. The quick change adaptors are also all complete trash. Luckily, there is absolutely nothing forcing you to ever use the Centrotec system if you don't want to. Obviously, there's the ratcheting chuck that works exactly like every other drill on the planet that you can always fall back on, and short driver bits fit directly into the nubs at the end of both the right angle and eccentric chucks. If you want to pop a Wera Rapidaptor into the ratcheting or eccentric chucks, it holds firm. No issues. It won't sit securely inside the right angle chuck, though. For that, you'll need to pop the ratcheting chuck on the end, which might cause clearance problems. Again, it's easy enough to slip a short bit straight in there in the case of ultra tight spots.With all of these benefits, plus the fact that you can find videos of people dunking them directly into buckets of water without any evidence of failure (no, I'm not trying it myself) I think it's worth it. I'm not ditching my impact driver any time soon, but it's a darn versatile drill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332KRRMFFR4D1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MYLS8W#wasThisHelpful","R332KRRMFFR4D1","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a piece of routed MDF on top of a plastic box. Anyone who's buying Festool products could probably make something similar in an afternoon or less, myself included.But I didn't make anything similar. Instead, I kept doing little random projects around the house where I found myself thinking ""Man, I could actually use that stupid thing right now."" After about the hundredth time thinking that, I ordered one, and I like it. I feel like a complete sucker every time I look at it, but I still like it. It holds a few clamps, marking rulers, pencils and pens and it stacks on top of my saw box. I drag it out for all the tiny little things I don't want to go setup a giant work surface for, and it's honestly great. I wish it were a bit deeper than it is, and I wish there were some way to make it stay stuck to the bottom of my saw's systainer while in transit (those little green latches only latch one side), but such is life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NPYF6FDTLYLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0GJW12#wasThisHelpful","R1NPYF6FDTLYLQ","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had an original Jawhorse for several years, and while it's always been great, the latches for the legs were always really difficult to release (especially on cold days) and its maximum clamping width was occasionally a hindrance. It's unlikely that you're going to be buying sheets of anything that are too wide to fit in this model's jaws, and the leg latches are much, much, much easier to deal with, gloved hands or no. The overall finish is matte rather than glossy and has enough of a texture on it to help keep the thing from slipping out of your hands when they're greasy, and the third foot is also much wider and padded--both welcome additions. The new, smaller wheels make it much easier to turn when you're pushing/pulling it around on floors, but they still will not help you out if you're traveling down a dirt road or up some stairs.My two biggest gripes are both pretty minor:#1 Clamping a 2 foot sheet is very difficult. Anything smaller or larger is no problem at all, but at exactly two feet, you're right at the upper limit of what the sliding jaw in its default orientation can get a grip on. Slip it off and flip it around, and you'll notice that the jaw itself is longer than 2 feet, so it'll only clamp against itself before it comes anywhere near the edge of your board. You can get it to work, you just have to be really careful sliding the jaw back far enough without taking it off completely.#2 The pedal no longer holds the folded legs securely against the main body. There are little nubs there to keep them put, but you can wiggle past them very easily, which means carrying it by the feet of the main legs is not a practical option.I was debating whether or not there was any point in upgrading given the fact that nobody actively stocks these where you can see them, but I have no regrets at this point. My old one's going in the storage closet.Rockwell's quality control, unfortunately, still leaves a bit to be desired. Mine had some extremely sharp bits of welding slag on the legs that needed to be filed down and repainted, and one of the little clips on the rear foot that are meant to secure it in its folded position was bent completely out of shape at the factory before it ever went in the box. How can I tell? Because the part is severely deformed but the paint on its surface is absolutely perfect. Not worth going through the hassle of a return over by any means, but somebody should have noticed that when they were folding it up to go in the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3750TVJ9SBE5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BTLXI8#wasThisHelpful","R3750TVJ9SBE5S","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't pay any attention to the lead rotation gimmick when I bought a bunch of these, I just grabbed them off the rack at the Japanese stationery store because they were closest to the register and went on about my business. Once I actually looked at the package, I thought I'd made a terrible mistake, but to my surprise, the ""engine"" actually works pretty darn well for normal writing. It does not take much pressure to actuate at all--which you can verify by watching the little white logo spin around through the circular window in the barrel--but obviously there is some amount of play in the lead as the gears do their magic. You're never going to notice this in the course of actual writing, but if you're looking for a drafting pencil that does not do this, then yeah, you'll probably be happier with something that's sold as a drafting pencil.While it's a little bit disappointing that only the lower part of the barrel is metal, its overall lightness is honestly quite nice for many rendering techniques which heavier pencils can make difficult.The eraser is tiny and useless, but I keep a kneaded eraser close by anyway, so I don't really care.

"I've used dozens upon dozens of ratcheting screwdrivers and always felt like they did exactly what I expected them to, but none of them ever really became my go-to driver, and I definitely never shed any tears when they went missing. It's really difficult to articulate what exactly is different about this one, but it works so much better than all the others I've had that it's really surprising.It takes very, very, very little resistance to make the ratchet slip the way it's supposed to, so you almost never have to hold the shaft with your fingers to keep it from undoing your last turn. There's very little play in the bit or in the shaft when it's locked, so it's almost as solid as a regular screwdriver when you need it to be. Not solid enough to make it excel at prying open paint cans or the like, but hey, you're not supposed to use screwdrivers as pry bars, right? Nobody ever does that.The bits are not as super-hardened as they could be, so wear is definitely going to show after a while, but I haven't seen one chip or snap so far.

"If you've been laboring under the notion that a 2D scanner would slow you down, this unit will definitely change your mind. It picks up even the tiniest of Data Matrix and QRCode symbols nearly as fast as you can push the button, and the Bluetooth transmission adds only a barely perceptible latency to the process. It's also really small and really light, so lugging it around your neck all day won't be all that bad of an idea. Its ability to pair with iOS devices right out of the box without masquerading as a keyboard is also leaps and bounds above most of the competition out there. If this is a feature you need, you'd be hard-pressed to do any better than this.But while it's generally an excellent scanner, it's still not quite the big fluffy bed of roses you might hope it to be. The seams on the thing are really large and jarringly sharp. The battery cover especially just seems like it was designed by someone who never actually saw the rest of the unit it was supposed to attach to. In addition to being uncomfortable, this makes it profoundly unsanitary as it traps dirt like nobody's business. What's the point in shelling out the extra cash for the ""anti-microbial"" version if it's just going to be a filth magnet anyway?The buttons are also a little too hard to press to be particularly ergonomic. Their covered bubble switch design obviously contributes to the units splash resistance, but try hitting that tiny power button with gloves on. Ain't gonna happen.And while it does indeed pair with iOS devices beautifully, the SDK Socket Mobile provides you with for developing applications that talk to it is, sadly, not so beautiful. The code and its accompanying documentation is very clearly written by someone who is neither fluent in English nor Objective-C, and by-and-large it's built in a way that makes it seem as though they're just mashing on buttons until the Xcode project builds before they say ""ship it!"" If I had to guess by the way the whole thing is architected, I'd say their engineers gave up on learning new things at least 20 years ago, but it *will* work if you're willing to spend the time struggling to decipher all of their incomplete examples loaded with semi-explanatory comments that make no sense and fail to reflect what is actually supposed to be going on in the code.All-in-all, it's a great little unit, but it could be so much better if they only took the time to sweat the details.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZTLC67C2KW2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IXW6SS#wasThisHelpful","RZTLC67C2KW2Z","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are made to be replaced and replaced often. Even if yours is not damaged, as soon as you change blades, it's no longer accurate because you cut it flush the first time you used the track (if you didn't do that, then you need to read instruction manuals more often). As such, it's applied via a very non-permanent adhesive. If you leave it in a 150 degree truck all day, yes, it's probably going to fall off. The fact that it fell off doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the track or its accuracy, it just means you've failed to understand what it is you're working with. A can of WD-40 could very well explode in such an environment, does that mean it's not suitable for use by professional contractors or does it mean professional contractors should be able to figure out a better way to store it?Application's pretty easy given the ridge that's machined into the track, but there's no need to get it perfectly straight since the first thing you do with it is cut it parallel with the blade. Also, if you happen to switch from a 2.2mm and a 2.5mm kerf blade, you can remove and re-apply it a little further out to get one more use out of it when you go back to the 2.2mm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XATRW2IZ5R8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YZBXIW#wasThisHelpful","R1XATRW2IZ5R8P","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"No, you're not going to get the brightest possible output for more than 10 minutes or so on a full battery charge, but if you're going to be spelunking for hours on end, you should probably consider carrying something bigger and heavier than a pocket-sized tactical light. For its size and weight, it's an incredible little light. There's plenty of heat dissipating metal, everything is very well machined and the switch feels pretty rugged.I got one to replace a Skilhunt that used an older CREE LED and was more difficult to use as it could only switch modes via head twisting. The Olight supports head twisting as well, but you can also double or triple tap the switch, and this is much easier to perform one-handed. You can leave it on low for the vast majority of the times when you just want to see under a cabinet or into a scratchy throat without blinding anyone and then double click it on when the power's out for the whole block.

"This is a great thing to toss in your toolbox for dealing with some of the more frustrating fastener heads you're likely to encounter in the world today. While the handle is all plastic, it's pretty durable and unlikely to crack unless you take a jackhammer to it. The bit storage compartment glides smoothly in and out and is permanently captured inside the handle so it will never tumble out completely.The main thing I don't like about it is the difficulty associated with removing and inserting bits into both the shaft and the carrier. They're pretty easy to pop out of the carrier and really easy to pop into the shaft, but pulling them out of the shaft might require gloves or a pair of pliers depending on how clean/cold your hands are. Popping them back into the carrier is a little more delicate a process than I'd like and I usually resort to using my fingernails to push down on the end, which usually amounts to me stabbing myself under the fingernail.I also wish they'd included a few smaller sizes of tamper-proof torx bits instead of all the spanner bits. While the microscopic ones are most frequently used in consumer electronics where something this big is simply the wrong tool for the job, I've had to take apart some dishwasher inlet valves that needed something much smaller than a T-10.

"Given the prevalence of acrylic tubs and shower pans which silicone absolutely will not adhere to under any circumstances, it is utterly baffling to me that contractors continue to use silicone to seal them. It usually lasts about a week before it starts to let go and let water seep through. If you're lucky, you see it happening. If you're not, the water goes behind your walls where it fosters fungal growth and all of the destruction associated with it.White silicone also yellows terribly within weeks and attracts dirt like a magnet. If you try to scrub it, it usually starts peeling off and the damage can only be repaired by removing ALL of it and re-applying. Since the only chemicals that will reliably dissolve silicone also dissolve most plastics and etch glass, this can take days of tedious labor.Lexel sticks to almost anything, does not attract dirt, resists mildew, stands up to normal scrubbing, and does not yellow at all. That last benefit *can* also be a bit of a downside as it's likely to remain a much brighter white than any of your tile or grout, but for the protection it offers, I don't mind at all. After three months of watching some bumbling contractors struggle to seal a frameless shower by globbing on mountains of GE II that just turned brown and fell off, Lexel saved the day. I now use it on every change-of-plane joint I see sprouting cracks and the only times it fails are the times when I fail to apply it correctly. Luckily, I can just cut out the bad spot with an X-Acto blade and re-seal. The results are absolutely seamless and it makes me very sad inside to know that I can't just go to a store and buy it off the shelf anywhere in California.On the down side, it stinks, it shrinks and it's incredibly difficult to work with. I shall now copy and paste an excerpt of my review of the clear version as all of it applies:1) Tape off the area surrounding the gap you want to seal with your favorite painter's tape. Preferably the delicate kind that pulls up quickly and easily.2) Cut your nozzle to run as fine a bead as you can possibly get away with and spend the extra two dollars on a drip-free caulk gun.3) Coat the end of a rounded tool of your choice (popsicle stick, toothbrush handle, spoon, etc) in wax. Wax is one of the few things on earth that Lexel will not stick to. This may seem unnecessary, but Lexel dries faster than you can shoot it and if it already has a bit of a skin on it by the time your finger hits it, you're just going to tear it all out and make a giant mess of rubbery little pills that look terrible.4) Put some rubber gloves on and get a container full of mineral spirits handy for accidental smears.5) Squeeze and run your bead for a foot or so. Run your tool along the bead at about a 30 degree angle, very lightly encouraging it into the gap you're trying to fill. Wipe off the excess frequently. If you wind up with voids, go back over it and repeat. If it takes you longer than 30 seconds to notice those voids, just let it dry the way it is and come back to it in a few hours.6) Move on to the next section and repeat.7) Remove the tape IMMEDIATELY. If you wind up with little lips where the tape pulled away, re-tool VERY gently to smooth them down. A soapy, wet finger may be best for the final touch.8) Crank the (cold) water on and test your work. If it leaks, wait half an hour and dab some touch ups on. If it doesn't leak, let it cure a day or two before you hit it with hot. Thermal expansion/contraction in anything it's trying to bond to can cause it to fail, leaving you with mystery leaks. This is mostly a problem wherever it touches metal.9) Profit.There's a rhythm to the application process that is nearly impossible to convey in writing, so I strongly recommend practicing on some extra/scrap tiles before going after the real thing in your bathroom or kitchen. Once you get it, you'll never want to use anything else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVMFOJTFFOB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009PRFYU#wasThisHelpful","RJVMFOJTFFOB7","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Works absolutely perfectly for a fraction of the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CESCC34BWA1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AV78B#wasThisHelpful","R2CESCC34BWA1Y","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an edge guide, it's plenty sturdy and very unlikely to break in anyone's lifetime, but the rods are a little short and the accuracy of the adjustments leaves a bit to be desired. As a dust collector, it's brittle acrylic that's VERY likely to break and doesn't really work all that well, but it's better than nothing.I only wanted it as a guide, so I'm perfectly content to pitch the dust collector part in the trash and get on with my life, but it does seem more than a bit overpriced for what you're getting.

"While this is a great marking ruler, it's made out of extremely thin gauge sheet metal and is packaged in a simple cardboard backed blister pack. When Amazon handles these, they get shoved into bubble mailers and those bubble mailers are invariably bent. Your ruler will be bent along with it, thereby robbing it of its accuracy.I don't think it's realistic to expect Incra to use heavier sheet metal for a product such as this, but I do think they could come up with a much better package for such a precision instrument than that of a Kenner Star Wars toy circa 1977.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C3AQD0LY7IZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GU68EO#wasThisHelpful","R2C3AQD0LY7IZU","A1BDJK501QH72G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BDJK501QH72G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received the hitch a few days ago and finally got up the courage to install it last night.  I've installed a few hitches on a few different vehicles in the past & they are, generally, bolt-n-go type assemblies.  This one requires a little more...The item arrived in a nice, oversized cardboard box secure inside by two wads of foam.  The instructions & hardware were securely taped to the receiver opening on the hitch.  The instructions are a simple, 1-page deal with only a handful of easy to understand steps.  The only step that was slightly unclear was the one pertaining to cutting the plastic skid plate/pan but more on that to come.  Hitch is well built & fairly hefty in weight.  The hardware was of proper size & all parts needed were included; including the pill wire but more on that to come.  The instructions are also available to download but here's a brief overview of what I did & what I can remember of the install:Remove the existing tow hooks under the front of the truck; 2 bolts each & they were firmly secured in there.  Cut opening in slid pan/plate.  I didn't clearly understand what part, or actually what direction, I was supposed to enlarge the plastic pan opening based on the directions since there were no pictures/images/illustrations so I took a little extra time to prop the hitch up to see.  It appears to only affect the two (small) plastic pans; one on left/right & not the main skid pan.  I removed both of those; 2 bolts & 2 screws each.  The plastic is soft & cut with relative ease using a sharp box cutter & tin snips.  I personally opened it up about 1"" towards the front of the truck & about 1"" towards the motor side of the opening.  Nut sure what purpose those two smaller pans serve (to the left/right of the main pan) - maybe they can be left off?  Quick re-install of both small plastic pans/guards.  Jacked the hitch up in place while balancing it on a small rolling jack (attempting the 1-person install).  Can be done with 1 person!  Two people would be faster/easier.  Once I got it in the general location, I installed (finger tight) the 4, 12mm bolts/washers.  Easy so far!  Torqued them to spec as noted in the 1-page instructions.  Next step required a drill.  Found a drill that fit the remaining hole thru the hitch.  Takes a 1/2"" drill.  I suspect mine was closer to 17/32 or 9/16"".  Whatever size it was, it was PERFECT!  Tip that worked for me:  Trying to drill thru the frame (using the hitch as the guide) can be tough, especially upside down in a fairly tight space.  I used my rolling floor jack, supported the butt of the cordless drill on the jack & jacked it up to provide lite pressure while drilling.  PERFECTION!The final step seems to cause the most grief & makes for the lower star ratings (which REALLY has nothing to do with the product itself).  As you can see by my pictures, they include a 'fish wire' that is setup for this intended purpose & appears to be well thought out.  The 'fish wire' attaches to  the coil of the bolt to pull it thru a small opening.  Took me less than 5 minutes to install BOTH bolts & here's what I did:Drill the holes (as noted above)Fish the wire, coil end first, thru the hole I just drilled & stuck my finger thru the access hole in the frame ~8-10"" away to pull the coil thru.  This is the access hole that the cartridge bolt & plate will pull thru.Holding on to the loose end of the wire protruding thru the freshly drilled hole, I slide the square washer over the coil end of the fish wire & into the hole in the frame.  Gently screw the bolt to the coil (see pics below) till the bend in the coil touches the tip of the bolt.  Gently pull the loose end of the wire while feeding the bolt into the hole in the frame.  GENTLY pull on the fish wire & wiggle a little as needed till the bolt starts to come thru the hole.Twist the bolt a little till you fell the carriage head engage the plate.  Gently unscrew the fish wire from the bolt while gently applying a little downward pressure to keep the bolt seated.  Install the nut & torque to spec.Repeat on the other side.Total install time was about 1 hour!  Hitch is SECURE.  Sticker notes it is rated for 5000# towing & 9000# straight pull.  Has two large pull rings.  Happy with the install.  Happy I chose this over the other, which based on other reviews notes you have to remove the skid plate/pan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38J278ECW626L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00076RLG8#wasThisHelpful","R38J278ECW626L","A3ETB0VMA9UXKK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ETB0VMA9UXKK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My set just came in.  They are a little smaller than I had envisioned but big enough to match the feet on the bottom of my BAL stabilizers.  These can be stacked for extra height (and they nest into each other slightly to keep them from slipping apart).  The included strap to hold them together is useful.

"These coolers serve a specific purpose/use for me.  I will preference this by saying that, though they are insulated, these are not designed for long-duration cooling during such activities as camping.  These ARE great for single day or overnight uses like camping, hauling cold or hot items to/from parties, etc.  In short ... they lack really cool insulating capabilities like those found in larger coolers.The lid's are not attached & appear to be hollow (no insulation)With that being said ... here's why I like these!  The ability to stack these is GREAT!  When loading for a short trip or smaller, multi-day trips, the ability to stack them in a orderly fashion makes for better space planning.  Color coding - I buy these (and the 25 qt size) in different colors for different uses; cold/frozen stuff (like meats), dry goods (bread, chips, small cereal boxes), canned goods (perfect for canned good items!) and lastly, drinks (sodas, juice boxes, etc).  Some of these items get ice, others don't ... you get that though.  Makes for an organized load, organized camping or event, etc...Speaking on the topic of stacking ... also think home storage.  The ability to keep these stacked uniformly at home is critical to maximizing my storage.  How many times are you left with a bunch of coolers that are all mis-matched & they form a weird, leaning pile in your garage?  Final thoughts on storage ... After use & drying, I make sure & toss in a 'Fridge & Freezer' baking soda box in each cooler & it seems to keep them fresh for the next use.Just ordered 3 more!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMJ6XMP9CQ95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BMCORC#wasThisHelpful","R1AMJ6XMP9CQ95","A3ETB0VMA9UXKK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ETB0VMA9UXKK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Measurements (hole cutout) were ~50mm as they were noted to be.  The overall OD is 60mm.  The opening (pie shaped, textured piece) is secured to the removable cap & is spring loaded so you can rotate it out of the way to form an opening.  My only ""issue"" is the color .... they SURE do look tan/beige when I got them.  If you are looking for true GREY to match a GREY desktop, these are far from the correct color.  For me, this color is actually BETTER to match the marbled counter-top they go thru.  They are much thinner & lesser quality than the ones I purchased locally but they will work for my intended needs despite using a 2"" holesaw to cutout the openings for these (they fit loose in a 2"" cutout)","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38G67O2442S4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZCUDL0#wasThisHelpful","R38G67O2442S4E","A3ETB0VMA9UXKK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ETB0VMA9UXKK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Poor ... Cheap ... Junk.I had bought a ""cheap"" version of this from my local sporting goods store & had hoped to pick up a few more like it thru Amazon.  The local one I purchased was less money & WAY better built.  It had a bungee 'hem' to help keep it pulled downwards towards the reel & a loop at the top to hand the rod (if needed).This one came in & it is nothing more than about 6' of wire loom wrap.  The end was melted to keep it from unraveling & then folded over on itself to form the rod tip entry hole (""the bell shape"").  Nothing to keep the opening that ""bell shape"".  The rod tip end was held closed by a 1"" long piece of heat shrink tubing melted to form a tip.Needless to say, I would NOT order another one of these from Amazon.

"Initial impressions are that this is an attractive piece of hardware, however a couple things I am missing from my 5 year old Iogear keybaord:  1--there's no ""STOP"" button.  I can play & pause, but that's not quite the same.  2--there's no scroll wheel.  That was the 2nd thing I missed from the Iogear keyboard when scrolling through long lists.  We'll see how ""page down"" works...  3--the batteries are not replaceable. I know that was in the description, but I'm a little concerned that I have a throwaway keyboard. I had my Iogear keyboard for 5 years and went through maybe 3 sets of AAA batteries. I can always put a new set of batteries in that, versus throwing away the entire keyboard.  I may return this and just order another Iogear keyboard....I do like the backlight, so I'll need to try this out a few days to see if I like the backlight more than the missing functions.Update after a couple days trying out--this keyboard is losing a couple stars because it's not very ergonomic to type on. It's downright uncomfortable for a touch typist, in fact. Key caps are flat, too close together and and completely undifferentiated. I really miss the trackball and super convenient mouse button placement on the IOgear keyboard.  I do like the backlighting on the logitech, but it's a night & day difference using the two keyboards side by side.  The I just printed a return label for this keyboard and ordered another IOgear GKM561R  keyboard. I've heard recent iterations of the IOGear keyboard might have some quality issues, so I have my fingers crossed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDQ3Y246V0X34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2LIC44#wasThisHelpful","RDQ3Y246V0X34","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this about 4 years ago for use on my home theatre PC. Great feeling keyboard.  The positioning of the trackball, scroll wheel and mouse buttons are intuitive and incredibly useful.  The dedicated multimedia keys work well. Batteries are replaceable and last many months. The only two things I do not like about this keyboard is that the trackball can be a bit finicky when your hands are very dry, and the backslash key is in the incorrect place. This key is used for mapping/browsing windows network drives. It's just something to get used to.I just purchased a Logitech K830 illuminated keyboard for twice the price because I'm moving some things around and need another keyboard.

"Great size for small pills--just what I was looking for.  However, there are two things that are a problem.  First issue - there's no water-tight seal. The reason that is an issue is that a water tight seal not only prevents water from entering, but also keeps the cap on securely. The rubber o-ring provides a bit of resistance to the cap slowly working its way loose.  I do have an easy fix for this because I happen to have a bunch of keyboard o-rings that I bought for my keyboard. These work perfectly. Here's the link--I found the blue ones work best.  Cherry MX Rubber O-Ring Switch Dampeners Blue 40A-R - 0.4mm Reduction (125pcs)Second issue -  I wish the cap and the body were attached together with a small lanyard or chain. This isn't so much an issue as a wish list item because I have not found other products that have this feature. This would be beneficial to prevent dropping one or the other pieces.The size of pills it can contain is slightly bigger than the tiny nitroglycerin pill holder found at most drug stores, so this works better for me.I have tried several other versions of pill holders and found that this one best fits my needs so giving it a pretty good rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGEPR3TTEVYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L22QP1S#wasThisHelpful","R1IGEPR3TTEVYS","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a great purchase and I'd buy it again.  It rates 5 stars because it's a great heater and fairly quiet, but there are a couple things that it should have. 1--there is no OFF switch.  You can turn down the thermostat to the  point that it will not come on, but there's no actual OFF setting.  In my installation I paired this with a Leviton LTB60-1LZ Decora 1800W timer so that I could hit a single button to turn it on for up to an hour and it will then shut off automatically. 2--when this heater is installed, you can choose to leave it at the full 1500 watts, or disconnect one of the heater element wires so that it runs at half power. I plan to add a small rocker switch to the front so that I can change the heat output easily.In my opinion, the #1 modification was essential, but #2 is just a nice to have that I probably won't use too much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEGTLJ2MF775/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002YTLBI#wasThisHelpful","R2ZEGTLJ2MF775","A10LWFKVC21F82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10LWFKVC21F82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I fly most every week for work and the airline seats hurt my back because there's little to no lumbar support. I finally found this pillow and provides just enough support so that my back doesn't hurt. It would also work in a car or stationary chair, but for those uses I'd recommend just getting a small regular pillow since there's no need to deflate.The pillow self-inflated in 1-2 minutes. I found that I even needed to let some air out after the plane gained altitude. Inflate to about 50-75% of where you really want it and it should be just about right when you're in the air. It's easy enough to add or remove air either way though, so don't sweat it.The only downside is that this does not pack down to be terribly small, but it still fits in a carry-on easily.
