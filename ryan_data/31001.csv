"This cable from AZsales is NOT RG58/U coax as stated.  It is RG58A/U which is slightly smaller and has slightly more attenuation.  It is also of different construction.

"These are very well made from high quality materials.  They do seem to run a little small compared to other brands I have used, but not to a large degree.There is one area which could use improvement, the waistband.  The waistband rolls up into an elastic rope very quickly and easily.  This might not happen so much if you have almost no body fat and a totally flat rock hard mid section (I do not), but for most people the waistband is likely to roll up instead of staying flat like some other brands.Otherwise this is the best quality supporter I have ever seen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL00T4VE9XZZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YSIE38#wasThisHelpful","RL00T4VE9XZZG","A1TR3G8YUR8QMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TR3G8YUR8QMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The UV5R belt clips both original and Tenq (which are identical) have one major flaw.  The hinge pin is not held in place by anything.  It has no retainers on either end, so it slowly moves out of the clip and causes everything to fall apart resulting in a radio drop test.  Don't trust the UV5R belt clips  Get a belt case instead.  As to these, they ARE the original Baofeng UV5R (and variants) belt clips in every way.This would have one star if it weren't for the fact that these are OEM and no different from what comes on your radio.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ORTWUBXAGS0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MK8SP70#wasThisHelpful","R3ORTWUBXAGS0S","A1TR3G8YUR8QMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TR3G8YUR8QMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a number of HT antennas and for performance, this has proven to be the best.  In addition it seems to be the most physically durable as well.  You can fold it in half and it jumps right back to a straight line.  When I need the radio/antenna to be compact I just bend this antenna around in a 3/4 circle and clip it under the belt clip.  You wouldn't want to TX like that.  The SWR must be terrible and you could harm your radio.It outperforms the Nagoya NA771 by a little bit and is similar to the Diamond SRJF40A.  The problem with the Diamond is that although it is a bendable antenna, it is too flimsy to stay in the shape/position you put it.  Move the radio gently and the antenna flops about eventually drooping toward the ground.  But when straight, it performs well too.  Obviously the Sainsonic outperforms all the shorter antennas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35W2N3S5IZQ5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBWGMW2#wasThisHelpful","R35W2N3S5IZQ5K","A1TR3G8YUR8QMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TR3G8YUR8QMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wouldn't really call it flexible as much as bendable.  To me flexible means springy.  This antenna is like a microphone gooseneck.  You bend it to a different shape and it stays there, sort of.  It doesn't hold it's position well enough though.  If you move the radio gently the antenna loses it's position and droops.  Not all that practical.  However I got it to use with a HT on the belt so that this could slide under my coat and move with me, yet still give me extra gain over the stock antenna.  For that it works pretty well.  The only disadvantage is the base coil which is rigid and 3 inches long, so don't bend too much or you can break it off the radio.As to gain, it certainly receives and transmits better than the stock rubber duck that comes on HTs.  So performance is a definite improvement.You will have to decide if these features fit your need.  For some it will and for others not.  If it were a bit stiffer (held position better) it would have been a 4 star rating to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OFVME3ZLJSVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OAHS6Q4#wasThisHelpful","R2OFVME3ZLJSVB","A1TR3G8YUR8QMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TR3G8YUR8QMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased 4 of these almost 6 months ago.  Fit and function is good, except for the fact that even when only worn once to twice a week each, they have all fallen apart at the same seam.  Where the cup is sewn to the elastic straps, the stitching on all four has come loose at between 4 - 6 months.  Obviously a defective bit of sewing as it is also a chain stitch, which means if a thread comes loose the whole thing unravels.  Typical of cheap sewing.If you don't mind a little sewing on each unit then these should last about normally.  If you do not sew then don't buy these.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FCF8EW7YE9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GCWGX8#wasThisHelpful","R23FCF8EW7YE9U","A1TR3G8YUR8QMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TR3G8YUR8QMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, it works as expected in that it replaces your battery (it is a battery eliminator not a charger) and powers your radio from a 12 volt accessory socket.A couple poor design features to be aware of though:The cord is a coiled cord, but the coils are very stiff.  At rest it is about 2 feet long, but if you try to stretch it out, by the time you get to three feet it is pulling out of the car socket.  I would say that for most people, they would have a lot of trouble talking on the radio with that limitation combined with the fact that at that length you are playing tug of war if it stays plugged in.Also the cord comes out of the bottom of the battery adapter, which means you cannot stand your radio up.  Not a concern for car use but in emergency use where you might have to be on 12 volt power indoors, you cannot stand up your radio.  This means your antenna is operating at well below maximum efficiency.It seems that just a little forethought and beta testing of this product would have made it a MUCH better product with little or no change to cost.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HSUWXBDU9CI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZ6VGUW#wasThisHelpful","R3HSUWXBDU9CI4","A1TR3G8YUR8QMG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TR3G8YUR8QMG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unit had 2 defects: 1) It would not latch onto radio.  Never snapped into place and even with good firm press would just slide back off, 2) when you plugged it in the power light went on and then faded to black.  Tried several sockets.  You had to remove it and wait 30 seconds to plug it on and same thing all over.  Power to radio did same thing.  Started up then turned off in a few seconds.  I also bought a BL-5 (for UV5R) and it worked fine on the appropriate radioSince it has good reviews, I returned this one for a refund and order another.  Will see how that does.A couple other poor design features, the cord is a coiled cord, but the coils are very stiff.

"The one thing that I knew that I had to overcome in order to start really losing weight was late night cravings. For some reason no matter how great of a diet day I would be having, I would mess everything up with a late night binge. I tried to work everything out on my own, but was not successful. Eventually I decided to try some kind of supplement. I am not a stranger to supplements and have used them in the past with success. I was going to use one that I had had success with in the past, but my friend was going on and on about this particular supplement. We are both late night snackers and she swore that this was the only supplement that really curbed those cravings. I decided to trust her and ordered this product. I must admit that she was right about being able to control cravings. I have not had a late night binge in a while. A night of no late night binges is one thing, but for me to go weeks without having a late night binge is beyond impressive. This supplement has really helped me to achieve my diet goals and I highly recommend it if you are finding yourself in a similar situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VM0JY1PPCTA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6MLMOC#wasThisHelpful","R1VM0JY1PPCTA9","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a Shany makeup kit a handful of months ago and fell in love with the white eyeshadow that came in it. I ended up using it almost every day and was disappointed when I realized I was running out. I came on here and found that I could order an individual container of the white eyeshadow and instantly ordered it. I already knew how much I liked it so I was a very happy camper when it came in the mail. It looks great, doesn’t clump, and is easy to take off at night. Another awesome Shany purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FE4H60GO4HNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQAT8SA#wasThisHelpful","R1FE4H60GO4HNN","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always impressed with the quality of Shany brand cosmetics, but this lip gloss is definitely my favorite out of everything that I had tried so far. I spent some time carefully picking out my favorite color, but it only took a few seconds after applying to fall in love with it. I am planning on buying more of the colors to add to my makeup collection. I love how smooth it is once applied and how long the color lasts throughout the day.

"I have been slowly switching over to using Shany products for all of my makeup needs. As soon as I run out of something, I quickly replace it with a Shany brand version. Not only has this saved me money, but I am actually happier with the overall quality of the product. This liquid shimmer is no different and I could instantly see a difference after applying it. I love the natural glow that my face gives off after I apply this and I have definitely converted a bunch of my friends to this brand over some of the other lower quality, but more expensive brands.

"This was the first book of this series that my little one read to me instead of me reading to her. I have been reading Oliver & Jumpy to her for quite some time now and was so excited (and proud) when she was finished reading to me! We both had a sweet tooth after reading the first story and I definitely used Joey’s incident as a way to talk about how too much of a good thing can be bad. The second story in this series was also a hit with us, as I had lost my voice last summer when we went to an amusement park (too much screaming on rides, I guess). My little one said that we needed a fairy queen for the next time we go to an amusement park, which definitely made me chuckle. I am always amused by this series and my youngest is always very excited when I download the next book.

"If you have been following this series then you know that it is high quality. If you haven’t been following this series, but you enjoy westerns then I highly recommend taking a look at this set. As someone who has really enjoyed the previous books in this series, I was very interested to see how everything was going to close. I think that Luis Antwoord has outdone himself. I found myself questing what I would do in the same situation as our main character. I think my favorite part about this book was sitting back and thinking about the inner struggle that must have taken place when it came to defending the land. It is easy to see truth in the saying “it's a gift and a curse”. I think this wrap up fit this series perfectly and I am not at all disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R252BI8IF04A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WITHBN0#wasThisHelpful","R2R252BI8IF04A","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main reason that I liked this story so much was simply how relatable of a character Ray was. Ray wants to escape his current situation. He wants more out of life than what his surroundings can provide and he starts to come up with a plan to take a new path. Unfortunately, his plan does not end up playing out exactly as it should (due to outside forces) and he is forced to go in a different direction. You can definitely get the sense of “things have a funny way of working out” when you are reading this book and it helps to instill a pretty positive outlook on your own life.

It turns out that much more happens on this journey than our main character could have ever imagined.

"The thing that I love about Michelle Eastwood’s stories is the fact that regardless of your background (or religion) you can really take something away from the stories. I am not very religious; however, I love an inspiring read. This series definitely takes you on a journey. There is tragedy and a sense of being broken, but then you get to see the strength and the actions that can be taken to make everything whole again. I think that everyone can become inspired by these stories. This, mixed with the wonderful writing style of this author makes this set a great read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14YSVNWBMANSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUBAUVI#wasThisHelpful","R14YSVNWBMANSI","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not purchased this bundle, but I have read these books individually and I wanted to post a review on this set because this is an awesome series. You get drawn into the story and the connection (or lack of connection) that the characters have. If you are interested in romance and drama, especially paranormal romance then this is one of those series that you have to read. I am a sucker for love and this story definitely kept me wanting more and more. This author knows how to draw you in and keep you on the edge of your seat; I highly recommend this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHB64CMCTTLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UPEE1WY#wasThisHelpful","R3MHB64CMCTTLZ","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been on a historical romance kick of late and books like this one is exactly why. There was so much tension and excitement, not to mention love, throughout this story. It was very interesting to see how the roles of power played into a love story. This was a different take on love then what I am used to reading about, but I ate it up and could not stop reading. I could relate to the unconditional love that Aaron has to give and it is intense to read his story. I ended this book and just wanted more; my attention was completely captured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASBZUHGFNEVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US7J7AY#wasThisHelpful","RASBZUHGFNEVD","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yay! Yet another book in this series that I must give a positive review to. My little one is always excited when I purchase a new set of stories in this series, we have both become very fond of the adventures of Oliver and Jumpy. If you are looking for a cute series that offers adventure, moral values, and (my little one’s favorite) adorable illustrations then this is one of those series that I’d recommend picking up. My little one got a huge kick out of the first story in this series, we too had a little incident with a hide & go seek game gone wrong. Overall this is a series that I think most kids will love; it’s a crowd pleaser at our house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y82XJ7JBKTPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMKWMBC#wasThisHelpful","R2Y82XJ7JBKTPM","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My fiancé and I started our relationship on the internet, which made this a very enjoyable and adorable read for me. I loved being able to feel the giddiness that our main character feels with every new message from him and it’s interesting to watch it grow and grow. This is one of those books that have you hooked and tug at your heartstrings. I honestly think this is a great representation of new age romance. Social networking (technology, really) now plays a huge part in how relationships work and it was great to see a book encompass that. If you are a sucker for romance then I recommend this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YE13YG68AHE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TM0N2Y0#wasThisHelpful","R2YE13YG68AHE3","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such an adorable story that my youngest and I really enjoyed. We ended up having a pillow fight afterwards; one thing that she really liked. I enjoyed being able to discuss the concept of dreams, especially with regards to being able to make dreams a reality (such as when she is older). My youngest liked the few pictures that there was. I think that there could have been a few more pictures; however, she still sat and listened without moving so I don’t believe that the lack of pictures takes away from the quality.

"I am very anxiety ridden when it comes to my health. I constantly think that there is something wrong with me and am constantly spending nights wide awake being unable to fall asleep because I think that X thing is wrong with me. That is when it was suggested to me that I start to spend time fixing my diet. I knew that improving my diet would help and got on board to create a healthier lifestyle for myself and my family. The DASH diet was also recommend and since I know this author’s writing style and enjoy it I went ahead and purchased this book. This book provided me with awesome information on the DASH diet and delicious recipes to help me stay on track. Basically I started to feel more confident that I was taking the right steps to being healthy and my anxiety started to ease away.

"Despite the winter time there has been an awful lot of rain where I live. I walk my dog multiple times throughout the day and an umbrella is a must. Unfortunately my old umbrella broke and I knew that I needed to replace it. I have had great experiences in the past with this company and therefore felt confident to order an umbrella from them. The package came quickly and I was so excited to see the design. I am a sucker for the sky blue color and this brought a huge smile to my face. It is a little stiff to get open, but is nice and sturdy. I am very impressed with this umbrella and know that I will be using it to walk my dog in the rain for quite a while.

"My fiancé is a big tea guy. He loves tea and is always telling me how great tea is for your body and mind. I am not a huge fan of tea, unless it is cold and sweetened (haha). With that being said I have a huge issue with anxiety. I am an anxious wreck and it seems to be worse at night when I am trying to sleep. I do not want to be heavily medicated, but I was reaching my breaking point. My fiancé convinced me to try tea. We came onto Amazon and picked out this book, which not only gave me some ways to make great tasting tea (which is not something I ever thought I’d say) but also provided me with the benefits of the herbs that I was drinking.

I decided that I was going to make him a sweets table (if you will) for his birthday to show him that he can still eat all of the desserts that he loves. I decided to do a few test runs at my parent’s house and was so blown away by how delicious each dessert I made was.

Dan Howe not only shares 33 tips that are beneficial to those selling on Fiverr, but provides tips and advice to those simply trying to earn an income online.

"To be completely honest, I never thought that I would be reviewing a chicken and waffle recipe book. If I am being even more honest I never actually thought that I would be making any kind of chicken and waffle recipes. That changed when I moved in with my boyfriend (now fiancé) and his brother. We started taking turns making dinner a few nights a week and one of the first nights my boyfriend’s brother made us chicken and waffles. I was so taken back by the mix of these two foods that I almost thought they were pranking me. I found out later that they are both very into chicken and waffles and now know how popular these recipes are. It has been a while since that has happened and my fiancé and I now have our own home; however, I still think back to that chicken and waffle dinner. I purchased this chicken and waffle recipe book because my boyfriend’s brother is coming over for dinner and I wanted to have a little throw-back to that night. I am not a great cook; however, this recipe book was very fun and easy to follow. My chicken and waffle dinner turned out awesome (I made more than one of these recipes for that night) and the four of us (his brother brought his new girlfriend) had a wonderful night.

"I cannot help but rant and rave over this book. I am one of those people who has tried and failed when it comes to losing weight. I know that a huge portion of the problem was that I wanted results instantly. Unfortunately it had taken me a lot longer than I care to admit to actually understand that you cannot expect instant results when it comes to weight loss. If you do something that result in an instant weight loss then there is a chance that you are either causing yourself harm or you are going to be gaining the weight right back. My point is that I had finally understood this and was ready to try something that was slower, but that was going to lead me to success in the end. I had heard of the Ketogenic diet before and was very excited when my boyfriend told me that his friend recommended this book. I was mainly so excited because his friend had lost over 100 pounds and that is the direction I knew that I was headed. I purchased this book and to my surprise I received more than just a recipe book for losing weight. I learned the ins and outs (the history, if you will) of this diet and how it really works to help me look and feel my best. I have lost 20 pounds in less time than I would have imagined and I feel so much healthier. I plan on continuing using what I have learned in this book, as well as enjoy the delicious recipes, as I continue my quest to a healthier life. If you are looking for something that really works then I highly recommend this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3NYXTPX4RS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5CG1ES#wasThisHelpful","R1W3NYXTPX4RS0","A3HS9FKICF0PG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HS9FKICF0PG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was such an awesome diet cookbook. Recently I have been trying to get back on track with my weight loss. I had been very successful and lost up towards 90 pounds, but then I stopped working so hard and gained all but 20 pounds back. I knew that I had to try something that was going to be long lasting and that I could sustain on for the rest of my life. That is why I purchased a few different diet tip books, recipe books, and diet cookbooks. I am most impressed with this particular cookbook because you are receiving a lot of solid information about why the 20/20 diet works. You are not just receiving recipes that can help you lose weight, but actual information on how this diet can help you become a healthier (and thinner) person.

I am in the very beginning stages of planning my wedding (I am so happy and giddy that everything feels perfect) and I know that there is a slight high that comes from being engaged and trying to throw together a wedding. With that being said I know that marriage is not always easy and therefore anything that I can learn to keep me and my better half together (and happy) is appreciated.

"Five+Stars! My favorite genre to read is romantic suspense.  I have read each and every I-Team novel and listened to them on audio. They never disappoint.This story is a rollercoaster ride that starts quickly at what is supposed to be a boring Christmas party at a glorious Denver hotel, and turns into a nightmare. Ms. Clare takes us through every harrowing turn and dip. There is violence, cruelty and even death, but the biggest message in all her novels is loyalty, honor, family and love.  Through this terrible night, there is strong bonds holding this little group of people together. The love of husband and wife, precious friends and the promise of being there for each other. I cried, gasped and thought my heart stopped for a minute.  The only disappointing thing about this hot, action packed novel? It's the end of the I-Team stories.

"If your looking for a very sexy read with great characters and some laughs, I suggest this book.Chloe Franklin has lived in Beaufort, South Carolina her whole life.  She grew up in the house that was transformed into a bar and restaurant by her Mom. It is called Honey's and she's trying very hard to make it a successful tribute to her Mom. Two years ago she met a handsome Search and Rescuer named Gage McGraw, while he was in town for the weekend. The weekend was hot, sexy and memorable. So much so they have repeated it multiple times over the last two years. Chloe has a commitment phobia, so sporadic weekends is perfect for her.Gage is former military, and loves his job with search and rescue. The travel, the great emotional high of finding the missing, and the adrenaline rush make him feel alive. That is, until a recent rescue almost ended his life. He realized that if he had died, no one would miss him, and that was a wake up call. He is in Beaufort for three weeks training new recruits, and decided to try and make Chloe more than a weekend fling. Starting with dating.....seems simple enough but horrifies Chloe. So Gage resorts to bribery. If she agrees to go on a date he will happily give her whatever she wants.......which is hot sex.Gage wants to continue his travel and S&R, but Chloe doesn't want to sit waiting for his return from his dangerous missions. His pursuit of a date and her frustration with his rules  for sex made me laugh out loud.  As far as Chloe is concerned, ""love is a cliche."" She saw it in her own life, her Dad leaving and occasionally returning, and the depression and misery it caused her Mom. She would rather be alone than suffer from her heart breaking a little at a time.  Is there even a possible compromise?This sizzling story in a quaint little town is a quick fun read.

On her one and only escape from her boring routine, her friends convince her to go to frat party, and she remembers every moment, unfortunately so does he! He immediately calls her argyles, the socks she wears frequently, and actually tied him up with. His teasing and banter with Tess is hysterical until he realizes behind the shy mousey exterior is a very intelligent woman who has been traumatized by someone who should have been protecting her.This is a very sexy romance between two people who have serious issues and find themselves needing each other more than they could possibly have imagined.

It was bought by an up and coming investor who is keeping Cassie on as winemaker, but the house and grounds, including her home are owned by the buyer.

"What can I say that hasn't been said before?  Another emotional roller coaster ride from Ms. Ashley!  I spent the first half of the book crying and wanting to shake Millie for putting up with the heartbreak; at the same time so angry at Chaos and the brothers for being so cruel. But I didn't give up and Walk Through Fire, Millie and High (Logan) proved that Chaos Motorcycle Club are bad boys with a lot of heart.

"If you are a fan of Pamela Claire's novels, or even if you have never read one, grab this latest in her romantic suspense series, it will rock your world.Holly Bradshaw is an ""entertainment writer; a smart but shallow blonde; a woman who loves sex, expensive clothes, and good times with friends.""  She is close friends with the I-Team members, and their spouses, and they all feel very protective of her. In fact, joking with Kara, (wife of Reese) she was daydreaming about which of the men would be her fantasy. She immediately thought of Julian Darcangelo,  who she has had a secret crush on for years. I have to heartily agree with her on that choice. But, Holly does not play with married men.  She is dating Sasha Dudaev, a billionaire known for his interest in gas, oil and the arts. He is very generous with gifts, but Holly is finding him boring. Holly dates a lot of rich, intriguing, often dangerous men.Nick Andris is Holly's next door neighbor and has been investigating her for months. He listens, tracks her with a gps system, delved into her background and family and has yet to figure out what his bosses in the CIA/SAD ( Special Activities Division) could possibly want with her.  Other than the scumbag she is dating, who is involved with a lot more illegal dangerous things than he lets others know. Nick has a history with Sasha, and nothing would make him happier than taking him down dead or alive. Ms. Bradshaw seems to be a lover of expensive beautiful things, and men, not dangerous. It's time for Nick Andris ( alias Andrews) and Holly to meet. After all, their first encounter she wasn't aware he was there.I couldn't put this book down after the first chapter. It's shocking, funny and so heartwarming. So much fun to have all the characters together, the men bantering, all the kids, and the courageous women of the I-Team.  The epilogue alone is worth five stars as far as I'm concerned. I don't want the I-Team Series to end, but if this is the last story it ends with a blaze of glory.I received this ARC from the author for an honest review.

"I will be honest and say I don't usually enjoy reading novels about lawyers, legal problems or courtrooms. Sustained proved to me that legal novels are not all the same and this one has a lot of heart.Jake Becker is a well known defense attorney for a prestigious law firm in D.C. He is powerful, controlled and dedicated to routine, which includes his love life of one night stands. That is until two important things happen to him. One, a former hook up appears in his office with the news she has an STD. That rocks his control, a lot. He tests negative but decides he needs to change his routine and actually get to know a woman before he beds her, like actual dating. Two, while walking on the street he literally runs into a young boy who topples over in front of him. He helps him to his feet, the boy apologizes and is gone. Jake suddenly realizes his wallet is missing and goes after the boy. His life will change when he catches this child and learns his story.Chelsea McQuaid was in grad school enjoying her life with friends. But a phone call changes all that. Her life is uprooted and she has moved to D.C. to take care of her six nieces and nephews who were orphaned when their parents ( Chelsea's brother and only living relative) were killed in a car accident. The children range in age from 13 years-6 months. They are reeling from their grief and the upheaval in their lives, and though they love Aunt Chelsea, they are missing their parents. When Jake shows up with eight year old Rory, explains what happened, he can see the turmoil in the house on the shoulders of a young beautiful woman on her own. He agrees not to press charges, leaves his card for her if he can help. But, he can't seem to get Chelsea and those children out of his head.Sustained is a wonderful love story, not only between Chelsea and Jake but the children as well. I laughed a lot and shed some tears. Jake at times was frustrating but so lovable. These characters grabbed me from the first page, and when it ended I wanted more.  This can be read as a stand alone, but I'm anxious to read the next in the series Appealed.Pat Fordyce","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZR07IRPUZ68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501102079#wasThisHelpful","R2MZR07IRPUZ68","AYIPGMUURK82V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYIPGMUURK82V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is always a pleasure to review a Jill Shalvis novel.

She is determined to go on a blind date, even though Darcy is trying to tell her the dress she's wearing makes her look like a granny going to bingo. Darcy has convinced Zoe to start this date off right, get the goodnight kiss over with when she opens the door, the rest of the night will be so more relaxing.Parker James is an Agent in Charge for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service.

He is quite amused when he knocks and the door and is opened by a long legged beauty who kisses him with out a word. Yes, he's going to enjoy his stay in Sunshine, Idaho.

But underneath is a beautiful love story, with a little danger and all our friends from Sunshine. Parker is trying to bring down a dangerous animal poacher, but Zoe gets under his skin.

"The Billionaire's Return  Dare Valley Meets Paris Book 4  Ava MilesMargie and Evan's parting in Paris was heartbreaking. After refusing his marriage proposal, he refused contact with her....his driver took her to the airport, he never answered phone calls, or texts. She just wanted to talk...explain.The bakery was off to an amazing start. She had more customers every day, and she was thrilled, but a big part of her was missing the joy. She missed Evan terribly. She even went so far as to contact Chase for help. Evan buried himself in his inventions and heartache. After Chase dragged him out of his lab, made him eat, and talked sense to him, Evan was going to Denver. He would try one more time.When Evan and Margie saw each other, they both new their love was solid. But, Margie still feared the notoriety, the lavish spending and it frightened her all over again. Evan had a solution, and a very good one, that would benefit so many people in Dare Valley.  Life was good, until Margie's parents interfered and caused more heartache and pain. Once again she realized she couldn't live like that. But, with the help of friends and looking deep into her heart, she couldn't live without Evan.This was an enjoyable series, and Ms. Miles told a beautiful story. I'm not a huge fan of serials, but Dare Valley Meets Paris flowed easily, the characters both in Dave Valley and Paris were a delight. All four books are released now, so the reader can read them all in order.  A very beautiful love story, with mouth watering baked goods.I received this ARC from the publisher for an honest reviewPat Fordyce","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0E3CJS69JQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147GF1VU#wasThisHelpful","R3A0E3CJS69JQG","AYIPGMUURK82V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYIPGMUURK82V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Grace Andrews arrived in Las Vegas five years ago, and has been working on her life plan. She wants financial security, a home and even a family if she found the right guy. Her job as a fight promoter for the MFL has provided her with financial security, she is moving in with ""the fight matchmaker"" Erik Johnson, who is vice-president for the league of MMA fighters and hopefully has an engagement ring in her future. She is a little frustrated that Erik never seems to have time for her, but working together they at least see each other. Doing a favor for her best friend Kylie didn't seem that big a deal. Kylie's brother, Walker Adams, needs a place to crash for a few weeks, even if it's her couch. She had a huge crush on Walker when she was fifteen; now she is older, wiser and in a relationship. Grace sees hard, muscled, chiseled men all day, why does the sight of Walker shirtless leave her with a dry mouth and heart palpitations?Walker Adams has been sleeping in his jeep for a few weeks. He was cut off from his family after dropping out of law school to pursue his MMA fighting career. Staying with Grace was a huge help. She also set him up with a job, a very strict trainer, who  has led him to the chance for the first fight as a professional being a blockbuster.....if he survived. Grace is very much against this fight, she knows the fighter, Walker is no match. But, he is determined to fight, so she is all in, in more ways than one.I enjoyed this book, a lot. I'm not a huge fan of books based in Las Vegas,  they always seem too glitzy and have questionable characters. Grace and Walker are the exception. I enjoyed their easy banter, and slow realization of their feelings. But Grace  was still in a ""relationship"" with Erik while this was going on. Don't enjoy that a lot.If your into MMA fighting, Walker Adams is the underdog to root for.I received this ARC from the publisher and NetGalley for an honest review.Pat Fordyce","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYL1D2F7WDOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGG11L0#wasThisHelpful","RLYL1D2F7WDOY","AYIPGMUURK82V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYIPGMUURK82V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel opens with a prologue, and we meet a little girl named Sunny. It is her birthday and she has a party, cake and friends. She is sure it is her best birthday ever, but what happens later that night will change and haunt her for the rest of her life.Sara Richards grew up with three brothers that lived next door. Being an only child, the boys and parents treated her like one of their own.  Rusty the oldest is a firefighter, Sam the middle son is a police officer, and Chris the youngest just finished his tour as a Navy Medic. He is now in medical school and working as a para-medic for the experience and helping to pay for school. He is almost done with his probation, and ironically his supervisor is none other than Sara. They have a easy relationship, and when Chris is looking for a place in Denver instead of his parents home, Sara offers him her extra bedroom to help her with rent. They both work the night shift called ""deep night"" and sleep and study during the day. Sara had a huge crush on Cris as a teenager, but a lot of things have changed, and she wants no part of a relationship. They live and work very well together, but Chris would like more.This entertaining novel takes us behind the scene for a look at First Responders. The calls they are sent on vary from heart attacks, drug overdoses and everything in-between. Sara suffers from nightmares ( her nickname is Sunny) and Chris has flashbacks to his harrowing experiences as a field medic and his own injuries. It shows the human side of PTSD, service dogs and the wonderful things they do, with a sweet friends to lover's romance adding spice.This is the third book of Denver Heroes, it can be read as a stand alone, but the stories do connect. Very enjoyable story, and one I recommend.I received this ARC from the publisher and NetGalley for a honest review.Pat Fordyce","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FX4V74QMYLZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNDP1B8#wasThisHelpful","R3FX4V74QMYLZ6","AYIPGMUURK82V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYIPGMUURK82V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel opens with a Marine on his tour of duty getting letters from someone from home. They grew up together, but have always had a rocky relationship. The letters between Tristan Lawson and Lemon McCoy are funny, sarcastic and sometimes even sweet giving us an idea of their ""friendship.""After an injury that sends him home he heads straight to Lemon's house, where he is turned away by Apple, Lemon's sister, telling him lies to ""protect her sister."" Lemon never learns about this encounter. A few years go by, Tristan is now the head librarian in their struggling library, Lemon owns her own business and is still living at home. She delivers some papers from her father to Tristan, and the old sparks combust. For one amazing night, all their bickering is pushed aside. But in the morning, it's back. But, something happened that night that can't be swept aside. Lemon is pregnant, she wants the baby and she wants to marry Tristan.This novel can be read as a stand alone, but characters from previous books are a large part of the story. I found myself wanting to shake Apple for her cruelty to both Tristan and Lemon. Their growing love is sweet and touching, and they find out they can handle just about anything together even with interference and bumps in the road.

"This is the fourth book in the Worth the Fight series and I found it somewhat different than the first three. An emotional roller coaster is the best way I can describe it.It is enjoyable to read how the previous characters are spending their lives.Violet Channing grew up with a very strict, emotionless military father.  Her best friends, Jeremy Edwards and Cain Sorensen, from military families also, were three years older than her but accepted her tagging along. When she was sixteen, Cain and Jeremy went on their first deployment. Cain gave her a mind bending kiss, her first, and she was in love. Cain is the strong very silent type, so he hardly ever contacted her, Jeremy on the other hand wrote as often as he could, saw her every time he came home and finally with a lot of fanfare, proposed. She said yes. But, on a mission not long after, Jeremy was killed.Cain Sorensen, former Army Ranger, MMA fighter and a contractor for IMF (International Military Coalition), has loved Violet since their first kiss, so many years ago. But as Jeremy's best friend, he stood back and tried to be happy for them. When Jeremy was killed, he went straight to Violet as soon as he could. But instead of pursuing her, he couldn't get past survivor's guilt, his own poor self image and his need to frequently disappear. He knew he could never be good enough for her, so instead, would pull her close when he needed her, then turn around and be gone. Violet has had enough of the way he treats her, if she could only be strong enough to not forgive him and send him on his way.I wanted to bash Cain and Violet's head together a few times. Little or no communication, loving each other with all their hearts, but could not put it into words.The ending is perfect and worth the frustration.  Cain and Violet are a couple destined to love, if they could just get over their fear and guilt.I received this ARC from the publisher and Netgalley for an honest review.Pat Fordyce","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFW7DGA0YPPKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE1J5M8#wasThisHelpful","RFW7DGA0YPPKG","AYIPGMUURK82V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYIPGMUURK82V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another delightful read in the Late Bloomers series, and get ready for Ivy Cross! Ivy is ""a breaker of rules and hearts and has crossed the threshold of middle age and lost her spark.""  She is tired of her job as an economist for the American Embassy even though she is being offered an unexpected promotion. She needs a big change. One of her options is Ruben Allegre. A very handsome business man from Madrid who is best friend's with Mateo, Rose's lover now fiancé from Wild Rose. Ruben is a charming, flirtatious ladies man who has set his sights on Ivy. He wants her to stay in London or come to Madrid where they can spend time together. Ivy is attracted to Ruben, but is not interested in a relationship and dodges his every move.Along comes Christoph Brandt, a serious business rival of Ruben's and he sets his sights on Ivy, offering her a very lucrative job in Germany, with a BMW to sweeten the deal. Ivy is very tempted, but Ruben's determined to not let her go. The scenario is very well written and keeps you guessing; will it be Ruben, or Christoph and Germany, or something not yet in her sight?The Late Bloomers are an amazing group of five best friends, more like sisters, all have different personalities, dreams and hopes, but I think Ivy and Rose could not be any more opposite!  If you haven't read Wild Rose, you should!  The characters are delightful, the locations beautiful, and the stories will warm your heart.

"Avery Crosslin, wedding planner, is hurrying to the venue for the wedding she and her half sister Sofia, have planned down to the last detail. The one thing she hadn't planned for was running into a scorpion in her path. She throws a glue gun, missed, now is aiming a can of hair spray when a deep voice informs her that scorpions can hold there breath for a week.  He than crushes the scorpion with a well worn boot.  Joe Travis, of the rich and famous Travis's introduces himself. Joe is a photographer, commercial and free lance. He is attending the wedding she has planned as a guest, and is fascinated by the wedding planner. Avery is a full figured woman, wears boxy, loose comfortable clothes, and is not interested in men. Ironically she was left at the altar for her own wedding, and she's much happier planning.Sofia and Avery met a few years ago at their fathers bedside. He had a massive stroke and was not expected to live. He was a serial husband, married five times with children scattered everywhere. Sofia grew up in San Antonio, Avery in Dallas, and from their first meeting they were best friends, and the business they started was becoming successful.This can be read as a stand alone, but I think you would love to meet the other Travis brothers. Joe is persistent in trying to convince Avery they would be good together, but, as in all good romances there are obstacles, some personal, some career choices. I totally enjoyed the characters, the romance and a second little romance working as a side plot. We also reconnect with some characters from the previous books.

"This book should come with a warning label!  ""Very Hot.....Proceed With Caution!""Young lovers Seth and Rowan are inseparable, until a tragic night tears them apart. Seth ends up going to prison for something he didn't do, trying to protect her and her brother, Jase. Rowan is suddenly alone, again, when her brother and Seth go to prison. Everyone important in her life eventually leaves her.Seven years later, Seth is in the Marines and realizes how his anger and cruelty nearly destroyed both of them. He needs to see her and beg her forgiveness and prove he has never stopped loving her.Rowan is strong independent and needs no one. Least of all the man she unfortunately still loves, but refuses to accept back in her life. Seth won't give up, but how long can he take Rowan's biting remarks, acting like he's invisible and belittling comments.  He breaks down her barriers and they do have sex.....but that's all it is sex, and she immediately returns to her hard cold ways.This was an emotional read for me. They both had their hearts broken, but they were so young. Seth survived prison, lived through deployments in Afghanistan and other dangerous places and finally realized what he needed to do to get his life back on course. Rowan has grown up, made a good life for herself, but just can't find it in her heart to forgive and move on. I'm afraid at times I wanted to shake Rowan and scream ""listen!""This is a very sexy, at times heartbreaking novel. It's the first in a series and the second revolves around Rowan's brother Jase.

"The Strongest Steel  A Second Circle Tattoos Novel  Scarlett ColeI LOVED this book. Now that I have said that, I will try and review this amazing story.Harper Connelly works in a coffee shop in South Beach, does not interact with many people, only her best friend Drea and the owner Jose. Drea pretty much bullied her way into her life and now Harper doesn't know what she would do without her. Harper survived a life threatening brutal attack seven years ago. Though her body has recovered, her heart and soul and life have not. She wears clothes that make her invisible and the slightest touch, even accidentally, can send her into a panic attack.She wants to take back her life and prove she's strong and takes the unlikeliest route you would suspect.Trent Andrews is the co-owner of Second Circle Tattoo. He was mentored and taught the art of tattooing by Jr. Silver who recently passed away. Now he and Cujo, Trent's best friend from childhood are working their dream. Trent is a very good looking guy who enjoys women, beer and creating his masterpieces. He is well know for his amazing talent of tattooing over scars to cover them. At 1:00 AM on a very chilly morning as he's locking up, a young woman appears. She is small, very timid, and ready to run at the slightest hint of trouble. He reluctantly lets her in the shop, and his life is changed forever. Harper explains her wish to cover her scars. When Trent takes a look at her scars he is torn between rage that someone could do this to another person, sympathy for all she had been through and an overwhelming feeling to protect her.This is a novel that will grab you from the first few pages. It is sensual, with amazing characters, a bit of suspense, and one of the most beautiful love stories I have read this year. It is definitely on my list of best reads for 2015. I can't wait for the second in this series.Pat Fordyce","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OL725321WS82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WE0OS4S#wasThisHelpful","R3OL725321WS82","AYIPGMUURK82V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYIPGMUURK82V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second in a series and Ms. Covington again treats us to fascinating characters, sexy scenes and a strong female heroine.Carlisle Queen barely survived a terrorist attack; a bombing that cost the life of her lover and best friend and left her with shrapnel imbedded perilously close to her spine that could paralyze her or end her life. Not the life this young Olympic Medalist swimmer expected for herself. Carlyle suffers in constant pain she relieves with marijuana, heavy duty pain pills ( legal and illegal) and the oblivion they offer her. She also loves the release random sex gives her. Carlisle lives with the knowledge that someday she will be paralyzed and has decided she cannot live that way, and when the time comes she will take her own life. She has moved to Nashville to go to college, mainly to distance her self from her overprotective and smothering parents.Mateo Butler is a TA for Spanish at the university. He just so happens to have Carlisle in his class. He is fascinated by her and feels a hint of attraction from Carlisle. Her name around campus is Ice Queen. He is unsure what his life will be, he has planned to go to medical school, but the death of his beloved sister from a brain tumor has derailed his plans and left him floundering. Carlisle finally shows up at a party at his home and the Ice Queen seems to be warming up to him. They agree to a one night stand, but that night was HOT, and Mateo wants to more. He learns more about her life, pain and the need for drugs. He is not going away.Suddenly a Doctor offers a possible miracle. Should she risk it, or live or die the way she is? I can't imagine a life living with chronic pain or the threat of sudden death. Carlisle is an amazing, strong, stubborn heroine. The more time Mateo spends with Carlisle, the more he learns more about what type of man he is. Some interaction with the characters from Redemption (Nashville Nights Book #1) adds a nice touch. This is a thought provoking novel with sizzle and romance.

"After the War  ( Homefront #2)  Jessica ScottMs. Scott writes military romance that grabs you heart, your emotions and wrings them out. After the War is no exception.Captain Sarah Anders is stationed at Fort Hood after a training accident left her injured and fired from her previous position. Saying it wasn't her fault never cuts it. She is a widow, her husband died in Iraq and a single Mom of five year old Anna. Sarah has given the army everything, her husband, her loyalty and very nearly her life. When does it get easier? Not with Major Wilson in charge.  Major Wilson ""ruled by fear and intimidation"" especially with other females. Instead of giving these women a hand up, she was pushing them away . ""Never in her life had Sarah imagined that being a parent and a soldier would be pulling her in completely different directions.""Lt. Sean Nichols has a history with Sarah, and when they are thrown together for an investigation their past together is brought to the forefront. Sean and Sarah were very young, in love and Sean wanted to get married, but in his eyes, Sarah had to leave the Army. She loved the Army and it was her career, Sarah wasn't giving it up. Two hearts are broken.  This time when they meet they are war weary, discouraged and both so changed.The case they are working on becomes more and more complicated, the only benefit is their spending more time together and talking. Sean has a secret that is eating him alive, he's afraid what will happen if he reveals it.To me, being a female in the Army is hard enough; losing your husband, caring for your child and doing your job makes it more difficult. To have superiors making it harder is just appalling to me.  The romance is hot and spicy, second chance love always seems sweeter.

"This is the third novel in the Ethan Frost series by Ms. Wolff. It is my favorite.Ethan and Chloe have finally worked through Ethan's anger and Chloe's fear. The one danger in their relationship is Brandon, Ethan's brother. We learned in the first two books in the series of his cruelty, her family's cruelty and even Ethan's responsibility for hurting Chloe. Chloe wants to put it away and start fresh, she begs Ethan to let it go for her sake........but he can't.Now that they are together again, Ethan has planned a quick getaway to Las Vegas to get married.  Chloe's best friend Tori has invited herself along and whisks Chloe off for a day of buying and spa treatments. Ethan's PI has reported more dirt about Brandon. He's hooked into the Vegas Mafia, he's a serious gambler, thus the need for mob money, and Chloe is not his only victim.  It's tearing Ethan apart to know his brother is now running for Congress with endorsements he set up before he learned the truth. Ethan is going to take him down.This novel is edgy, very sexy and romantic. Ethan has promised to not lie to Chloe anymore, and Chloe has promised to stop running away. These promises are hard to keep, especially when the unthinkable happens and brings Ethan to his knees. This series makes you think, the romance melts your heart while sparks are flying. I highly recommend these books , but they are best read in order.Pat Fordyce","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R386HHGV2SKITH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6V6AW6#wasThisHelpful","R386HHGV2SKITH","AYIPGMUURK82V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYIPGMUURK82V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Laura Florand writes very romantic love stories often set in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Paris. Her descriptions of the sights and sounds draw you in and make you feel you are there. This novel is no exception, but, you might want to read this close to a source of chocolate!Celie grew up in a small town called Les Tarterets, that is infamous for drug dealers, users and heartache. She worked in a pastry shop as a teen, and had a huge crush on her brothers friend Joss. He treated her like a little sister and protected her from the danger in the streets, and even her own brother, who was arrested for drug dealing. Then after walking her home after work, he said goodnight, and the next morning he was gone. Not just gone, he joined the French Foreign Legion. Now, five years later she is the Chef Chocolatier for Dom Richard in Paris. She has won many awards, and she feels liking working in the shop is like ""working in heaven.""

Waiting outside the shop.Josh regrets having to leave Celie five years ago, but she was only eighteen, he was a man, although a poor excuse for one as far as he was concerned. He went away, risked his life, became a hardened Legionnaire finished his commitment, and was done. He came back for Celie, hoping to prove he is worth her love now.  But Celie can't forget his leaving without a word, sent him cards for six months and he never wrote back. This relationship is not going to be easy, although they are widely attracted to each other. Stubbornness, lack of true communication and Celie's need for independence threaten both their hope and dreams.This is such a delightful story, and including Dom Richard and his fiancé Jamie Corey( The Chocolate Touch) makes it even more fun.

"Don’t expect any displays of deductive genius here. In fact, don’t expect to find any traditional mystery here at all. There’s no body in the library – no darts dipped in curare – no snakes sent coiling down bedposts to a victim’s jugular in the middle of the night.This is about the aging Sherlock Holmes’ attempts to remember why he quit being a private consultant. As his memory fails after WWII, he tries to reconstruct the last case he took just after WWI, and the reason he decided it would be his last case.Even though there are none of Holmes’ trademark observations here - this movie is well worth watching.

"This psychological thriller gets its suspense from a glance, a look. It doesn’t depend on approaching jump-scares to keep you on the edge of your seat – although there might be a few of those. Rather, most of the suspense comes from its characters’ unsettled looks. They sense something that is going to send their lives tilt. They know something intuitively that they can’t quite articulate, can't quite admit. Even the family dog’s prolonged, doleful look will send chills down your spine.The plot evolves in the direction of a classic tale of revenge. However, who is going to get revenge on whom – or who deserves to get revenge on whom – and the why and how of it – will keep you guessing.

"Ramsey Campbell seems as if he hasn’t sequestered himself in a room, writing all day. Rather, the keen metaphors he conjures here suggest that he’s the kind of writer who has garnered a wide experience of everyday life. It seems as if he walks around in an ordinary neighborhood, observing ordinary details, then comes home and does ordinary chores. He compares the whirling clothes in a laundry machine to “dervishes.” His windows “drooled” in the rain. He observes how a girl’s parents were waiting “on the lit stage of the porch.” The porch itself reminds him of a refrigerator as the light flicks on and off with the coming and going of the home’s inhabitants. Doors snap shut “like disapproving lips.” The shadow of the church spire “made the village square into a sun dial – 11:00 at Millie’s Woolens.”However, Campbell brings to this familiarity with the common bricks and mortar of life – a sense of the sinister that inhabits the homely. “The dark fireplaces looked ominous, prosceniums awaiting a cue.” “A roofless house stood like a rotten tooth.” “Gray clouds crawled grub-like across the sky.” The mass of clouds “had closed overhead like a coffin lid.” A person smiles “with a grin that looked pale as a crack in clay.” The faces of sheep resemble “munching skulls.’ As night falls, the lamps around the pond in the park “would have begun to dangle luminous tails in the water.” “But the silence wasn’t soothing. It was unnatural, the product of too many coincidences. It was the silence of a forest when a predator is near.”The stories in this book make great reading primarily because of these twists of detail that Campbell insinuates into his common world. The plots of the stories themselves though tend to be a little too murky and unresolved. Most of the horrors that threaten the stories’ characters are vaguely defined - crouching, encroaching, spreading. A crack on the ceiling will propagate like the threads of a spider’s web. A blotch on the wall will grow bigger. Something in a jar will become engorged and animate. Obscurity in horror stories is generally good. It’s only the half-seen that’s frightening. But in these stories, the menace tends to remain sometimes just a touch too oblique.Nevertheless, if you’re looking for good writing, eerie atmospherics, and an awakened sense of the sinister in everyday life – Campbell is here and everywhere the author for you.There are many collections of Campbell’s stories. The 21 stories included here are:Mackintosh Willy, Napier Court, Down There, Heading Home, The Proxy, The Depths, Out of Copyright, The Invocation, The Little Voice, Drawing In, The Pattern, The Show Goes On, The Puppets, Calling Card, Above the World, Baby, In the Bag, Conversion, The Chimney, Call First, The Companion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D7F3LS2U0P4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609286626#wasThisHelpful","R2D7F3LS2U0P4F","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although J. B. Priestley had already written a lot before this book was first published in 1929, it’s “The Good Companions” that really launched him into popularity and eventually led to his being considered “the Grand Old Man of English Letters.”This is about three separate people facing rather routine lives who decide to kick over the traces and hit the open road. Circumstances cause them to converge with the members of a troupe of pierrots (a group that considered themselves to be a “concert party” rather than the more common vaudeville troupe). This Dinky Doo group is flagging, but comes to be revitalized through the efforts of its three new associates, and they launch out anew as “The Good Companions.”Much of this book is a kinder, gentler Dickens. Priestley has the same genius for catching people’s theme, the small trench of philosophy that most people seems to settle into (“It’s the Government what done it!) - and outlines them vividly. He even has much of Dickens' way with aptly naming his characters. For example, we meet Mr. Mord here, the swollen, dyspeptic husband of a difficult landlady that the troupe encounters. But Priestley doesn’t reduce his characters to caricature.There are occasional references here that date the book. Be prepared to meet a few terms that would now be considered unacceptably racist in describing black people or Jewish people. Such jolts are very rare on these pages though. More often, you might be amazed at how modern-sounding some of the activity is. Both men and women casually drive cars everywhere. Then when Inigo meets a Doomsday group on the road, they point out how the recent increase in earthquakes, floods, and droughts, proves their contention that the “end is nigh.” (Priestley makes this yet another occasion for his wry humor as he has Inigo note that, despite their dire warnings, this band of Resurrectionists has put expensive new tires on their vehicle.)Priestley reportedly wrote very fast and rarely made revisions to his sentences. So it’s all the more surprising that he came up with so many bright metaphors. He describes a morning “as crisp as a nut,” an afternoon like “painted silk,” and a night full of “owl-haunted distances.” He captures a typical 1920’s Yorkshire scene as he likens a tram that’s slowly making its way over the dales to an ancient beast who stops here and there “to swallow a few morsels of humanity,” then lumbers off to unimaginable places. Priestley sees how the wind in one dreary place “rounded up all the odd pieces of paper in the streets & compelled them to join in a witches’ Sabbath.”There’s a fair amount of Yorkshire dialect represented here, but it’s surprisingly easy to read if you sound the syllables out in your head. The book is also a long one, something of a commitment. But it tells of people who yet had the capacity to be enchanted with each other. It carries you breezily down the road, like Mr. Toad in “Wind in the Willows” as he tooled along having adventures. Priestley occasionally breaks the “fourth wall” as they call it in the theater, when he himself steps forward to comment on the characters’ gentle, life-affirming journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBCSVZJEBYA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RJOMOO#wasThisHelpful","R2HBCSVZJEBYA4","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I take notes on the especially interesting thoughts I find in the books I read. I ended up with over 20 pages of notes from this book. This is a learned, perceptive series of essays on how and why so much of our modern culture has become a lax and dull place, devoid of enchantment.The first part of the book contains essays that revisit some of the classics of literature and art, showing how they shine a beacon on our modern predicament. Included here are some unusually interesting comments on “Macbeth,” as well as some on Shakespeare’s less often cited “Measure for Measure.” Dalyrmple also considers works by Turgenev, Stefan Zweig, artist Marie Cassatt, and cartoonist Gilroy.On the other hand, he tells why he considers some of the work of Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence, and all of Marx, to lead away from a philosophy of personal responsibility. He also puts many modern artists in that category of anti-humanism, with their technique of dabs and splashes “letting chance do all the work for them” rather than bothering to make their works a considered, skilled expression of human individuality.The later parts of the books draw from Dalrymple’s wide-ranging experience as a doctor in places such as the poorer sections of England and in Rhodesia-become-Zimbabwe. He’s a “Conservative” thinker whose literacy and intellect might yet appeal to those who consider themselves to be politically “Liberal.” It would be difficult for those anywhere on the political spectrum not to agree with at least some of the telling points he makes about the hypocrisy and posturing he sees inherent in a lot of political correctness.There are a few places where I feel he lapses into more prosaic conservatism, as when he opposes same-sex marriage or the legalization of any drug. He has some good reasons for his opposition, especially to the legalization of drugs. But he doesn’t justify the alarm he feels at these developments as well as he does with other modern trends. Also, it’s hard to fully credit the bleak picture of widespread dissolution and decadence he sees existing in England, France, and in cities such as Amsterdam, where many drugs are legal and where generous social allotments have made many people dependent on the government.His statistics about the consequent increase in crime might also be open to some question.  So many other social commentators maintain that total crime rates have likely remained pretty much constant over the span of recorded human history. It’s just that when individual crimes decrease, state-sponsored crimes (all the up to and including genocide), often increase. So people who say that at least the machinery of the Third Reich quelled street crime in the form of purse-snatching, etc., are overlooking the elephant of crime that was rampaging through the streets.However, when it comes to targeting the broad malaise of our age, Dalyrmple is generally cogent to the core. Just to give a brief taste of some of his pithy insights:”Turgenev saw men; Marx saw classes of men. People were like snowflakes in an avalanche to Marx; instances of a general force, conditioned by circumstance.”“Marx is filled with vehement rage, as if to cloak the synthetic nature of his feelings.” He “had a firm grip on unreality.”“The stance of being shocked by nothing is itself a convention now.”Our decent into vulgarity and irresponsibility has been gradual. “Rome wasn’t destroyed in a day.”“A sensation can’t strike twice in the same place. You have to go above & beyond your last presentation each time to create a sensation.”“All dictators hate even the independence of nature. They can’t tolerate the slightest insubordination.” (So their governments are almost always characterized by gigantization, by creating the monumental - making spontaneity impossible.)“For the intellectual elite, words are meant, not to convey truth, but to distinguish one from the herd.”Now “Adolescents are precociously adult; adults are permanently adolescent.”“But if we cannot censor, we can censure.”This book gives the support and perspective to stand against the tide of cheapness, vulgarity, and cruelty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4JQADS8IUPV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=156663721X#wasThisHelpful","R4JQADS8IUPV2","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terrorizing and tracking people via the computer plays a significant role in the plot of this book. Since “Goodnight” was written in 1996, you have to cast yourself back a bit, to the state of computer technology then, to get in the spirit of the pursuit. Some of the references might seem creaky and antique to people who keep up on the advance of computers. You’ll find floppy discs and bulletin board postings here. The programmers “looked like workers tending a giant buzzing termite queen, down there in the basement.”But many of the techniques remain relevant, at least in principle. For example, both stalker and police make frequent use of proxy servers and APS (anonymous posting services) to misleadingly direct emails.However, you can still enjoy this psychological thriller even if you skip over the computer talk. The story at heart is about a woman who starts to receive messages on her computer screen from her murdered daughter. Who is this killer who’s adding torment to torment?My only objection to the author’s approach here is that she once again uses what has become the convention of ubiquitous hostility. Co-workers are hostile to each other; members of the police force are hostile to each other. A kind of low-level, pointless antagonism seems to form the main connection between people.But the writing here is generally perceptive and literate. Murphy paints a telling picture of what it’s like to live with an abusive husband, and she has a good descriptive command throughout. One character is described as being, not clever, but cunning. A house is described as having “the fossilized hush of habit.”The suspense mounts as killer and victim spiral towards a conclusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6ESJBDJ7C58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0333669487#wasThisHelpful","R1B6ESJBDJ7C58","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I read this book, I tended to think it was a good thing we continue to aggressively pursue war criminals until the ends of their lives. After reading this, while I still would like to prosecute such individuals in principle, I can see how prejudice and politics make such prosecutions, certainly in the case of World War II war criminals, almost impossible as a practical matter.You’ll learn a lot from this book besides the legal maneuvering that was involved in prosecuting Ivan Demjanyuk after he was accused of having been “Ivan the Terrible,” the sadistic guard of the Treblinka concentration camp. You’ll learn about the pitfalls of a system that doesn’t include trial-by-jury, but in which all cases are decided only by a panel of judges. You’ll find a graphic example of the many ways the truth can get distorted and buried during the ultra-adversarial process of prosecution vs. defense, and during the resultant clash of personalities between all the parties involved. You’ll learn how sustained grievance and prejudice can cloud judgment and even lead to mob action.More generally, you’ll learn a lot of telling details about the dynamics of the late-War and-post-War period in Europe, particularly about the politics of repatriation. Who went where after WW!!? How did so many higher-ups such as Mengele escape? What was the jockeying that took place among lesser functionaries to avoid going back into Russian territory and to establish revised identities? Why was the Russian KGB so intent on forging documents pertaining to so many of these individuals?My only complaint about the book is that it tends to be too much about the author, who was Demjanyuk’s Israeli defense attorney. Sheftel doesn’t come across as a very likeable person. He proudly tells how he impressed the U.S. defense attorney who arrived in Israel by driving up in his new Porsche. Similarly, Sheftel tends to judge others by the cars they drive and by initial appearances. This tendency might give the reader pause about the quality of his perceptions and reporting overall. Certainly the resultant falling-out he had with U.S. attorney O’Connor, which is so much of what the early part of this book is about, demonstrates how using such shallow means of appraisal can derail a project.Then Sheftel narrates how he gave up his “carefully guarded” bachelorhood to a long-time helpmate who stood by him during his medical crisis and who then told him, after he’d made a summary presentation in Court, that “It was simply amazing to see the power of your appearance.” He tells of the instances in which he feels humiliated by the judges and by others in the case, and of reverse instances when he purposefully does the nettling and humiliating. Also, Sheftel doesn’t seem to consider how his historic antagonism with one of the judges scheduled to preside over the case might have worked against Demjanyuk from the start and made Sheftel a poor choice of attorneys for the man.He doesn’t meet with Demjanyuk until he’s well into preparing his defense. Sheftel does give a thumbnail sketch of his client, but he doesn’t seem to consider it important to really get to know the man. So the book is a frustrating blank when it comes to acquainting readers with Demjanyuk’s personality. Nevertheless, you get a fascinating panorama of information in the course of learning about Demjanyuk’s particular case.I suggest you read this book in tandem with one of Helen Loftus’ books on the problems of eye-witness identification – a book such as “Witness for the Defense.” Loftus ended up not actually testifying here. But since so much of the case against Demjanyuk centered around survivors’ identification of him from photo arrays that included a suspect picture of him as a trainee at a camp for concentration camp guards – Loftus’ research into the proper protocol for witness identification could be of key value in helping you form your own opinions about these proceedings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCN2S4IXQOFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0895264587#wasThisHelpful","R2SCN2S4IXQOFG","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie is a pretentious mish-mash. It pertains to the story of the Amanda Knox trial in Italy, but names have been changed - I'm not sure why. The core of the action here is supposed to be a photojournalist's endeavor to bring a different angle to the proceedings. So many people have commented on how the accused Knox deceptively has ""the face of an angel."" The photojournalist however thinks perhaps that appellation might be better applied to the murder victim herself - or perhaps to the bartending woman who acts as his guide and muse through the streets of Sienna, the Italian town where this transposed version of the murder takes place.In the course of these ruminations, the photojournalist tries to draw a parallel with Dante and his beloved Beatrice. There doesn't seem to be any basis at all for making such an analogy, other than to drag in some literary reference by the ears.Everyone talks very fast. Some dream sequences are interjected to add to the confusion. The result is a real pointless mess of a movie. I would give it only one star, except some lovely photography of the Tuscan region of Italy redeems the film a little.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AXZ3YQWK2QL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZMDA14#wasThisHelpful","R1AXZ3YQWK2QL8","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just have a basic textbook knowledge of ohms and oh-ohs. I was able to follow along in this book for about the first 75 pages describing tools and precautions. But then I found myself in deep waters when Geier got into the details of using an oscilloscope and I came upon passages such as:“In a non-complementary design, the amplifier has to be biased to set its output halfway between ground and the power supply voltage when no signal is applied…”However, Geier tries to take as avuncular, helpful a tone as possible. He interjects memorably humorous advice such as “they don’t call metal connect points “terminals” for nothing.” He also gives advice on what brands to buy and where to buy some parts and products at discount prices.There were a few points in this generally sound book that I felt were misleading or insufficient. For example, early on, Geier says that electricity has always been considered running off the negative terminal of a battery. He says that’s been the conventional usage since the days of Ben Franklin. Well, that’s not quite true. Actually, until the mid-1950’s, electricity was generally taken to be running from the positive post of a battery.I have several reasons for wishing Geier had addressed this re-orientation. What little electrical troubleshooting I’ve done has often involved work on antique cars, most of which operated with a POSITIVE ground (the opposite of almost all modern cars). In all my probings in this regard, I remained largely in the dark because I have yet to come across a really lucid explanation of the implications of this difference. Various guides point out that older cars rusted faster because of their positive ground. Why would that be? The old cars would basically function even if you hooked them up the wrong way, but you would almost certainly blow their radios, lights, and turn signals.It’s true that an account of these effects would be more in the realm of electricity than electronics. But I think an explanation in the lucid style Geier is capable of, would have been really helpful in grounding (pardon the pun) readers, especially beginners in the field, in some essential points about the ways of electricity in general.Then Geier made a basic omission when he failed to tell readers how to check the viability of batteries. That’s almost always the first thing a beginner tries to check with a DMM. Geier devotes a chapter to the functions performed by various circuit components such as capacitors and transistors, and he tells how to go about checking for breaches in each of these.First of all, it might have been helpful if he had put this chapter BEFORE the very challenging one on how to operate an oscilloscope. Most important though, he ought to have included the basic information that batteries need to be tested under load in order to get reliable readings. I have met even some presumably practiced electricians who weren’t aware of this point.The section devoted to tackling the repair of specific items is very brief. There are only a couple of pages devoted to diagnosing computers. This might seem to contradict the title and premise of this whole book. But Geier has scattered some information on diagnostics throughout other chapters, such as that chapter on what individual components do and how to tell if they have gone bad.These little kvetches aside – this book can be a solid help, if you already have some understanding of electrical workings and terminology. In order to gain that understanding, there are a few preliminary readings I can heartily recommend, some of which are older or less obvious books – but helpful nonetheless. These include:“There Are No Electrons” by Amdahl - (Looks at electrons as party animals, and in so doing, memorably impresses beginners and professionals alike with an understanding of why electricity takes the paths it does.)“Electricity and Electronics Basic” Third Edition, by Steinberg/Ford – (An old book, but one of the best basics I’ve ever found.)“Electricity and Electronics,” the textbook, not the lab book, by Gerrish, Dugger, Roberts.“Understanding Solid-State Electronics,” the Texas Instruments Understanding Series from its Learning Center. - (This really makes it clear what’s happening inside diodes, transistors, MOSFETs, and the like.)“Automotive Electricity and Electronics” by Santini - (In telling exactly where you put probes to analyze a car’s circuity, you are able to extrapolate to all kinds of circuits.)“How to Keep Your VCR Alive” by Steve Thomas – (Again, an older book that might seem an odd choice. But it really tells how to open up the compartments of a device, how to look at how wheels and cams interlock, and how to get past them into the electrical components – information that can give you a feel for prying and unscrewing panels that can be extrapolated to more modern devices.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QX4H57BD666T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071848290#wasThisHelpful","R1QX4H57BD666T","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film seems to have started life as a Canadian made-for-TV movie with the title “The Husband She Met Online.” It has the low-budget, interior-setting feel of a soap opera. The pared-down pacing and rhythm of conversation also brands the film with a kind of soap opera quality.But that’s not a bad thing in this era of too many over-the-top special effects extravaganzas. What was a little more difficult for me to overcome before I could get involved with this film, was the casting of the lead actor. I initially kept thinking of Jason Gray-Stanford as the bumbling, too-eager-to-please side-kick detective in TV’s “Monk” series. However, once I got beyond stereotyping the actor that way, I could appreciate how he had morphed into a properly menacing presence for this role.There is nothing too memorable here, but the movie dramatizes what seems to be a common and perhaps growing problem in society – the problem of the controlling boyfriend/husband. While the character is this movie carries his need for control into shocking extremes, his early warning tendencies in that direction are not all that different from what myriad women are reporting in the media and to police.It might be possible to draw an important lesson from this film. If someone seems too good to be true – he probably is. So this likely wouldn't be a good choice for viewing with someone on a first date. It's bound to give a prospective partner pause.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5BINMRS6R7V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113SSHW0#wasThisHelpful","R5BINMRS6R7V5","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went from getting almost no channels with my indoor rabbit ears - to getting 57-60 clear broadcast channels with this outdoor unit. It is a great value. It’s hard to believe a person can get this much complex technology for so little money.The unit was also easy to install. For a pole (not provided in this kit), I used a length of plumbing pipe embedded in a bucket of cement.The remote control is working from a distance of about 70-feet for me, although I find I don’t need to use it much. Most of the stations in my area transmit from towers banked in one direction. Once I oriented the antenna for maximum reception, I’ve been pretty much able to leave it in place. But the remote does swivel the antenna this way and that responsively.The antenna beams a red light to show when the power box inside is on. So you can stand outside and see if anyone is inside your house watching TV.There are a few things to consider in connection with my 5-star review though. I live in Chicago and am only about 9 miles from the transmission towers downtown. So I can’t really speak to how much range this antenna has.Also, I had read in other reviews here that some buyers had doubts about the coaxial cable that comes with the unit. I happened to have 60-feet of sturdier coaxial cable handy, so I immediately used my own cable. Therefore, I can’t say how well the provided cable would have worked.But this was a good buy that has really worked for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15N1OKDKRIF4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJXXOAE#wasThisHelpful","R15N1OKDKRIF4B","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw one of these wiggling, waving flowers on my bank teller’s counter. Its gyrations made me laugh. So for once, someone laughed IN the bank, rather than all the way TO the bank. I bought a set of these so I could also laugh at home.Three of the four flowers I bought danced immediately as I took them out of their cellophane packages. One of the flowers had to be gently secured in its track a little more firmly before it would animate a bit. (It’s never been as lively as the others, but 3 out of 4 strong dancers is not a bad success ratio at this price.) Be careful if you feel you need to do this. The flower stems are very fragile.These flowers do best in a window with good sun exposure, although they will also dance in a very bright room, especially if they are put under a goose-neck lamp. Either an incandescent bulb or one of the new energy-saving fluorescent bulbs will do the job in this case.There are a couple of things to be aware of when you buy any of these solar dancing ornaments. Most of these brands and sizes of trinkets do not store energy in the way larger outdoor solar lights do. With these, as soon as a sufficiently bright light source is removed, they stop dancing.Also most of these ornaments do not have any on/off buttons. When I took that one laggard flower out of its package, I wasted quite a bit of time looking for a button that I thought might be stuck in the “Off” position. But no – there are no such buttons on these flowers. Their cellophane wrap restrains them until you open the blister pack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24UO77HJ3QVDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LVLYMG#wasThisHelpful","R24UO77HJ3QVDN","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good, absorbing account of the ultimately inexplicable murder of two children. It has more than a little suspense along the way, as for example when the author points out the possible “chilling” irony involved in the searchers’ pause in front of the family refrigerator.The book is co-authored by the man who became the chief prosecutor in the case. So there is necessarily a bit of awkwardness in the juggling of pronouns and referents, especially in the later chapters, when the case is taken to court. Don Weber narrates events from his point of view, but refers to himself in the third person. He alternately becomes “the prosecutor,” “Don,” and “Weber.” I don’t know if simply saying ”I” would have been an easier, more direct approach. But perhaps then the chronicle would have lacked the authoritative tone that its objective, reportorial style in fact gives to it.Since this account is written by a lawyer, it is naturally heavier on court room maneuvering than it is on psychological insights. But probably the latter would have been hard to come by, even in the hands of a psychologist. Paula Sims seems to have remained enigmatic and inarticulate about her motives. So instead of a look inside a killer’s mind, readers are given more of a legal procedural, at least once the suspect(s) are taken into custody.This approach has a fascination of its own. It’s like auditing a good class in criminal prosecution. You’ll learn phrases such as “writ of mandamus” and the legal meaning of “per se.” If you don’t get inside Paula Sims’ head so much, you do get inside the head of a good prosecutor as he prepares his case. Mostly, Don Weber provides a solid role model in this regard. However, there are a few instances in which his judgment about how to present a point to a jury ends in slightly humorous, off-kilter results.For example, he tells how in preparing a summary, he wanted to make sneering reference to Sims’ protestations that her babies were taken by one or more masked intruders. Weber initially thought that in order to underscore the patently fictive nature of any such invader, he’d call him “the bogeyman.” But then Weber had second thoughts. He felt that the term “bogeyman” might have a negative, personal connotation for any African-American jurors on the panel. So Weber instead used the character of “Rumpelstiltskin.”I’m not sure that reference was apt. That odd name from Grimm’s Fairy Tales has surely stuck in many people’s minds. But it’s unlikely that most people recall who Rumpelstiltskin was – whether he was hero or villain. If they do recall the story more exactly, they would know that Rumpelstiltskin did NOT steal children. He was NOT an improbable kidnapper. His bargaining with the miller’s daughter much more complicated than that.Weber also chooses to accept as a key element of his case the rather dubious testimony of one doctor regarding the effect of a head injury on a person’s memory. As Weber himself later admits, his doctor’s conclusions would tend to be contradicted by the experience of many prizefighters.Another slight problem with this book is a problem that it has in common with most true crime accounts. There are so many detectives, superintendents, sheriffs, lawyers, and others, involved in the investigation, that in places, these pages become like a telephone directory. In real life, crime investigation hardly ever seems to have the coherence of a Columbo story, with one brilliant mind pursuing the investigation through all its phases. So most true crimes books such as these could use an initial rundown of names, with thumbnail reminders of their roles attached - or at least an inclusive index. This book (or at least this paperback edition) has neither.Despite these few drawbacks, this book is a good insider’s account of a strange crime and its resultant punishment. It’s worth a place on any true crime buff’s shelves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLAXLWNG703JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0863695981#wasThisHelpful","RLAXLWNG703JO","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-researched account of a strange, seemingly unmotivated 1969 murder at Penn State. Author DeKok puts the reader back in that time and place by including reminders of the campus revolts prevalent then, the Viet Nam War protests, the manners and mores of a generation seeking liberation from all sorts of old restrictions and prejudices.It’s interesting to be recalled to a time when the victim had a strict curfew at the more conservative Michigan College where she did her undergraduate work. In spite of this guarded atmosphere, the Co-Ed Murders rocked that academic community in the 60’s, as briefly recounted by DeKok. (For a fuller account, see ""The Michigan Murders"" by Keyes) It’s a ghastly irony that part of the reason Betsy Aardsma moved to Pennsylvania for her graduate work was to get away from the killing fields that Ann Arbor had become in the 60’s due to the depredations of that serial killer.In the course of recounting Betsy’s earlier years, the author also provides a fascinating history of some of southwestern Michigan, especially towns such as Holland. I live not far from there, but had never realized the place’s rich ethnic, religious history.The only reason I give this book 4-stars instead of 5 is because of the absolute certitude with which DeKok names Betsy’s killer. Well yes, his candidate is indeed a likely suspect, but I don’t feel quite certain enough to consider the case closed. I have read enough true crime accounts to know how often the presence of a murder victim draws awareness to a veritable host of sociopaths and psychopaths who had been surrounding that individual. A case in point is the Peggy Hettrick murder. (See ""Drawn to Injustice."")It seems that, on a somewhat lesser scale, this could be the same situation in this case too. Quite a few people with aberrations emerge from the shadows and are seen to have been circling in Betsy’s life. Some of these other suspects who were considered by police and whom you can read about here include:Betsy’s boyfriend, a pre-med student who really did NOT want to go through with marrying her, but whose alibi seemed air-tight;A man whom Betsy briefly dated, who carried a knife, who was in the library stacks at the time of the murder, and who was only eliminated as a suspect because he passed a polygraph test, a test which we now know can produce misleading results;An associate professor with whom Betsy might have had some contact, who philosophically modeled himself after Dostoevsky's killers-with-impunity as they were written about in “Crime and Punishment” and “Notes from the Underground – a man who shortly thereafter fell into depression and possibly committed suicide by crashing his car;An ostensibly homeless man who’d been sleeping in the stacks at the time of the murder and who wandered off without having had his presence reported until days later;A rapist who’d been terrorizing women in the nearby Mall;Betsy’s classmate who discovered the body and who had a very odd reaction to this discovery, going into convulsions at the sight, when at first it only looked as if Betsy had fainted there in the stacks.Then there are several other individuals who were never fully considered by police but who might creep off these pages as likely suspects in readers’ eyes - individuals such as:The prime suspect’s adviser, who seemed to have something of his own to hide in that he didn’t push forward a report of the suspect’s revelations on the night of the murder until years later;A relative of Betsy’s who went into over-the-top, life-long grief at her death, even though he was not a member of her immediate family;And finally, someone else – an unidentified person whose possible presence in the stacks by Betsy is suggested by an odd detail that neither the police nor author DeKok noted until I sent an email. To consider this clue yourself, see Page 55 of the 2014 paperback edition - the paragraph mentioning the scattering of books found around Betsy’s body.In short, this is an excellent summary of the case and the trajectory of the likeliest suspect. But it leaves latitude for you, the reader, to be an armchair detective, and to perhaps see things that have been overlooked through the decades.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15LMLDSERXSLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762780878#wasThisHelpful","R15LMLDSERXSLN","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was motivated to buy this book after I watched the “American Masters” series entry featuring tennis star Billie Jean King. King is a champion whose achievements deserve to be recognized. However, I was disturbed by the documentary’s suggestion that King put women’s tennis on the map. I had gotten the impression from my parents’ involvement with the sport in the 1920’s, that a previous generation of women had fought for, and largely achieved, equality for women in tennis.I bought this book to see if that was true. Engelmann confirms here that not only did the female stars of the 1920’s put women’s tennis on an equal footing with men’s – their competitions by far surpassed the men’s as box office draws and as sheer sensation. That these women have been so largely forgotten, and that most current documentaries fail to credit them or even make passing mention of them, is one of the oddest mysteries of the sports’ world.Engelmann concentrates on recounting the exploits of French/European star Suzanne Lenglen (pronounced like a nasalized long-glen) and her arch rival, Californian Helen Wills. He tells how these women fought their way to preeminence, thrilling crowds of admirers with their power and grace. One of the rare modern commentators familiar with those stars has said that Lenglen was the Michael Jordan of that era, making seemingly impossible jumps and pirouettes across the court, at times, almost giving the impression of levitating.The face-off between Lenglen and Wills attracted more attention in its day than the King/Riggs competition did in 1973. While the King/Riggs tournament was merely a “Battle of the Sexes” – the game between Lenglen and Wills became “The Battle of the Nations,” or, even more dramatically, “The War of the Worlds.” It was viewed as pitting Old World traditionalism against the innovative vibrancy of America. People who had villas anywhere within eye-shot of the tennis court in the south of France where the game between the two women took place, often removed the entire tile roofs of their homes so that spill-over spectators could pop up their heads between the beams, like gophers, to catch a glimpse of the action. Other people climbed surrounding palm trees and resisted all the efforts of gendarmes to bring them down with grappling hooks. The outcome of the match made front page headlines around the world.So this book makes it clear that before King and before the Williams sisters, there were dazzling female tennis stars who broke barriers. Engelmann also tells about Ora Washington, who broke the race barrier, becoming the “black Helen Wills.” He tells how many of these women routinely practiced with and played against top-ranking men in preliminary matches leading up to the final Forest Hills, Wimbledon, and Olympic matches. (Tennis was dropped as an Olympic sport in the late 20’s because of controversy surrounding amateur versus professional status, and was only reinstated decades later.) Women tended to win at least half of these matches with men, making the novelty attributed to the King/Riggs match another example of our national amnesia.In a larger sense, Engelmann demonstrates in this book how the female tennis stars of the 20's became trailblazers and trend-setters. They made it fashionable for all women to be toned, tanned, and athletic. They brought women out of the pallor of Victorian parlors.This book can be a little boring if you aren’t a real tennis enthusiast. A large part of it consists of point-by-point accounts of various key matches. I wished Engelmann would have included an introductory chapter for novices such as myself, telling more about how the game is scored and including a glossary. (What's the difference between a lob and a slam?) I also would have liked somewhat more time spent on the women’s personal histories. I don’t mean any tabloid low-down on their romances, but something to bring them off the page as more than just point-scoring machines.However, I’m still giving this book 5-stars because it provides such an amazing and well-researched corrective to the amnesia we are suffering when it comes to women’s athletic achievements. Almost everyone is familiar with the male athletes of the early part of the 20th century – with the likes of Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey. Our modern disregard of women who generated as much hero(ine) worship in their day as Ruth – makes it clear that each new generation of women might have to be prepared to renew the fight for equality. This book does a good job of bringing earlier female athletes out of the eclipse into which they so undeservedly have fallen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2150O854QJKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195043634#wasThisHelpful","R2150O854QJKN","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an intelligent, brilliantly acted true story of the meetings of two men - one a journalist, the other an imprisoned murderer. Each, in his own way, is shown seeking redemption and exoneration by using the other. Journalist Finkel hopes that by getting the scoop on the murderer’s life and thoughts, he can get his writing career back on track. Murderer Longo hopes that by talking to the journalist, he can get his deeds slanted and projected with a different spin, so that his lies will be believed and so that he’s projected in a sympathetic, exculpating light.The suspense in the movie often comes from the very smallest gestures and details. There’s that habit Longo is represented as having – the habit of ever so slightly cricking his neck when a particularly malignant thought is passing through his mind. One can see that habit becoming chillingly infectious. Then there are details such as the soiled leg of a teddy bear protruding from a satchel.This movie has inspired me to order Finkel’s book on the subject, to learn more about the people involved, and to learn more fully about their circling of ambition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMEWBZVMLEMPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTSKEMS#wasThisHelpful","RMEWBZVMLEMPC","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main movie on this DVD is good enough. Its plot and philosophy are predictable. But the acting is engrossing. The photography sets an eerie tone, keeping things indistinct and fleeting enough to be frightening. Some of the actors are photographed from behind as they jostle along the path from the main house to the removed guest house where their strange fate awaits them. That technique was used to good effect in the movie “The Black Swan.” Here too, that kind of trailing view is arresting. It turns us, the viewers, into the stalkers, coming up from behind for a surprise attack.The producers of this film made the most of their low-budget independence. I didn’t miss the special effects or expensive production values.However, though the movie itself is worth watching, I found the bonus extras to be the real reason for getting this disc. The director/actor commentary is average. But there are two long trailers (over 20 minutes each) of other films Senese made starring Jeremy Childs. These films are not readily available, but the samplings of them presented here are almost enough to constitute satisfying one-act plays in and of themselves, even if we never get to view the full movies.Jeremy Childs shows amazing versatility as he stars in the trailer for “The Intruder.” The full-length version of this film promises to challenge us to consider who might be the real intruder on the scene. There’s a wounded war veteran who perhaps can get out of his wheelchair after all. There’s the wife who has been so bold as to report the strange noises coming from her neighbor’s apartment. There is the neighbor himself, played by an ominously transformed Childs, who might be trying to break into the woman’s house in retaliation – or who might be trying to break out of the predatory clutches of the woman and/or her wounded husband. Inside/outside, insider/outsider flip - with frightening effect. If this isn’t in fact the theme of the full movie – it should be.But the true gem here is the trailer for Senese’s film called “Suicide Tapes.” Even just this partial view breaks new ground in surreal suspense. Childs is transformed again as a psychiatric patient who might have attempted suicide. The action consists of only the claustrophobic dialogue between him and his psychiatrist. I promise you will uneasily watch for something strange to appear in the mirror in which the two are reflected in their verbal danse macabre. But then comes a real shocker…There’s a lot to this disc. If the main film doesn’t get you – the trailers will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM40AZPRBB4BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XPYPXC#wasThisHelpful","RM40AZPRBB4BT","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first, I was a little dubious about the usefulness of these sheets. They seemed large and unwieldy for the original use I wanted to put them to - which was to clean the lenses on my camera and my microscope. I didn't need a 15-inch x 17-inch sheet to clean such small areas.However, then I realized I could use these sheets for other than the small ""delicate"" purposes mentioned on their dispenser box. I started to use them to clean fingerprint smudges off my rented DVDs and off my vinyl record collection. They do a good job ridding these surfaces of any oily residue without scratching. They are also good for cleaning eyeglasses, and come in handy since most opticians have stopped handing out complimentary cleaning tissues.

"These pads do seem to stay bacteria-free and stain-free, and they do a good job making plates and glassware sparkling clean. However, they have a few limitations that have caused me to subtract a star from their rating.The instructions accompanying these pads say not to put the pads in a microwave, and not to use them on stainless steel pans. I would be wary about using the pads on the non-stick surfaces of any pots and pans. They have a tendency to scratch if used somewhat vigorously.So taking these provisos into account, it might ultimately be more economical to buy the regular, less expensive Scotch scrub pads.

"The actors in this film absorb the viewer into their terse, tense face-offs. Some decades ago, popular British author V. C. Clinton-Baddeley wrote a mystery story entitled “To Study a Long Silence.” That title refers to a technique that acting students learn in order to hold an audience’s attention. But it can be used to summarize how the characters in this movie approach each other. Despite the close physical contact that their wrestling jousts entail, they still essentially keep each other at a distance with the long breaches of silence between them.The tension in the film comes from the enmity and imbalance that creeps into these caesuras. The caesuras become gaps - and then chasms.But we never really get to know what might have caused this estrangement between the real-life millionaire du Pont and his protégé Mark Schultz, whom these movie characters are roughly meant to represent.  Well, perhaps in the case of du Pont, there can be no satisfactory explanation for his ultimately shocking action - other than pure craziness.  But I was left wanting to know more about the transformation that overtook wrestling champion Mark Schultz. What caused his disaffection, which seems to come on suddenly? What changed him from viewing du Pont as his sponsor, mentor, friend – into viewing him as a stymieing foe? There is one scene that suggests the turning point, but it provides an insufficient answer.So we’re left with no real reason for having watched this film other than to have experienced an engrossing but finally frustrating involvement in profoundly inarticulate lives. Rather than getting a hammerlock on the people and their personalities, we’re left with at best a half-Nelson grasp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25N55ULVUQ6GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QK4ANNY#wasThisHelpful","R25N55ULVUQ6GR","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee starts out as you might expect here, explaining the process of DNA analysis as it existed in 2003 when this book was written. Some of his account resembles an alphabet soup, with RFLP, SNPs, VNTRs, etc., all mixed a little confusingly into the broth. All these letters refer to different parts and lengths of the genome that can be analyzed in order to arrive at a statistical assessment of the likelihood that X done it.Elsewhere, I had read that RFLPs for example (restriction fragment length polymorphisms), simply refer to sequences of DNA bases that repeat a different number of times in different individuals. Scientists zero in on these repeating sequences of GATC bases that are found in what was termed the “junk” DNA between actual genes. Some people might have three repeats of a sequence at a site: AGAGAG. Some might have four repeats: AGAGAGAG. Five percent of a given population might have 3 such repeats at a given site: 20% might have ten repeats, etc. Scientists look at a number of these sites (or loci). They then multiply the odds of there being a certain number of repeats at locus A by the odds of there being a certain number of repeats of another sequence at locus B, etc., and thereby arrive at the usually rather slim chance of anyone other than a given suspect having that profile of repeats.Nowhere in this book does Lee ever explain the process of this kind of DNA analysis as simply as I’ve summarized above. You’ll have to work a little to make it all clear. But if you persevere – if you keep reading and take some notes – you’ll probably come away with a fairly complete picture of how DNA analysis works. If you are an aspiring mystery story writer, a lawyer, or just an interested reader, having this book will probably obviate the need of plowing through any expensive, technical textbook on the subject. You’ll get most of what you need to know here.Lee also sprinkles these chapters with thumbnail sketches of the cases of suspects who’ve been convicted and suspects who’ve been exonerated by DNA. Meanwhile, you’ll learn how complicated the process of DNA analysis actually is – how many steps are involved, opening the door to the possibility of cross-contamination and delay. You’ll come to understand how, at least until the recent past, DNA analysis took a lot of time and couldn’t be accomplished in the span of a half-hour TV show.But then in these densely packed pages, you’ll go beyond the boundaries of DNA analyses and get what is essentially several other whole different books. If you don’t mind digressions from anything strictly pertaining to DNA, you’ll find extended sections about:1. The Holocaust. In connection with determining if a certain set of buried remains were in fact those of Josef Mengele, the author goes into some detail recounting Mengele’s biography, and the motive and means behind his ghastly experiments, with twins and others, at Auschwitz. This includes a general look at conditions inside Auschwitz.2. The O. J Simpson Murder Case. The author here gives one of the clearest timelines I’ve read, recounting which detectives arrived on the scene, when they arrived, what evidence they found, where they transported it, and whether or not there could in fact have been any breaks in the chain of custody.3. Tabloid History. This is a clever term Lee coins as he recounts the results of a number of DNA analyses that have been aimed at revealing intimate secrets about historical figures. You might be surprised to learn here that, contrary to what you might have read elsewhere, President Jefferson probably did not father any children with slave Sally Hemmings. You’ll learn the results of other titillating disinterments.  Many of these researches have incidentally revealed whether or not certain notable figures had diseases such as syphilis. This gives Lee a chance to once again interject some of the sly humor that is scattered through these pages. He tells about attempts to confirm whether some tissue remains were in fact those of the Dauphin, son of Marie Antoinette. Lee winks that incidentally, the analysis can be expected to reveal whether or not the little boy had syphilis.There is also considerable information about non-human DNA and the developing science that distinguishes different strains of anthrax and the different strains of all sorts of bacterial/viral infections.All-in-all, these pages are jam-packed full of interesting information that’s fairly well presented. However, the lead summary of this book is misleading. You won’t find anything here about either Chandra Levy or Albert de Salvo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6J83IQ11T4NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738206024#wasThisHelpful","R6J83IQ11T4NA","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a treasure trove of tidbits about how the development of the laws of probabilities have, or should have, informed the way we lead our daily lives.In the first part of the book, the author tackles such puzzlers of probability as the Monty Hall Dilemma and the chance of having at least one girl if you have two children. In some ways, the counter-intuitive answers to these questions have been better explained by any number of other authors such as Marilyn vos Savant in her collection of articles entitled “The Power of Logical Thinking.”But there’s still a great deal of new, arresting information here, including a lot of the history of mathematics. It’s fascinating to be reminded how the ancient Greeks pursued truth without a consistent way of representing numbers – without a decimal system, without the concept of zero. It’s also interesting to learn how the laws of chance were eventually developed, not as a purely scientific endeavor, but more often by gamblers interested in finding winning strategies.You might encounter a few little stumbling blocks along the way. There’s a bit of sexism, as when the author uses Oprah’s fluctuating weight to demonstrate the principle of “sample space.” Then, since the author is British, he might occasionally be using terms in somewhat different ways than you’d find in a typical American classroom. For example, he doesn’t make clear the same distinction between the “average” and the “mean” that I learned in school.However, this book really swings into delivering useful information in its last third. It helps rationalize the seeming portents and patterns behind Ouija boards, séances, and a host of what many persist in interpreting as “signs.” You’ll garner sound advice on topics such as the efficacy of hiring a financial manager with a winning track record. You’ll learn whether or not you get your money’s worth by buying the most expensive vodka and wine – whether or not you need to be wary of moving into an area that has been labeled as having a “cancer cluster” – whether you should judge team coaches or corporate executives (or anyone) by the last four or five years of results that their institutions realized during their leadership.All-in-all, this book is fun, informative, and provides valuable tips on how to rationally judge whether or not the odds are really in your favor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QSB4DL08P1QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307275175#wasThisHelpful","R1QSB4DL08P1QZ","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some of this book reads like an old time radio mystery drama. But here the lead character isn't a private eye. He's a Chicago-area newspaper reporter, waltzing through the twilight of the age of newsprint, knowing that his days on the job are likely numbered. What's more, the murders in this story aren't the relatively quick, bloodless affairs of old-time radio. Here the reporter is on the trail of a savage serial killer.But the dialogue has some of the lean, detached tone of the old-time private eye. After he's been knifed and beaten, reporter Alex Chapa wryly remarks that yeah, ""I feel like a million bucks - give or take a million.""The old-time sexism is here too. There's a kind of Velma-counterpart in the story, a woman who presses close to Chapa, making him feel her warmth through her form-fitting top. However, she's doing it, not out of love, but with an agenda of her own. Meanwhile, Chapa has a girlfriend back home, whose only role is to worry over him and to be there, as long as Chapa doesn't abuse the relationship too much by entangling himself in deadly danger. We read that this girlfriend smiled, ""and in the glow of a night-light, Chapa saw a look of surrender and unguarded passion in her eyes…"" These are the kind of women who were confined to the black-bordered panels of a comic book strip back in the 40's.But this book ultimately has more sensitivity than a standard Mickey Spillane. I usually like the cozies, the more literary English who-dunits. Nevertheless, this more action-oriented book kept me reading. Its 100 short, footprint chapters paced me quickly on the heels of the killer. Then it has at least a couple of really chilling, memorable scenes wrought by that psychopath.I got this book out of the remainder pile at a dollar store. Even though it has too many suspects too poorly delineated, it deserves a better fate. It's as good as many of the more critically acclaimed mystery stories out there, without having the miring pretensions often found in those books. Plus, you get some good Chicago-area backdrops.

"The title of my review (borrowed from a bonus feature interview on the disc) - in fact sums up the action in this movie brilliantly. The monster starts as something definitely apart - something that might creep out of a closet, or rap under the floorboards. But then its spirit seems to inhabit the mother and turn her into the beast itself.This movie becomes a tour de force performance illustrating a descent into madness. In that respect, it might remind viewers of such cult classics as Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion."" But is that what this movie is really about? Or is there perhaps a real monster who haunts the premises?The people who produced this movie don't spoon feed any answer to viewers. We are left to decide for ourselves. The plot does provide some clues though. Where did that pop-up book that introduces the progressively more menacing Mr. Babadook come from? Why can Mr. Babadook penetrate into some rooms, yet be confined in others? Is the Babadook real, with an independent existence, or is he in the mind - or both? While the movie draws us into that question, it delivers some very scary moments and that chilling central performance by Essie Davis.The interview bonus features on the disc are also more absorbing than what's usually found on disc ""extras."" It seems it was primarily women who were involved in the making of this movie, and in telling about their journey getting this film as a realized project on screen, they weave a quiet, focused narrative that, in its way, is as atmospheric and intelligent as the movie itself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55LYUNJD29FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4YGV6Q#wasThisHelpful","R55LYUNJD29FC","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So many true crime TV programs such as ""48 Hours"" have dealt with the gruesome murders in the Novack family, the Miami royalty who founded the Fontainebleau Hotel - that I was reluctant to get this video. I thought there could be little more to add to the already numerous accounts.But this movie does have a freshness about it, despite how well the ground has already been covered. The life leading up to these murders is recounted in a wry narrative style. This narration is done by the already dead Ben Novack, Jr., heir to the family's fortune. This puts the proceedings in a strange, out-of-body perspective from the start. It also allows Novack to be more of an appealing character than the straightforward TV documentaries made of him. Despite his addiction to porn, drugs, and Batman memorabilia, his postmortem account makes him seem almost angelic, a personage who hovers over the scene - enthusing in the excesses he enjoyed in life, and accepting with a sort of resigned twinkle the fate that these excesses ultimately dealt him.Overall, this ""based in fact"" movie reminded me of the purely fictional movie ""Sexy Beast."" Both movies are unusual in that they feature characters who enjoy their wealth to the hilt. They are not depressed by their over-the-top lifestyles. They revel in all the excesses that their wealth affords them. So this is a departure from the usual code that even most modern movies adhere to - the code that dictates that the rich must be demonstrably miserable and undeserving at all times.But then, this movie also swings along with the sort of syncopated beat that made ""Sexy Beast"" dance. In ""Sexy Beast,"" Ray Winstone's character revels in his good fortune by pronouncing it fabulicious, or literally, ""fan-dabby-dozy-tastic."" In this movie, Rob Lowe never quite utters any such catchy scat phrases. But the spirit of riffing through the music of our existence that way permeates this movie, right through the brutal killings.It tends to give the viewer a new way of looking at life - and death. Isn't it all, in the end - Wow! Isn't it all fan-dabby-dozy-tastic?","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U16Y39BJY5AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAGO8H8#wasThisHelpful","R3U16Y39BJY5AC","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stephen King has produced so many works in the last decade or so that have been mishmashes of supernatural special effects (a la ""Rose Red""), that this return to realistic human storytelling is a welcome relief. We have here the subtleties of a marriage that appears to be a good and loving one on the outside, but that even from the beginning has the tension and suspense of something sinisterly rotten at its core.There is even here though some departure from strict realism. Sometimes we can't be sure when we have crossed the line from reality into one of the spouse's imaginings. So, while I was 99% sure I knew what had happened and why at the end of the story - King leaves us that niggling 1% that might cast the story in a completely different light. The self-satisfied, triumphant way in which someone at the end pops open what had previously been a forbidden candy - might make you think - and wonder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YL48BGX21FSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW6KW16#wasThisHelpful","R1YL48BGX21FSC","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a small gem of a book written by a Swiss psychologist who offers some valuable advice to parents and partners who want to do the best for the people they love. Tournier writes about the necessity of having secrets, and about the subtle timing involved in ripening, then revealing secrets. He defines healthy relationships as this ebb and flow of restraint and confiding.The word ""secret"" is too often preceded by the adjective ""dirty"" in this culture. We often fail to appreciate the degree to which having a secret promotes independence in children and gives marriages their emotive force. In our tell-all, let-it-all-hang-out world, it's easy to become emotionally flat. We lack the inner spark that a delightful secret can give us.Tournier is one of the few psychologists to point out this positive aspect of secrets. You don't hear much about this from Dr. Phil or any of the other talk-show counselors as they deal with parents with wayward teens or wayward spouses. Having a secret and allowing others to time the keeping of their secrets can indeed be the ""secret"" to having a harmonious household.This book was written in the 1960's and does contain a couple of outdated references, as for example when Tournier refers to the extreme fear with which people often hide a family member's homosexuality. But for the most part, this wise little volume carries forward into the modern world with some remarkable insights that have been overlooked for too long.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17CVZNXGDDB6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620323583#wasThisHelpful","R17CVZNXGDDB6W","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, Loftus recounts some fascinating true crime cases in which she was called to give testimony regarding the unreliability of eyewitness identifications. Loftus is a research psychologist who participated in a lot of studies demonstrating how easily people's memories can be influenced. She also is known for the work she has done demonstrating how memories can be implanted wholesale in adults or children, as happened in the McMartin pre-school case.Loftus does give some illustrations of how police can contaminate witness accounts, but I wish she had gone into even more detail about the studies she has conducted showing how this can happen, and about the advice she gives to police officers on how to avoid such undue influence. Perhaps though more detail on this score would have made the book too long. There is a bibliography provided to fill in some of these gaps.Here the author concentrates more on the circumstances of the crimes themselves. As it turned out, she didn't always work on the side of the ""good guys."" She tells about testifying for Ted Bundy's defense. Thinking back, she remembers disliking how Bundy smiled at the prosecutor, something an innocent man doesn't ordinarily do. A few scattered comments such as that might make the reader wonder if Loftus' memory might itself be showing the kind of after-the-fact malleability that she saw it as her role to remind juries to take into consideration. Did she really suspect Bundy at the time?In several of the cases Loftus recounts, there have been interesting reversals since this 1991 book was published. Some of the other individuals for whose defense she testified, also later appeared to be guilty. She writes about the part she likely played in exonerating Timothy Hennis, accused of killing a mother and two of her children. More recently, a DNA analysis of semen found in the dead woman matched Hennis' DNA. But this case cries out for an updated, full-length account. Hennis' three trials raise the issue of how prosecution can circumvent double jeopardy laws, and might even call into question the reliability of some DNA analysis, since so much of the other evidence seemed to unequivocally point to Hennis' innocence.There were other reversals, going in the opposite direction from guilty to innocent, after Loftus' book came out. Loftus was asked to testify for the defense team of Ivan Demjanyuk, accused of being a sadistic Treblinka concentration camp guard. Loftus recounts  how she agonized over her decision. Should she testify and appear to be betraying her Jewish ancestry by calling into question the memories of the survivors who identified Demjanyuk as being their tormentor? You can read the book to find out what Loftus ultimately decided.Other cases dealt with in this book include that of: Tony Herrerez, a camp counselor accused of child abuse; Howard Haupt, accused of child abduction and murder; Von Williams, accused of rape; and Tyrone Biggs, accused of assault and attempted rape.You'll find a number of insights into court procedure here that you won't find in most other true crime books. This book will also probably inspire you to read more about many of the cases mentioned, and to probe more deeply into the whole question of how accurate anyone's memory is, including your own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17I0C4TI9G7AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312084552#wasThisHelpful","R17I0C4TI9G7AG","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A number of plots revolving around frighteningly disturbed people get woven together here. There's a young woman impelled by an increasing conviction that she was abused as a youngster, who is now seeking to get revenge on those who would deny it. There's a street tough who has lost all touch with his humanity. Most central to the book though is the boy found lost and wandering, fallen mute in the wake of some mysterious trauma his caretakers suspect he might have suffered. The cause of his unnerving silence has to be solved before many of the other people's disorders can be unraveled. Is the boy an innocent victim? If so, of what?The subplot that I found to be most interesting was the one involving the battle that a couple of the lead characters make against created or ""implanted"" memories of abuse. These psychologists draw an unreasoning amount of hostility from individuals committed to the life stories they might have structured for themselves as props, and from counselors who have dedicated themselves to helping people unearth these presumed causative factors. I hadn't realized the extent of the controversy surrounding this issue.This fiction led me to read some of the true crime accounts of psychologists who have been in the forefront of exposing techniques of implanting false memories. This included some of the work of Elizabeth Loftus who has frequently testified in court, making juries aware of how readily eye witnesses to a crime can be misled into identifying the wrong person as perpetrator.The writing in this novel is fairly lucid, although sometimes the point of view shifts and the story is told from the perspective of some unidentified person. These interjections appear in slightly different type faces. This is occasionally a little confusing. But generally, you can skim along if you want, just getting the gist of the action. Or you can pause over slightly more complicated, literary sentences, such as the one describing the street thug's girlfriend. ""She stared up…, unable to convey so dignified a sentiment as disdain, and resorting instead to hostility.""The novel is set in England and contains some English slang. That girlfriend is reluctant to ""grass"" on anyone. But anyone who has seen any British-produced crime dramas on TV should have no trouble understanding these occasional colloquialisms.The pace picks up and the suspense builds, particularly in the last quarter of the book. So if the going seems a little slow through some sections - hang in there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SBINET3L563E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0333766253#wasThisHelpful","R3SBINET3L563E","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has a grabber of a premise. It seems possible that an ingenious serial killer is eliminating all the people who were on the psychiatric staff of a hospital years previous. The murderer (if indeed there is one) has made each death look like an accident that meshes perfectly with some risk the victim was accustomed to taking in pursuit of a hobby. A mountain climber falls off his ledge, a pilot's plane crashes, etc.The two surviving members of that psychiatric ward have to figure out who, what, and why, before they might be the next to fall prey. Their task is made all the more difficult because most of the regular police have taken the long span of deaths to indeed be nothing more than perfectly explainable accidents. Even if the authorities could be induced to entertain some suspicion, the surviving doctors are bound by their professional ethics not to divulge the names of any of their patients from those days.There are some subplots here that might appeal to readers with special niche interests. The question of the identity and fate of D. B. Cooper, the real-life hijacker who became a folk hero in the 1970's after he parachuted out of a 727 with the ransom money he'd demanded, is once again considered. There is also some space given to the problems of living with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.Author Stephen White writes in a straightforward way that will move you quickly through the pages. There are just a couple of gaffs that might trip you and amuse you for a second.  When the two doctors first seem close to renewing their torrid romance of years before, they stand face-to-face to embrace. At this point, White writes that the male protagonist feels his ex-lover's bosom rub against his abdomen. Well, that would be anatomically difficult unless the woman was a Little Person, which she was not - or unless she had extraordinarily droopy breasts, which she did not.White doesn't use a poetic or prepossessing vocabulary. The book's ending is rather lame. But I liked the level of detail White applies to describe people and places. For example, when Dr. Gregory spreads a blueprint for his house renovation out on his kitchen table, White tells us that he held down the curling ends of the paper with a brass pepper mill and an unopened jar of peanut butter. It's details such as this that really put you in the scene, and that make you feel put at risk along with the lead characters in the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396DUZL10TF3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451197038#wasThisHelpful","R396DUZL10TF3C","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a who-done-it. And contrary to its jacket blurb, it's not very suspenseful either. It gets off to an odd start. It presents an obvious problem in the first pages. But in the 1960's world in which this book was written, the problematic action comes out of the blue and really isn't given any context. So it's more puzzling than mysterious, more frustrating than nefarious. The book occasionally feels as if some pages, some passages are missing. It lacks a certain narrative flow.It's altogether a little odd and off-kilter and antique. It presents a world of rented rooms where both a Doctor and a transient might stay, using a common phone that's down the hall. It presents a world in which a woman's character might be besmirched by almost any sexual liaison. When the villain or villains do swing into action, they appear a bit Victorian, with a stereotypical Dickensian cast.However the book generally held my interest, if for no other reason than that it is so unlike most more recent novels that involve malicious intent. There are also passages of exceptionally good writing. Armstrong really makes the reader feel what a trip on LSD might be like. She also paints some characters very well, giving them touching human motives. For example, she has the protagonist's mother-in-law clutching onto her husband, as if she were making a justifying clutch at all the bad decisions she's ever made in her life.So in general, I can recommend ""Balloon Man"" if you like a gentler, lower-key book that's well off the beaten path of our current serial killers and psychopaths. But don't expect to meet a balloon man any too soon on these pages. He appears late and very briefly. And along with his wares, this story might leave you feeling a bit up in the air.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOFGHXAG6TCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005VHUE#wasThisHelpful","R1VOFGHXAG6TCS","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book consists of short, bite-size chapters describing a wide variety of analyses the author made regarding the implications, reliability, or source, of words presented to him. He did this as a leading authority in the relatively new field of ""forensic linguistics"" that he has been a pioneer in formalizing.This isn't handwriting analysis. Nor is it exactly like the kinds of attribution studies that scholars have been doing for a long time in order to determine such questions as ""Did Shakespeare really write all those plays?"" Rather, Olsson's work is geared strictly toward giving impartial testimony in court, so it calls for both legal and linguistic knowledge.I had my attention called to this new discipline in an episode of TV's ""Forensic Files."" It seemed like a fascinating subject for anyone interested in writing, or in the meaning and nuances of words. As a result, I immediately bought this book, as well as Olson's textbook on the subject. Of the two books, ""Word Crime"" is aimed more at a general audience. Each chapter is a case study that describes some of the principles Olsson used in reaching a conclusion about certain contested statements.The chapters cover an amazingly wide range of topics. They include Olsson's analysis of both written and audio sources. Had a ""suicide"" note found beside a woman's body really been written by that woman - or did her husband write it to disguise a murder? Was a witness' statement spontaneous - or did his account have the earmarks of having been fed to him by police questioners? Were the charges of genocide made by two Rwandan women against one of their countrymen firsthand accounts - or were they based on hearsay? Was bestseller ""The DaVinci Code"" plagiarized by author Dan Brown - or is it original work? (In this last particularly interesting case, Olsson refrains from spelling out what opinion he rendered, leaving readers to form their own conclusion.)In general, this book didn't dampen my enthusiasm for pursuing the subject matter further. However sometimes Olsson's writing is a bit stuffy and uninspired. Some of the conclusions he rather laboriously arrives at seem obvious. Also, some of the cases he cites don't seem to warrant the analytic lengths he went to in order to render an opinion. For example, there's the case of the airplane pilot who had his flyers' Club privileges revoked and his plane and hangar confiscated when his fellow plane enthusiasts thought he was the author of some bitingly satirical articles about the Club in the local newspaper.Olsson also sometimes contradicts himself from one study to the next. In one place he warns that it's now deemed to be unproductive to use concordances in which you total up the number of times a word appears in a contested document as compared to a known document. However, then Olsson tells how he used various corpuses (similar to concordances) and also just simple Google searches to see how often a particular phrase appears in general usage. It's the same when it comes to considering the average length of sentences and the richness of the vocabulary used in two documents up for comparison. At first Olsson says such factors are ""not indicative"" of authorship, but in subsequent case studies he uses those very factors to help him reach an opinion.In other cases, Olsson appears to be somewhat biased, contrary to the strict code of conduct that any forensic scientist is supposed to follow. He reports the cases in which the courts or judges rendered decisions contrary to his recommendations, and in some of these cases, the reader might feel the courts were in the right. Also, many of these studies were conducted in England and so are based on questions of jurisprudence and police procedure that might be foreign to many American readers.But on the whole, this material is a real find. It opens a door to a whole new field of study. Better yet, it will likely sensitize readers to phrasing and nuance. Did the witness say, ""I saw 'the' cut on his arm"" - or ""I saw 'a' cut on his arm""? That difference can make all the difference.Be sure to take advantage of the glossary at the end of the book that explains the more technical meaning of many of the terms that Olsson uses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVL18Q2PD9JUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1441193529#wasThisHelpful","RVL18Q2PD9JUG","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like so many authors who write about relativity and quantum physics for the layman, Brian Clegg explains some aspects of the science well, and skips over other aspects of the field. There are very few books out there that satisfactorily explain every one of the facets of quantum physics that is explainable.What's good about this book:It starts out on an interesting note, providing some of Einstein's arguments against quantum physics in his original German. Those original words, along with the more exact translations provided, give readers a better feel for Einstein's real objection to quantum weirdness, rather than just compressing his views into the usual quote about God playing dice;It contains some interesting descriptions of the art of encryption and what quantum science might eventually contribute to sending secured messages;It includes a better-than-average description of the set-up of Alain Aspect's experiments, the experiments that finally seemed to demonstrate the existence of quantum entanglement and therefore of ""spooky action at a distance.""How author Brian Clegg could have made this book better:He doesn't devote enough time to giving the exact results of Aspect's experiments and to explaining their significance. That's really what I read this book in order to discover;Although this book is largely about the phenomenon of particle ""entanglement,"" Clegg never fully defines what constitutes entanglement. I'd have liked more hand-holding paragraphs devoted to that basic idea;I would also have liked fuller definitions of basic concepts such as ""solid state,"" and ""qubit.""Clegg says qubits (when these theoretical entities could be harnessed) would be capable of carrying such a wide range of informational values all at once in a superimposed state, that their use would greatly increase the processing capacity of computers and would essentially return us to the days of analog rather than digital mechanisms. In that regard, I would like to have read about the use of ""fuzzy logic"" that was all the rage in the '80's, and that still is the basis for a lot of computer operations. Since fuzzy logic also returns users to the broad range of capacity that characterized the analog age, it might have been interesting to learn how fuzzy logic would compare to the use of qubits.Finally, both the title and the jacket of this book are misleading. Clegg doesn't make it clear until the last few pages that, by the ""God Effect,"" he in fact is referring to ""entanglement."" He also doesn't mention the ""God Particle,"" the Higgs boson, (another strictly theoretical particle when this book was written in 2006) until those last few pages. So we don't know the reason for the book's title until the very end. Since this isn't a mystery thriller, in which the skillful author doesn't reveal the killer's identity until the last page, this delay in clarifying the book's subject matter might be a little frustrating.Then the book carries a second subtitle of ""Time Travel, Teleportation, and the Ultimate Computer."" Again, two of these topics aren't broached until the last chapters, and then only to be either effectively dismissed or misrepresented. Clegg tells about the invention of the telegraph and how that enabled savvy horse race bettors to learn which horse won a particular London race, and then to bet on that horse while bets were still being accepted in England's smaller, outlying towns. Clegg characterizes this advantage given by telegraph transmissions as ""traveling back in time."" That kind of loose, possibly metaphorical reference, once again muddies the concepts of ""time"" and ""time travel.""As for teleportation - Clegg says it won't be possible in any literal sense for the foreseeable future (or likely ever). So if you are tempted to get this book based on its jacket's promise of presenting Star Trek in action, you'll be disappointed.Finally, Clegg is quick to dismiss entanglement as a factor in producing consciousness. He says that consciousness is more robust and more easily explained than through the vagaries of entanglement. I think most scientists would object to this opinion that consciousness can ever be ""easily"" explained..However, this book is good enough to keep you reading, and will inspire you to go on to read other books on the subject in order to fill in more of the missing pieces of the puzzle of quantum physics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80TWOXSF58QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031255530X#wasThisHelpful","R80TWOXSF58QG","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The jacket blurb advertises this book as ""Three on a Match."" That's a good way to characterize these three stories featuring detective Poirot. Some say it's likely that the phrase ""three on a match"" came to signify bad luck as a result of men's wartime experience. Using one match to light three cigarettes kept the flame burning long enough for an enemy to get a precise reading on your location. That's what happens in this triad of tales written in the 1930's, the heyday of dead bodies in the library. The stories get progressively more dangerous from first to last, as they home in on the heart of malice.The first story, ""Dead Man's Mirror,"" does indeed present the classic puzzle of an eccentric, blunderbuss of a Lord found dead in his den, an apparent suicide.  Poirot immediately thinks he sees beyond that easy assumption though. This story is fairly good. It has appeared in several collections of Christie's short stories, sometimes I think in slightly abbreviated form. But in the course of arriving at the truth, Poirot has to pick his way through quite a mesh of confounding circumstance. This is more a story of logistics than emotion, and some of the logistics become a little implausible.The second story, ""Murder in the Mews"" also involves an apparent suicide. A young woman finds her flat-mate dead in her bedroom. This story involves a clever twist, but the twist is telegraphed, perhaps a bit too broadly. For once, I tumbled to a part of the truth early on. Perhaps you will too.The third story, ""Triangle at Rhodes"" is the most dangerous one of the three though. It involves some subtle psychological interplay which can be more chilling than lots of legerdemain in the course of effecting either suicide or murder. This last story about a mismatched group of people on vacation in sunny Rhodes is quite short - something you can read almost in the flick of a match.All-in-all, this small book, like so many of  Christie's books, is ideal for the bedside or for plane trips. A study once showed that a large percentage of travelers have taken a Christie mystery with them on at least one of their trips. An interviewer once asked Christie herself - ""What do you take along for light reading when you travel?"" What could she say? When you ARE Agatha Christie - there's nothing left.Aren't we lucky that we aren't Agatha Christie, so we can enjoy books like this on our travels?","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCHR6AYB9MMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD36ERA#wasThisHelpful","R3LCHR6AYB9MMS","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's that old saying - ""When all you have is a hammer, the whole world is a nail."" Since the author has made the study of Tourette's such a large part of his life's work, and since his son was diagnosed with the Syndrome - he sees it everywhere. He genetically associates the Syndrome with just about every other kind of dysfunction you can imagine, from all forms of OCD - to autism - to alcoholism - to depression - to schizophrenia - to hyper-sexuality, hypo-sexuality, and homosexuality - and the list goes on. In the end, he even says that he can see himself as being likely responsible for passing at least some part of the Tourette's gene complex onto his son, because he has been a workaholic all his life. Thus even working hard at a career gets labeled as a form of Tourette's.So Comings does tend to cast his net too wide, dragging in every kind of fishy malady that's out there as a result. This far-flung association might tend to make the reader skeptical about the whole body of his work. This approach also obviously will make it difficult for future researchers to focus down on any real remedies.What's more, it becomes difficult to see why Comings specifically chose Tourette's as the fulcrum of this whole gamut of disorders. Couldn't he just as easily have made something like compulsive hand-washing or any other OCD behavior as the centerpiece of his researches, and hung every other disorder, including Tourette's, on that hook?However, Comings researches, as reported here, still make a valuable contribution to the understanding of Tourette's and all compulsive behaviors. Comings was a pioneer in this field, and he hauled the Syndrome out of the Dark Ages when it was blamed on a mother's aloofness or on some other parenting failure (usually of course on the mother's part). He moved it from the sphere of vague Freudian accusation onto the firmer ground of genetics.His extensive observations also served to raise awareness of the Syndrome in the medical community and relieved many parents of their struggle to get a diagnosis for their child's troubling behavior. Comings took complaints seriously and took the time to observe over the long haul. He came to understand that someone with Tourette's could suppress symptoms for a while and appear to be trouble-free when sitting in a Doctor's office, again causing the Doctor to accuse the mother of being overly protective and of imagining symptoms, or even of imputing symptoms to her child.Comings also has assembled a huge number of family histories, charting what he found to be the increased incidence of OCD, alcoholism, and other troubling symptoms in the family trees of Tourette's sufferers. These records can serve as a valuable data bank for all kinds of researchers, although again, the readiness with which an uncle of a proband Tourette's sufferer gets labeled as an alcoholic with a habit of flashing school girls might be called into question. Comings does tell what standardized personality tests he used to label individuals with the variety of associated problems he finds. However, readers might still find these histories to be a bit random. Comings himself admits that other researchers have looked at his data and found NO linkages to Tourette's.The records might also be of minimal value in differentiating the families of sufferers from non-suffering families. Almost every family, even those without any Tourette's complaints, can probably find any number of uncles, great-uncles, and cousins, who were alcoholic flashers in their family trees. Nevertheless, Comings' records still stand as an impressive repository of suggestive data, and if nothing else, make for interesting reading.So all-in-all, I can recommend reading Comings if you have any interest at all in the subject of compulsive disorders or in genetics in general. In this later book, he traces how his thinking developed from the assumption that Tourette's might be linked to one specific gene or to a small number of interacting genes - to his current opinion that it could be the result of a complex multitude of interacting genes and their triggers, even including what we'd currently call ""epigenetic"" factors.However, if you keep in mind that Comings' ideas have developed away from any single-gene theory, you might still find his earlier book, ""Tourette Syndrome and Human Behavior,"" more informative. That earlier, longer book serves as a lucid primer in genetics and includes many diagrams that clearly illustrate the principles of heredity involved. That 1990 book also includes more detailed family histories. These accounts of dysfunction are forensically fascinating and make you feel as if you're a detective following a familial trail of clues to solve the great mystery of Tourette's Syndrome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMOR675FKL750/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1878267418#wasThisHelpful","RMOR675FKL750","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the chronicle of what we'd call ""besties"" taking the grand tour after their graduation in the 1920's. They travel with an enthusiasm and innocence that would be rare today.Skinner and Kimbrough describe their adventures sailing from Canada and then taking in the highlights of England and France. Since Skinner was the child of a famed theatrical family, the two young women were able to stay longer and see more on their travels than the average tourist. Readers get a hilarious view of the Seinfeld-esque contretemps they experience.One of them gets ""attacked in bed."" The two learn about sex from ""Leda and the Swan"" at the Cluny Museum. Emily gets to flaunt the command of the French language she has acquired from road signs as she drops phrases such as ""safety valve"" and ""No spitting"" into sophisticated continental conversation with H. G. Wells and Margaret Sanger.But there are some serious lessons to be drawn from this book, written about twenty years after the fact. It's good to see how society has progressed in some of its attitudes. Cornelia's mother explains homosexuality as an unfortunate affliction that, in spite of being involuntary, can't be condoned. The girls aren't allowed to meet one actor because he was divorced. As far as the status of women goes, the girls realize that ""A woman alone, or with another woman (which counts as the same thing)"" is completely discounted in France. Finally, one of the girls sees something in a wedding picture that a veteran shows her - something that we've probably all seen in such old pictures, but whose implications we didn't interpret so keenly. She sees the groom standing behind the seated bride, his hand firmly clamped on her shoulder, ""as if holding her down.""There are also references to some of the fashions and famous people of the 20's that most readers will probably find too distant to remember.But for the most part, this book will make you laugh and will lighten your heart.

"This book is disappointing.  Mr. Tompkins, the intrepid adventurer in the realm of physics, doesn't really play any part in it. Outside of a few interest anecdotes, It becomes just a straightforward overview of the development of ideas in the field of physics, including the more baffling field of quantum physics.Some of these concepts aren't even very well explained. For example, early on, there are confusing references to anodes and cathodes - first one, then the other being cited as the negative electrode in a cell. I was hoping Gamov would make the differential use of the terms clear with some of the quixotic clarity he mustered in the actual Mr. Tompkins books. However he doesn't. He lets the reader flounder with these terms, and with only partial explanations of many other principles.He goes on to recount some of Faraday's experiments, but doesn't explain them or their significance as well as a reader might find in other books on the subject. And so these pages proceed, basically as a rehash of information available in many other places. The first pages do include some interesting history, such as how the ""Milky Way"" got its name. But then, it just devolves into routine definitions (what's a millimeter - how many grams in an ounce, etc.) and routine reviews of basic information in the field.In summary, I couldn't see any real need for this book. You can probably find most of these concepts better explained in any decent high school physics book, and certainly in many of the hundreds of ""Physics for the Layman"" and ""Quantum Physics for the Layman"" books out there. Many of these other sources also would likely include more vivid, clarifying illustrations, which are very sparse here. It seems as if Gamov might just have written this book under contract to produce something, anything - in the wake of his popular Mr. Tompkins' series. Gamov didn't seem to bother to exercise his genius for explanation here.In order to find that, you need to go back to the original Mr. Tompkins books which take you, along with Mr. Tompkins, on wild rides into the fascinating realms of the very big and the very tiny.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SLUK2XGP4K5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0131872915#wasThisHelpful","R2SLUK2XGP4K5T","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rothbotham writes this psychological thriller in the first person. The narrator/protagonist is a psychologist who is found to have incriminating links to several murder victims. At first I somewhat missed having the multi-layered perspective that's available to the omniscient observer used in many novels. But this book's approach gives the reader an urgent sense of running along with Joseph O'Loughlin as he races to clear himself from suspicion and to catch the person he believes to be the real killer before he strikes again.There are a few fault-lines here that might cause readers to stub their toes as they follow along. For example, the first murder victim is found after having been buried for ten days by a canal. The psychologist immediately recognizes the body as being that of a woman who'd been his patient some time before. In reality, it seems unlikely that anyone buried by water for ten days would remain so easily recognizable. Therefore, this book probably would not be a good choice if you're looking for realistic autopsy examinations and forensic analysis.Then there are occasional usages that might bring American readers in particular up short. There are some very British references that I had to research in order to understand. One character is referred to as having ""a Scorse accent, such as you might find in a Ken Loach film.""Another factor that might dampen a reader's enthusiasm a little is that Joseph is often not a very sympathetic character. He never refers to his father except as ""God's personal physician-in-waiting."" About the sixth time he thinks of his father in these terms, the snide sarcasm has definitely gotten tedious and intrusive. What's more, it makes it look as if Joseph has such an axe to grind, that the reader, along with the police, might begin to suspect that he really IS the brutal serial killer.Joseph also has had major failings as a husband, and he has not come all that far in reforming. In addition, he exhibits some minor, but just as annoying, sexist attitudes. He refers to Welsh weddings and funerals as being routinely officiated over by ""women in support hose."" He describes some elderly waitresses as being of the type who ""should be home putting curlers in their hair."" This is the kind of routine condescension one finds when actors dismissively talk about their matinees as being predictably stocked with ""blue-haired old ladies."" Such a tone would not be tolerated if the standard activities of different ethnic groups were being described. So if you are looking for a novel that features a thoroughly decent and heroic lead character - again, this might not be the book for you.However, ""Suspect"" is very well-written. It's full of apt, evocative figures of speech. One character, who might be the killer, ominously announces, ""I was once a pawn, but I reached the end of the board. I can be anything now."" When Joseph speculates that his counsel might be making an impression, albeit an unwelcome one, on a patient, he says, ""My words are leaking through and expanding the cracks & crevices of his mind like water turned to ice.""There are other good points about this book. As Joseph deals with his recent diagnosis of Parkinson's, he conveys some good information about the prognosis and treatment of his form of the disease. You'll also read something about the symptoms of schizophrenia. Finally, the motive for the killings turns out to be something different from the standard love or money or madness. It's a motive that might call all those in the counseling professions to take stock and think twice.The book slips into being a bit like an over-the-top action movie at the end. But it's a good, taut read most of the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3Y5QIKNWV14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087XJPKI#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3Y5QIKNWV14","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first part of this book didn't convince me that Patton was assassinated, especially that he was assassinated with a one-two punch. It just seemed too difficult and unlikely that Patton could purposely have been involved in a car collision, then when that only paralyzed but didn't kill him, that a stealthy agent could have finished him off in the hospital by some exotic means such as cyanide spray.As if this ""how"" weren't improbable enough, the ""who"" seemed even more unbelievable. Wilcox initially advances a dodgy individual involved in all sorts of OSS and other spy operations as the main claimant to have done the deed. However this man's information wavers with each re-telling. What's more he seems to be a blowhard whose facts don't jibe. For example, he claimed to have had one of his hands permanently mangled in a torture episode, but at least one later picture of him that's included in this book shows him with two perfectly shaped hands.But then Wilcox's claims about who might have been involved in the assassination branch out from there to become a hodgepodge of implication and innuendo reminiscent of Oliver North's view of the Kennedy assassination. Everyone from FDR and Stalin, down through Eisenhower and Donovan (head of the OSS), and then through a host of Russian and Ukrainian functionaries, are implicated in intimating a desire to get rid of Patton - a desire that might have gotten translated into action without anyone's ever having issued a specific order.Wilcox obviously did a huge amount of research for this book. He minutely went through everything available in all sorts of national document repositories (making note of what was suspiciously NOT available along the way). He examined the car which Patton's Ft. Knox Museum staff purports to be the one in which Patton's crash occurred. He even had old car buffs and car crash reconstructionists examine the Cadillac (along with accident scene photos) to confirm that the car now on display is likely not the car in which Patton was jolted to his ultimate demise. Wilcox interviewed countless people involved in the crash and their relatives, noting how their stories suspiciously shape-shifted over the years.However, it's plain that Wilcox pursues all these leads from a strong anti-Communist, pro-Patton stand, and therefore is likely looking only for evidence that would support his view of Patton as heroic victim. He definitely labels Robert Oppenheimer, Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs, and others, as Communist spies rather than recognizing that the status of many of these individuals has been a contested, murky issue to this day. So Wilcox comes to the case with a Patton-could-do-no-wrong bias.Wilcox even leaves out details that might vaguely mesh with his conspiracy claims, but that would put Patton in a bad light. For example, Wilcox doesn't mention that Patton had a mistress and that she seemingly committed suicide not long after Patton's death.However, all this bias and these likely fabricated or exaggerated memories notwithstanding, I did end up feeling Wilcox might be onto something after all. In the later part of his book, he does a good job of recounting the chronology of Patton's campaigns and of the ill-will he generated along the way. Wilcox points out the urgency U.S. officials felt to cozen the Russians and to maintain our friendship with them - and how dangerously disruptive Patton was to these delicate diplomatic relations. With all the other anti-Russian information that was suppressed (violently if necessary) at the time - it begins to be more and more logical that Patton might have been suppressed too.Wilcox demonstrates how cheap all life was in the espionage entanglements of post-War Europe. It was a world of betrayal. There were proven assassinations galore. What's more, the lives of American and British POWs, German refugees (and virtually all other refugees), agents and double agents, were all so easily sacrificed in order to prevent any news of Stalin's massacres and of Russia's overall killing bleakness from leaking out. Wilcox does an excellent job of putting the reader back into that grim and mercenary reality, and in so doing, makes his case at least plausible.You might want to check out the movie ""Patton"" to view in conjunction with reading this book. The movie amazingly manages to capture so much of the waxing and waning of relationships between Patton, Eisenhower, Bradley, and others, through the series of  campaigns Patton led and the campaigns from which he was so pointedly sidelined. It dramatically summarizes the dangerous liaisons that Wilcox finally so ably expands upon in ""Target Patton.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZFTRWU8N9C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621572919#wasThisHelpful","R19ZFTRWU8N9C3","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This inside look at a real jury's deliberations does very much parallel some of the dynamics shown in the classic movie ""12 Angry Men."" The actual jurors here were perhaps not as dramatically angry or impatient as some of Henry Fonda's co-jurors, but they did have to work their way through a variety of personality conflicts. As in the movie, some of these real-life jurors also were swayed back and forth between ""Guilty"" and ""Not Guilty"" as first one juror, then another held the floor with an opinion. These individuals also paralleled the fictional jurors in that they extrapolated from the evidence presented during the trial, supplying from their own experience some of the missing links left when defense attorney Hawk simply rested  his case without calling any witnesses.In his introduction to this book, author Villasenor says that he interviewed all the jurors several times on each point in order to arrive at an accurate composite recollection of every aspect of their debate during sequestration. However, it seems impossible for him to be exactly recreating every word, every gesture in the way he recounts here. It's more likely that he had to resort to some of the techniques that an author of historical novels uses. He likely recaptured the gist of the progression of the jurors' decision-making process - but necessarily had to imaginatively fill in the specifics of their conversation.There are a few points about this book that readers might find a little frustrating. First of all, it can be difficult to get to know all the jurors and to keep their differing views straight. However, Villasenor provides a list of jurors and attorneys at the beginning of the book, with thumbnail identifiers you can refer back to as you read.Second, you might initially find it a little frustrating to be thrown into deliberations about the crimes Juan Corona was accused of, without knowing what those crimes were. I hadn't been very familiar with the 1970's serial killings of migrant workers that Corona was charged with having committed. But it was amazing how soon a reader is brought up to speed on the facts of the crimes just by eavesdropping on the jurors' debate. Ultimately, this turned out to be an excellent way of learning the details of the crimes themselves - better than any simple chronological narrative could probably have provided.All in all, this stands as a rare look into what goes on behind the closed doors of a jury room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJKGN359K2WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316903000#wasThisHelpful","R3HJKGN359K2WA","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book contains snippets of science. Each interesting scientific fact is presented in a bite-size page accompanied by a cartoon drawing. So this makes for ideal bedside reading. You can learn a little something each night before dozing off.A lot of the facts are of the myth-breaking, believe-it-or-not variety. The author says that the ""melt-down"" of the 3-Mile Island nuclear plant hardly raised surrounding levels of radiation at all. Hurricanes are not stronger or more frequent now than in other eras. Wine and liquor sold in the U.S. must, by law, be radioactive. Most organically grown produce is vastly more toxic than produce grown with conventional large-scale spraying/fertilizing techniques.Muller explains all the above surprising assertions. However, some of the facts are presented all too briefly. The information is given in a hit-and-run form that cries out for a little more elaboration. For example, Muller points out that the Earth's magnetic poles flip every 800,000 years or so. The switch takes a couple hundred years, during which time, he says the Earth has so magnetic field at all. Can this be true? How did birds migrate during these magnetic black-outs? How did the hundreds of other organic and geologic processes that depend on the presence of some magnetic field push through so that the continuity of life was preserved on Earth during these periods?Well, such quick peeks into scientific phenomena can inspire a reader to research the topics more fully. These pages make you realize a lot of what you don't know - and that's really what learning is all about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RBAJX9NITW5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393078264#wasThisHelpful","R2RBAJX9NITW5I","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has all the elements of a classic thriller. It has a stalking killer and a series of vulnerable women. It also gives the reader a clue to the killer's identity which I didn't catch, but which, like all good hints, makes the answer seem so obvious - once you know.Tom Savage takes the time to give his characters some individuality, even repeating a religious joke that circulated in the family of one victim. But happily, none of his victims have quagmire back-stories of drug addiction, alcoholism, or other such ""human failings"" which so often seem to be mandatory in modern mystery stories.The writing here is generally quite good. Savage knows how to make the most of that pivotal moment in all good thrillers when the killer reveals himself/herself with a terrifying turn of expression. The killer ""continued to smile at her, but she noticed the subtle change that crept into it. The gleam, the sudden look of triumph…""Savage goes beyond what many  thriller writers offer in that he also humanizes the killer. He allows that individual to have a say, so that the reader can feel the sense of humiliation and anger that has become a goad to action.Finally, you'll find real New York settings and some apt quotes from Shakespeare here, allowing you to consider your time spent reading this book as being ""educational,"" rather than simply an indulgence in sensationalism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELV27PCHCUT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5AG6GU#wasThisHelpful","R3ELV27PCHCUT0","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book captures a lot of the details of the debate between two giants of 20th century economic theory - but it is a bit dry in that it doesn't quite capture whatever spirit or essential genius either man might have brought to the match. It portrays two men confined in a ring roped off by presumptive concerns over the need to balance unemployment, inflation, interest rates, etc. The larger philosophical genius that Hayek especially showed in his ""Road to Serfdom"" largely gets lost in this more technical exchange.In the first half of the book, Hayek and Keynes are shown sparring over what was basically a form of the more modern debate between supply-side economics and demand-side economics. Hayek fought for the former, generally settling into a pattern that emphasized the necessity of keeping economies vital and growing by encouraging measures that led to more production. Keynes fought more on the demand-side by encouraging housewives to ""Spend, spend, spend!""In the course of this exposition, the author sometimes explains easy terms at great length - terms such as ""inflation."" However when he comes to more difficult concepts, such as whether or not to peg currencies to the gold standard - he breezes right by, leaving less technically trained readers puzzling over why either Keynes or Hayek would have taken the stand he did on the question. Well, I suppose if the author had gone into a detailed explanation of these more complicated subjects, he would have turned the book into a lengthy text on economics. Still, it's frustrating not to be able to fit the positions the economists took on these matters into their larger philosophies.Wapshott might also be a bit too breezy in some of his chapter titles. He repeatedly uses a Wild West analogy. We have: ""Pistols at Dawn,"" ""Return Fire,"" ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence,"" etc. Again, some readers might feel there has been a slight bias against Hayek in this shoot-out. One chapter title is ""Keynes Takes America."" However, two principal chapters focusing on Hayek are entitled ""Hopelessly Stuck"" and ""The Road to Nowhere."" In the text itself, Keynes' opinions are often stated as given facts - ""It was."" But Hayek's opinions usually are labeled as just that - ""He believed…""However, the latter half of the book becomes a valuable lesson in recent history. Starting with FDR and going through some of the second Bush administration, Wapshott summarizes the Presidents' economic policies, and in so doing provides a valuable recap of the times. These chapters illustrate how much the Presidents have been like Supreme Court appointees in that their earlier stated views and party affiliations were often no predictor of what economic tack they would take in office. Republicans often ended up promoting Keynesian policy; and Democrats often ended up instituting Hayek's programs.Through all their vacillations though, the officials rarely seem to think beyond the limited alternatives and definitions set by the Keynes/Hayek debate. It was always a see-saw of ""spur demand"" - no, ""spur production."" That surprised me in reading these chapters, because there were some other economic thinkers who had presented possibilities outside this clinch.For example, an American economist, Henry George, who was hugely popular in the early 20th century, had spoken to the anomaly of there being so much want in times of depression - so much work to be done, but so little employment. George still has followers today who run schools teaching his philosophy in most major cities. His solution of a single tax on land might seem to be a little creakily Victorian now in that he presented it with such gung-ho assurance as a panacea for all economic/social ills. However, George's insights into how speculative bubbles repeatedly arise and how they repeatedly lead to depressions/recessions should have informed the Keynes/Hayek debate.Then there are books written about ""Unjobbing."" These books are often written by and for back-to-the land environmentalists, but they contain more general insights into how people might think outside of the same old categories of ""supply, demand, and full employment.""Finally, writers such as Jane Jacobs discuss how to achieve vital economies without any reference at all to that endless teeter-tottering between unemployment and inflation, between inflation and interest rates, between supply and demand. She takes a personal, on-the-ground approach that informs about which kinds of industry ramify to create more and more vigorous economic activity - activity that satisfies actual needs rather than artificially manufactured needs goaded by a Keynesian command to ""Spend, spend, spend.""So in summary, this book presents interesting history, but I'm not sure you can come away from it with any net gain in insight into economics. For that, you might want to look into writers who have thought outside the box. You might want to read: ""Progress and Poverty"" by Henry George, ""Unjobbing"" by Michael Fogler, and ""The Economy of Cities"" by Jane Jacobs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84GXJSIC9D5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393343634#wasThisHelpful","R84GXJSIC9D5R","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This true crime account would be of special interest to Midwesterners who were alive in the 1960's and who might be ripe to have their memories jogged about the people and circumstances surrounding the brutal slaying of Valerie Percy, daughter of Charles Percy. ""Charles Percy"" was a household name throughout Illinois for decades. He had been President of Bell & Howell, and then had gone on to be elected Senator from Illinois. He became a national figure with Presidential aspirations.Considering the fame of the people involved and the fact that the victim was a beautiful young girl, it's odd that more books haven't been written about the crime. This one seems to be the only book devoted solely to the case. Perhaps the reason more authors haven't tackled the subject is that the Percy family has so consistently asked for privacy and has not cooperated with outside attempts to re-examine the tragedy. A member of the family had the case re-investigated a few years ago and reportedly came up with a suspect, but the name of that individual has not been released.So in 2013, when this book was written, author Glenn Wall did as much as he could on his own, with somewhat limited access to the evidence. He advances the name of the man he thinks responsible for the murder in the first few pages of the book, not keeping readers in suspense. His candidate does indeed seem likely, although I have read enough true crime books to be aware how often there are a remarkably high number of off-balance, potentially homicidal individuals living in the area of any crime scene. This case was no exception.In addition to the candidate Wall names, there had been a young man with a history of some mental stress problems living in the Percy guesthouse. Then, although Valerie had a steady boyfriend (who was in England at the time), there were other young men who dined at the Percy home (including on the night of the murder), at least one of whom thought HE and Valerie were a couple. There was also a home invasion gang that had been operating in the area. There was an asylum near Percy's mansion. And on it goes.You will find a few points against Wall's candidate being the perpetrator. For example, many who investigated the crime concluded that it must have been committed by someone with extensive knowledge of the Percy home, something Wall's suspect probably didn't have. Then here too, as famously figured in a Sherlock Holmes story, there was a dog who did NOT bark. So readers are given a lot of possibilities to consider.The book also serves to take the reader back to the early 60's in Chicago - to the retaliatory marches against Martin Luther King, to the Speck murders, to the case of Judith Mae Andersen whose body was found floating in a tin drum, and to the many misdeeds of Chicago politicians, one of whom was found to have hundreds of thousands of dollars, bilked from the public, in shoeboxes. (Wall, wrongly I think, attributes the shoebox stash to Illinois Secretary of State Carpentier, when in reality it was Carpentier's successor, Paul Powell, who siphoned off the money.) But Wall otherwise seems to be a reliable reporter.If nothing else, this book serves to remind us that the ""good old days"" could be as deadly and depraved as the modern times we are always lamenting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAZ8787X0PMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098997152X#wasThisHelpful","RKAZ8787X0PMS","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This truly is ""something different,"" to use Monty Python's segue. It's witty, bizarre, enthralling - and features a real individualist as its lead character. You won't have met anyone like Gabriela before. As one co-worker says of her, she is sort of oddly “child-like.” But while she has maintained a child's capacity to become utterly fascinated by some seemingly incidental question, the particular subject of her fascination reflects anything but what we regard as childish innocence.Her fascination results in an unusual scene of dueling obsessions that will keep you guessing. Can this unlikely young woman hold her own against the most ruthless of homicidal maniacs? Who will win, and what will be the prize for winning - besides life itself?The answer might not be strictly anatomically correct, but it's gory good fun.What's more, this movie made me aware of a lucrative job opportunity. I've recommended ""Curdled"" to out-of-work acquaintances seeking extremely high-paying jobs that don't require much specific training. Although a few later movies, such as ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" featured  crime scene clean-up as a career path - this is the original and best training film on the subject.

"This review is for the more casual movie-goer who doesn't necessarily want to make a study of a film or fit it into a director's larger oeuvre, but who wants entertainment and an emotional experience. As hard to figure out as ""Mulholland Drive"" is sometimes, it really delivers on that score.I'm grateful to other reviewers who have lived with this film for a while and have sorted out what might be its its dream inclusions, its chronology, the identity of its characters, and its overall plot and meaning. Many of those who have analyzed this film in that way have found it to be a masterpiece. However, even if you are like me and generally don't want to exert yourself making sense of a movie, you're still likely to find this one's scenes individually memorable and mesmerizing.Just to cite a few scenes that I found unforgettable: There's Naomi Watts' character's two renditions of her audition reading. Her first practice reading in her apartment is well-done and engaging, but it's a rather straightforward reading of rather banal material. However, her second, presumably at-the-casting-offices reading with Chad Everett, adds a breath-taking erotic twist of interpretation to the words. There was a hint of interpreting such a conventionally scripted scene in that way in the 1940's movie “Gilda.” But this more sustained reading gives the viewer time to be drawn into such a possibility of meaning the opposite of what you say. This scene should be required viewing in every acting class. It will open aspiring actors up to the possibility of new levels of meaning in any script.The scene in the all-night vaudeville theater is heart-breaking, and offers a telling philosophical view of the nature of life and illusion.Virtually every scene is a glittering gem in its own way, so you don't need to care exactly why they are strung together the way they are to make this a worthwhile experience. Even the more prosaic scenes, such as the early one showing two men chatting in a diner, the one man narrating his frightening dream to the other – are so steeped in some larger atmosphere of menace and amazement, that they are riveting. They give the initial impression of being set in the real, everyday world, but as you get into them, you are overcome with a sense of being in some bizarro, mirror-image reflection of everyday life.It amazingly captures the fear many of us might have of that cheery, apple-dumpling, seemingly encouraging grandmotherly figure in our lives. It intimates we might have reason to suspect that behind that facade, there's a character of ghastly malevolence.Hardly anything could be more menacing than the soft-spoken, matter-of-fact cowboy who arranges a meeting at night in an old corral outside of town with its guttering light bulb over the ranch gate. You are left with an inner quaking apprehension that no mere gun threats could effect when the cowboy says, “If you do good, you will see me one more time. If you do bad, you will see me two more times.”If any movie could convert me from being a casual movie-goer to a student of film, this would be the one to do it. It inspires me to want to see it over and over and more deeply each time. It is magnificent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31QP4MMJ9EZPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JKJA#wasThisHelpful","R31QP4MMJ9EZPF","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you really have an intense interest in this case about three youths accused of Satanic cult killings - you might find there's a little TMI included here. There are actually four discs in this ""Trilogy.""The first disc contains an account of the crime and the initial investigation. It's essential and interesting. The directors do a good job of recording the reactions of townspeople in the aftermath of the crime. You feel you really get to know some of these people. However sometimes a viewer might wish the reporters would have injected themselves in the inquiry more. There were questions that needed to have been asked. For example, many felt that the victims could not have been killed by the riverbed where their bodies were found because there was virtually no trace of blood around the scene. The water could have washed a lot of blood away, but if the theory about the killing having taken place elsewhere was correct, there must have been a blood-spattered room somewhere nearby. However we don't see any such search being made.The second disc is largely superfluous. Unless you have a lot of extra time, you can probably skip it. It summarizes the crime and its prosecutions and does follow-up interviews, but most of it is repetitious.You can move right on to the third disc. That includes the results of the prosecution of the three youths (now turned into young men) who had been presumed to have been acting in the throes of Satanic worship. It also includes the results of the activism on their behalf. Most interesting though is the follow-up interviews of some of the leading townspeople, showing how they and their attitudes have changed over the years. I found that one of the least likeable of the rabble rousers in town had actually turned into one of the most likeable and self-aware of individuals. These discs end on the optimism of how people can perhaps change for the better.There isn't much on the bonus fourth disc. Its brief content could have been included on one of the other discs. However its main feature, an interview with Jason Baldwin, again leaves the viewer with a more optimistic view of the human race. What comes across as the young man's essential kindness and persistent humanity in the face of all the trials he'd been through, sets an example for all of us.If you are not interested in the kind of in-depth and often repetitious view of the case that this Trilogy offers, you might check out the movie ""Devil's Knot"" starring Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon. The movie gives a fairly good thumbnail look at the personalities and the issues involved in the crime.But don't expect any case-closed resolution with the documentary Trilogy, the slightly fictionalized ""Devil's Knot,"" or Mara Leveritt's book dealing with the case. That's not what these accounts are about. They are more a representation of how hysteria and even something akin to mob rule can carry proceedings away from justice. In that sense, they are reminiscent of the title of another, earlier movie - ""A Town Without Pity.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UM2F2L5492YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NNY980#wasThisHelpful","R3UM2F2L5492YI","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This account of Joseph Kallinger’s fetishes, obsessions, and hallucinations probably describes the objective facts of his progression into murderous madness adequately enough. However, I’m not sure that the coloration that author Schreiber puts on those facts can be completely trusted.First of all, Flora Schreiber was the author of “Sybil,” an account of multiple personalities that has been widely discredited. The charge has been made that Schreiber got too close to the subject of that book and ended up eliciting or imputing the many personalities that individual eventually manifested. It’s possible that happened again in this case. Schreiber tells how she finally won the right to interview Kallinger in prison, and that he came to enjoy and rely on their association. She said he remembered more about his actions and motives as their interview sessions progressed. Some readers might suspect that Kallinger was becoming a sort of Scheherazade, “remembering” more and more in order to keep a good story going and to insure Schreiber’s continued visits.The possibility that Kallinger might to some degree have been leading Schreiber on is reinforced by contradictions that emerge in his narrative of himself. On the one hand, he says he believed his parents were omniscient, able to see through walls, able to divine all his intentions and deeds. But then shortly after that, he says he realized his parents were afraid of him, but he didn’t know why. He was sure they couldn’t know that he had lured a little boy into the woods.Then Schreiber sprinkles the account with some rather rickety Freudian analysis. There’s some questionable dream interpretation and some intrusive reference to Jung’s theory of “racially inherited psychic materials.”This is a fairly exhaustive, depressing account. Despite its length though, there were areas I wish Schreiber would have explored further. While some mention is made of the physical problems Kallinger might have been suffering from, she attributes most of his aberrant behavior to the misdeeds of his adoptive parents. I wish Schreiber might have considered the possibility that he was suffering from some form of Tourette’s Syndrome - and various physical imbalances resulting from the glue fumes he inhaled in connection with his cobbler’s trade. I also wish Schreiber would have gone into more detail about Kallinger’s trials. Why was he given such mild punishment for the fires he set in order to collect insurance? Finally, I wish Schreiber would have more fully examined the relationship between Kallinger and his son Michael. The latter is represented as being even more vicious and depraved than his father, so the reader is left wondering why his complicity in the crimes was so largely ignored.I’m not really sure I learned anything about the psychology of deranged killers in general from this book, but then that behavior remains a mystery through all analyses and accounts. Bill James, the author of “Popular Crime,” a compendium of accounts of notorious crimes and books written about them – says this was the most terrifying of all the true crime books he’d ever read. With the several detours “Shoemaker” takes into pop psychology, it didn’t quite strike me that way. However, the chapter describing Kallinger’s most inexplicable murder does brand a truly sad, searing image in the reader’s mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAJMBG9GVST9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671226525#wasThisHelpful","R1AAJMBG9GVST9","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This makes for an attractive, eye-catching little piece of jewelry. It's a good conversation piece, and is especially fun for creating a campy, retro look. It keeps good time, even including a second hand. It's easy to set, using just a single, old-fashioned pull-out knob. There are no complicated series of buttons you have to push to set the time, like opening a top-level security vault. What a relief!The back of the watch face itself seems to be the button battery that operates the watch. It uses one of the larger, 3/4-inch button batteries, but the battery's number doesn't appear here.There are two barely discernible brazed-down sections on the battery that can possibly serve as places to wedge the battery out when it needs replacing. I'm not sure that this will be possible though. I haven't tried removing the battery for changing yet, and my unit didn't come with any instructions. However, it looks as if it will be a long time before the battery will run down, so it's likely I won't be facing the problem any time soon.The watch band is expandable, designed to fit a wide range of finger sizes, although it looks as if this style ring I bought might fall off the fingers of very thin people.The only down-side to this finger-style of watch is that it is not quite as comfortable as I thought it would be. You more often apply pressure to your fingers than you do to your wrist. For example, when driving, I find I'm applying continuous pressure to that finger, so the watch begins to cut into my flesh and feel a bit of a nuisance.

"I’d hate to turn this very interesting book into a chore, but, like me, you might find it useful to take notes as you read. There’s so much packed in here that I found I hadn’t appreciated on the first read-through, but that I was able to think about more when I reviewed my notes. (What was it again that James said about the significance of the proximity of several intersecting public transit lines to the series of “Boston Strangler” murders?)The book’s title is a little misleading in that it tries to provide a sociological justification for people’s interest in the topic of popular crime. But that needlessly inflates the subject. The real heart of this book is simply author Bill James’ perceptive account of crimes that have made the news over the centuries. Most of the crimes are presented in chronological order, starting with the presumed abduction of Elizabeth Canning in 1753, and going through the more recent O.J. Simpson and Scott Peterson cases.The author gives just a thumbnail account of some crimes. But he really excels when he pauses to analyze a crime and express his opinion on the probability of different people’s guilt. His chatty, avuncular style draws you in around the fireside to consider who really “done it.” He demonstrates how far common sense and observation can take a person in solving a puzzle.The Sam Shepherd case is a prime example of his ability to analytically re-enact. He puts readers in the shoes of any likely perpetrator as that individual would have had to navigate right past the couch where Sam Shepherd was presumably sleeping, and make his way up the stairs to Mrs. Shepherd’s bedroom in the dark.Moving on to the Kennedy assassination, James has become convinced of the correctness of a novel interpretation of the crime – one that posits neither a conspiracy nor Lee Harvey Oswald’s exclusive responsibility. How can it be neither one nor the other? James thinks he knows.The one analysis of his that didn’t much convince me was the one dealing with the Lizzie Borden case. James says the solution proposed in the Elizabeth Montgomery movie would have been too unthinkably shocking for the day. Well, I don’t know about that. Shocking, yes – but perhaps not unthinkable. Still, his examination of the different possibilities is enlightening.By reviewing all these crimes of the centuries, the reader will learn a lot of history. Just as you learn more in a museum if you go there with some focusing questions rather than with only an intention of wandering aimlessly through the thousands of artifacts – so you can learn more about history by examining these key crime questions than you can by simply attacking an exhaustive narrative of names, dates, and events. James’ analysis of the kind of crimes characteristic of the Civil War is especially telling. He puts our current presumably “high” crime rate in perspective.He also paints an engrossing picture of the early part of the 20th century, the rise of the labor movement, the rise of the anarchist and Communist movements, and the consequent epidemic fear of certain kinds of “terrorist” crimes. He cites the strict immigration laws that followed in the wake of the Sacco and Vanzetti trial. These restrictions led to a sudden, severe contraction of the labor pool and, in James’ view, contributed to the Depression.That the Depression might, in part, have been caused by too few available laborers, is a unique historical view. But it’s characteristic of James’ often offbeat, but compelling homespun wisdom about causes and effects.His delineation of the likely biography of “The Killer of Kingsbury Row” in Cleveland in the 1930’s is a stunning model of profiling. James is truly Sherlockian in his projection of the killer’s probable military career (right down to what unit he might have served in), his prison record, marital status, and neighborhood of residence. Any reader willing to spend a little time on “Ancestry.com” should be able to come up with a name. James is similarly keenly perceptive as he walks us through some aspects of the Zodiac and the Jon-Benet Ramsey cases.The book includes a very helpful bibliography and filmography, with James’ rating of the usefulness of the various treatments.Overall, this book proved to be a real find - an outstanding addition to my true crime collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R168U36HGL0SZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=141655274X#wasThisHelpful","R168U36HGL0SZD","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This pendant is pretty, but very delicate in every way. Its chain and clasp have not broken, however, I have difficulty trusting them. I think I will buy a new chain for it - one that's sturdier and a little longer.Also, the pendant itself is so slender that it's difficult to tell it has a Mobius strip twist in it. You have to come up close and examine the pendant in order to appreciate that it's really a topological oddity. For all intents and purposes, people looking at me think I'm just wearing a ring on a chain.If I had it to do over, I think I would buy a Mobius pendant that's a little thicker and wider - so that its twist would be evident from more of a distance.

"This couch exactly filled the bill for me. It is very comfortable, exactly the right firmness for my taste. I like the pillow arms-rests. They allow a person to stretch out and use the couch to sleep on without getting a sore neck.The couch was easy to assemble. You just slide the back cushions into their tracks. No nails or screws required. It took less than 30 seconds for me to complete the assembly. This couch is exactly the same size and style as the couch I'm replacing it with - except for the fact of those back cushions being separate. That's a good idea because if they should ever rip (as they are likely to do eventually with the heavy use I give my couch) - they can be re-upholstered individually, without the entire couch always having to be transported to an upholstery shop.The two ends of the couch do double duty as recliners. I find that I can pretty much bank the couch up to my wall, and still use the recliner feature. When you pull a recliner lever, the cushioning slides forward, away from the wall. So you don't have to use up a lot of room in your living quarters keeping the couch away from the wall.Note though that these end recliners do NOT have a vibrating massage feature, as many similarly designed couches do. You're getting a basic couch/recliner here without any needless frills. After shopping around for similarly designed couches - I decided on buying this one because it seemed by far the best value for the money. That has turned out to be correct.The delivery people were right on time, arriving exactly when they said they would.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IE6I8B2EHUOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OITRC2#wasThisHelpful","R1IE6I8B2EHUOB","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stand-up comedian paints pictures on larger canvasses, rather than just delivering a splash of one-liners. He really lets you live his trials and tribulations, for example on his farm – a deer-hunting poseur – a tractor-riding dandy. He’s a raffish version of the sort of storyteller that Woody Allen started his stand-up career as, on venues such as “The Ed Sullivan Show.”Hastings has a compelling genius for the art of stand-up comedy, and I hope he makes more DVD’s. The only reason I’m giving this performance 4-stars rather than 5 is that there’s a certain mean-spiritedness that runs through Hastings’ narratives that damped my enthusiasm for him just a little. He’s especially derogatory about his girlfriends. However, he does sort of soften that attack persona with moments of sly, self-deprecating self-awareness. He mentions the string of problematic girlfriends he’s had – virtually a dozen whackos in succession - and in mock beleaguerment he asks the audience, “What are the odds?”On the whole though, you’ll find a transport of hilarity here. But with Hastings’ graphic examination of topics such as the effects of Viagra and certain love-making techniques – this is not necessarily for the whole family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AYPOYZCVP5QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014Z4OLG#wasThisHelpful","R3AYPOYZCVP5QF","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-researched, temperate account of how various modern fundamentalist Islamic movements coalesced under different leaders and became juggernauts moving toward various bombing attacks and finally – 9/11.If you often just listen to the news casually, as background “Newsack,” you might not really understand the difference between such groups as Hamas, al Jihad, al-Qaeda, and the Taliban. This book distinguishes those groups by region, history, and leadership so that readers can approach currently unfolding news stories more intelligently.“Looming Tower” starts in the early1950’s with Egyptian Sayyid Qutb, telling how his ultimate martyrdom gave impetus to much of modern terrorist activity. Wright proceeds through the formation of the Taliban in the wake of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and on to bin Laden’s activities under the al-Qaeda banner. He tells how the latter became in effect, “a death-cult.” Enough biographical information is given about each of these leaders to convey a sense of who they were in their personal lives – of the frequent disjunction between what they did publicly and how they lived privately. There isn’t a huge amount of psychological analysis of how presumably religious people arrived at the point of justifying mass murder and suicide, but Wright does provide some insights into the process of transformation away from simple, often happy childhood days.This book is written in straight-forward reportorial style. But it includes enough telling metaphor to graphically illustrate many points. For example, Wright tells how some factions fell away from having a centralized leadership and instead organized themselves into cells. This gave them a “spongy quality, clandestine, hard to combat.” With that one word “spongy,” Wright conveys the difficulty that U.S. and allied military forces have been up against.The narrative includes some really surprising details about how Western and Middle Eastern cultures can differ in their interpretation of events. I had no idea how the Monica Lewinsky/President Clinton scandal was interpreted by many in the Middle East – and how it served to fuel further terrorist activity. Wright also tells of other instances where our failure to speak the language and realize cultural differences led to serious diplomatic and military miscalculations.The last third of the book moves quickly, almost too quickly, towards 9/11. A lot of it is told from the perspective of FBI investigator John O’Neill. There isn’t quite the measured detail here that there is the first part of the book. I felt a little hurried along. Of course, events themselves were rapidly sweeping towards the terrorists’ fearful culmination. But I would have liked to have known somewhat more about how vital information that might have forewarned us got lost in the jostling egos of FBI and CIA operatives. Well, more detail on that score might have made this book too long and was perhaps better saved for separate books.“Looming Tower” was first published in 2006, and includes an “Afterword” written in 2011. In that afterword, Wright expresses some optimism that a partial, peaceful resolution might be possible – an optimism that unfortunately doesn’t seem justified in light of recent developments.There’s a map at the front of the book showing Middle East countries’ relationships to each other, and the location of key bases of activity. Wright also provides a list of “Principal Characters” at the back of the book, reminding the reader who’s who. Despite the many names in this book, I found that I didn’t often have to refer back to that reference section. Wright provides such a clear, chronological account, it was easy to keep track of the key players.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EJAXCOHE34D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400030846#wasThisHelpful","R24EJAXCOHE34D","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a mean macho-man’s fantasy of the world. The villain is the ultimate misogynist as he goes about his savage, twisted killings. But the people who track him are also, in their way, misogynists. The person who comes closest to being the hero of this novel says he wanted to be around power. And women, being powerless, “held little interest for him – beyond momentary pleasure.”Women hardly play any part in the proceedings, except as the victims of brutal dismemberment or as mistresses expected to be endlessly inventive in bed. They aren’t even granted the status that Mickey Spillane gave his women as “babes” and “dolls.”So this novel wouldn’t ordinarily have been the kind of fiction I’d gravitate to, since I’m usually more drawn to the Miss Marple genre. However, this book initially attracted my attention, and then held it, for several reasons.First and foremost, it presents an excellent account of the Caryl Chessman case, which came to a head in 1960 when Chessman was executed after twelve years of fighting his conviction on kidnapping/robbery charges. As a child, I had gotten swept up in the mania to “Save Caryl Chessman.” After reading Chessman’s book “Cell 2455, Death Row,” I’d been fairly sure, despite his protestations, that he was in fact guilty of being the Red Light Bandit. But I thought the invocation of the technicality that made him subject to the death penalty was highly unjust, harkening back, as it did, to fears that had been generated by the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. In its early sections, this book reads almost like a “Frontline” documentary, as the circumstances of Chessman’s life, crimes, and conviction, are reviewed. I learned things about the case I’d never known, despite all the follow-up reading I’d done over the years.Author Stevens imaginatively weaves the real-life details of the Chessman case into the fictional lives of his characters. He starts with a compelling premise. Indeed, what might the lives and psychologies of the children of rape be like? You hardly ever see that question treated in fact or fiction.Second, this book held my interest with enough interesting turns-of-phrase. The writing isn’t fancy, but it definitely rises above the level of pulp fiction’s usual reliance on naked verbs and interjections. The author has his killer reflecting how “with invisibility would come invincibility.” In describing the kind of physical abuse the killer had suffered as a child at the hands of his mother, the author refers to “frenzy-flushed, pain-pleased bodies.” There’s insight into the kind of pathology that abuse breeds there. There are also thrusts of sly humor here and there. “I have lots of opinions, but I don’t necessarily agree with them.”Third, after the more expository nature of the first part of the book, the author falls into a rhythm of quick-cut narrative. We get a paragraph describing what the completely self-involved politician does – then a paragraph describing the killer’s plans – then a paragraph about the journalist’s latest surmise. At first I thought this technique was sort of distracting and fragmenting. But after a short time, I began to appreciate the quick slicing movement. This approach produced a tightly-woven tapestry of evil intent, with something immanent and dreadful catching the eye at every turn.Stevens does strike a few false notes along the way. For one thing, I didn’t find the killer’s psychology or his fantasies completely convincing. Then there were a few technical errors, which probably weren’t actual errors at all back in the 1970’s when this book was written. For example, Stevens repeatedly describes his killer as being a “mass murderer.” Actually, modern nomenclature would insist that he was a “serial killer.” The former, like Richard Speck, kill a number of people all at once, while serial killers, like John Wayne Gacy, kill sequentially over a period of months or years.Overall, this book will likely hold your interest, even if your taste generally runs to the cozies. You get some good, solid historical accounts of crime – plus action, gore, and finally, even a touching moment of humanity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRUYRM93M896/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1556526628#wasThisHelpful","RKRUYRM93M896","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’d always been a Christie fan, but this book made me even more of an admirer. I’d thought that Christie was good for clever plot twists, but not really a very good writer in general. This book of short stories changed my mind. I was amazed at how creatively Christie limns the characters in her stories in just a few short sentences – how she involves you in their fates from the first page.For example in her Miss Marple story entitled “Sanctuary,” readers are immediately able to picture the vicar’s wife as Christie describes her coming “round the corner of the Vicarage with her arms full of chrysanthemums. A good deal of rich garden soil was attached to her strong brogue shoes and a few fragments were adhering to her nose, but of that fact she was perfectly unconscious. Christened by her optimistic parents Diana, (she) had become Bunch at an early age for somewhat obvious reasons and the name had stuck to her ever since.”Such telling detail allows readers to effortlessly know and identify with so many of Christie’s characters. The only minor splinter in this capacity to evoke person and place is Christie’s slight tendency to the anti-feminism, and in some cases, to the racial stereotypes of her time. Her depiction of Bunch aside, so many of Christie’s female characters are judged solely for their ability to fight the good fight against aging. They are appraised and praised for maintaining an elegant handsomeness by dint of obvious special effort. When they finally slip over the dividing line into agedness (which is often considered to be past 50 in those years when Christie was writing, before 70 became the new 50), the women are often likened to elder cats in one form or another, inauspiciously curled in coziness before their fireplaces.But that sort of occasional indifference aside, Christie usually proves herself to be a keen observer of human character, and to appreciate characters who are themselves observers of the human pageant. The four protagonists of the four sections of this book are all successful because of their ability to sit back and creatively let the hurly-burly of other lives pass them by. The four non-movers and non-shakers presented here are Parker Pyne, Mr Satterthwaite (whose observations are catalyzed by the mysterious Harley Quin), Hercule Poirot, and Miss Marple.Parker Pyne was fairly new to me as one of Christie’s continuing featured characters. He is not so much a crime-solver as a life-solver. He is a mild-mannered actuarial who uses his knowledge of probabilities to bring happiness to people. His clients come to him as a result of his newspaper ads promising to lift people out of their dilemmas and doldrums. He has a few key operatives who do this by bringing romance and adventure to the clients in a way that is not always completely manufactured. I couldn’t help but think as I read this large section of stories that they might make a good basis for a TV series. The idea might also inspire readers interested in starting their own businesses. Mr. Pyne’s methods of bringing some measure of happiness to people could be replicated by ambitious and caring entrepreneurs.Overall, there is a compelling realism to the solutions wrought by all of Christie’s slightly surreal characters. Every character and almost every story presented here will draw you into the picture from the start. These interesting bystanders draw their powers from being so engagingly disengaged. They might encourage all of us to step back sometimes and become quiet observers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ECHTH0TGZ1V9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312349386#wasThisHelpful","R2ECHTH0TGZ1V9","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good premise that this movie starts with gets buried by pretentious surrealism. The actors move wordlessly through the vaguely futuristic suburbs of Toronto, estranged from their landscape and from each other. I kept wanting to yell at them, ""Say something! Don't Act! Interact!"" But it doesn't happen.In the bonus ""Making of"" feature on this DVD, the movie's director said that, like all good directors, he completely disregarded the book that this material was based on. He made it anew. In a way, I understand what he meant. Material has to be completely re-imagined to work in another medium. But although I haven't read the award-winning book this film was based on, I believe it has to be better than what got translated onto the screen.I also objected to the roles played by the three women here. Again in that ""Making of"" bonus feature, the actresses playing these roles praised their characters as being strong, determined women. I couldn't see that at all. Each of these women was given only a handful of words to say. Other than that, they were generally just left to themselves float in worried, estranged silence through their scenes. Most of the time, they were mannequins in service to whatever was the tacit need of the men in their lives.There is some puzzlement here that challenges the viewer, as all surrealistic images tend to do. But I would have liked more of the artful, less of the artsy. Unless you are a fan of art-house film, you might not want to gamble on this. You might not want to double-down - but simply fold.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144GJ807A1MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKM5MIA#wasThisHelpful","R144GJ807A1MX","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection of Skinner’s essays was published in England during WWII. The person writing its forward defends its seeming frivolity by pointing out that such humor about our everyday frustrations could not have found an audience in Germany at the time – that the author of any such material centered on gentle bemusement would have been considered a dangerous defector from rigid, purposeful adherence to The Cause. That is true. This kind of humor would be considered an alien insurgent by any tyranny.But this Seinfeld-esque humor about nothing really needs no defense.  All these little bafflements are the stuff of our human condition, and Skinner writes about them with rare wit and with an antic, acrobatic vocabulary. We can all identify with her hilarious discomfitures over everyday nothings such as finding a vase for some cut flowers, making a trip to the bank, or trying to find floor space to exercise in a hotel room. But along the way, Skinner punctures pomposity and pretense. She notes how media ads selling soap always refer to how the product will “cleanse” –not simply to the fact that it will “clean.”There’s also more serious social commentary that runs as undertow through her observations. An example of the way Skinner combines the trifle and the insightful can be found in her essay on “The Business Party.” She tells what a chore it is for everyone concerned when it becomes necessary to entertain her husband’s out-of-town business associates. They take the couple dining, dancing, and then to a nightclub. A disaffected, hectic waiter sets up an extra table for them at the last stop of the evening. As a result, the visiting couple partially jut out onto the dance floor and fall prey to “every passing fanny.” But on the serious side of this picture-painting word-play, readers come to understand how empty this whole exercise is, and how we all repeatedly get roped into doing things that we don’t enjoy and that have no real meaning.There are facets of Skinner’s comments that will strike readers as being very antique. She makes references to personalities whose names were bruited about in the 1920-1940’s, but whom hardly anyone knows today. In addition, she makes any number of references to Greek Gods and movers-and-shakers in ancient history. This reflects the classical education that school children got in Skinner’s time. But hardly anyone today will readily be able to grasp her allusion to the “Gracchi” movement of ancient Rome.Some of Skinner’s opinions also fly in the face of our modern views. For example, Skinner says she does NOT regard herself as the equal of men, does not want to do men’s work, and in fact would just as soon not have been granted the vote. But then in the next sentence, her comments fall right in step with discussions on today’s talk show. For example, she says how books on “How To Be Happy” always make her feel sad, with their fatuous enjoinments to repeat some simple sentences such as “I am happy today; I am getting better in every way.”The illustrations in this slim volume are by both Alajalov and Soglow. Their subjects’ looks of baffled surmise add comic chirps to the proceedings.However be aware – most of the essays included here are also included in other Skinner collections. On the whole, I found this “Popcorn” to be the most inclusive collection of her articles, so if you plan to get just one of her volumes – this might be the one.For reference, these are the essays included here:The Defense of Long island; Excuse It, Please; The Body Beautiful; The Skin-Game; This Up-Lift Stuff; Yoga Attempted; The Paintable Type; Breaking the Ice; Horse Shows; Hoo-Rah; On Riding; On Skating; On Dancing; Floral Piece; Vaulting ambition; Municipal Efficiency; Med to Mum; It’s a Wise parent; Youth’s Furnishings; God Rest You Merry; Business Party; The Captain’s Table; The Importance of cocktails; The Wrong Party; Room Service; In Quest of Tea; Seeing Stars; Auld Acquaintances; Allow Me, Madame; Pour le Sport; Bonny Boating Weather; Great guns; Wednesday Matinee; I Saw Your Father in Kismet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28H9DUZIKBWES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007J8Z6U#wasThisHelpful","R28H9DUZIKBWES","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author/cat-woman Alex Matthews presents a decent murder mystery in these pages. But the book is primarily interesting because of its Chicagoland settings and because of the way it shows its heroine psychologist/social worker dealing with the problem of feral cats. The Chicagoland settings include a peek inside the process of visiting a prisoner inside the County’s main jail on the South Side of Chicago.The theme of feral cats has the series’ ongoing protagonist Cassidy McCabe having to relocate a colony of outdoor cats after their guardian is murdered and a neighborhood resident threatens to shoot the animals. Had the presence of the cats made the man angry enough to commit murder?This topic drew me into the story right away because I was at that moment myself in the throes of having to get a colony of feral cats off the streets after a neighbor’s complaints. “Cat’s Claw” was written in 2000, before Chicago’s official catch-and-release program was in place, authorizing guardian individuals to trap alley cats - spay/neuter them – then release them back into their old neighborhoods to go on rat patrol. So Cassidy doesn’t specifically go through those steps. But she deals with the problem in parallel ways.Matthews uses the same italics technique here that she uses in other books in her Cassidy McCabe series. Most of the book describes Cassidy’s actions from an objective, non-italicized point of view. But then when the reader is allowed to eavesdrop on Cassidy’s brain chatter, the text switches into italics. I usually found this to be a good technique. It eliminates the author’s having to repeatedly write, “Cassidy thought…” or “I thought…” However, this volume might contain a little too much of that offset interior monologue, and, in any case, Cassidy’s thoughts usually aren’t very interesting.Another possibly distracting/detracting element in this story is its subplot involving Cassidy’s husband and the strain his undercover reporting work puts on their marriage. The personality transformation that Zach goes through as a result of his work, and Cassidy’s concerns about this estrangement, might strike some readers as being a little unrealistic.But with the Chicagoland settings, the problem of dealing with feral cats, and the problem of angry neighbors – most readers will probably find something they can identify with on these pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2IICRSQY8LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1890768359#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2IICRSQY8LE","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book might almost have been written as an entry in the “For Dummies” series. It approaches the subjects of music notation, music terminology, instrumentation, and the overall way in which music produces its effects, on a very basic level. It consists of easy sentences step-laddered to painlessly raise you up to a better understanding. The author peppers the book with snappy humor. His wry word play makes what can be an esoteric subject to those without any training enjoyably accessible. He starts by saying, “Enough of the preamble, let’s get on with the amble.” And so it goes.Powell uses a number of apt analogies to illustrate some general ideas about the nature of scales and keys. For example, he likens a scale to the whole group of players a coach might have available to play football. But the key that a composer selects for a piece is like the specific team that a coach fields for a game. The captain of that team can be changed in the middle of the game, or players can be fielded in different positions, resulting in different styles of play during the game.I still found myself occasionally confusing scales, octaves, and keys, as I read along. And Powell’s explanation of “equal temperament” as the best method of tuning instruments remained a little obscure to me. But for the most part, I was amazed at how much information was packed into his simple sentences – and how many of my questions about the ways in which music is constructed got answered.Powell also shatters a few myths along the way. He challenges the general feeling that vinyl sounds better, warmer than music reproduced on CD’s – and the feeling that music written in a major key is always cheerful and confident sounding, while music written in a minor key must always be sad and pensive.This book comes with a bonus. There’s a 35-minute CD tucked onto its back cover. This CD presents an audio illustration of some of the points Powell makes in the text. For example, he shows how you can vary the timbre of your guitar-playing by varying where you pluck the strings of the guitar – nearer the neck or nearer the bridge.Finally, this book might inspire a reader to become more actively involved in producing music herself or himself. Powell says that anyone can write a pop tune, a process that’s always been a mystery to me. He tells how to sit yourself down in front of a piano – and do it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9V2N9X0HESK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AHXD0S#wasThisHelpful","R1B9V2N9X0HESK","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an eye-opening, saddening account of the plight of orcas kept in captivity primarily to serve as circus-like performers in various marine worlds. These creatures are made to suffer merely to supply us with casual entertainment.This documentary does a good job of waking us up to the pointless cruelty we’re inflicting, and the waste of life entailed. Some of the commentators on the film are former marine world trainers who quit their jobs in order to be free to speak out publicly against the abuses they now regret being party to.However, the film could have been even better. It’s a little disjointed, recounting cases here/there, then/now, in which both humans and orcas have been injured or killed as a result of the animals’ unnatural confinement.Then it misses a few chances to give viewers further insights into the nature of these “black fish.” The writers could have included some more of the kinds of details that I learned when I went whale-watching off the coast of Vancouver. For example, this documentary doesn’t explain that orcas aren’t really “whales” at all – killer or otherwise. They are actually dolphins whose current name might have been an early transposition of the term “whale killer.”Also, this documentary states that orcas have never been known to kill humans in the wild. According to the whale-watching boat captains, that’s true – but not for this documentary’s implied reason that orcas might find some intellectual sympathy with humans and recognize us as kindred spirits. Rather the boating captains believed there were no attacks in the wild because humans are simply viewed as being relatively bony slim pickings for the orcas when they have larger prey available. The whale-watching crew said that one of a wild orca’s favorite repasts would be a moose.This conjured an eerie picture in my mind. I imagined an orca slithering out of its natural watery medium, through the Canadian forests at night, sneaking up on unsuspecting ungulates. How could that happen? But no, the crew member explained that moose like to swim between the many islands off the coasts of Vancouver and Seattle – and the orcas pick them off then.Despite the fact that “Black Fish” could have included more such choice details and been a little better organized, it remains a brave and awakening must-see documentary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LDO75GAAQETL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EL6AAEU#wasThisHelpful","R1LDO75GAAQETL","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book reads like a novel, but is a true story of the man who is possibly the worst serial killer you’ve never heard about. You might not have heard of Charles Cullen because he operated subtly, in medical settings where deaths are common anyway.However, so much of the tragedy of this story lies in the fact that Cullen’s sly but deadly injections WERE noticed or at least strongly suspected. However, the fear of lawsuits and the very nature of corporate medical administration prevented his killings from being reported. This is a chronicle of how he was passed along from hospital to hospital with “neutral” or even praising recommendations. He was the proverbial hot potato being tossed from hand to hand. You might find it interesting to read a book such as “Criminal Investigative Failures” by D. Kim Rossmo in conjunction with this book, in order to get a clearer idea of how group dynamics often lead to perpetrators and their crimes being obscured or outright ignored.But any thumbnail summary of “The Good Nurse” can hardly do justice to the book. Graeber is an excellent writer who is able to suffuse his report with a dark poetry. He has a knack for the apt metaphor that puts you there, at the scene. For example, he tells how Cullen actually enjoyed the tension after each kill, how he keenly anticipated being arrested. “He enjoyed the waiting, the little death of that caesura.” That special tension made coffee taste better; gave every snap of a glove extra portent & meaning.What’s more, Graeber writes in short chapters, each one a needle injection of further derangement. Be forewarned though. The first chapters are very graphic. They deal with conditions in a burn unit where Cullen served early in his career as a nurse. While you might have known how life-threatening burns can be, you probably didn’t fully realize the sort of trauma inflicted on the body by fire.Graeber doesn’t involve himself in too much psychological speculation about Cullen’s motives. In the course of outlining Cullen’s biography, Graeber does suggest certain influences that might have been at work. Graeber also suggests that Cullen might have been killing himself by proxy. Since he was personally afraid to die, all his suicide “attempts” notwithstanding – he might have been keeping death as his familiar by killing others.All around, this is a fascinating portrait of the man who is perhaps America’s most prolific serial killer, but who fit no known psychological profiles. He was neither a classic “Angel of Mercy” nor a standard sexual sadist. His evil could not be categorized or fathomed – as is ultimately the case with most evil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R103ZQKHVWRNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446505293#wasThisHelpful","R103ZQKHVWRNM","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wright offers a daring look inside Scientology – as far inside as it is generally possible for someone not in its upper echelons to penetrate. Along the way, he provides a biography of L. Ron Hubbard which diverges significantly from the biographical history that most followers of Scientology are given to understand. He also provides a more graphic picture of the punishments that Scientology metes out to people who are perceived as having transgressed some aspect of its disciplines. Most followers though are reportedly willing to submit to these “corrections” – in order to get back into Scientology’s good graces and in order not to be a disappointment to the Hubbard role model.In footnotes that appear throughout the book, Wright indicates instances in which Scientology leaders have disagreed with or outright refuted various aspects of his reporting. In a few cases, the footnotes even go on to provide refutations of the refutations by other Scientologists. So readers don’t just get a one-sided view of what has become The Church.Much of the development of Scientology, from Hubbard’s early conception of it as a program for right-living and then on into its apotheosis as a full-blown religion, is traced through the progress through its ranks of Paul Haggis, an early convert. Haggis is introduced on the first page of the book, and this is where Wright might have made his one notable misstep in reporting. He recounts how Haggis was recruited on the streets of London, Ontario, Canada. But in recounting this initiation, Wright describes that London as being a rather bleak manufacturing town with a dying downtown. As someone who has toured London, Ontario, on several occasions – I could hardly reconcile my view of it and Wright’s description. A friend of mine who lives there also confirms that the place is actually known to be a sort of boutique tourist destination, famous for its gingerbread Victorian houses and the central park that enlivens its downtown district.I was almost put off of this whole book right at the start by this contrary view of London that Wright provides. It was a minor point, but it made me wonder if Wright wrongly characterized London to such an extent – how he might be wrongly characterizing whatever descriptions of Scientology were to follow. I’m glad I persevered though and went on to read the rest of the book. Wright’s depth of research into Scientology and his grounded, unemotional approach, convinced me of the general validity of his reporting.Wright doesn’t offer a lot of psychological analysis of how and why people become so committed to the often very illogical principles of Scientology. In one exceptional sentence he does make reference to the human need for “transcendence and submission.” He also points out that illogical doctrines are to be found at the base of almost all religions.Overall, this is an amazing view into what strange lengths people are willing to go to gain that sense of transcendence and submission.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YNQ2G4H1KWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ES2AKY2#wasThisHelpful","R2YNQ2G4H1KWV","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saks takes us along on her odyssey through schizophrenia in search of some mental equilibrium. She describes the negative thoughts that assailed her, giving her what could perhaps be termed a case of “scruples,” the diffuse feeling of being guilty of anything and everything. This guilt at times made her anorexic as she felt unworthy of even the food she might consume. She felt she could kill with her thoughts. This leads readers to the novel realization of how much these various mental conditions might be related.Saks tells how she resisted medication for a long time, feeling that she should be able to lift herself up by the bootstraps with will power alone. Finally though, she found a combination of medication and talk therapy that has generally been successful at holding her demons at bay.Her preferred form of talk therapy has been psychoanalysis, often of the Kleinian variety. She says that the ongoing insights she has garnered from the psychotherapy have been invaluable. Some of the analytical insights do seem to hit home. For example, one of her analysts pointed out that it’s often easier to feel attacked than to feel grief or envy. So we can be complicit in creating demons to wage war against us.Some readers might doubt the ability of such therapy to produce new insights almost daily over a period of decades though. But then Saks does say that the heart of her talk therapy was in the relationship with the therapist, in the routine and security of having a professional there for her through thick and thin. I would have liked her to elaborate a little more on why the close friends she had, friends whom she could call day or night, couldn’t adequately fill that role, especially since strict psychotherapists avoid encouraging any personal relationship with their clients. They remain seated behind their analysands, maintaining inscrutable poker positions. As Saks briefly explains – this is the recommended stance, in part so that the therapist can be like a screen onto which the patient projects all her own impressions. These then become the substance of what the therapist has to analyze.I would also have liked Saks to elaborate a little more on the reasons for some of the decisions she made. For example, after attending school in her native U.S., why did she decide to go to Oxford, with all the upheaval and frightening novelty that entailed? Saks doesn’t say a word on that subject, just as she doesn’t make too many outreaching observations in general. Well, that is part of the condition of schizophrenia. A schizophrenic, of necessity, is preoccupied with inner turmoil.Then just one other minor mote of dissatisfaction crossed my mind as I read this book. How could Saks have remembered so exactly the nature and chronology of all her hallucinations over the decades? I couldn’t help but think there might perhaps have been some creative reconstruction going on here.But overall, this is a valuable testament to what goes on in the mind of someone suffering from schizophrenia or related psychoses. Such testaments, as Saks herself points out, are few and far between. While individuals with other challenges, such as bi-polar disorder or even Asperger’s Syndrome, have been writing about what the world is like for them - few schizophrenics have been able to organize and exteriorize sufficiently to give others a real feel for what they are suffering. Since so many of us likely know someone who is struggling with schizophrenia, this book is relevant to just about everyone. A list of resources is included at the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B7G7BXE0AKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401309445#wasThisHelpful","R2B7G7BXE0AKA","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a long book, and unlike many of Ann Rule’s other books, it deals with only one main perpetrator. This individual is shown wreaking havoc over a period of decades, throughout an extended family. Despite the length and spread of the narrative, it held my interest. It's very well-written, putting the reader right there in the midst of this dysfunctional family dynamic.While keeping to the chronology of the family history, Rule doesn’t immediately reveal who the trouble-maker is. Also, the extent of this individual’s insidious influence only gradually unfolds. This individual’s long reach into the lives of everyone in the vicinity often isn’t made apparent until years after the fact.Rule doesn’t offer a lot of psychological analysis of the perpetrator. A sort of Munchhausen’s compulsion to garner attention at any cost is likely in play. But it’s difficult to understand other family members’ willingness to lend themselves so extensively to remedying and covering up the ensuing chaos. Perhaps it’s a personal re-enactment of the Viet Nam syndrome. Once people have invested a good deal of time and energy in a project, it’s difficult to abandon it. People become all the more committed to their efforts to bring a project or a person to some sort of fulfillment. In fact they can become all the more fond of that person for so thoroughly engaging them.So this book might serve as another warning against throwing good money after bad. Or it might more specifically serve to warn against pouring all one’s human resources into efforts to detoxify an essentially toxic person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PF43EFGUZ2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067169071X#wasThisHelpful","R22PF43EFGUZ2F","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is like a less fictional version of the 1980’s Masterpiece Theater Classic series “Brideshead Revisited.” As in that series, we have a young innocent coming onto campus and soon being captivated by a handsome, epicene upper classman. In this case, the young innocent is the real-life poet-to-be Allen Ginsberg, and the upperclassman is Lucien Carr. Like Brideshead’s Sebastian before him, Lucien Carr is shown here inciting those in his circle to exotic sensualities and sexual experimentation. Like a King Cobra, his gaze has hypnotized others before Ginsberg. But when he is through with them, they are not always ready to be through with him. That’s where the tragedy of this association of Burroughs/Kerouac/Ginsberg/Carr germinates.Some of the descendents of these founders of the Beat Generation have challenged the truthfulness of this film’s depiction. I had other problems with the movie, besides the dubious nature of some of its biography. The other problem with this film for me was that it was too fragmented and episodic. I never felt I got a chance to know or care about any of these proto-Beats. I found I was finishing watching the movie as I myself might finish a school assignment, coerced by Lucien’s magnetism into doing his homework for him. It was a bit of a chore, but I watched the film to the end in order to acquaint myself with some of the early history of this influential clique of poets, rebels, and easy riders.Flawed as it might be, this film provides a valuable clue to the lives of these creative individuals – a clue that most modern readers of their work probably never suspected existed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XJBBCMDFGA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DN3S3GY#wasThisHelpful","R25XJBBCMDFGA5","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a number of improbabilities and gaps in this plot. For one thing, I don’t think forensic voice recognition programs are nearly as precise and targeting as they are represented as being in this drama. What’s more, the ending is likely to strike viewers as being too generic and unlikely.Nevertheless, the plot set-up is gripping. I identified with the District Attorney’s dilemma from the start. In a bonus feature interview, co-star Samuel L. Jackson says that this movie project interested him because it promised to be everything he seeks when he himself goes to the movies. It promised to be entertaining, to take you out of yourself and put you directly in the plight of the characters in the movie, to challenge you afterwards to consider what YOU would have done in the same set of circumstances, and, as a bonus, to provide a sort of moral. The movie delivered for me on all those points.What’s more, there’s the added attraction of Gloria Reuben’s outstanding performance as a police detective. She does a wonderful job of showing the guarded suspicions her character has about what’s really going on. If I were guilty, I’d get chills from just her look. Her piercing gaze suggests to me that she knows – and that she knows I know she knows… Who’s going to make the next move?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JZ7QEV57VOXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGJAPYO#wasThisHelpful","R1JZ7QEV57VOXS","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The opening chapters of this book are almost too intense. They are an account of Russell Williams’ escalating crimes, one after the other. Offense piles on offense, fetish on fetish. As he creeps from sinister panty raids to murder, you might feel yourself being violated just reading this. But I believed it was important to finish the book in order to get some understanding of how such aberrations develop in people.The author of this book was a process=server who had occasion to deliver notice of a civil law suit to Williams after the Colonel had been imprisoned for the criminal aspect of his actions. So David Gibb was in a good position to assess and write about the sequence of Williams’ crimes and conviction. Unfortunately, the Canadian system of justice and Government allows numerous gag orders to persist, hindering journalists from gaining access to criminals after the fact. So Gibb wasn’t able to personally interview Williams. (However a tape of the police interrogation that led to Williams’ confession is considered a model of interview technique and is widely available, even having aired on several true crime TV shows.)The author of “Camouflaged” was also stone-walled by most of Williams’ relatives and acquaintances. Neither Williams’ wife nor his school-days girlfriends were available to be interviewed. But some summaries of the extensive photo record Williams kept of his crimes, and the journals he wrote detailing his actions, were available. However, much of Gibb’s final analysis of Williams’ devolution from respected Air Force Colonel to sexual sadist is based on FBI profiling generalizations. Gibb extensively quotes Stone’s “Anatomy of Evil,” a book I personally hadn’t found to be too enlightening in its classification of criminal types.Williams doesn’t easily fit into any of the FBI categories of types of sexual predators. But “Camouflaged” does at least offer some brief insights into how such extreme fetishes as his might develop, insights I hadn’t found in other books. Gibb also suggests how medication, mid-life crisis, and Williams’ inflating ego might have all contributed to his crossing the line from fantasy into practice. Finally, the author considers such issues as what role viewing pornography might play in such criminals behavior.Overall, this is a valuable record of the etiology of a dangerous perversity. It can also serve as a cautionary tale – warning how little we might actually know about the people we think we know – and how little we might actually know even about ourselves and our own potential for evil.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C0B1SNW9ISTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425244393#wasThisHelpful","R3C0B1SNW9ISTQ","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story has some of the qualities of a classic Russian novel, except it is shorter, more accessible, and is hardly like a school assignment. But it does have the imaginative, intricate plotting of one of those novels. We get into the minds of three of the main characters as they observe the other people around them and as they lay their plans.At first it seems as if these three lives constitute three different plots - running parallel in that their protagonists all find themselves in precarious desperation, but being otherwise essentially unrelated. However, as the story gets under way, these three lives often begin to insect in surprising ways. We begin to see the fatefulness of it all.With Rendell, the characters and the movement of the plot are primary. She writes without pretension or elaboration, except possibly when it comes to describing her characters’ clothes. Here again, as in some of her other books, she perhaps goes into a little too much detail, describing toggle buttons, Black Watch tartan skirts, polo collars, etc. These paragraphs begin to read like one of J. Peterman’s catalogues as portrayed in “Seinfeld.” But for the most part, Rendell writes fluidly.There are complex insights embedded in the simplicity of her style though. For example, she tells that Benet stuck a pin in herself in order to have “a different focus of pain.” With those few words, she gives us as good a grasp of the motive behind the practice of self-mutilation as I’ve ever read.She quotes another character’s dislike of looking in the surrounding bedroom mirrors when he makes love. She explains that “his love was here and now.” Oh, to have a partner like that!Rendell’s characters come from different strata of society, and talk differently. Each one is unique, and Rendell writes them all so believably, rather than making them all reflections of herself. In this way, she is unlike, for example Dorothy Sayers, most of whose mystery novel characters strike the same note of detached urbanity.Rendell, especially in this novel, is real, gripping, and intense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDQMV5USJESC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345312007#wasThisHelpful","RSDQMV5USJESC","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s more science than strict autobiography here. Oliver Sacks tells how all the magical certainties of science were his refuge throughout his early years when WWII and so much else was quaking the human world around him. He relished the odd smells and the fiery globules he could send rushing through the house as a result of various chemical combinations he contrived in his laundry room-become-laboratory.In the process of learning about his youthful enthusiasms, you’ll get an almost complete overview of chemistry and physics in these pages. But it won’t be the abstract, cold study you might have encountered in school. Sacks’ introduction to these disciplines is filled with his personal noticing of the little things – the way a piece of tungsten hefted in his hand, the luster on a chunk of wolframite, the way sparks could be made to arc between different metals.He includes some telling details from the biographies of various scientists he admired, ones who led the way in the experiments he was so joyously duplicating. You’ll be introduced to Hooke, Boyle, Lavoisier, Davy, and the Curies. Many of these individuals took the same kind of sensual delight in their materials that he took. Reading this made me wish I could have had a similar field of dreams, full of enchantment with the elemental things of this earth.The book isn’t all science though. Sacks does provide some intimate detail. Among his most telling reflections is his account of the cruelty he encountered in the school he was removed to in order to keep him safe from the bombings centered on London during the War. Although brief, his reflections on these experiences provide some of the best insights available into the effects of corporal punishment and bullying. He tells how he became in some ways cruel (such as to his dog) when he came home, in hopes of drawing his parents’ attention to the cruelties he himself had been suffering.This would be a good book to pass along to a young person in order to awaken them to the wonders all around them. Although the evolution of Sacks’ interests has a somewhat sad ending, any young person reading this account would be hard pressed to ever again take a bored attitude of “whatever.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UF2XME9XBSOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375704043#wasThisHelpful","R3UF2XME9XBSOF","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“Jumped” was published by Reader’s Digest United Kingdom branch, and at first I thought it was going to be too brief and basic an overview, popularized for mass consumption. But as I got further into the book, I found I was really learning new things about forensic science, and having old information clarified. What’s more, the book, with its glossy page format and color pictures, is a pleasure to read.It would be ideal for a student considering a career in forensic science or any area of crime detection. However, anyone who wants an easy overview of the field would likely enjoy reading “Jumped.” While some more professional studies such as Saferstein’s standard texts, go into a lot more detail, this book summarizes topics in a few sentences and so it lets you see the forest for the trees. I finally got a quick grasp on the difference between chromatography and spectrometry, and succinctly learned how to use toner powder to bring up underlying impressions on a piece of paper.Each chapter considers a different kind of evidence and the techniques used to analyze those clues. There are chapters on tool impressions, DNA, blood spatter, ballistics, poisons and drugs, and handwriting and voice analysis. Each chapter includes a “Day in the Life” page that tells what an expert in that specific branch of evidentiary information does on a typical day. Many of the experts who are followed here are British. There might not be quite the same categories of investigators in the U.S., but readers can still get a good idea of what assignments each kind of specialist faces on a typical day.Finally, each chapter recounts cases that were “cracked” by examining the kinds of evidence featured in that chapter. There are 50 of these cases, some all-but-forgotten ones dating back as far as the early 1800’s, but illustrative of some pioneering investigative technique. Other crimes cited are more recent and famous. Each case is dealt with in a “Just the facts, Ma’am” thumbnail of a sketch. There are no Anne Rule-style elaborations of character or motive here. But again, the paired down descriptions often allow readers to get a clearer picture of the crimes than any long drawn-out debates about them have afforded.In the ballistics chapter, the book clears away a lot of the smoke surrounding the Kennedy assassination in a few sentences. It tells what neutron activation analysis revealed about the trajectories of the two wounding bullets and about their source. It brings readers up to date on the resolution of other famous cases. What finally happened in the “Dingo Ate Your Baby” case in which the parents were charged with killing their daughter? What led the jury to their conviction of Jean Harris for killing Herman Tarnower, the Scarsdale Diet doctor? Who were Sacco and Vanzetti and what crime were they really charged with committing? What led detectives to Timothy McVeigh in the bombing of Oklahoma City’s Federal building, or to a Libyan agent in the bombing of a PanAm plane over Lockerbie, Scotland? How closely does Bruno Hauptmann’s handwriting match that of the handwriting on the ransom notes sent to Charles Lindbergh? You get to judge.Overall, this book is a keeper for anyone interested in forensics, crime detection, or a thumbnail history of some famous and some not-so-famous dastardly deeds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3Z6OTFCXWO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606520377#wasThisHelpful","RJ3Z6OTFCXWO4","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is essentially a silent film. Robert Redford is alone against the sea. He proves that he has been more than just a pretty face, delivering a tour de force performance.The film works on several levels. It can be viewed as a realistic story of the struggle to survive, teaching us how to condense potable water at sea and how to launch a life boat. But it can also be viewed as an allegory of our journey through life. There are big breaches in our days that we have to use all our ingenuity to patch. There are a few moments of breathtaking beauty, but hardly enough time to enjoy them before another huge challenge presents itself. This is a profoundly moving story on whatever level it's viewed.There are a lot of extras on this DVD, including a director/producer commentary. These commentaries are OK, but they don't really add anything to the experience of the movie. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, you can probably skip these extras, and not dilute the impact of the movie itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21R31VN89BO99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GST8U4U#wasThisHelpful","R21R31VN89BO99","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this plot seems a bit familiar to you, it might be that you’re recalling the movie “Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice."" That movie was based on this book. Also, several Alfred Hitchcock TV hours and other mystery episodes have used elements of this plot in their own story lines. But even if your earlier exposure to those other thrillers gives you an early sense of which way things might go here, this book is still very worth reading. It’s downright chilling. The printed paragraphs, in Curtiss’ hands, turn out to be more graphically frightening than any number of pictures.Revelations made on the first page might lead you to believe that this is going to proceed in the light-hearted way of “Arsenic and Old Lace.” But things get serious fast. The plot becomes a matter of dueling suspicions. The suspense builds and some of the chapters end with real shockers.What’s that scratching, scratching sound at the door? Is it the big stray dog that’s been so unshakably nosing around the property? Or is it something else?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F23PSMUCB28Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006AXYD4#wasThisHelpful","R1F23PSMUCB28Q","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book consists of short, memorable vignettes recounting the author’s life as a nurse on a sparsely populated island in the Hebrides in the 1970’s. MacLeod doesn’t have quite the same wry observational style that James Herriot had in his classic “Creatures Great and Small” series. But her writing is nonetheless excellent and evocative.Be forewarned though. These aren’t all sentimental, nostalgic pieces. There are some real shockers here. Although in one later chapter, MacLeod says there was no child abuse on these islands - that contradicts at least one or two of her earlier accounts of some terrible behavior born of superstition, a compulsive adherence to notions of propriety, and ingrown anger. These accounts, that MacLeod either witnessed herself or heard about having taken place in the not-too-distant past, recalled some paragraphs of a Sherlock Holmes tale. As Holmes and Watson are riding by train out to the countryside, Holmes reflects that big cities don’t deserve their reputation as being the exclusive breeding grounds of evil deeds. He says that there are as many, or more, heinous acts committed in remote rural areas. There in the dank isolation, people’s worst impulses can mushroom, with no one to check the growth.But for the most part, these reminiscences tell of kindness and resourcefulness. The people of MacLeod’s island (re-named in order to protect the inhabitants’ privacy) have a knack of making parties out of adversity. Inclement weather, fire, rain, and the need to transport the sick, all become occasions for rallying community spirit.After reading this, you’ll likely want to be one of the tourists who have been increasingly coming to these islands during their three short months of passable weather. But you might be disabused of any romantic notion of coming to live here to finish writing your Nobel Prize-winning novel. There were real hardships to be endured here in the 70’s, and probably there still are. The windswept beauty that Macleod describes might come to strike you as barrenness after a while.But at least for the stretch of these pages, you can warm to the malapropisms, the misdeeds, and the heartiness of these very individual inhabitants. In this place where almost everyone is “wee” and at least a little “daft,” MacLeod’s writing invites you to sit down and have a “cuppie and a clootie” (tea and a dumpling) by the fireside. (A brief glossary of Scottish colloquialisms is included at the back of the book.)Best of all, MacLeod promises more to come. She explains that she has many more reminisces of her time on the Island, and is now working on a sequel. Like me, after reading “Call the Nurse,” you’ll probably want to be in line for this second book as soon as it appears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C45GF08X0ASV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611458315#wasThisHelpful","R1C45GF08X0ASV","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This slim book contains 8 practice tests, consisting of 40 questions each, with answers included. You are asked to allot yourself 90 minutes per test. The questions are difficult. You’ll have to immerse yourself in the problems in order to finish each test on time. The book will likely leave you with a feeling of having stretched your mind, and it will give you an impetus to really concentrate on something while you try to figure out what figure comes next in a series, or what letters have to go in the blanks to form a synonym for “autochthonous.” So taking these tests can provide a refreshing relief from distraction.But I’m not sure that these tests are really representative of what you’ll find, for example, on the actual I.Q. test used to qualify you to join MENSA. I paid for and took the practice MENSA test online, and it tended to present much less knotty, obscure posers than you’ll find here. The MENSA pre-test was weighted more towards requiring an ability to recognize the orientation of simple shapes.The brief introduction to this book does acknowledge that there are different versions of standard I.Q. tests. The Stanford-Binet emphasizes verbal ability; the Wechsler has separate sections for verbal and spatial abilities. The tests in this book intersperse vocabulary questions with numeric and spatial progressions. The latter tend to be frustratingly elaborate, while the vocabulary questions seem to have a definite cultural bias. You’ll do well on the vocabulary questions if you’re an educated Victorian English gentleman. Do you know the definitions of such arcana as barouche, farandole, jabot, pomander? If not, like so many of the immigrants coming through Ellis Island in the early 1900’s, you might find yourself being falsely classified as an idiot.Nevertheless, your score will likely improve dramatically as you move through these tests and learn the little tricks of approach to the problems. Your score will likely increase more than the 6 points the authors think that you’ll be able to eke out with practice. But even if the 8th test finds you as puzzled by it all as when you started – you’ll probably enjoy the challenge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRC8AWQY3SI4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402732732#wasThisHelpful","RRC8AWQY3SI4H","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good novel, but it doesn’t quite sustain suspense in the same way some of Rendell’s other psychological novels do. There are a few stretches where it might be easy to lose interest here. It was only my trust in Rendell’s ability to track her characters through to the poignancy of their perverse dreams that kept me reading through these somewhat flat sections.Things do pick up, and by the book's end, you can appreciate how well-woven the fates of these characters are. But if you aren’t already a fan of Rendell’s, this might not be the book to launch you into enthusiasm. If you like novels of more intense psychological suspense, it might be better to start with some of her novels that will keep you taut from beginning to end, novels such as ""the Killing Doll"" or ""A Demon in My View.""  Then you can come to this novel on a lower key later.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PX5NDP7IMPHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553134566#wasThisHelpful","R2PX5NDP7IMPHA","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brilliant novel that will keep you on edge from the first page. Rendell once again gets inside the heads of people who are spiraling down into madness.  I had thought that, after reading her “A Demon in My View,” I had read her definitive effort at leading us into the dark basement of derangement. But with this 1985 novel, I discovered a surpassing probe into the lives of people slipping from whatever precarious hold they had on reality.Rendell’s specialty is this sort of exploration into what it’s like to lose one’s footing. She lets readers inhabit the lonely existences of these characters for a while, as they try to reassure themselves by running their fingers along the blades of the protective knives they keep in their pockets. But amazingly, Rendell doesn’t repeat herself. Each one of her featured characters in these noir psychological novels loses touch with reality in his or her own particular way. Each one is set spinning along some very personal trajectory that’s believable, and fateful. It’s never a standardized schizophrenia that drives these individuals.The characters in “The Killing Doll” are memorable for the very special, and deadly, twist their perceptions take.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29USVKDZF8AM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099399504#wasThisHelpful","R29USVKDZF8AM8","A387BD735MI50R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A387BD735MI50R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very realistic and goes very fast! My daughter wanted a fire truck that looked real that she could play with. She was amazed when we showed her this one.

"This is a great bag at a great price.The fabric is thick and very durable. The leather shoulder pad is a nice touch and makes it comfortable to wear. The large flap and the small pockets have velcro closures and the main compartment has a zipper closure. The zipper closure is great as most messenger bags don't have this feature. They just leave the main compartment open. I tend to lay my bag down on the floor of the car when I am driving and with other messenger bags my stuff would just slide out. At least now I know I don't have to search my car to find what I put in my bag. I like the zippered pocket on the back side too. Great for storing quick grab items like your phones or keys.

"I am very glad I was given the opportunity to receive this eyeglass holder at no charge in return for my honest review. This product has a sturdy base so it won't tip or fall over when you put your glasses in it. The inside is lined with a soft fabric that will not scratch or harm your glasses. It looks nice as well. I have been wearing glasses for over 20 years and I have never owned an eyeglass holder. I am not sure why this idea didn't come to me sooner but I love it. Now I don't worry about putting my glasses lens down on accident and getting the lenses all scratched up. I am putting this one in my bedroom on my nightstand as the only time I really take my glasses off is when I go to bed.

"I love products that have multiple uses. Not only is this a cool mist humidifier but I can also use it as a nightlight and an oil diffuser.As a cool mist humidifier it works great. Once you turn it on you can see the mist coming out of the unit. When the water runs out the humidifier will shut itself off but the nightlight will continue to stay on (if you had it on in the first place). With a full tank we have had it last through the night (almost 12 hours) at a low setting. On a higher setting it lasts about 7-8 hours.As a nightlight it is awesome. You can use the nightlight feature without turning the humidifier on. It has a separate switch just for the nightlight. Press it once and it cycles through all 7 colors. Press it again (7 times) and it will cycle through each color. Press it again (8 times) and it will turn off. My 6-year-old daughter loves the nightlight. Each night she goes through and either chooses rainbow or a specific color to light up her room while she sleeps.As an oil diffuser...to use the oil diffuser feature the humidifier has to be running. There is a small drawer on the bottom of the unit that you pull out. It has a small aroma diffusion sponge. The unit also comes with 5 extra sponges. Soak the sponge with your favorite oil then slide the drawer back into place. Turn the humidifier on and you can immediately smell the oil. I use the oil diffuser feature when my daughter is sick. Works like a charm.Overall, I love this product. It works great. I haven't had any issues.

"The bag I received did not have the clear plastic pouch to put pictures in. Mine had black wording on it that said ""Velocity Boxing"". The air pump that it comes with is very small. I started to use it to inflate the punching bag but realized about 15 minutes in that it would take too long. I then used my husband's air compressor which filled it up within seconds. It has a small opening on the bottom with a plastic cap where you can add sand to it to make it stand up right. I think it would be better if there was a zippered compartment where you could add sandbags or heavy items.My daughter loves this thing. She doesn't care that it does not pop back up. I am worried that if we fill it with sand or water it might leak or pop open in the house. She throws it around, jumps on it and basically uses it like a punching bag.

"Great to use when you will be sitting for long periods of time or when the chair or surface you are sitting on has no cushion. The cushion is a lot larger than I thought it would be but it works.

"This is a very nice ceramic knife set with sheaths which I love because you don't have to worry about cutting/hurting yourself on open knives in drawers. The wood handles have a nice feeling to them in your hand but in some spots its a little splitery. The blades are a decent thickness with a good weight to them and sharp enough to cut fruits and veggies like butter. I like that it comes with a variety of them and it has a chart that tells you what each knife is called and what it is best for. Make sure to be careful with these knives though, do not toss them, especially in the sink as they could break or snap at the tip. Also don't stick them in the dishwasher as you don't want to ruin them or the handles.  I really like that with ceramic you don't have to worry about your lettuce turning brown as fast the way you do with metal saving my lettuce a few extra days.

"This is a pretty nice and big be blanket, that could be also used as a camping blanket or to keep in the back of the car for going to the park and such. Its a soft tent like material so its comfortable to lay on and super easy to shake off all the sand or grass to put back into the bag. The bag is attached to it so you will always have it with you and you can even fill it up with things you need while the blanket is out. There is also another pocket on the other side that snaps closed with 3 snaps and the four pouches around the edges can be filled with rocks to keep it down and from moving around. I really like how you don't have to roll the blanket up or try to fold it a certain way, you just shove it back in the bag a little at a time and it all fits just the same as when it showed up. You can hook it to your beach bag or camping gear to take with you by the latching strap attached to the bag and since its light weight you won't even notice your carrying it.Sample provided in exchange for my honest, unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13620CRSY9YB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146667AK#wasThisHelpful","R13620CRSY9YB2","A2Q24QWFA47FO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q24QWFA47FO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:24 MinsI love all these cute little baby toys. They are so adorable and fun for babies and toddlers. When baby pushes the buttons on the horn it makes noise and it does when baby blows into it as well. The candy is my favorite, its just so cute and makes clicking sounds when baby turns each of the spinning pieces. They all make rattle sounds when baby shakes each of them and the weird shape one is even a teether.

Some of the stitching in spots isn't fully all the way so if you want to give them to babies make sure to go through them and tighten up all the stitches so they don't come apart and stuffing falls out.

Its so simple to use by putting the grinds into the top, attaching the handle and spin it a few times ( that's the fun part ) then the grinds come out the bottom with you can see through the little window on the bottom. You get a nifty little brush to get everything out of the grinder to keep it clean and in tip top shape for your next cup of coffee.

Its really cute in the green and white color and I like how it seems durable. The blue light in the front turns on when you got it plugged and you just use two regular USB cords to charge two devices at once.

" 1:06 MinsThis is the coolest little security camera and could even be used as a baby monitor or nanny cam if needed. It is simple to set up with the little cd and cable provided and only takes a few minutes before you can start seeing/using your camera. To set it up on the wireless takes a little more time, but after you get that done you can move it to any location in your house with no limits other then the short power cord. I love how you can operate it from your phone or computer and how you can move it around to check every angle in the room. It comes with a nifty little holder that screws into the bottom of the pipcam and you can screw it to the wall over your front door or where you decide you want to hang it to get the best view. It has a speaker on the side which is a pretty nifty feature so you can tell the kids to stay out of the cookie jar, let someone know you are watching them and to nicely put the TV back before the cops arrive or even to tell your doggies to get out of the trash (as if they will listen)Pros: Easy to set up and operate Wireless Extra comfort knowing you can monitor your house from any location by phone or computer Compact size Clear pictureCons: Power cord is a little short.Sample provided at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FT57YALJXZXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017DT0MJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3FT57YALJXZXO","A2Q24QWFA47FO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q24QWFA47FO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The 3 pieces fit perfectly inside the pocket of a diaper bag so you know where they are at all times and they can even be every where baby is at all times. The little clippers are surrounded by a yellow plastic and when you flip the top to use it, they have a non slip top so you have more control over them then standard ones. The tweezers are a thin plastic that really helps to get little boogies out of little noses, fast and easy. Especially when baby is sleeping. The scissors have a good feel to them in your hand and are my favorite to use on itty bitty fingers because I feel they are easier to control and get the curves so your not leaving sharp edges on their little nails.

"This is a good book to read if you want to relax or before going to bed. It starts out with a lot of good hope and at times its pretty funny. It is a lot like listening to one of your best mates tell a story so at times it can seem a little ramble and at other times your right there waiting to see what happens next. It carries on for a while so you kind of get attached to the characters. I found myself wanting to hang out with Harvey and waiting for the Walter (the cat) to speak again. The writer has a great imagination and knows how to tell a story good, but could do with a little better editing. Looking forward to future reads by this author as he grows.

The waffle cookie heart maker thing is super cute and silicon so you can just put it on top of the pan if you wanted to make individual waffles or heart shape cookies.

" 0:42 MinsI was really excited to get this sleep mask since my schedule has me up late nights, I tend to sleep a lot during the day time. The first thing I noticed about the mask was how soft it was, so I went to put it on and noticed it was a little to big for me. No problem, it has a velcro strap on the back that lets you adjust to the right size you need. Once you get it to the right adjustment for you, there is NO light coming through at all. They are completely blacked out and fit so comfortable you instantly are ready for your snooze. The one thing I didn't like was it didn't stay on while sleeping so when I woke up from the sun I had to find them on my bed and put them back on, even at the tightest fit on the velcro strap. The material is like a double padded bra that is heat sealed together ensuring you wont be woke up by the sun if they stay in place.  It comes with a nifty little carry case and some ear plugs so you can get a peaceful snooze on a plane, train or bus during travel.Sample provided by seller in exchange for my honest, unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX98712CXHQWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJM6PUK#wasThisHelpful","RX98712CXHQWB","A2Q24QWFA47FO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q24QWFA47FO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:42 MinsI love sugar babies and never seen these apple ones so I was super excited to try them ever since ordering. Right when they showed up today we opened up the box and took a few out. They are green and kind of pistachio looking but when you bite into them you get these super yummy green granny smith apple candy taste followed by the yummy awesome caramel.  We have already finished one box and don't estimate the rest will last much longer.

She loves how it lathers up really easy and mostly she loves that it left her skin feeling so soft and clean looking.

We sampled out this set tonight to make sure it could fit all our needs and it is going to be just right for all our future parties. There is enough toppers to have 6 bottles at your cocktail serving station so bring on the Midori, hot damn and triple sec cause these parties are about to go into awesome over drive.

" 0:54 MinsI really like these stainless steel mixing bowls. You get a variety of sizes from extra large to small so you always have the right size bowl for your mixing, cooking or serving needs. They are very light weight which I like, but it also worries me that they might dent easy if the kids were to accidentally drop them. We used the really big one for popcorn to watch movies and it was big enough to hold 4 microwave bags with no problem.  I really like how they nest in each other so the most space they are taking is the biggest bowl and they are super easy to wash by hand and put right back away.Sample provided at a discount by seller in exchange for my honest, unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SEZ0A2RA5X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01117H6GG#wasThisHelpful","R26SEZ0A2RA5X8","A2Q24QWFA47FO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q24QWFA47FO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 8:19 MinsThis 3d pen is one really neat idea and device. It's pretty simple to use but takes a little time to get use to. Just like the directions say you plug it in and push the forward arrow so it can start to warm up. The light will change green when it is warm and ready to use. That is when you feed the filament into it while pressing the forward button waiting for it to start to come out. Then you can pretty much draw whatever you want and however you want. It does take a bit of practice and things come out a little funny at first but its a lot of fun to use and make things with the kids. To change out the filament or when you are done, you just press the reverse arrow and until it all comes back out. You get 3 different colors with this pen and a decent amount of filament to start out with so you can get plenty of practice in while waiting for a variety color pack.Pros: Fun for everyone Draw in the air You can hold your drawings  Easy to use Cons: Lines come out a little weird at times.I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KP6D8L0YH34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01550X3C6#wasThisHelpful","R35KP6D8L0YH34","A2Q24QWFA47FO5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q24QWFA47FO5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It attaches instantly and easy to the head rest with a latching clasp to either the driver or passenger seat.  We put it in today to use on our hiking trip and it was super handy for the entire family, making everything easy to get to and with-in arms reach. The bag is lined with a thermal foil like material to keep your drinks extra cool. We put it in the freezer over night before filling and hanging it up in the car with waters.

I really like the tool box and the belt so they can put the tools on them or carry them to their next fix it job.

It instantly infuses your water because you are able to juice the lemon, lime or orange right into the bottom of the bottle and you can leave the fruit in the bottle and just keep adding water to it over the day to get a little flavor burst instead of regular water. I really like you can juice as many as you want before adding the water so you control how strong or light your water flavor is. The top has a handle so you can carry it with you on a hike or clip it to a bag to get to it easy.

"I have 3 small dogs and lets face it that adds up to a lot of poo over a week. They have a designated spot outside so its not to bad to clean up with a scooper and large pan with handle but it can be a little awkward at times, so when I saw this I knew it would make the perfect gift to my oldest who is on dog doodie duty.  I didn't get the smile I was hoping for and she didn't jump up and down hugging me telling me I am the best mom ever, ( kids now a days) But I do think she will appreciate this little gem more then she is letting on. The handle is pretty strong and sturdy with the opening part being really heavy duty, thick plastic with claw like teeth to grab the biggest or smallest of loads. You can do it all with one hand and dump into the trashcan easy peasy without getting poo dust tossed back in your face on windy days which I know should please the kid when she discovers that.

Their easy friendship was destroyed the night they made out and then Chase walked away without a backward glance and now, on the rare occasions when Madison isn't able to avoid him, they find themselves constantly bickering. Chase always cherished his friendship with Madison but after watching his father's constant cheating destroy his mother he's determined to avoid relationships himself. When a family wedding forces the two of them into close proximity it's very hard to resist the heat that builds between them but Chase hasn't changed his mind about relationships and Madison is determined not to get her heart broken all over again.I tend to have high expectations to Jennifer L.

Lynn's contemporary romances and I love the older brother's best friend trope so I was looking forward to reading Tempting the Best Man and I hate to admit it wasn't quite as good as I had hoped it would be. It's not a bad read by any means but it's definitely not one of her best. The story is quite predictable, that isn't something that bothers me on it's own - after all most contemporary romance is predictable to a certain extent - but coupled with the completely forced and unnecessary drama towards the end it just irritated the heck out of me.For the most part I liked both Madison and Chase, they have great chemistry and I enjoyed the heat between them. I loved the interactions with Madison's family and Chase's brothers, that family dynamic always adds a little extra to the story and it was amusing watching them meddle in the budding relationship. Everyone else could see how Madison and Chase felt about each other and they were determined to push the two of them together. There was a lot of humour in the story and it was a great light hearted read but I could have done without the contrived drama towards the end of the story. It definitely lost a star for the last few chapters, especially since there was a huge amount of drama and stress and then it was all resolved within a couple of pages. I liked Chase's brothers enough to want to read their stories though and I'm definitely hoping that the series will only get better from here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXW8J3S3LAWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJMK3RA#wasThisHelpful","R1SXW8J3S3LAWR","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm finding it really hard to write a review for The Eternity Cure, I absolutely loved the first book in this series but for some reason this one didn't quite live up to my expectations. I enjoyed how dark The Immortal Rules was and it was great seeing a nasty side to vampires again but the thing I loved most was Allie, She was just such a fantastic character, she had been changed into the thing she hated the most because it was the only way to survive but she remained the kind of person who put everyone else's needs above her own even though she considered herself a monster. Allie was strong, smart and capable and more than anything she was a survivor, she was willing to fight for what she believed in and she wouldn't back down no matter what danger she had to face.Unfortunately I think Allie lost some of that kick-arse attitude in this book, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what felt so different about her here but she started to really irritate me. I think it was the way she constantly mooned around over Zeke that started it (even when they're fighting for their lives she's more interested in thinking about kissing him than worrying about how to kill her enemies!) but it was also the fact that she's become so indecisive, the way she's turned her back on her principles to take the easy route, the way she spent half the book complaining about being a vampire and how terrible it was and especially the way she was so judgemental of other vampires for doing things that she has done herself. I don't know how it all went so horribly wrong with her and I really, REALLY hope she pulls herself together in The Forever Song.As far as the plot goes the beginning of the book felt very slow to me, it seemed to take a long time for things to get going but once the pace picked up I started enjoying the story much more. I actually found myself coming to like Jackal (something I never would have expected!) probably because he was so honest about who and what he was. He had no problem killing people who got in his way which is something that Allie was constantly judging him for but he never pretends to be a good guy and he is after all a vampire. Allie herself was happy to kill when she felt the situation required it but she constantly berated Jackal for not following her own self imposed set of rules and I felt that she was a little hypocritical in her attitude.I didn't hate The Eternity Cure, in fact there were a lot of things I liked about it - the search for Kanin, the changes to the Red Lung virus and the battle with Sarren to name a few - but it didn't wow me as much as I'd hoped it would. I'm still going to be reading the final book though because I really do have to know how things are going to turn out for Allie and her friends.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24UMKVUJJT06E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211139#wasThisHelpful","R24UMKVUJJT06E","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series has quickly become one of my favourites so I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of Invasion. I was a little nervous in case it didn't live up to my expectations but I needn't have worried because K.F. Breene smashed them. The series is going from strength to strength and I loved every minute of this book.Shanti and Cayan may have won the respect of the Shadow people and have added some incredibly skilled new fighters to their army because of it but the real battle is only just beginning and it's now time to face the Hunter once more. While they've been busy on the island the Hunter has been getting into position and now he's taken Cayan's city by force and is using the people Shanti and Cayan care about to force them into doing what he wants. Neither of them are characters who will give up without a fight but now they're in the difficult position of trying to defeat their enemy without getting an entire city full of hostages caught in the crossfire.As much as I love this series I've always been more than a little irritated by the attitude of the guys in Cayan's army. They think of women as the weaker sex who need to be coddled and protected and I've never liked that about them. Shanti has been working hard to change their opinion and while they may have finally realised that she is as strong as the best of them (the fact she's constantly wiping the floor with them has probably helped with that!) they still think of the women from their own city as pretty much helpless. Sometimes it can be an advantage when women are underestimated though and in this case the Hunter is making the same mistake as Cayan's army always has. The city is under siege but it's only really the men who have been imprisoned and who are being closely monitored. The Women's Circle have been staying under the radar but secretly plotting and have put plans in place to rescue their men folk. I absolutely loved seeing Shanti and the Women's Circle in action, these ladies are more than capable of protecting their own and they prove it a thousand times over. Cayan and the rest of the men are going to have no choice but to accept that now and I'm really looking forward to seeing how this changes the dynamics as the series continues.Invasion is full of action, the plot pretty much never allows you time to breathe because the characters are going from one battle to the next and facing up against more difficult odds than ever. We also get to meet a whole group of new characters, not only are we getting to learn more about the Shadow warriors but we finally get the chance to meet some of the people from Shanti's homeland. I'll admit I was confused at first because the opening chapter starts from the point of view of a completely new set of characters but once I realised what was going on I was really excited at the chance to learn more about where Shanti came from and to see her through the eyes of her people. I was also slightly disappointed that we didn't see more of Shanti and Cayan working together but the more I think about it the more I'm actually pleased about it - it's good to see that even though they're a couple they're not joined at the hip and that they are still going to play to their strengths even if that means working separately for a while.I'm absolutely loving this series and I can't wait for the next book, please write quickly Ms Breene, please, please write quickly!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N00SMUNCJQ0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161NEC9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1N00SMUNCJQ0R","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Josephine Montford is the daughter of one of New York's wealthiest families and her whole life has been planned out for her, she will marry a boy from another of the prominent families and her life will be one of ease and luxury. Jo may wish things could be different but she would never risk shaming her family by following her dreams of becoming a journalist. Everything changes when her father dies in suspicious circumstances, was it really an accident as the police claim or could it have been suicide, or even worse, murder? Jo knows she'll never be able to move forward until she finds out the truth about her father's death and she will do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of the mystery. She teams up with journalist Eddie Gallagher to investigate but the answers she finds may just change her life forever.I was really excited to read These Shallow Graves, I've been hearing great things about Jennifer Donnelly's writing for a long time now so I went into this with very high expectations. The prologue completely sucked me in, it opens with a very creepy scene where Jo and her friends are sneaking around a graveyard digging up a dead body and from that point I was totally hooked. I guess from there I was expecting a very dark story but the tone gets much lighter in chapter one where we skip 2 months into the past to discover what led Jo to that graveyard in the middle of the night. The rest of the book does still touch on dark themes but it doesn't have that creepy vibe to the majority of the story.Jo is pretty much exactly what you'd expect of a young girl from a privileged background in 1890, she has been kept very sheltered by her family and is there for very innocent and naive. Jo has no clue what it is like for the poorer classes but she has seen how differently women are treated and how they are controlled by the men in their lives. She longs for the freedom to follow her own dreams but worries about what society and her family would say if they found out about her love of writing and her wish to make a career of it. I have to say I really loved how the book portrays the role of women in society, it has strong feminist themes and a lot of Jo's observations about the way women are treated are sadly still relevant today. I enjoyed seeing Jo mature as she spent more time in the real world investigating her father's death, she has a quick mind and although her innocence led her to make some stupid decisions, especially in the beginning, she really starts to come into her own later on in the book.I quite liked Eddie but the romance that develops between him and Jo wasn't as fleshed out as I'd have liked. Considering how long the book is I think I could have done with a bit more of them getting to know each other, their connection seems to build quite quickly, especially considering the rumours Jo hears about Eddie. I was actually disappointed that she didn't confront him about them in the beginning, I was sure she was going to ask him for more details and the fact that she just brushed everything under the carpet irritated me a bit. I think my favourite characters were actually Eddie's friend Oscar and a young girl called Fay who he grew up with.There were a lot of things I loved about the book but unfortunately there were a few things that didn't work quite so well for me. I was actually enjoying the mystery of what happened to her father right until nearly the end of the book, I'd made loads of guesses about who was the mastermind, why they were doing what they were doing and the secret identities of several characters and I guess I was kind of disappointed that I got them all right. You have to understand that I'm usually useless at guessing who did it in a mystery story so the fact that I'd figured out at least 4 of the major plot reveals kind of proves how obvious they were. I was so hoping for some kind of major twist that would completely shock me and it just didn't happen. I also felt that the book was longer than it needed to be, there were definitely parts of the story that dragged and could have been streamlined further.In spite of my niggles I did find These Shallow Graves a very easy book to read, I was interested enough in the story to keep reading and I like I already said I enjoyed the mystery right until towards the end of the book. Jennifer Donnelly has a writing style that I like and I'd definitely be interested in picking up more books by her in the future. The things that bothered me probably won't be an issue for everyone, in fact I've been seeing a lot of really positive reviews for the book, so I'd still recommend giving it a try if the blurb catches your eye.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SH2VH0RPP8CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385737653#wasThisHelpful","R2SH2VH0RPP8CY","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every so often you discover a series that hooks you in completely and the Warrior Chronicles is one of those series for me. I devoured the first three books in less than a week (even though it's taken me a long time to get around to writing this final review!) and I've been waiting impatiently for the release of Invasion ever since I finished Shadow Lands. Well, I finally have a copy in my hands so I'm going to write a really quick review of this book so I can dive back in and catch up with Shanti and her friends.Shanti never wanted the title of Chosen but she's finally come to accept that she doesn't have any other choice. If she wants to defeat her enemies and bring her people back out of hiding then she's going to need every ally she can get and the warriors from the Shadow Lands would be a huge asset to her. The only way she'll get them to help her is by completing the trials and it's a challenge she must face alone. Cayan has reservations about letting Shanti go in without him, especially when he starts hearing rumours that their enemy is cheating in order to complete the trials before she can, but he is facing troubles of his own and along with his best fighters he must hold their enemy at bay until Shanti can prove herself to the Shadow warriors and gain their assistance.I still love Shanti, she is such a fantastic character and I love the way she constantly pushes the boundaries and forces people to sit up and take notice of her. She's never been one to follow the rules and, along with Cayan, she always does the unexpected. I loved seeing them on the same page here, they have finally sorted out their difficulties and put the past behind them and they make a brilliant team. Their romance has been great, it developed so slowly but has definitely been worth the wait and I have high hopes for this couple as the series continues.Alongside Shanti and Cayan we have a fantastic cast of side characters. I still think Sanders, Marc and Rohnan are all brilliant and I absolutely loved the addition of Ruisa. I mentioned in my review of Hunted that I wanted more female characters in the series and that wish has definitely been granted here. Ruisa is brilliant, her skill set is very different from Shanti's but she's just as capable and possibly even more ruthless. She certainly knows her way around poisons and I loved seeing her prove herself to Sanders and Shanti's Honor Guard. I'm still irritated that those boys don't have a better opinion of women when it comes to battle but I'm glad that they have both Shanti and Ruisa challenging their beliefs and making them rethink their position on female warriors.This series is going from strength to strength, there is plenty of action, a good amount of humour and I just love diving into this world. I don't really have much else to say other than to tell you to READ IT if you haven't already, you do need to read these books in order though so make sure you start with Chosen!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWENEUX0A2VS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZKE490#wasThisHelpful","RFWENEUX0A2VS","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was offered a review copy of Paper Dandy's Horrorgami I had no idea what kirigami even was but the image on the cover immediately caught my eye so I had to find out. After a little research I discovered kirigami is a form of paper craft where you make 3D images by cutting and folding a single piece of paper and I knew I had to give it a try. I've tried origami in the past but this was very new to me and I'll admit that I was more than a little nervous that my cutting skills wouldn't be up to the job.A couple of things you need to know before you get started:1. This isn't a craft book for young children, the designs are far too intricate to cut out using scissors so it's not for anyone who can't safely use a sharp knife. It takes patience and practice to create even the beginner designs but the results are well worth the effort.2. You're going to need some extra equipment before you can get started. At minimum you'll need a craft knife but I would highly recommend a metal ruler and a cutting mat too. You could probably use thick cardboard to lean on but if you're not REALLY careful you'll end up cutting right through and marking your table so I wouldn't recommend it. I was able to purchase a set of knives, a metal ruler and a cheap cutting mat for less than 10 on Amazon so you don't have to spend a fortune but I wouldn't have got anywhere without them.So, back to the book. Marc Hagan-Guirey has created 20 templates for you to use to make horror themed kirigami models. These templates range from beginner, through intermediate to advanced so are suitable for all skill levels and I think you'll be surprised at the huge range of images included. You can make everything from haunted houses, catacombs, gallows, a headless horseman, Dracula's castle, a ghost train and many more. I've added pictures of the 5 templates I've completed so far so you can see what they look like, the designs I've completed are:Design 1: The Thing Under the Stairs (Beginner)Design 2: Crypt Creeping (Beginner)Design 12: The Werewolf (Intermediate)Design 13: Alien Abduction (Intermediate)Design 16: Skull Island (Advanced)Each template is printed on card that can be removed from the book and used straight away (which is what I've been doing) or photocopied onto your own card so that you can reuse them as many times as you like. My only tiny complaint about this book is how hard it was to remove the templates, it would have been so much easier if they'd had perforated edges and were easier to tear from the book. The author talks about his inspiration for each of the designs and then gives tips on how to cut and fold them. The book includes clear and easy to follow images of the cutting process and gorgeous pictures of what the finished designs should look like (I wish I'd been able to replicate the lighting at home because it wasn't the easiest thing to get decent pictures myself!).It's funny because I was most worried about my lack of cutting skill before I started the first project but the thing I actually found hardest was folding the designs. The first template in the book is called The Thing Under the Stairs and I'll warn you now that those stairs were a nightmare to fold! It was well worth the effort though and finishing gave me a real sense of accomplishment.I absolutely love this book, I've had so much fun with these designs and I still have 15 more waiting for me to get to. I have to admit I don't think I have the skill to create my own templates so this book is ideal for me, I get to have the fun of cutting out and folding something that looks fantastic and none of the hassle of trying to make sure I get the design right in the first place. I'm definitely hoping that Marc Hagan-Guirey brings out more books in the future, the number of potential themes is endless and I'd definitely be first in the queue to buy the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8QC88YVPY99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780675933#wasThisHelpful","R1T8QC88YVPY99","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just when Muse thinks things can't get worse the Veil between our world and the Netherwold starts to fail allowing more and more demons to get through. Muse knows that the Princes of Hell are on their way and she has no hope of surviving if she has to stand against them alone. Akil seems to be on her side but when he is taken captive by the Institute she isn't sure where to turn. Stefan is back but his demon side is more in control than his human one and Muse can never be quite sure whether he loves her or hates her and Ryder has already betrayed her more than once. With her brother Val determined to open the veil once and for all Muse is going to need every little bit of power she can get her hands on to keep the princes at bay and she needs to figure out who she can trust to help her - fast.I think Pippa DaCosta is trying to kill me, she keeps throwing my favourite characters into these incredibly stressful situations and making them work against impossible odds. She isn't afraid to hurt them and I can never quite be sure if she's going to murder them or somehow get them through by the skin of their teeth. In fact, this series should probably come with ulcer warnings because my stomach is always in knots when I'm reading it! I honestly never know what is going to come next and that's one of the reasons I love these books so much. They're dark and they can be uncomfortable but the characters are fantastic, multifaceted creations who are never simply good or evil. There are so many shades of grey and sometimes the bad guys are the only ones you can trust because at least they'll warn you before they stab you in the back unlike the supposedly good guys who will string you along with lies until they find the perfect moment to betray you.I absolutely love Muse, after everything she has been through I think it would be easy to forgive her if she just gave up but she keeps on fighting for what she believes in. She's sure there can be no happily ever after in her cards but she keeps hoping that things can be better for other half bloods, she wants to keep humanity safe from the demons and she is so determined to do the right thing no matter what any prophecy may say about her. I love the way she sees the good in people, even those who have hurt her the most, but there are times when I kind of wish she had a bit more of a nasty streak because there are some characters who really deserve to get their arses handed to them. I only have one book left in the series now and I'm kind of terrified to pick up Ties That Bind, I honestly have no clue how Pippa DaCosta is going to tie everything up but I have absolutely no doubt that if Muse is going to get a happy ending she's probably going to have to face a lot more trouble before she earns it. I just really, really hope things turn out well for her. No matter what happens in the final book this series is absolutely fantastic and I can't recommend it highly enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IUU21PVRNWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQMKLDW#wasThisHelpful","R15IUU21PVRNWM","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dawn of Eden - Julie Kagawa (4 stars)Dawn of Eden is a prequel to Julie Kagawa's Blood of Eden series, it's set long before events in The Immortal Rules and gives readers more insight into how the red lung plague initially started and just how quickly it spread. To be honest this story was the reason I wanted to read the anthology and it was a really nice addition to the series. It introduces us to two new characters: Kylie is a young doctor struggling to look after the patients at her field hospital with limited medical supplies and dwindling members of staff; and Ben is a young man who just wants to make it back to the isolated farm he grew up on to check that his family are okay. If you've read The Immortal Rules you'll probably recognise Ben's farm but I'm not going to say more than that in case you're new to the series.This was a great prequel that hooked me in very quickly. It's quite dark (all the books in this anthology are to a certain extent) but there is a thread of hope running through it too. Ben and Kylie are great characters and I enjoyed the romance that develops between them. We get a brief appearance from Kanin too and it was interesting to learn a bit more about his past.Thistle & Thorne - Ann Aguirre (4 stars)I think Thistle & Thorne actually ended up being my favourite story in the anthology, as far as I can tell it's stand alone but the way things were left at the end has me hoping that we'll see more of these characters in the future - I would definitely purchase a full length novel about these two if Ann Aguirre decided to write one! This is set in a dark world where much of the land is desolate, the wealthy live in protected, gated communities while the poor struggle to survive in what's left of the old cities and towns. Life is hard, gangs rule and unless you keep your head down you're very likely to come under attack.Mari Thistle is an expert thief but she only steals what she needs to survive and to keep her younger siblings safe. She is the sole provider for her family and when she catches the attention of one of the gang bosses she suddenly finds herself in deep trouble. Thorne is a member of the gang who isn't happy with the way things are run, he has been waiting for a chance to make a power play against the current leader and Mari gives him the perfect excuse. The two of them must work together to find a way to beat a dangerous enemy if they are going to have any hope of surviving.I loved these two characters, Mari is fiercely independent and is used to having no one but herself to rely on. She is incredibly protective of her siblings and will do whatever it takes to keep them safe even if it costs her everything. Thorne is harder to read in the beginning, I wasn't sure what his motives were but it quickly becomes clear he has a good reason to want to change things. It's not easy for these two to trust anyone but the more time they spend together the better they are at reading each other. I enjoyed the world building and would love to revisit these characters so I'll be keeping my fingers crossed we see them again in the future.Sunstorm - Karen Duvall (2.5 stars)I actually ended up feeling disappointed by Sunstorm which was annoying because the story had so much potential. The world building was really interesting and I liked the idea of solar flares causing so much damage to the earth. Due to the strength of the flares people were now only able to leave their homes in darkness, daylight was too dangerous and would cause horrific burns to anyone caught outside with no shelter. A few people were able to survive the sunfever though and they gained some pretty interesting abilities.I think the story fell down for me because of the characters, I found it hard to connect to any of them and I never felt particularly invested in what happened to them. There were frequently large jumps in time which made the story harder to follow and so many things that happened just seemed too conveniently placed just to move the plot forward. I still think the anthology is worth reading if only for the first two stories but this one could have been so much better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FINHMUVBKBRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373803494#wasThisHelpful","R1FINHMUVBKBRX","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I saw images of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: Illustrated Edition I knew I had to have it, as a huge fan of the series and someone who already owns several print versions as well as the ebook of each Harry Potter story there was no way I could miss out on this beautiful new edition. There is absolutely no point in me writing another review of the story (you can read my original one HERE) because I'm pretty sure that most of the people who are going to be looking at buying this book are already going to be Harry Potter fans so instead I'm going to focus on the quality of the book and the illustrations.To put it simply this book is STUNNING. I had high expectations but was totally blown away by how beautiful this book is, it brings back the magical feeling of reading Harry Potter for the first time and I think it's definitely a perfect edition to read with children. Jim Kay has done a fantastic job of giving new life to the characters, he's managed to make them his own (which must have been quite hard to do considering how well everyone knows the actors from the movies) while still making them instantly recognisable.The book itself is a lot larger than I expected and has me wondering if they'll have to publish the later books in more than one edition. The quality is brilliant with lovely glossy pages and gorgeous illustrated end pages. This is the kind of book that you want to treasure and it would make a perfect gift for any Harry Potter fan. I can't wait to see the illustrated editions of the rest of the series and will definitely be purchasing them as soon as they're published.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J3K5U9EHZG47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545790352#wasThisHelpful","R2J3K5U9EHZG47","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who has been a cat owner for years but always taken in older rescue cats this is the first time I've ever had a kitten so I thought it would be worth doing a little bit of research, particularly on introducing a kitten into a household with an older cat already in residence. I think this book is probably a good place to start if you've never had a cat before, it covers a whole range of topics from selecting the right cat for your family and making sure your home is prepared, to understanding your kittens needs, training them and monitoring their health. The trouble is that because it covers such a broad range of topics it doesn't go into a great deal of depth about any of them. That isn't necessarily a major issue but it does mean you might be left with questions and have to look for further reading material.If you're looking for something quick to read that will give you the basics or something that is suitable for children then this isn't a bad option but if I'd been a first time cat owner I would probably want something with a bit more detail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2996POX7AZOV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907337121#wasThisHelpful","R2996POX7AZOV2","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was already a huge fan of this series but it honestly gets better and better with every instalment! I was on the edge of my seat for pretty much the entire book, never quite sure who to trust, never quite sure what would happen next and regularly shocked by the turn of events. Darkest Before Dawn is a gritty read, I think it's actually the darkest book in the series so far and it isn't always the most comfortable story to read but it's totally gripping and hooked me in from the very first page.Muse is such a fantastic character, she has suffered more than anyone should have to endure and we're definitely seeing the effect things have had on her here. Her human side is losing the battle and the demon is starting to take over but she still has a deep sense of honour and integrity. She is faced with challenge after challenge but she always does what she thinks is best and regularly puts herself in danger to protect others. I have to admire her for the way she cares about others, even people she doesn't know very well.In this instalment Akil rescues a young half-demon child and tasks Muse with protecting her. Muse knows exactly what it is like to be so powerless and in the hands of the demons so Dawn's story resonates with her deeply and she will do anything to save the child from a fate worse than death. I have to admit Dawn just about broke my heart, she's only nine years old but she's literally been to hell and back. Dawn's half-blood powers are incredibly rare and particularly terrifying but she still has a childlike innocence to her and she definitely brings out Muse's protective instincts. The scenes between the two of them were really touching and incredibly bitter sweet, especially when you think about the reasons why they bonded so quickly.All the characters we love (or love to hate!) are back in full force. Akil gets harder and harder to read the more we see of him, sometimes I actually find myself liking him but I still wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. Stefan has been going through some interesting changes of his own and I have to say I'm loving his storyline. I enjoyed getting to see more of his demon side here and I'm still rooting for him and Muse to find happiness together in the future. Adam and the institute are still doing terrible things supposedly for the ""greater good"". Akil may be a demon but Adam proves once more that humans can be just as bad, if not worse. I was disappointed in Ryder for remaining so loyal to the institute when he knows what goes on in the background and I really hope we get to see him come to his senses in the future.Darkest Before Dawn was my favourite book in the series so far and this series is definitely proving that Pippa DaCosta is an author to watch out for. I'm relieved that the entire series has already been published so that I can dive right in and continue my series binge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F8NN4HXTKPXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKSBCA0#wasThisHelpful","R2F8NN4HXTKPXZ","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you thought the stakes were high in Alice Through the Zombie Glass that's nothing compared to what Ali and the slayers are facing in this instalment. Zombies may be evil but they're mindless creatures that act on instinct and it turns out that humans are far more dangerous. Anima doesn't want to see the slayers wipe out the zombies, not when they've worked so hard to find a way to control them, so they will do whatever it takes to wipe out Ali and her friends.Right from the beginning of The Queen of Zombie Hearts the action is off the charts and the slayers are really up against it. Anima is always one step ahead and they're willing to act with lethal force to get rid of everyone Ali cares about. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the story, there are some great twists and a couple of shocks that I would never have spotted coming. I actually came pretty close to tears at one point thanks to one unexpected and utterly heart wrenching event. In fact, I'm still not quite sure I believe that I read that part right, I kept hoping it would all turn out to be some kind of horrific misunderstanding.I was pleased to see that Ali and Cole had got their relationship back on track but then there is one moment where Cole reverted to his foolish behaviour and pushed Ali away again. It was in a particularly emotional situation so part of me could understand his reaction but I was annoyed that once again he turned his back on her when she needed him the most. I think I find it more frustrating because most of the time he's such a great guy and I'm generally really happy to root for them as a couple. I just wish he wouldn't have these stupid moments.There are a lot of changes in this book, a lot of revelations about characters we know and love and we get to meet a whole new group of slayers who added an interesting dynamic to the story. The two groups don't really trust each other but Anima is causing so much trouble that they have to work together if they're going to have any chance of stopping them. The story has definitely ramped up on all levels and I can't wait to see how things play out in the next book. Ali has been through a lot already but I think she's still got quite a battle ahead of her before she can let her guard down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243BZMHC0IVSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211864#wasThisHelpful","R243BZMHC0IVSB","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsI've been hoping we'd get to see more of Jehan ever since we met him in the previous 1001 Dark Nights novella Lara Adrian wrote (Tempted by Midnight) so I was incredibly excited when I saw the blurb for Stroke of Midnight! I'm actually hoping she might continue the trend because there are a few other members of the Rome branch of the Order that I'd like to get to know better so I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for a few more novellas in the not too distant future!Stroke of Midnight is a bit different to the other stories in the Midnight Breed series, I don't think we've ever had an arranged mating before so I was interested to see how that would change the dynamic between the main couple. Centuries ago Jehan and Seraphina's families were at war but that all changed when a member of each side fell in love. Since that day it has become a tradition that each generation tries to find a love match to strengthen that bond between the two families.When Jehan's father tells him it's his turn to shoulder the burden he is horrified, he loves his life fighting with the Order and the last thing he needs is a mate. Luckily he only has to show willing and agree to a hand fasting ceremony with Breedmate Seraphina. They will then be sequestered together for eight days and nights in the hope that they'll fall in love and choose to take a blood bond but as long as he keeps his distance he'll be able to return to his normal life at the end of it and the task of uniting the families will fall to someone else's shoulders. Seraphina has no intention of accepting Jehan as a mate either, she loves her job helping refugees and has no interest in giving it all up to mate with a member of the Order. What neither of them counted on was the scorching hot attraction that burns between them the moment they set eyes on each other. Surely it shouldn't be too hard to resist acting on it though? After all they only have to spend eight days alone together . . .I absolutely loved this novella, Jehan and Sera were both fantastic characters and even though their relationship developed quickly I was totally on board with everything that happened between them. Their connection never felt forced and I thought they were really sweet together. One of the things I love so much about the Midnight Breed series is that we have characters spread out across the globe so although most of the series is set in America we do get to visit other locations as well. Jehan is based in Rome but this particular story is set in Morocco and I loved the descriptions of the desert we are treated to. I was also surprised by how much action Lara Adrian managed to fit into this novella, I wasn't expecting so much to be going on considering the couple were supposed to be alone for eight days. I'm not going to tell you what actually happens so you'll have to read the story for yourself but there was a perfect blend between the romance and action and I liked how things tied back into the main series story arc.My only complaint is that I'm now caught up with the series again so I'm going to have to wait for something new to be published. I think it might be time for a series reread though, it's been a while since I spent much time with the original warriors so I should probably do something about that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P8NGWUGYVGH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940887321#wasThisHelpful","R2P8NGWUGYVGH7","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Midnight Breed series, I just can't help myself I'm totally addicted to these books. Things have changed a huge amount since the dramatic outing of the Breed in Darker After Midnight and I'm really enjoying getting to know the younger generation of the Order. It's really interesting to see how some of the previous couples are coping with parenthood, especially now that the older children are starting to find their mates and that was especially true here.Carys is the daughter of Chase and Tavia she's a rare female vampire and a daywalker to boot thanks to her mother's genetics so she really does have the best of both worlds. We've already seen Carys and cage fighter Rune together over the last couple of books so their relationship is well established even if they haven't fully committed and made a blood bond. Poor Chase is struggling to see his daughter as a grown up and Rune is definitely not the sort of guy he feels is worthy of dating his precious girl. Carys's twin Aric is also dead set against the match and that's before he starts finding out about Rune's background and the secrets he has been keeping. Carys isn't one to back down though, she wants Rune and she's determined to keep him no matter what anyone else thinks. Rune is the one who is holding back on the blood bond, he knows that his past will catch up with him eventually and he doesn't want Carys to get caught in the crossfire.I love these two together, they have fantastic chemistry and the sex is off the charts hot (I'd expect nothing less from a book in this series!) but they also have a much deeper connection and are obviously crazy about each other. We already knew they were head over heels before going in but it was nice to see a couple in an established relationship get their chance to shine. I loved the fact that Carys was so stubborn and refused to let Rune walk away from her and I was really pleased to see how kickass she was when she stood by her man when he needed it the most. She more than proves herself as a tough cookie and I'm looking forward to seeing much more of her working alongside the other warriors in the Order. Rune is a bit different to the other guys in the series, he's still all alpha male but he takes things less seriously and is more willing to fight for what he wants. He may worry about his past catching up with him but he is more than happy to have Carys on his side when he is facing a life or death battle and he didn't mind her taking an active role in protecting them both.Alongside the romance we also get to find out more about both the Opus Nostrum and the Atlanteans and I can't wait to see what happens next with both groups. One things for sure things aren't going to slow down for the Order any time soon. We get to catch up with previous couples as well as see a bit more of Zael (please, please someone tell me he's getting a book of his own - I already have a feeling about who he'll be paired up with!). I was slightly disappointed we didn't see more of Aric, since he's Carys's twin I was expecting him to have quite a bit of page time, but hopefully he'll get his own story soon enough. Lara Adrian is definitely managing to keep things interesting, she's always adding to her world and she ties things together in surprising ways which always keeps me guessing. This series has been a favourite for a long time now and it looks set to stay that way for a long time to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32TGQDJYHO6W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515250490#wasThisHelpful","R32TGQDJYHO6W0","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since the slaughter of his entire Dark Haven Lazaro has been working alongside the Order to bring down their enemies and he's now the leader of their command centre in Italy. The Breed was exposed to humans 20 years ago and the dangers they face have only increased since then. Now there is a faction who is determined to pit humans and vampires against each other and Lazaro is working on creating a secret alliance between influential Breed members and powerful humans trying to prevent a war. When things go drastically wrong at a secret meeting he must work with Breedmate Melena if they are going to have any chance of surviving and warning the Order of the newest threat.I've been waiting for Lazaro Archer to get his own HEA ever since his whole family (apart from his grandson) was murdered in one of the earlier books but I could understand why it has taken so long for him to reach a point where he was ready to move forward with his life. To be honest, Lazaro still doesn't feel ready, the last thing he wants is to find another mate. He blames himself for failing to protect his family and he doesn't want to risk getting his heart broken all over again so he's very resistant to the attraction he feels towards Melena and is determined to walk away from her once they get to safety. Melena first met Lazaro when she was a child, he was visiting her family Darkhaven and saved her life when she was just seven years old. Ever since that moment she has never forgotten the man who rescued her but that was before Lazaro lost his family and the man she meets now is very different to the one she remembers. That doesn't lessen the attraction she feels though and she becomes determined to prove to Lazaro that they could have a wonderful future together if he just lets her inside his barriers.I have to admit that the fact that Melena has been crushing on Lazaro since she was a child was a tiny bit creepy. I'm very used to huge age differences in vampire / human romances and they don't usually bother me but there was something a bit weird about the way she kept thinking back to their initial meeting when she was a child and how she's always had a bit of a hero worship thing going on. I was able to get past that issue though and I enjoyed the romance that developed between them now. This is a novella so everything moves quite quickly between them but as much as I'd have loved a full length novel about them I think we got enough to make their story believable. We also get a nice amount of action and a bit more information about the Opus Nostrum that will have a knock on effect in the main series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1USDWFPXTWP64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H57X85U#wasThisHelpful","R1USDWFPXTWP64","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Devil May Care picks up Muse's story about six months after the end of Beyond the Veil. Stefan and Akil are still trapped in the netherworld and although Muse is determined to get Stefan out she knows she can't do anything without her demon side so she is trying to win the trust of the Institute so that they'll give her the antidote to the drug that has locked her demon deep inside her. As if that wasn't bad enough when she is asked to investigate a spate of murders she realises that her demon owner Damien is actually still alive and he's very determined to recapture her as his slave. Without her demon side Muse is defenceless against him so she's going to have to take desperate measures if she wants to survive and keep her freedom.After loving the first book I couldn't wait to see how things would play out in this one and I was completely hooked from the beginning. Devil May Care is a darker story than Beyond the Veil, Muse is really up against it and Damien is a particularly terrifying enemy to face. Muse is at a distinct disadvantage because she is paralysed by terror when he even looks at her and it takes her a great deal of courage to try and fight back after everything he has done to her. Some scenes with Damien made me feel quite uncomfortable but that just shows how good the writing is, Pippa DaCosta has me so invested in Muse's story that I feel everything that she goes through right alongside her and I desperately wanted to see her find a way out of the horrible situation she finds herself in.I'm going to admit that I missed the connection between her and Stefan and even the interactions between her and Akil at the beginning of the book. There wasn't as much romance or humour in this instalment and both characters were missing for most of the beginning of the story. When Akil does make a reappearance he is just as untrustworthy as ever, I still have no idea what to make of him but his character is definitely an interesting one. One minute he'll do something that makes me think he genuinely cares about Muse but the next he'll be back to his usual self-serving ways and I definitely don't trust him to have her best interests at heart. Stefan has been changed by his ordeal in the netherworld, what may have only been six months to Muse has felt like years to him and even though his demon half has protected him life definitely hasn't been easy. I missed the easy banter between Stefan and Muse, I loved the connection that had built between them in the first book and that's all fallen apart here thanks to the circumstances they find themselves in. I really hope they'll get things back on track eventually but I think it's going to take a lot of work on both sides before we see their relationship improve.There is a lot going on in this book and it definitely had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. We meet some great new characters and get to know some familiar faces a little better. The actions of some characters definitely surprised me and it's going to be interesting to see the fallout for certain events in the next book. I'm thoroughly enjoying this series so I'm going to end this review here so I can continue my reading binge!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123RJNP8J1VJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBZ8SIK#wasThisHelpful","R123RJNP8J1VJD","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes it can be a nerve racking experience to pick up the second book in a series, I'm sure we've all been in the situation where the sequel to a much loved first book ends up being a terrible disappointment and leaves us wondering whether it's even worth continuing with the rest of the series. Well I know I have anyway so I was slightly worried when it came to Alice Through the Looking Glass, what if it didn't live up to my expectations? Thankfully my fears were unfounded and within a couple of pages I was completely hooked. This story had everything I loved about the first book and then some and I loved every minute of it.I don't want to talk too much about the plot but Alice Through the Looking Glass was darker and grittier than the first book, Ali is facing a far more dangerous enemy than she has before and it's one that she doesn't have much hope of defeating. The life that she has worked so hard to rebuild is starting to fall down around her ears and it's going to take every bit of courage and determination she has if she wants to hold things together. I love how strong Ali is, she has been through so much but she never gives up hope and she never stops trying to make things better for her friends and the people she cares about. I also love the great friendship between her, Kat and Reeve. The three girls are always there for each other and it's a refreshing change to have strong female friendships in a YA novel. It's actually quite sad that I feel the need to mention that fact but I'm so sick of reading stories where females treat each other as enemies even when they're supposed to be ""best friends"". I even found myself liking Mackenzie and Trina in this story and that's definitely not something I saw coming.I have been a huge fan of Cole since the beginning but I have to admit I was more than a little irritated by his attitude for the majority of this book. The visions he has always shared with Ali have dried up and now she's experiencing something similar with Gavin, a new hunter on the scene. Cole is jealous and upset which was understandable but he uses the visions as an excuse to treat Ali really badly and I was incredibly angry with him because of that. I liked the way Ali called him out on his behaviour and I'm glad he eventually apologised and started to try and make up for his bad behaviour but I think I would have liked to see Ali make him suffer a little more before she forgave him. To be honest, as much as I still like him I'm now a little wary of him and I really hope he proves himself in the next book. They do have such great chemistry that it would be a shame for their relationship to be ruined. I was worried at one point that Gena Showalter had introduced a love triangle to the story but I'm pretty pleased with the way things turned out in the end and I'm glad it wasn't dragged out for several books.Although the romance may have been a little lacking in this instalment the plot was on top form and there was plenty of action to keep me turning the pages. There is also some fantastic character development and I loved catching up with the hunters and seeing how they're all getting on now. There were some lovely scenes between Ali and her grandmother and some very sweet moments with her little sister too. We also get to meet some great new characters and it looks like things are about to get really interesting in the next book. I'm definitely excited to continue reading the series and I'm glad I already have the next two books so I don't have to wait to find out what happens next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYDONGLRMUBJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211295#wasThisHelpful","RYDONGLRMUBJQ","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After loving the prequel, Wings of Hope, I couldn't wait to see what would happen to Muse now that she had escaped from hell and her demon owner. Beyond the Veil picks up the story about five years later, Muse is now living in the human realm and working as a blacksmith using the fake name Charlie. She has completely suppressed her demon half and does her best to just blend in with the human population and live her life completely under the radar. Things change when an assassin turns up at her workshop and calls her by her demon name. With her cover literally blowing up around her Muse has no other choice but to turn to Mannon, the demon who helped her escape captivity, for assistance once more. Mannon is also living in the human realm and under the assumed name of Akil he is a rich and powerful businessman. He promises Muse protection but when you're dealing with the Prince of Greed you have to be very careful about the price you might have to pay.Beyond the Veil was one of those stories that completely sucked me in from the beginning. The Muse we meet at the beginning of this book is very different to the one we saw in the prequel. Her demon half saved her in the past but now she is determined to keep that side of herself hidden and live as a normal human. All she wants is to stay off the radar of the demons who want to see her dead. She was grateful to Mannon for the help he gave her but even though they have great chemistry she doesn't want to be tied to him forever and would rather stand on her own two feet. Muse may be trying to live a quiet life but when she's backed into a corner she is more than capable of standing up for herself.I really don't want to say too much about the plot because it would be far to easy to give spoilers but what I will say is that nothing is ever quite what it seems. Everyone is keeping secrets and with characters who go from bad to good and right back to bad again at the drop of a hat, it really is impossible to tell who is on Muse's side and who has their own agenda. I absolutely loved the way the story took so many twists and turns and I could never guess what would happen next. I honestly don't know what to make of Mannon, one minute you think he really cares for Muse and the next you'll be convinced that he's the root of all evil but I guess you never can completely trust a demon. Alongside Mannon we have another hottie Stefan to deal with, he's another complex character with completely different motives and it's very hard to tell which of the two Muse might end up with. I have to admit I'm usually incredibly anti any kind of hint at a love triangle but things are so well done here that I actually found myself really enjoying the pull they both have on Muse.Beyond the Veil is an action packed story that is full of shocking twists and it'll really keep you on your toes while you read it. The way things ended left me desperate to read the next book and I'm incredibly glad that the whole series is already published because I can feel a binge read coming on!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGJK1NI0R6IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA3S97K#wasThisHelpful","R3UGJK1NI0R6IW","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Rock Kiss series but I have to admit I was a little nervous going into Rock Redemption. I have a big hot button for cheating and it's not something I can usually forgive in romance stories. Now I know Noah didn't technically cheat on Kit because they weren't actually dating but he definitely broke her heart when she caught him with another woman and the fact that he did it on purpose because they were getting too close made it really difficult for me to like his character in the beginning. I trust Nalini Singh though and decided to push through my fears and I'm glad I did because Noah is actually a really sweet guy when you get past his deep seated issues.Noah is a mess and he doesn't claim to be anything else, he survived something horrific as a child and it's left him damaged and broken. He uses sex as a way to push aside his memories but it's all quite mechanical and not something he really enjoys. Kit was one of his closest friends and he knew that she was falling in love with him but he didn't want to taint their relationship with sex so he deliberately set out to push her away and he destroyed their friendship in the process. I have to say I had a huge amount of respect for Kit because even though she loved him she walked away when he hurt her. She wasn't about to put up with his crap and knew that she deserved to be treated better. When she eventually lets him back into her life she does it slowly and carefully, she's wary of getting hurt again and I could completely understand where she was coming from. It's obvious the two of them have a brilliant connection but Noah was too messed up to be what she needed, especially in the beginning, and I liked the fact that the author doesn't immediately fix Noah just because he's found love.Someone who is in such a bad place isn't going to come out of it easily and Rock Redemption isn't quite as light hearted and romantic as the earlier stories have been. It's gritty and real and it takes a long time for Kit and Noah to rebuild the broken trust and decide they have a shot at a future together so you should go into this expecting a slow burn romance built on a strong foundation of friendship. Kit is strong enough to stand up to Noah and she point blank tells him that no matter how much she loves him and no matter how horrible his past was it doesn't give him the right to use her as an emotional punching bag. I could have cheered at that point and I definitely think it was a strong and important message to send out to readers. Kit was more than willing to be there for Noah and help him through his issues but she wasn't prepared to be treated badly while she was doing it.Noah has a lot of issues but if you look beneath the surface he's a great guy, he cares deeply about his friends and would do anything to help them and it's obvious that he's crazy about Kit. By the end of the book I was completely convinced that Noah had been able to turn his life around, I'm sure he'll still mess up but it won't be by cheating on Kit and I can't imagine him doing anything to hurt her again. Rock Redemption is a slow burner but that made it all that much sweeter when Noah and Kit finally reach a good place in their relationship. We also get the chance to catch up with the previous couples and we get some very interesting glimpses into the final band member Abe's head, I can't wait to read his book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JTKXAWGRQLUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942356358#wasThisHelpful","R3JTKXAWGRQLUO","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We met Alexis in Falling for His Best Friend and I've been desperate to see her get a happily ever after ever since. She has been through so much having to face cancer and come to terms with no longer being able to have children of her own, throw in the treatment she received from her ex and the way her grandfather calls her a failure it's no wonder she has had enough. She is thrilled that Avery is happy but watching her sister's pregnancy is just too much for her and she decides to head off to Europe to get some space and take the time she needs to let herself get over her losses. My heart broke for Alexis when we first met her but she's made of strong stuff and I was proud to see her go out there and live her dreams. She's been knocked down by life but refuses to stay there and it was great to see her start to put herself back together as she visited the places she's always dreamed of seeing.Luke is friends with Drew and Ryan and they've asked him to keep an eye on Alexis for them, they're worried that she took off with little preparation and don't want to see anything happen to her. Luke is recovering from his own injuries and the last thing he wants is to follow a spoiled princess around Europe just because she decided to take off and cause her family trouble. He has completely the wrong idea about her but when they eventually meet he is quick to realise his mistake. There is more to Alexis than meets the eye and he's desperate to uncover her secrets.Alexis and Luke have great chemistry but they're both emotionally wounded and trying to put their lives back together in their own ways. While the story was undoubtedly hot, and Luke is a brilliant dirty talker (my favourite kind of hero!), I think what I enjoyed most was seeing them help each other rebuild their confidence and start to put their issues behind them. I have to admit that I was a little annoyed with Alexis's family for the way they viewed her as so helpless but luckily Luke doesn't take long to realise how wrong they are about her and he helps her see just how brave and capable she is.The one issue I had was with how long Luke kept his identity secret, it was obvious that she was going to be hurt when she found out he'd been sent to protect her and I think I would have had more respect for him if he'd been honest with her sooner. However, things all worked out in the long run so I was able to forgive him quite easily. The romance between them was really sweet and it was great to see Alexis happy again, we also get a glimpse at some of the previous couples from the series and got to travel around Europe a little which made a nice change of setting. Katee Robert has definitely become one of my go to authors for contemporary romance and I'm looking forward to seeing what she comes up with next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZT0NS38ZOBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BEDMPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GZT0NS38ZOBT","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Shanti has spent her whole life training to be a warrior, she is the Chosen one, the one who is meant to be the saviour of her people, and trying to live up to that has cost her everything. Now her people are in hiding and she has been alone for a year, searching for allies who can help her defeat their enemies. She is desperate and on the verge of starvation when a band of soldiers rescue her and take her back to their home town to recover. All she really wants is to heal up and get enough supplies to continue her journey but the town Captain Cayan is determined to find out where she came from and what secrets she is hiding. It quickly becomes obvious that Shanti has unusual abilities, ones that call to a similar power deep inside Cayan, and it isn't long before he is forced to chose between handing her over to her enemies or going into battle at her side.I don't think I can even put into words how much I loved this book, the fact that I stayed up until 6am reading should give you a clue though, especially when I tell you that I'm planning to dive straight into the sequel, Hunted, as soon as I've written this review. I hardly ever read series books back to back but this one is definitely calling for a reading binge!Shanti is a brilliant main character, she is incredibly strong, independent, intelligent, fierce, determined, ruthless, powerful, honourable, protective and completely badass. She has been honing her skills both physical, with all kinds of weapons and fighting styles, and mental, where she is able to use her Gift to attack on a psychic level, since she was a child and that really shows when she goes into battle. She is the kind of woman who takes no nonsense, she refuses to be seen as weaker than men and she has no time for the old fashioned gender roles in Cayan's town. I'll admit some of her actions are questionable in the beginning but I think any woman who wakes up surrounded by male soldiers is going to be immediately on the defensive and once she realises that they're not bad guys and they aren't intending to harm her she dials back on her Gift.Shanti is slow to trust and let people into her inner circle but she's the kind of woman who inspires loyalty from those who get to know her properly. She is happy to pass on her skills and when she is forced to deal with an honour guard of young and still fairly untrained soldiers she takes it upon herself to teach them how to protect themselves. Scenes with her and her boys were absolutely hilarious and I loved the banter between them but what I really liked was how the author took her time building relationships between them all. We get to see that bond of loyalty slowly develop as they train together.Cayan had to be another highlight, he's another complex and multi layered character who has a lot of the same great qualities of Shanti. He's a little old fashioned and the last thing he wants is a woman on the battlefield but that is before he sees Shanti in action and once he realises quite how skilled she is he is more than willing to see her as an asset. The relationship between him and Shanti is complicated, he wants to know all her secrets and she sees him as a threat, but when they decide to work together they can achieve the impossible. I really loved the way Shanti goes out of her way to tease and irritate Cayan and I have high hopes that things might develop beyond friendship at some point. I don't think it's going to happen quickly because they're only just starting to trust each other at the moment but that kind of will they / won't they build up is the best kind of relationship if you ask me.Chosen is a fantastic start to this series, it has a whole collection of fantastic characters, a lot of humour, plenty of action and I think the world has a lot of potential. I still have a lot of questions about things but I'm definitely looking forward to learning more about Shanti's Gift and how she can use it. If the rest of the series remains as good as this book then I definitely have a new favourite on my hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QKHBC3WV8QKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508923027#wasThisHelpful","R3QKHBC3WV8QKI","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wings of Hope is a short prequel to the Veil series and you can actually get a free copy by signing up for Pippa DaCosta's newsletter. I've not read any of the other books in this series so can confirm that this definitely worked as an introduction to main character Muse and the world she lives in and it was more than enough to make me want to dive into the next book as soon as possible.Muse is half-demon and half-human and has been raised in hell where she is a basically a slave. Her master Da'mean treats her like a possession and he is determined to break her will so life definitely hasn't been easy for her. She is used to being treated as nothing and considered lesser by the full demons that surround her and she knows that death is in the cards for her. Especially when the Prince of Greed Mannon takes a sudden interest. Da'mean does not like to share his toys but he's unable to refuse a prince and Muse knows she will be the one to suffer his wrath.Although Wings of Hope is a relatively short story Pippa DaCosta does a fantastic job of introducing this world, she paints a vivid, if dark, picture of what life has been like for Muse and it isn't always easy reading. Muse herself is a fascinating character and I can't wait to get to know her better. She has always tried to keep her human side hidden because she considers it her weakness but Mannon makes her begin to hope for things that she never even thought of before. She longs for freedom but that isn't something that is going to come easily for her.I don't really want to say much more in this review but I definitely think this is going to be an interesting series and I'm looking forward to finding out what happens to Muse next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1COQ57QKNM630/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC2W6NW#wasThisHelpful","R1COQ57QKNM630","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neville Wyatt, future Earl of Killbourne, was going through a rebellious stage when he joined the army and went off to fight in the Napoleonic war. The last thing he expected was to fall madly in love with the daughter of a common soldier and he knows deep down that there couldn't ever be a future for them. However, when her father is shot in battle he makes a promise to the dying man to protect Lily and it gives him the perfect excuse to marry her. Unfortunately when they are ambushed the following day Neville witnesses Lily being shot and believes her dead but before he can check on her he is badly injured himself. Two years later Neville is trying to put his life back together and has agreed to marry his cousin to keep his family happy. He is standing at the alter waiting for his bride when a bedraggled Lily stumbles in and halts the wedding.Neville couldn't be more thrilled to discover that his wife is alive but Lily has been through hell since their wedding, captured and held prisoner she suffered all kinds of degradation and is sure that Neville will reject her. Neville is horrified by what she has been through and feels that he let his wife down but nothing will ever convince him that they aren't meant to be together. Lily may love him with all her heart but she wasn't expecting the splendour of his estate and she struggles to fit in with his family and friends. Lily doesn't feel good enough for him and decides to leave him for his own good and make a fresh start for herself in London. But nothing is quite what it seems and Neville isn't going to let Lily go without a fight so he becomes determined to win her back.One Night for Love is an incredibly sweet love story, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Lily has been through so much and it was only the thought of being reunited with Neville that kept her sane so she is heartbroken when she finds he was about to marry someone else and she has no idea how she fits into his life back in England. She feels out of place, uncomfortable and convinced that Neville would be better off without her but that doesn't stop her trying to fit in. I think what I loved most about her was her courage, she is terrified of Neville's reaction when he finds out what happened to her but she is brave enough to immediately tell him what happened, then she is brave enough to do what she thinks is best and move to London without him. The romance between her and Neville is really well developed and it was easy to see why they were so good together.Neville was a great hero, he was honourable, protective and very loving. I loved his reaction to what had happened to Lily, he never once blamed her or made her feel less than worthy of his love and he was incredibly kind and patient with her. He wanted her to be comfortable enough to be herself and refused to let his family intimidate her or try and turn her into something she wasn't, in fact I think he loved her all the more because she was so unconventional. They just fit each other perfectly and I enjoyed seeing them spend time together.This was my first book by Mary Balogh, in fact it was my first historical romance for a couple of years, but it definitely won't be that long before I read another. I'm excited to continue reading this series and looking forward to spending time with some of the side characters we've already been introduced to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JZ6JHJB2M79E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440226007#wasThisHelpful","R2JZ6JHJB2M79E","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had such incredibly high hopes for The Wanderers, first of all I loved the idea of a circus setting and then you add in that the circus performers are all shapeshifting children who are travelling the country while trying to avoid the Hunters who want to kill them and I was sure we were going to be in for an exciting adventure! Honestly this book should have hit all the right notes for me and I was sure I was going to love it but unfortunately that really wasn't the case and I ended up feeling incredibly disappointed.First let's start with our main character Flo, she shifts into a pony and her boyfriend is an bear, pretty cool right? Unfortunately not. I didn't immediately hate Flo but it wasn't long before her constant whining and complaining really started to get on my nerves, she just didn't stop and it got old very quickly. I actually felt sorry for her boyfriend Jett and really couldn't understand why he put up with her. Most of the other characters were cardboard cut outs and I was disappointed by the lack of characterisation, even Jett was pretty bland and he was supposed to be the love interest.I was excited to read this book because it was set in the circus but the setting was never fully fleshed out, I should have been able to vividly picture the big top, smell the saw dust and popcorn on the air and feel like I was in a ringside seat watching the show but apart from Flo's two performances the rest of the acts just didn't seem important enough to warrant more than a passing mention. It was all about how scared Flo was about her first performance and the day to day drudgery of her life as she was forced to wash her own dishes and do chores. It didn't help that I had major questions about how the circus was supposed to work as a way of hiding in plain sight. They travel from town to town in a bunch of cars and a couple of trailers yet they're supposed to be a circus that has 3 performing elephants, tigers, lions, seals, monkeys, a pony and a bear (those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head, I'm sure there were others too). Doesn't anyone wonder how a circus with that many animals doesn't have any way of transporting them or housing them when they arrive? Don't they question why the circus needs so many tents and has so many people running around during the day when hardly any of them are actually part of the show since nobody is supposed to know they're performing as animals?When something goes horribly wrong at one of their shows and brings the Hunters to their doorstep I thought that the story would start to get interesting but instead the main characters make mistake after mistake after mistake and it's a wonder any of them survived to the end of the book. The pace goes from slow and boring to so fast you could get whiplash but in spite of that nothing really had any impact on me as a reader. There were a few twists but I'd guessed most of them long before they happened and I was feeling so ambivalent about the characters that I just didn't care how things turned out.I don't take pleasure in writing bad reviews, it's one of the worst things about being a reviewer, but I always try to be honest about my feelings towards any of the books I read and unfortunately I think The Wanderers was one of my biggest disappointments of the year. What's worse is that it had the potential to be amazing and it ended up falling completely flat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GT7HZL9UJBQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1634502019#wasThisHelpful","R3GT7HZL9UJBQE","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's impossible to review Firewalker without including spoilers for previous books in the series so if you haven't read Trial by Fire yet then you need to look away now. I will say that I'm really enjoying this series though so it's definitely one I'd recommend checking out if you enjoy YA fantasy.Trial by Fire was one of my favourite YA books last year so it's no surprise that I've been desperately waiting for the release of the sequel. I was actually so excited about Firewalker that I was kind of nervous to start reading it because I wasn't sure if it could live up to its predecessor and I have to admit that in some ways I was right - it didn't quite reach the highs of the first book but that doesn't mean it wasn't an excellent story in its own right and it still far surpasses a lot of other books out there.The story picks up immediately from where we left off, Lily is badly burnt from the time she spent on the pyre but luckily she managed to get both herself and Rowan back to her own reality. She is relieved to have escaped from Lillian but she is now facing a whole new host of problems, not least of which is the FBI investigation into her vanishing act three months ago. It's not like she can explain where she's been all that time and she had no idea how much trouble her disappearance would have caused for the people left behind. Some have just been worried out of their minds, others have been living under suspicion of her murder but all of them have been suffering constant police surveillance and harassment. Lily didn't choose to leave and she came back as quickly as she could but she still has a lot of explaining to do. As if that wasn't bad enough she still has Lillian to deal with, she may have left Lillian's reality but Lillian isn't done with her yet and she is determined to pull her back into the war they started.I have to admit I found the beginning of the story a little on the slow side, probably because I'm used to this series moving at such a fast pace usually. It was interesting to see Lily reconnect with her friends and family as well as trying to settle back into normal life but it wasn't as interesting as seeing her in Lillian's reality. I also had a few issues with the way Lily was keeping so many secrets from Rowan and the people who were supposed to be closest to her, I could kind of understand why she was holding back but at the same time I always think honesty is the best policy. Rowan started having real trust issues and he actually made me really mad a couple of times but I think a lot of the problems could have been avoided if Lily had been more honest with him in the first place. They were both in the wrong though and it's probably going to take a while for Rowan to work his way back into my good graces, I am still hoping he can manage it though so that's definitely something in his favour.I actually think my favourite character in this book was Lillian, I found her fascinating in the first book but here we find out a lot more about the things she has been through and why she has made the choices she did. I'm never going to agree with some of her actions, let's face it she has done some pretty evil things, but I did find it much easier to understand how she ended up in that situation and it was interesting to see how Lily started to come to a similar conclusion. Although they are basically the same girl their life experiences have made them very different in a lot of ways but it does make you wonder if Lily wouldn't have done exactly the same things Lillian did if they had switched places at birth.Anyway, when they returned to Lillian's reality the story really picks up the pace and I loved getting to explore more of that world. We get answers to some of the questions that we had at the end of the previous book but we also get hints that there is so much more going on than meets the eye and I'm dying to see how certain things are going to play out. Lily is in an impossible situation but she is so determined to make things right and find a different way to fix things and I have hope that she can come up with something. There are some beautiful moments in this story, shocking and heartbreaking twists, weird creatures that made me shudder in fear and brilliant friendships that made me smile. I'm definitely excited to see where Josephine Angelini takes things from here and I can't wait to continue reading the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJEGUY8V6X2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250050901#wasThisHelpful","R1QJEGUY8V6X2Y","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know how Nalini Singh does it but this series just continues to get better and better with every single book. Out of all of Raphael's Seven Naasir had mostly stayed off my radar until we started to get to know him a little better in Archangel's Shadows but those glimpses had me dying to know more and I incredibly excited to discover that he was going to be the main character in Archangel's Enigma.Along with Elena I was desperate to unravel the mystery of his background and learn more about one of the most mysterious characters in the series. I'm not going to spoil the reveal for anyone but trust me it was well worth the wait and it completely surprised me, I don't think I could have guessed his origins in a million years! Naasir is such a brilliant character, he's almost childlike in some ways because of the black and white way he looks at the world - he doesn't play games and is very much a what you see is what you get kind of guy - but he's definitely all man where it counts and I loved the contradictions in him. He doesn't always find it easy to relate to people but he's very playful, completely and utterly charming with a hint of danger that is always lurking underneath. I am absolutely fascinated by him and could happily have read a book that was twice as long just to spend more time unravelling his secrets!It takes a special kind of woman to tame a man as wild as Naasir but Andi is up to the task. She may be a scholar by choice but I loved that along with being smart as hell she's also a trained warrior who is more than capable of defending herself. Naasir needs a woman who is tough enough to fight by his side and Andi was just as protective of him as he was of her. I loved how slow build their romance is, they are drawn to each other from the beginning but thanks to a vow Andi has made they end up taking things incredibly slowly and I savoured every minute of it. I'll admit I wasn't too sure about the vow when I first heard about it (and Naasir certainly wasn't impressed!) but I ended up really respecting both of them for the way they handled everything. My one irritation with Andi was the big secret she was keeping, I desperately wanted her to open up to Naasir sooner even though I understood why she didn't want to and was able to forgive her for it.Although the romance was sweet and great fun to read about there were so many other things going on in this book that I was on the edge of my seat practically the whole way through. Lijuan has gone so far off the rails that it is pretty much impossible to guess what lengths she'll go to next and her plans to murder a sleeping Ancient are despicable. I can't wait to see her suffer for her actions but I have no idea how anyone is going to take her out considering how powerful she has become! Talking of the Ancient I have to mention how excited I am about the direction things went in here, the Cascade is definitely causing some very interesting developments and I think we're going to be in for one heck of a ride throughout the next few books. Of course we also see more of our favourite characters, Elena and Raphael have some lovely scenes, we get more about Naasir and Dmitri's relationship and there are some wonderful, wonderful moments between Illium and Aodhan. I can't quite decide who I think will be the focus of the next book, there are definitely several possibilities, but I am dreading the wait for it to be published and it'll definitely jump to the top of my to read pile the minute I get my hands on a copy - just like anything else that Nalini Singh writes. She really is an amazing author that nobody else can quite compare to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25WDKZN5S44ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425251268#wasThisHelpful","R25WDKZN5S44ZP","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think it's possible for me to write an objective review of The Shepherd's Crown. As someone who has been a fan of Terry Pratchett for over 20 years I think it's fairly obvious to say that I went into this final Discworld novel feeling very emotional. We all know that we lost Terry Pratchett too soon, he was truly one of the best British fantasy writers and his voice will be deeply missed. I'll always be grateful that we have so many of his books though and I'm very pleased that he was able to give us one final adventure before he left.The Shepherd's Crown isn't quite as polished as his other stories, it states quite clearly in the afterword that Terry hadn't quite finished working his magic on this book. It definitely has a beginning, middle and end but there are parts you can tell have had more polishing than others and there were definitely a few threads that I felt sure Terry would have expanded upon if he'd had the time. While this hasn't quite been finished it's still a wonderful story and I do think it would have been his best Discworld book yet if he'd been able to complete it. It was certainly the most poignant book and it's the only one in the series that has made me sob my heart out as well as laugh out loud.I expected to feel sad after reading The Shepherd's Crown but I wasn't quite expecting the story to be as heartbreaking as it was. It's hard to talk much about why without giving spoilers so I'll just leave it that there is a devastating loss of one of my favourite characters within the first couple of chapters. This particular character has a wonderful, poignant and heart wrenching conversation with Death and I couldn't help but think about Terry while reading it. Those two pages of this book were absolutely priceless to me and I think they probably give a little insight into how Terry was feeling about his own battle with illness. They certainly touched me deeply and I'm tearing up again now just thinking about it.It was wonderful to revisit Tiffany Aching and the Nac Mac Feegles up on the Chalk too. Tiffany has come a long way since she started her witch training and I've loved taking that journey with her, she is wise and powerful but more than anything she loves her home and her people. She isn't afraid of hard work and she always puts everyone else above herself which can sometimes be her failing as much as it's one of her strengths. Now she is facing an old enemy and she has to realise that it's okay to ask for help, she will need all of the witches to come together if they are going to put a stop to the fae a final time. There are a lot of other familiar faces in this book and it was nice to get a last chance to catch up with them all. I'm still not quite ready to say goodbye to this world but like I saw someone post on Twitter we shouldn't be sad that this is the final Discworld book, just grateful that Terry Pratchett wrote so many in the first place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FWG76EL0Z0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRTCHMW#wasThisHelpful","R28FWG76EL0Z0S","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seduced in Secret was originally published with the title Whipped Cream and Handcuffs but the story has been revised and expanded before being published again with a new name. Having never read the original version I can't compare the two so this review is purely for the new version of the story.Tessa's life is going completely to plan, she likes her job, she loves her home and she's engaged to the perfect man. Well, he's the perfect man on paper anyway even if he is a little over controlling. Everything is great until she starts receiving messages and gifts from a secret admirer and they make her start to think about all the things she is missing out on. She quickly realises that man sending the messages is right - her fiancé will never make her happy - but does she take a chance on meeting up with a stranger or should she risk action on the attraction she feels for her best friend Caleb, the one man who has always been there for her?I really love the friends to lovers trope so I knew from the blurb that I was going to enjoy Seduced in Secret. Caleb has had feelings for Tessa for as long as he can remember but she placed him in the friend box a long time ago and he's never managed to break out of it. He's spent years working overseas in the Navy but Tessa has always been the woman he dreamed of coming home to and now that he's been medically retired he is determined to make his move. It was easy to fall for Caleb, he was such a sweetheart and he obviously knows everything there is to know about Tessa and what she needs to be happy. I loved seeing the strong bond of friendship between them as well as the obvious physical attraction, they make a really cute couple and it was easy to root for them. The secret Caleb was keeping was very amusing although I didn't blame Tessa for being a bit upset when she realised what was going on. My only problem was that the story ended a bit too abruptly, I think it would have been even better if it had been extended by a couple more chapters.This book also includes a bonus short story called Don't Walk Away, this was a second chance love story between a couple with a complicated history. It was a nice bonus but was a bit too short for me to really connect with either of the characters. I would have much preferred to skip this for an extra couple of chapters of Seduced in Secret.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2RTVOENC96K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ANG9C8#wasThisHelpful","R1L2RTVOENC96K","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took one look at the stunning cover of Mechanica and knew I wanted to read it and that was before I discovered it was a steampunk retelling of Cinderella. Talk about a book that was made for me! I've seen lots of people commenting that this sounds similar to Cinder by Marissa Meyer so I wanted to clarify that apart from the fact that they're both based on Cinderella these books couldn't be more different.Nicolette grew up watching her mother creating fascinating mechanical creatures and useful gadgets and she always dreamed of becoming an inventor too but after her mother's death her father had their workshop destroyed. Now, after losing her father too, Nicolette spends her life running around after her stepmother and stepsisters, she is pretty much a servant in her own home but she doesn't have anywhere else to go so she's stuck there until she can find a way to escape. Then on her sixteenth birthday she receives a mysterious letter from her mother and discovers a secret workshop hidden in the basement. Nicolette finally has access to her tools and she finds unexpected friends when she realises some of her mothers mechanical creatures have survived. With the help of her new friends Nicolette's life gradually starts to get easier as she creates mechanical tools to take over her day to day tasks allowing her time to work on new inventions.When it is announced that the royal family is holding a ball in honour of the prince Nicolette is much more interested in the inventor's exposition that will follow, if she can just create something amazing perhaps she will be able to find a sponsor and earn enough money to leave home. Unlike Cinderella Nicolette is determined to save herself, she doesn't need to marry a prince and she would much rather become a famous inventor and earn her own living. I think that was the main thing I loved about her character, she has it tough but rather than sit around complaining about things she sets her sights on a goal and works hard to make her dreams come true. Of course she does have a little help along the way and I enjoyed seeing her make a few friends outside the house but I have to admit my favourite character was the mechanical horse Jules.Mechanica is beautifully written and very descriptive, it was easy to dive into Nicolette's world and I enjoyed reading the story. The pace was a little slow at times but I was so caught up in it that it didn't really bother me. I think the main issue I had was with the ending, not because of the twist (which I have to admit I guessed well before the end) but because of the way one of her new friends acted. I was pleased with how Nicolette handled things but I was disappointed with the way her friends reacted to the situation and it just left the ending feeling a little bit flat. This was still a fun read though and I'll definitely keep an eye out for more from Betsy Cornwell in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYT5IVVFCOV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547927711#wasThisHelpful","RLYT5IVVFCOV8","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew before going in that One was going to break my heart but what I wasn't expecting was how beautiful the story would be. I don't tend to read many verse novels, in fact the last one I read was The Weight of Water, also by this author, three years ago but there is no doubt that this writing style can be extremely powerful when done well. Sarah Crossan definitely has the skill to pull it off and One is now my favourite of her novels.This is the story of conjoined twins Grace and Tippi, they are joined from the waist down so although they each have two arms they only have one pelvis and two legs between them. Their condition has led to high medical bills which the family struggle to pay and it causes no end of difficulties for the girls when it comes to living their daily lives but the pair are overwhelmingly positive in their outlook. It was great to see them both as individuals and the way they work together as a team, they have an incredibly deep bond with each other and although there are times they wish for privacy most of the time they're just happy to be together.When the girls start school for the first time it was heartbreaking to see how they were treated by the outside world, the cruel remarks don't just effect the twins though, both their younger sister and their parents are also under a lot of extra pressure. School isn't all bad though and for the first time they have a chance to make friends with people outside the family. Grace and Tippi go through so much but they are always a team, they're best friends as well as sisters and no matter what happens outside they always have each other to turn to.I'm not going to say anything else about the story because I want readers to be able to enjoy it for themselves. It's being marked by Bloomsbury as ""The ONE book to read this summer"" and for once I'm completely on board with the marketing hype. If you're looking for something a little different, something that will give you an insight into the really rare condition of conjoined twins but is really all about sisterhood, love and friendship, then you really should pick up a copy of One. It's a beautiful book and it's one that has stuck with me in the weeks since I finished reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUGHKKUI8ESO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140887234X#wasThisHelpful","RMUGHKKUI8ESO","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been seven years since the Veil between the worlds was opened and New Orleans was nearly destroyed by a war with the supernatural creatures that came through before the it was resealed. Now life is very different, the supernatural creatures who were left behind have all been confined to a walled community known as Devil's Isle to protect the humans who remain but food and resources are scarce and it's like living in a war zone. Magic is forbidden and the few humans who can wield it, known as Sensitives, are exiled to Devil's Isle if they are caught. Claire Connolly is just trying to keep her head down and survive, she took over the running of her family's store after the death of her father and all she wants to do is live in peace. She works hard in her shop and does her best to provide her local community with everything they need. Unfortunately Claire has a secret, one that could get her sent to Devil's Isle if she is caught. Several months ago Claire discovered she was a Sensitive but she is too scared to practise using her abilities in case someone finds out what she is. Liam Quinn knows the price of not using magic and he sees it has his responsibility to make sure Sensitives don't step off the straight and narrow. When Claire is forced to use her ability to protect herself in public Liam agrees to keep her secret but there is a price she must pay for his silence.I love Chloe Neill's Chicagoland Vampires series so of course I was incredibly excited to find out about her brand new series. I had high expectations for The Veil and although it is completely different to her other series I found myself just as hooked. Claire is such a fantastic heroine, she has a lot of power but she hasn't had much of an opportunity to use it so she really has no idea quite what she is capable of. She's smart, loyal and caring, the kind of woman who goes out of her way to help others even when it costs her. Claire isn't afraid to make difficult choices and she has learnt to trust her instincts and go with her gut.I loved her little group of friends and the way they all looked out for each other but I have to admit that Liam pretty much stole the show from the moment he stepped onto the page. He is still quite a mystery, it's obvious he is keeping secrets and I'm sure we've got some exciting revelations to come about his character, but he is honourable and very protective. I love the fact that even though he had good reasons to mistrust all supernaturals he doesn't have a bias against them, in fact he is the one to show Claire just how wrong some of her assumptions are. There is definitely a huge amount of potential for them as a couple but I'm glad that the author hasn't rushed into anything, they are slowly becoming friends and learning to trust each other but neither of them is quite willing to jump into things without thinking through the consequences.As with any first book in a series there is a lot to learn about this new world but I never felt overwhelmed or bored by the information we were given. Chloe Neill has created a richly detailed setting that was very easy to picture and there is definitely a lot of scope for where future books in the series could take us. We get some great character development in this instalment and there was enough action and intrigue to keep me turning the pages as fast as I could to find out what would happen next. This series has definitely been added to my auto-buy list and I can't wait to find out what happens next for Claire and Liam.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C1UUYLT3L8Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451473345#wasThisHelpful","R1C1UUYLT3L8Z4","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think I lost the ability to write a sensible review of anything written by Ilona and Gordon Andrews a long time ago and that goes double when it comes to their Kate Daniels series. I just absolutely adore this world and these characters and will never get enough of them. I have been eagerly waiting for Magic Shifts for a year now, I reread the entire series in the run up to it's release, I dove into the book the moment I got my hands on a copy and I absolutely loved it. I loved it so much that I read it twice within three weeks of the release date, something I hardly ever do.Kate and Curran are without a doubt my favourite fictional couple and we get to see them on top form here. Things were a little rocky in Magic Rises, they improved in Magic Breaks but in Magic Shifts they are back in full force. They are a couple to be reckoned with, come after one and you have to take them both on because they always, always have each other's backs. I love that they're equals, Curran may have the edge on Kate physically but she's no slouch and with her skill with her sword and her powerful brand of magic she's a powerhouse in her own rights and Curran respects that about her. There may be times that he longs to lock her away from the world to keep her safe but he respects her and her abilities and knows that she can stand on her own two feet so instead he chooses to stand with her so they can fight their enemies together. There are some particularly poignant moments between the two of them in this book and there was definitely more than one point where I had tears in my eyes. I love seeing how far they've come as a couple and they really are stronger than ever now.After the ending of the last book we knew there would be huge changes in this instalment, Curran and Kate are separating themselves from the pack and it's a complicated process that has a knock on effect on their friends and family. I don't want to say too much about what happens but I am very happy with the way things are currently playing out and I think it's going to be very interesting to see where the couple go from here. As always we get to catch up with some of our favourite side characters, some we don't see as much of as I'd have liked (I missed Derek in particular) but I enjoyed what we do see of them and they never fail to add humour to any situation. Julie really gets a chance to shine and there are some wonderful bonding moments between her and both Kate and Curran. Plus we have the reappearance of both Cuddles and Grendel who never fail to make my day.One of the things I love about this series is the way the authors are always including new creatures to keep things fresh. I'd hate to spoil things for you so I'm keeping this vague but we get the chance to explore some Arabic mythology this time around and we see the Andrews' twist on some powerful new enemies for Kate. Of course just because they have new people to fight doesn't mean that their biggest threat has left the picture. Roland is still very much on the scene and his motives are still unknown. There are some moments when I'm convinced that he wants to be a proper father to Kate and that he's curious about the idea of having a daughter and family to love but there are other times when I keep expecting him to try and wipe her off the face of the planet and I actually kind of love how ambiguous he is. I honestly have no idea how this series is going to end and it's fantastic that the authors are able to keep me guessing.Magic Shifts was everything I want from a Kate Daniels book, it was full of action, intrigue and mayhem, there were heartfelt declarations, hilarious conversations, moments of compete and utter anxious terror, interesting twists and a couple of huge hints about major events to come. In short it was perfect! So begins the incredibly long wait for book 9, although I know I'll reread the series at least once between now and then to tide me over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHLL0CK0UDDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042527067X#wasThisHelpful","RWHLL0CK0UDDZ","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anything but Broken is the first book in the new Hurricane Creek series by Joelle Knox, AKA writing duo Bree and Donna who you may already know under one of their other pen names: Moira Rogers or Kit Rocha. I can understand why these authors choose to write under several names because each of their personas have a very distinctive voice and writing style, I'm a huge fan of everything that they write but not all of their books will appeal to everyone and it's good to have an easy way to tell what you're signing up for before you buy one of their books. Anything but Broken is like nothing they've done before but it still has innate their flare for story telling and for creating characters you'll come to care about.Hannah hasn't returned to her home town since the death of her sister five years ago but now another tragedy has brought her back, this time a car crash that killed her father outright and left her mother in a coma. Her life is falling apart around her and Hannah doesn't even know how to start picking up the pieces. Sean used to date Hannah's sister and when he realises how alone Hannah is he sets out to take care of her. The attraction between them is intense but Sean is more interested in helping Hannah put her life back together and he doesn't want to rush her into anything. The connection between them is undeniable but they both have plenty of issues to work through if they are going to have any chance at making a relationship work.Too often I find that NA romances revolve around guys who are players which leads to drama with exes or a lot bitchiness amongst the female characters and I'm sick of reading them so it's nice to find something that breaks the mould. The intensity in this story comes from the character's, from their past experiences and their way of looking at life, so there is actually very little in the way of conflict caused by the people around them. Hannah has been through a lot, her father was an alcoholic and her mother didn't deal with things very well so her childhood wasn't great. Her sister suffered with bipolar disorder but was never given the help she desperately needed because of the way her mother reacted and Hannah has spent years blaming herself for her sister's death and struggling to come to terms with what happened. She felt ostracised by her family and she never got the chance to make peace with them or get answers to the many questions she had. It's had a huge impact on her and now she's struggling to come to terms with everything and find a way to move forward.Sean was her first crush but as her big sister's boyfriend he was completely off limits, of course five years later everything has changed. She's still just as attracted to him as ever but it looks like he might return the attraction and she's not quite sure what to do with that, especially considering the family secrets she is still keeping from him. I absolutely loved Sean, he was the perfect blend of protective, caring lover and sexy, slightly dangerous bad boy. He was an everyday guy who worked hard to keep his garage running by day and who spent his evenings and weekends as a race car driver. I've never really thought of stock-car racing as particularly sexy but Sean convinced me and I'm definitely looking forward to more of that side of things as the series continues. What I loved most about Sean was his patience and the way he looked out for Hannah, he can see just how broken she is but that doesn't scare him off and he works hard to help her build her confidence and get her life back on track.Alongside the main couple we also have a great cast of secondary characters, I loved Sean's family and the way they took Hannah into the fold was really nice to see. There is a lot of fun banter between the siblings but they all care deeply about each other and I hope we get to see more of them all as the series continues. Hannah gets the chance to reconnect with her childhood friend Evie and I really loved seeing a strong and supportive female friendship between them, there is no petty jealousy, you just have two young women who care about each other and are there to support each other through the hard times. My favourite secondary character was Sean's friend Gibb though, in the beginning he is very against Sean's relationship with Hannah and I have to admit I was a little wary of his character but he really grew on me. Gibb obviously didn't want to see his friend get hurt and was trying to protect Sean and I could respect him for that but what I liked about him most was his ability to realise when he was in the wrong and the way he stepped up for Hannah to help her deal with something when he was in a unique position to offer her advice. Once we get to know him it becomes obvious that he's a really caring guy and I was incredibly excited to find out he's the hero of the next book.I was already a huge fan of this writing duo but I'm definitely going to be adding their new Joelle Knox pen name to my list of auto-buy authors. I have a feeling that this is going to turn into one of my favourite NA series and it's definitely one I'll be recommending to anyone who likes to read about realistic, flawed characters who are dealing with tough emotional issues and who find the strength to rebuild their lives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLHXA72HKQMWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141KJL1S#wasThisHelpful","RLHXA72HKQMWF","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often that you can reach book 14 in a series and still honestly say that you love everything about the world an author has created but that is exactly how I feel about Nalini Singh's Psy-Changeling series. I don't know how she manages to keep this series so fresh but every single book just gets better and better and with every new instalment I find myself with a new favourite in my hands. I had high expectations for Shards of Hope but it still completely blew me away, this was probably the book that took me on the biggest emotional journey of the whole series and I loved every minute of it.With the fall of Silence we have already seen one major plot arc come to an end but there is obviously plenty more to come and we are now getting to see the full impact of these changes. The loss of Silence has had meant huge changes for the entire Psy race but the Arrow squad are finding it harder than anyone, they have such incredibly powerful gifts and Silence was their safety net so they're feeling lost and unsure without it. Aden has given his whole life to the squad, he was never fully Silent but he was able to keep that hidden and use his abilities to protect the others. Now he wants to see his team not only adapt but thrive in their new environment, he knows there has to be a better way for the Arrows and he is determined to find it for them. I don't want to say too much about what transpires but I will say that I absolutely loved the direction he is taking them in, we get to see some absolutely beautiful moments with the squad and I found that part of the story incredibly emotional and heart warming.Aden has always put the squad first, it's something that shows what a great leader he is and how worthy he is of their trust but he does have a tendency to put his own needs last and he really needs someone to look out for him occasionally. I love everything about Aden, he's honourable, sweet, protective, caring and funny too, he cares so deeply about the whole squad but Zaira has had a special place in his heart since they were teenagers and now he's determined to act on it. Zaira survived a hellish childhood but it left her damaged, she has a rage deep inside that terrifies her and she's always been afraid to let anyone close because she knows she has the potential to destroy anything she loves. She thinks of herself as broken but she doesn't realise just how strong she is until Aden shows her. They are probably one of my favourite pairings of the series, on the surface they are so different but they need each other and the connection between them is palpable. I love how slow build their romance is, it's obvious from very early on how they feel about each other but Zaira is very wary and skittish and it takes a long time for her to completely let Aden in. Watching the connection build between them was brilliant and they completely made my heart melt.One of the things I always love most about Nalini Singh's books is the way she is able to include so many other characters without taking away from the couple who are currently in the spotlight. We get a chance to catch up with most of our favourites from both the DarkRiver and SnowDancer packs as well as meet the new RainFire leopards who I'm hoping we'll spend a lot more time with in the future. I loved the RainFire alpha Remi and really enjoyed the interaction between him and Aden, Remi is able to give Aden a lot of advice that is going to have a massive impact in the future and it was great to see a strong bond starting to form between the three Changeling packs and the Arrow squad. I think we're really building towards a point where each of the three races are going to be able to live in harmony and I can't wait to see more interaction between the various groups.Of course not everyone is happy that Silence has fallen and there are definitely people out there who are determined to stop the alliances that are starting to build. This new threat is certainly going to leave a mark and I'm looking forward to seeing how things progress as the series continues. I love this world, I love these characters and it's going to be a long, long time before I'm ready to say goodbye to any of them. It goes without saying that Nalini Singh is one of my favourite authors and I can't recommend all of her books highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVVY3SDD62RML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425264033#wasThisHelpful","RVVY3SDD62RML","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael is the last of his kind, the only ancient vampire to survive the slayers who set out to eliminate his race. He survived their torture but has never forgiven himself for the deaths of his brethren and he has been punishing himself ever since by refusing to feed as much as he required and by keeping himself apart from the dhampirs who think of him as their king. Michael is the only one who can repopulate the vampire race and he can only do that if he finds his true mate, the one woman who will return his soul and give him the strength to start turning dhampirs. After searching for centuries he's pretty much given up hope but all his prayers are answered when he stumbles upon Claire in a nightclub. Her blood draws him like no other but it takes him a while to realise how important she is to him and she gets away before he can stop her. Now the race is on to track her down before his enemies can harm her.I had incredibly high expectations when I picked up The Last True Vampire, let's face it when a book is compared to works by four of your favourite authors (Nalini Singh, Lara Adrian, Larissa Ione and J.R. Ward) you're going to be looking for greatness. Unfortunately I think that did this book a disservice because it was almost bound to be a disappointment. It's actually a pretty solid start and I have high hopes that Kate Baxter will build on these foundations to create a wonderful series but there were issues with this first instalment that meant I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.Let's start with the positive. The author has managed to put her own twist on vampire mythology, you can tell the series has been inspired by some of the author's mentioned previously but it stands on it's own enough for that not to be a problem. I'm intrigued by the connection between the vampires and dhampirs although I'm still not 100% sure I understand it fully and am hoping we'll get more information about that as the series continues. Usually the vampire society is well established at the start of a series so I'm definitely interested to see how Michael will go about rebuilding an entire race and I think seeing things from the ground up will add an interesting element to these books.One of the things I missed the most was having a solid group of core characters who are going to be central to the series though. When we first meet Michael he very much keeps himself to himself and there is only really one dhampir who he trusts. I did enjoy the bond he had with Ronan and it looks like Ronan has a group of warriors he trusts so the cast is bound to expand thanks to him but since Michael is supposed to be the king I felt he should have been the core member of the group and the one that everyone relied on.I actually had a lot of issues with Michael to begin with, the way he treated Claire in the beginning was despicable and a complete turn off, he constantly left her in the dark and refused to answer any of her questions so it was no wonder she found it hard to trust him. At one point he used mind control to put her to sleep for THREE WHOLE DAYS just so he didn't have to deal with her - he didn't even wake her up to feed or drink so it's a wonder she even survived! After everything he puts her through I struggled to believe the romance that develops between them even after he realised his mistakes and worked hard to turn things around. Claire was an interesting character, she starts out strong and street smart but it did seem like her connection to Michael effectively removed her brain and she started making more and more stupid decisions the longer she'd known him. To be fair they both turned things around eventually and I was happy with the way things turned out but I could have enjoyed the whole book much more if they hadn't been such idiots. I don't mind the whole fated mates thing in paranormal romance but I do like to feel that there is more than just a physical attraction between them and I'd have liked more of a slow build into a full on relationship.In spite of the problems I had with this book I definitely want to carry on reading the series. Ronan was my favourite character all along, although I have to admit the side story with him and another dhampir Siobhan actually turned my stomach, so I was excited to find out he will be the hero of the next book. I'm kind of nervous to see how it plays out because of his connection to Siobhan but since I know she isn't going to be the heroine I'm hoping we won't have to see too much of her. If Kate Baxter can build on the positives and avoid some of the issues then I think I could really fall in love with this series so I'll be keeping my fingers crossed when I pick up a copy of The Warrior Vampire.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SDAUUK6A57EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250053765#wasThisHelpful","R3SDAUUK6A57EX","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet is a bit like diving into a series of a show like Star Trek or Firefly and I enjoyed every minute of it. The story is very character driven so the plot can be a little slow in places but I was having so much fun getting to know everyone and learning about the different alien cultures they come across along the way that this really didn't bother me. Most of the action is towards the end of the story though as they get closer to their destination and that's when I was completely on the edge of my seat waiting to see how things would turn out.This is the story of the Wayfarer, a small ship that tunnels wormholes through the galaxy to make long distance space travel much easier. Their latest job has the potential to make the crew rich but the journey will be long and tedious and they're flying into a war zone so the potential dangers are high. The Wayfarer's crew is small and relatively tight nit, but even the closest friends can start to wear on each other after spending a long time trapped together in a relatively small space. There are nine members of crew who come from a variety of backgrounds spanning across both human and alien races. They even have an AI on board who is just as sentient as the rest of the crew.Rosemary, the newest human crew member and the ship's clerk, is looking to escape from her past and just wants to get as far away from her home on Mars as possible. Captain Ashby is also human but he was born in space and just loves to travel, his ship is everything to him and he cares deeply about his crew. Pilot Sissex comes from a lizard like alien race who have very different customs to our own while Dr Chef, another alien, wants to live in peace away from his war torn home world. The two ships engineers, Kizzy and Jenks, are both a little on the crazy side and fight like brother and sister while AI Lovey watches over the ship and her friends to protect them from danger. The final members of the crew are navigator Ohan, a complicated symbiotic pairing with a very different outlook on the world, and algaeist Corbin who is in charge of fuel production.Each of the characters get to tell part of the story which really allows us to get to know them all, they are all unique but sometimes flawed individuals with their own quirks and interests and I really grew to love them. The interactions between the various crew members were fantastic and I enjoyed seeing how various relationships changed throughout the course of the story. The universe Becky Chambers has created is fully fleshed out and full of intricate details, she has some brilliant settings and we get to meet a lot of interesting alien races along the way. Each species introduced has it's own customs and eccentricities that really helped bring them to life. Although The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet works perfectly as a stand alone story I can't help hoping that we'll get a chance to meet up with the Wayfarer again to join the crew on another adventure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IDPSWXCQAO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTM2B84#wasThisHelpful","R15IDPSWXCQAO4","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After thoroughly enjoying the first book in this series I couldn't wait to dive back into this world and spend more time with Caleb and #1001. The story picks up not long after the last one ended, #1001 has been caught by Chitec and is about to be decommissioned, she believes that she murdered Caleb and although she was only carrying out orders she feels very conflicted about what happened. When a lab technician agrees to help her escape #1001 knows this is her last chance to make her father suffer for what he did to her and she will do whatever it takes to get her revenge.Meanwhile Caleb has also been captured and he is struggling to survive on an inhospitable prison planet. His second in command, Fran, may have come to his rescue but Caleb knows that she can't be trusted and the deal she made with a pirate family to save him has ended up dumping him out of the frying pan and into the fire.If you thought these characters made questionable choices in the first instalment you've not seen anything yet, they all have their own agendas and loyalty is a word that most of them don't know the meaning of. Any alliances they make are fleeting and only last until a better offer comes along so no matter what kind of friendships you think they have you can never be quite sure that their bonds will last. It's just so much fun to read about characters who are so morally ambiguous, I may not always agree with their choices but Pippa DaCosta always does a good job of making their decisions believable.Caleb is a loveable rogue and I just can't resist him. He's not a good guy, in fact he does some truly horrible things, but he does have his own code of honour and he never claims to be something he's not. #1001 is probably my favourite though, she thinks of herself as completely inhuman but from her thoughts and actions it's obvious that deep down inside her human side is still very much in control. She longs for revenge against the people who wronged her but she also craves friendship and wants something more from life.I really don't want to say too much about this story apart from to warn you to expect the unexpected. Nothing is what it seems and there are plenty of twists to keep you guessing. I have absolutely no idea where the story will go from here but I do know that the next instalment will be jumping to the top of my to read pile the minute I can get my hands on it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MNKRGG9B1XZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBNT0IW#wasThisHelpful","R1MNKRGG9B1XZI","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew I was going to love Derek from the moment we met him in the first book, he is without a doubt a hero, someone who sacrificed a lot to protect his best friend and fellow Special Forces team member and who has no regrets about any of it. Derek has a great sense of humour but more than anything I love his strength of character and the way he is so loyal to his team. He's the kind of guy that any woman would be lucky to meet and it doesn't take Emilie long to realise how great he is. The connection between them is fairly quick but in spite of that I didn't have a problem with things feeling rushed, they're in the middle of a high pressure situation and that is bound to help fan the flames between them.Emilie is in a really difficult situation, her brother has always been the one person she can rely on to protect her but the man who came home from the war isn't the boy she remembers. He is now secretive, paranoid and jumpy, Emilie can tell he's showing signs of PTSD and she's terrified he might be a danger to himself or others. For the first time in her life she's actually scared of her brother and she's not really sure where to turn to. I have to say I was really pleased with the way Emilie handled things, she doesn't bury her head under the sand and hope that the problem will go away but instead she chooses to fight things face on and make the difficult decisions that are needed. She meets Derek because he is investigating her brother and although it takes time for her to open up to him once he has earned her trust she puts her faith in the Hard Ink team to protect her.One of my favourite things about this series is the bond between the Hard Ink guys, the banter between them is so much fun to read and I thoroughly enjoy the way that the friendship they share has increased throughout the series as they work to clear their names. Derek has had a lot to deal with and there are times he feels a burden to the team because of his physical injuries but really he's just as capable now as he ever was and the rest of the guys help him to see that. There may be things he can't do now but they don't stop him in the long run and he deserves the utmost respect for that. I don't think it's easy to write about a hero who has suffered from an amputation but Laura Kaye did a fantastic job of it, she takes a difficult subject and handles it sensitively but with her trademark humour too.This series is getting better and better with every book, the guys are getting closer to unravelling the mystery of what happened to them and they make some very important discoveries in this book. The story is full of heart stopping action, a fantastic romance and brilliant friendships. If you're a fan of romantic suspense you're going to love these books but I really would recommend reading the series in order and starting with Hard as It Gets. I can't wait to find out what happens next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1673IBRAHJW2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062267922#wasThisHelpful","R1673IBRAHJW2A","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsI absolutely loved Playing for Her Heart, if you're fed up with controlling alpha billionaires and fancy falling for a nerdy hero instead you can't go wrong with Megan Erickson's Gamer series. After really enjoying Changing His Game I was excited when I was offered a review copy of the sequel but I have to admit I wasn't sure if the author would be able to top Austin who is one of my all time favourite nerdy heroes. I'm very happy to say that she managed it and Grant has now sailed into the number one spot.Chloe is the kind of heroine you can imagine being best friends with, she's incredibly smart, talented and funny but she's also really shy and incredibly awkward in social situations. She doesn't really date and the only time she's really comfortable outside of her home is when she's playing a role which one of the reasons she loves cosplay so much. Dressing as a character gives her a confidence she never normally feels and when she meets Grant at Comic-Con sparks fly between them immediately. Neither of them are looking for a relationship but they're more than happy to indulge in a one night stand and it leads them to some of the hottest sex of their lives.Grant is a single dad who doesn't have much time for dating, he's happy raising his daughter and settles for the odd fling when she's staying out with friends but his night with Chloe leaves him wanting more. Unfortunately she never even told him her name but that doesn't end up being an issue when he discovers she's his best friend's little sister. Pursuing her may break all kinds of rules of friendship but there is no way he's even going to try resisting temptation.Chloe and Grant have fantastic chemistry and I think this book was even hotter than the first one, they're both into role play which helps keep things fresh but their connection isn't all about sex and there was definitely a sweet emotional connection between them too. I enjoyed the interactions with Grant's daughter Sydney and it was great seeing Grant break down Chloe's barriers and help her deal with some issues from her past. She was much more skittish about a relationship than he was but he knew she was worth the effort and was willing to fight for her.I really hope the next book will be about Chloe's brother Ethan, his back story was quite heart breaking and I'd love to see him overcome his demons, but whoever the main characters are any future books in this series will be going straight to the top of my wish list. I love the humour and geeky feel to these books and it doesn't hurt that the sexy times are scorching. Megan Erickson is definitely an author I'm going to be watching out for in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IUV16BAUCZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I42XQU#wasThisHelpful","R13IUV16BAUCZ3","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cara and Travis have history, the connection between them has always been combustible but she's looking for love and wants to start a family while he's seen first hand how painful love can be and is determined to avoid it. Knowing that a relationship is completely off the table Cara needs to find a way to move on and she figures that with one last fling she should be able to get Travis out of her system for good. Of course love doesn't always go to plan and now she's risking getting her heart broken if Travis doesn't realise just how special their connection is.This series just keeps getting better and better! I have a bit of a thing for all of the firefighters in these books but I think Travis might just be the sexiest one yet. I loved how sweet and romantic Travis could be even when he was protesting that he wasn't looking for a long term relationship. There is a lot of history between these two and it was really easy to see how strong their bond was, their chemistry was fab but they were also good friends and just enjoyed spending time together. There is plenty of light hearted banter as well as the sexy times and I had a lot of fun reading their story.It was also great to catch up with previous characters and see how they're all getting on. That's one of the things I love most about series like this one, the familiar setting and recognisable faces just add a little extra that you don't get from stand alone stories. Lauren Blakely is definitely becoming a favourite author and I can't wait to read the next book in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X7AQW66BCYE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7S52H2#wasThisHelpful","R1X7AQW66BCYE5","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Laird Wolf is the second novella in Vivian Arend's Takhini Shifters series and although these characters have made appearances in the Takhini Wolves books these stories are designed to be completely stand alone so it doesn't matter if you've read the previous books or not. For anyone who is familiar with the series this fits into the time line just after Copper King and before Black Gold.Cataloguing the contents of a remote Scottish castle for the estate's executor should be easy for Addie but things are complimented by the discovery of multiple wills and the fact that she is being hounded incessantly by two of the potential heirs. Feeling creeped out and unsafe Addie calls her best friend for assistance and Lillie sends lone wolf Damon to protect her. Damon has never wanted a mate or a pack, he's always been happy to live his life on the outside, but Addie brings out all his protective instincts and he's not quite sure what to do with his feelings. One things for sure, he won't let the weird cat shifters who are fighting over the castle harm her, but after that anything goes.I loved Damon when we met him in Copper King so I was really happy to discover he was getting his own story, he's such a fun guy and it was great to get to know him better. Damon has the strength of an alpha but after a traumatic experience when he was a teenager he has never got along very well with his inner wolf, they never really see eye to eye and he fights against his wolf instincts. Both of them are in full agreement over one thing though - the need to keep Addie safe, they are both intrigued by her and neither of them wants to let her go. Addie is a rare omega wolf and her unusual abilities make it very difficult for her to get close to anyone. She is drawn to Damon but worried about letting him close because skin to skin contact will allow her to see his innermost thoughts.I really enjoyed the romance between these two, the banter between them was great and they make a cute couple. Addie may have asked for assistance but she's still more than capable of standing up for herself, it's just nice to know she has some back up for when she needs it. I loved how strong she is and that she isn't willing to back down when she's set her mind on something. Damon was sweet and protective and they had great chemistry. Although this is a novella and a fairly quick read I never felt that the romance was rushed, we get to see them become friends and get to know each other and it was easy to believe that they actually had a chance of making their relationship work, even without the whole werewolf mating bond going on.If you're looking for a fun, sexy story then you can't really go wrong with any of the books in this series. Vivian Arend is one of my go to authors because she never fails to give me an enjoyable story that leaves me with a smile on my face.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N4I94LHE65KK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1512204560#wasThisHelpful","R3N4I94LHE65KK","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsI've been a huge fan of this series ever since I picked up the first book so I was really excited to start What Emma Craves. We've already had the chance to learn quite a lot about this couple's extracurricular activities in the previous stories but I was looking forward to getting to know them both a bit better. Emma and Pete have always been more than happy to invite other couples to join them in the bedroom, it's something that they both enjoy and it's never caused an issue in their relationship before. Recently things have been changing for Emma though, she loves her husband like mad but she feels like they're losing the connection that has always made them such a strong couple. She misses the way things used to be and knows that something needs to change. Hoping a break will help them reconnect they have booked a holiday to an exclusive resort on an island where anything goes but will it really give them the chance to rebuild their relationship?Although this story is undoubtedly hot I have to admit I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the previous instalments. I have always liked Emma but there were times I found myself really frustrated with Pete and the way he was so completely oblivious to her feelings. It felt like she was pushing herself to do things that she wasn't necessarily comfortable with because it was what he wanted and even when he noticed her reticence it didn't seem to bother him. I'm not saying he forces her into anything but you could tell her heart wasn't in it and that took some of the enjoyment out of it for me. I was actually really pleased when Antonio started paying her so much attention and showing her what it was like to actually have someone put her first for a change. This was when the story really started to take off for me and I enjoyed seeing Pete realise that Emma had other options, his jealousy showed that he really did care for her and it shook some sense into him.There was one side character who got on my nerves from the beginning, Mallory just seemed so self centred and whiny and I couldn't for the life of me understand why Emma ended up becoming friends with her. I especially didn't like the games she was trying to play and it wasn't until right near the end of the book that I believed she was actually trying to help Emma and Pete rather than break them up. I think she was one of the main reasons I didn't like this book as much as I could have.One thing I definitely enjoyed was the beautiful island setting, it was very easy to picture the decadent resort and it's definitely somewhere I wouldn't mind visiting. I also loved the growing bond between Emma and the other women from the series. There were some great moments between them and I loved the holiday shower they threw along with the gifts they gave Emma. There is a lot of humour in the interactions between them and I'm definitely looking forward to reading Gillian's book because I think it's going to be brilliant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KW6C20O3MQ0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJW05H8#wasThisHelpful","R2KW6C20O3MQ0V","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series just gets better with every reread, I've actually lost count of how many times I've read these books over the years but the Old Kingdom trilogy will always have a special place in my heart and I'm excited that Garth Nix has decided to revisit the world again with Clariel. Before I start the new book I wanted to reread the original books again though and Abhorsen was just as fantastic as I remembered it being. It picks up the story almost immediately after the ending of the last book so Lirael and Sam are fighting against the clock to stop the necromancer Hedge from releasing an ancient and terrible power into the world. The fate of the entire kingdom is in their hands and with Sabriel and Touchstone across the wall in Ancelstierre Lirael and Sam only have the Disreputable Dog and Mogget to help them.The world building in this series is phenomenal, I love the river of death with the various gates and the way that necromancers are able to use the seven different bells to control spirits and move make them move through the gates. The bells are just as dangerous to the person ringing them though and wielding their power tends to corrupt the necromancers who use them. The Abhorsens aren't like most necromancers because they use the bells in a different way but they are in just as much danger when they step into the river. I love how Garth Nix describes the river, the gates and the creatures that roam there, he's great at writing creepy scenes and makes it incredibly easy to picture what is happening.The previous book had a lot of set up but here we get to see exactly what is going on with Nick and how he was tricked into helping Hedge. The free magic is having a huge impact on Nick and even though he suspects something is wrong he can't quite seem to focus long enough to figure out what is happening to him. This story starts with a bang and the tension continues to build until the explosive climax when our heroes are in for the fight of their lives. I don't really want to say too much about the plot so I'm going to focus more on the characters here. Lirael has really come into her own since she learnt about her true heritage, she is doing a lot of learning on the fly but she is determined to do whatever it takes to stop Hedge from achieving his goals. Sam has also done a lot of growing up and now he isn't under pressure as the Abhorsen in waiting he is able to get past his fears and find his own way to help Lirael. the Disreputable Dog and Mogget remain two of my favourite characters, they're just so much fun and I always enjoy the banter between them, they're also both incredibly powerful in their own right and here they have to decide how they're going to use that power.Abhorsen was a brilliant conclusion to the original trilogy but I'm excited to revisit this world and meet a whole new set of characters in Clariel. This is one of my favourite YA fantasy series and that hasn't changed since it was first published over 10 years ago!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HNGQBR1WVAG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060528737#wasThisHelpful","R1HNGQBR1WVAG5","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I might as well come straight out and admit it, I'm a huge fan of Rachel Vincent! I love both her young adult Soul Screamers series and her adult Shifters and Wildcats books so of course I knew I wanted to read The Stars Never Rise the moment I first heard about it. I didn't even need to read the blurb to sign up so I went into this with pretty much no idea what to expect. Once again this author has done what she's best at: created a richly detailed and well thought out world then populated it with characters you have to root for.This is set in a dystopian style future, where much of society as we know it has been destroyed by demons who are able to inhabit human bodies. The church has proved the existence of souls but unfortunately, since demons like to eat them, these souls are in short supply and there aren't enough to go around. The church has taken control and society has pretty much taken a step back in time, the church decide everything about people's lives, from who is allowed to have children to what jobs you are given and even down to which new babies are allowed to be given a soul. Nina's mother is a drug addict who is unable to hold down a job and provide for her daughters so Nina has taken on the responsibility of raising her younger sister Mellie. Life is tough and Nina has to resort to desperate measures just to put food on the table but anything is better than letting the church find out how bad things are and having the family separated.Nina has decided that she will dedicate her life to the church so that she can make sure Mellie is able to get a good education and have a future that will make her happy but all her sacrifices will come to nothing if people find out Mellie's secret. As if that wasn't bad enough Nina suddenly finds herself coming under increasing demon attacks and if it wasn't for the mysterious stranger Finn coming to her rescue she'd be dead for sure. Nina has no choice but to put her trust in Finn and his band of exorcist friends if she wants to survive but keeping Mellie safe is going to be a whole new issue.I really enjoyed The Stars Never Rise, the characters are great and I loved the close bond between Nina and her sister. In so many books we seem to see sisters at war against each other so it was nice to see how much they looked out for each other and that Nina is there for her sister in spite of the mistakes she has made. Nina is a really strong character, she has a great sense of right and wrong, she's intelligent and she will do whatever it takes to survive. Life isn't easy but she's a fighter and she's more than willing to join in with the exorcists when it comes to kicking demon butt. There is a hint of romance that I definitely hope will be expanded on as the series continues but I loved that the focus was mainly on family, friendship and survival. This was a fun book to read, the author has come up with some very unique ideas (something she really does excel at!) and this was a great introduction to the new world she has created. I can't wait to see what happens to Nina and her friends in the next instalment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ABAAVV82A6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574417X#wasThisHelpful","R14ABAAVV82A6Y","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved Rachel Vincent's Shifters series but although I was happy with the way the series ended I have missed the world and the characters over the last five years. So as soon as I found out about this new spin off series I pre-ordered my copy of Lion's Share and I started reading it the moment it appeared on my kindle. In fact, I read all night until I finished it at 8am because I was enjoying it so much! I've been a bit lax with my review writing this year though so I decided a reread was in order so I could rave about the story properly. I don't do much rereading and it's incredibly rare for me to reread a book more than once in a year so that's high praise indeed. Where the Shifters series is definitely urban fantasy, and all told from main character Faythe's point of view the Wildcats books are going to be more romance focused with each book featuring a different couple and told from dual perspectives.In this first instalment we finally get to see Jace's story and I loved every minute of it. I was always team Marc when I was reading the previous books because I thought he was a better fit for Faythe but I still loved Jace's character and was a little heartbroken for him when he was rejected. In the couple of years since the ending of Alpha Jace has been running his sister's Pride, he knows he'll have to leave when she gets married but for now he's enjoying being Alpha and has worked hard to make a success of things. Unfortunately he now has problems, there is a stray werecat in his territory murdering humans and they are bringing down far too much attention from the authorities. The Council aren't happy and they're questioning is authority so he needs to resolve things quickly if he doesn't want to loose his position.Abby is a survivor, she went through hell as a teenager but she came out the other side and has worked hard to gain her independence. She had a close circle of friends at college but if you read the short story, Hunt, which connects the two series you'll know that things haven't gone smoothly for her. This time when Abby was attacked she was able to fight back though and although the event has left lasting consequences she has come a long way from the scared child we first met. I loved seeing how much Abby has matured, she has really come into her own as a strong and independent woman. She loves wholeheartedly and she will do anything to protect the people she thinks of as her own.I absolutely loved the romance between Jace and Abby, considering her previous experience she is understandably nervous but Jace is very patient and makes it clear that things will only move forward at a pace she is comfortable with. There are some incredibly sweet moments between the two of them but they also have fantastic chemistry and Rachel Vincent manages to make even the most innocent interactions between them practically sizzle the pages. Although this story is focused more on the romance than the previous books were that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of other things going on to hold your interest. You have the intrigue over the stray werecat, there are hunters who have been stalking Abby, Abby herself is keeping some pretty major secrets and we are reminded just what a bunch of pompous old fools half of the alphas on the Council are. There is a major upheaval at the end of this book that is going to have a huge impact on the werecats and I can't wait to see how this plays out in the next instalment.I had so much fun being back in this world, it was great to catch a glimpse of characters I already knew and love but we have also been introduced to some new faces that I'm looking forward to spending more time with. I enjoyed this book so much that I've decided to dive straight into a reread of the Shifters series and I'm hoping that'll keep me going until the next book is released. Thank you Rachel Vincent for revisiting this world, I'm so excited to see where you're going to take us on this new journey with the Wildcats and I'll definitely be auto-buying anything else you release in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0ARG9KAYTG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692390545#wasThisHelpful","RL0ARG9KAYTG2","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review will be spoiler free for Timeless but will contain major spoilers for previous books so please don't continue reading unless you've already read as far as Heartless.I absolutely loved the earlier books in this series but for me it kind of started losing it's way in the last few books. I still enjoy the humour and I'm invested in the characters so I've kept reading but it just lost the little something that made it special. It started going wrong when Conall acted so badly when Alexia found out she was pregnant, I felt that she forgave his behaviour far too easily and I wanted to see him make more effort to apologise. I was glad that they got their relationship back on track though and I do enjoy the banter and bickering between them.What really threw me for a loop was their willingness to let Lord Akeldama adopt their daughter, I couldn't for the life of me understand why an alpha werewolf would let his daughter be raised by another man - especially a vampire! I would have expected Conall to be horrified by even the suggestion and I didn't think it really fitted Alexia's character either, no matter how pragmatic she usually is. For the pair of them to literally end up living secretly in Akeldama's closet to be close to their daughter just didn't sit well with me. It kind of felt like the vampires were constantly getting one over on the wolves, especially when Akeldama effectively tricked Alexia into giving Queen Nadasdy the Woolsey Manor! Once again Conall just kind of shrugged his shoulders and went along with it not even particularly angry that the vampires had effectively stolen his home and conned them out of lord only knows how much money it was worth.From that point on it's always been the vampires shouting orders while Alexia and Conall rush around doing their bidding and that continues into Timeless where they receive orders to visit one of the vampire queens in Egypt. I have to admit I enjoyed the journey to Alexandria, I loved little Prudence (who is now 2 years old) and I enjoyed the family interactions but I was so angry about the pack just going along with whatever the vampires wanted that it put me in a bad mood. This does tie up the series nicely though and I'm actually glad that it was the end of the series. I already have a copy of the first book in the spin off and I'm really hoping that Prudence's story won't have the issues that irritated me with this book. I'm sad that the final books in this series didn't live up to my expectations but I do enjoy this author's writing style so I'm willing to give her another chance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HAVWF34AQPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316402729#wasThisHelpful","R31HAVWF34AQPR","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have become a huge fan of Pamela Clare since I started reading her I-Team stories and even though I'm only three books in it's now become one of my favourite series. Every time I think the books can't possibly get better she proves me wrong and Unlawful Contact was definitely the best one yet. I was hooked in by the incredibly sweet prologue that introduces us to the teenage versions of Marc and Sophie. They shared one special night together before Marc left their home town to join the army and although they never kept in contact neither of them ever forgot the time they had together.Now, 12 years later Sophie is working as an investigative reporter and she's incredibly worried when one of her contacts, a recovering drug addict who she has been working with for months, disappears with her baby daughter. Sophie is sure that Megan wouldn't have started taking drugs again, not when she was so close to getting her baby back, and she is determined to find out what is really going on. When she is offered the chance to interview Megan's brother who is currently serving life in prison for murder, she has no idea that the person she is going to see is the boy who stole her heart all those years ago. Marc gave up everything to keep his sister safe and he knows there is more to her disappearance than meets the eye so he will do whatever it takes to get out of prison and search for her, even if that does mean taking the girl he once loved hostage.What follows is an edge of your seat thrill ride that had me desperately turning the pages trying to find out what would happen. I fell hard for Marc, even though he was a convicted murderer, and I have absolutely no doubt that if I was in his position I would have done exactly the same thing that he did. Sophie and Marc have history but she doesn't immediately fall for his charms, she doesn't take his word for things and does her own investigation into his past. She can see that things don't add up and when he saves her life more than once she starts to realise that there is a lot more going on that meets the eye. I was sceptical about this romance before I started reading it - I mean how was I supposed to get on board with a hero who literally kidnaps the heroine at gunpoint within the first couple of chapters? - but I was incredibly impressed that Pamela Clare not only convinced me but had me completely rooting for them as a couple. Marc and Sophie were perfect for each other and their romance was sweet, hot and sexy as hell. Marc is a genuinely good guy, he always puts other people first and he will stand up for the people he loves no matter what it costs him. I had my suspicions about a certain thing from fairly early on but even if I'd been proved wrong I would still have been 100% behind Marc and his actions.This series tackles some very difficult subjects that can make for uncomfortable reading at times - we've had big businesses trying to hide the environmental damage they are causing, political corruption, human trafficking and slavery and now we get a look at prison corruption and drug dealing - but it is always done in an incredibly informative way and it's obvious the author has a great deal of knowledge about these issues. In spite of the darkness to these stories she is also incredibly good at infusing some light hearted humour and fantastic romances. This series really is a perfect example of what good romantic suspense is all about and I can't wait to carry on reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BURCKJNSW3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425217620#wasThisHelpful","R25BURCKJNSW3O","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love the humour in Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate series but I have to admit I found myself disappointed with the turn this series has taken. It started going downhill for me in Blameless thanks to Conall's absolute refusal to believe his wife hadn't cheated on him, considering Alexia's preternatural abilities he should have been more willing to accept that he was the father of her baby but instead he spent most of the book in a drunken stupor believing she had been unfaithful. I felt that Alexia accepted his rather lacklustre apology far too easily so I was really hoping that she would make him work a bit in Heartless.I'm actually pleased that they've got their relationship back on track, in spite of a lack of much needed grovelling, but there were a whole bunch of new issues that annoyed me in this book. Alexia is now 8 months pregnant but instead of resting up like she's supposed to she is too busy fighting off zombie porcupines sent by the vampires to kill her. It seems that the vampires have put a target on her head because they are worried about what her child might become and now she's even more at risk than ever before. I'm going to keep this review fairly vague to avoid spoilers but I was really shocked with the solution they found to this dilemma, I just couldn't believe that either of them would consider it an acceptable option - especially a protective, possessive alpha male like Conall. I love Lord Akeldama's character and always find him amusing but I am not at all impressed with his new role in Alexia's life.As if vampire assassination plots aren't enough for Alexia to contend with she has also uncovered a plot against the queen and while trying to uncover what is going on she finds herself digging deeper into Conall's past. I enjoyed this side to the story, there were some interesting revelations about the Woolsey pack and I was pleased to see the banter back on track between the main couple but I've reached the point where I'm bored of Alexia's nasty younger sister Felicity and I was really shocked by what happened with the Westminster Hive. Once again they seemed to get one over on Alexia and Conall, it seems like the werewolves are constantly losing out to the vampires and that doesn't really give me much confidence in Conall's alpha status. He just seems to have gone from being the one who everyone is afraid of to someone that the entire supernatural community can walk all over and that's incredibly disappointing to me.I'm still interested to see how things play out in Timeless but unfortunately I'm no longer as excited over this series as I was through the first couple of books. Let's just hope the series ends on a high note.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R184MNDFR4CWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316402044#wasThisHelpful","R184MNDFR4CWH","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dawn has been in love with her brother's best friend for as long as she can remember and half the town knows how she feels even if Hawk has never done anything to encourage her. Hawk has secretly wanted Dawn for years but he's sure her brothers would never approve of them as a couple. His job is dangerous and every time he leaves town there's a risk he might never come back so the last thing he wants is to leave Dawn broken hearted. He's tired of fighting his feelings though and she's becoming harder and harder to resist. After spending one amazing night together Hawk's job unexpectedly catches up with him and now everyone he cares about is in danger, including Dawn and her family. Can he keep her safe or will he lose her forever?I've been dying to read Dawn and Hawk's story ever since they were introduced in the first book of the series. I had a feeling Hawk was going to be my favourite and I wasn't wrong, he's definitely a brilliant hero and Dawn's a lucky lady. This story was incredibly fun to read, a few of the town's busybodies have decided it's time for Dawn to land her man and they're not above meddling to get Hawk to admit his feelings for her. I spent a lot of time laughing at their antics and they're definitely not the usual tricks you'd expect from a couple of little old ladies. I also loved catching up with Dawn's brothers and their wives, I've enjoyed spending time with this family and it's great to see how far everyone has come since the beginning of the series.Unfortunately I don't think the romance was as well developed as it could have been, this seemed like a fairly short book and as much as I enjoyed the crazy antics as well as the suspense side to the story I think the relationship development between Dawn and Hawk suffered because it wasn't the main focus. Don't get me wrong - the sex was hot and there were a few really sweet moments between them but I had such high expectations for their book and I was slightly disappointed. This has still been a fun series though and it's one I'd recommend to people who enjoy small town romances. I love Rebecca Zanetti's writing and I'll definitely be checking out more books by her in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZ2AN4CRPD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM7LWPO#wasThisHelpful","R1EZ2AN4CRPD0","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second volume in the Masters of Seduction multi-author series containing stories by Lara Adrian, Donna Grant, Laura Wright and Alexandra Ivy. Although each novella in the series features a different main couple there is an overarching plot that carries across the whole series so I would recommend reading both volumes in order to get the most out of the reading experience.I'll give you a quick overview of the stories but I don't want to go into too much detail because it would be easy to give you spoilers:Priceless - Lara AdrianSorin is the Master of Ebarron and in control of the family's assets so when he is contacted by a young woman who wants to buy back one of the treasures they have purchased he isn't willing to let it go. Ashayla will do anything to get back her family heirloom, it's her grandmother's dying wish to have it back so she doesn't have much time to work with and she sets out to Sorin's casino with a plan to steal it. Unfortunately for her things don't go quite to plan and it might cost her more than she could ever have dreamed of to get back her grandmother's pendent. This was such a fun story, I loved how determined Ashayla was and really enjoyed the banter between her and Sorin.Boundless - Donna GrantNaomi knew nothing of the supernatural world until her sister was murdered by an incubus, now after reading her sister's diaries she has a suspect and she is determined to make sure Javan pays for his crime. Javan isn't a murderer but he is the Master of Drohas and since Naomi's sister was one of the artists that his family sponsored he is just as keen to find out who killed her. The pair have to work together to find out what really happened and the sparks are soon flying between them. Another enjoyable read and I though they were a really cute couple.Dauntless - Laura WrightCas may love to party and have fun but as Master of Trevanion he knows it is his duty to mate into a well connected family. His mother is determined to see him with someone who will help secure the family's link to royalty and she doesn't care whether Cas likes his intended mate or not. Then at the ball where is mating should be announced he spots a beautiful stranger and his life is turned upside down. This sweet and hot story was definitely my favourite in the anthology (that's 2 out of 2 for Laura Wright!), it's a Cinderella retelling which is probably one of the reasons I loved it so much, I'm a sucker for fairytales!Reckless - Alexandra IvyTiege is a play boy who loves nothing more than partying but he's had to step up and take over as Master of Furia after the death of his brother's mate. He isn't going to let his new role stop him from having fun though. Sloane is a former Nephilim Blade who has spent her whole life putting her duty above everything else. The two of them should be like oil and water but when Tiege is desperate to feed and Sloane is the only one available to help him the passion that flares between them is surprisingly hot. I enjoyed the connection between these two, I loved how noble Sloane is and it was fun to see Tiege's heart captured.Masters of Seduction is an enjoyable anthology of short but hot reads by some fantastic authors. As much as I would have loved for these stories to be longer so that more time could have been spend developing the different relationships if you're in the mood for something quick but satisfying then I'd recommend checking out this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDTYMC1F840B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099164753X#wasThisHelpful","RFDTYMC1F840B","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's no secret that I love Zoe Marriott's writing, I've been a fan of hers ever since I picked up Shadows on the Moon (which is still my favourite of her books and one I would HIGHLY recommend if you haven't already read it!) and her Name of the Blade trilogy has been outstanding. I'm always a little wary of trilogies because more often than not at least one of the books ends up being a disappointment but I knew that wouldn't be the case here and I'm happy to report that Frail Human Heart ends the series on the biggest possible high.I think all readers were probably left reeling at the end of Darkness Hidden (well I know I was!) so it's been a long wait for this book. Mio paid the ultimate price for saving the world and I was absolutely heartbroken right alongside her. Now she's grief stricken and terrified of losing anyone else that she cares about, she knows that she has to stop Izanami but she's worried about the upcoming battle and doesn't think she'll survive it. Luckily her friends and family aren't going to let her face her enemies alone, it was great to see how everyone had Mio's back and I loved that they all have a role to play in what is happening.I really don't want to say much about the plot but you should be prepared for epic battles, terrifying monsters, heartbreak and grief but also the strong bonds of love between friends and family. Zoe Marriott is an expert when it comes to Japanese mythology and I've loved the variety of creatures she has introduced us to from the friendly kitsune like Hikaru to the horrifying Jorogumo and many more in between. I have to also give a shout out to the side characters because they've all been fantastic and I particularly loved some certain developments in Jack's love life but I'm not going to say more about that for fear of spoilers. Frail Human Heart was an absolutely fantastic conclusion to this trilogy and I'm sure fans are going to love it just as much as I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKKJKFYG9TFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5HR418#wasThisHelpful","R2MKKJKFYG9TFF","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't tend to read a lot of YA contemporary romance these days but I've heard so many amazing things about author Sarah Dessen that I was kind of embarrassed to admit I'd not read any of her books. So when I was offered a review copy of Saint Anything I knew I had to give it a try and now I can really understand what all the fuss was about.Sydney has been living in the shadow of her perfect older brother Peyton for her whole life, even when Peyton started going off the rails and ended up in juvie he was the centre of their family. Sydney's whole life was turned upside down because of his behaviour but her parents hardly even notice her and she feels lost and completely alone. Starting at a new school she meets Layla and is introduced to the whole Chatham family. Layla's family allow Sydney to be completely herself, they actually seem to notice that she exists and she realises just how much she has been missing at home.My heart broke for Sydney, she has been through so much and she feels such terrible guilt for what her brother did but until she meets Layla and her family she's never had anyone who really seemed to care about her feelings. I was so angry with her parents, her father was pretty absent but her mother is so focused on Peyton that she forgets that Sydney needs her too. I could understand her wanting to stick by her son but the way she completely ignored Sydney's feelings was pretty hard to stomach and I wanted to shake some sense into her. Sydney is so confused, she has nobody to talk to about what happened and she's beating herself up for something that she didn't do. It was great to see Layla and her family take her under their wing and I absolutely loved Layla's older brother Mac.There is a really sweet romance that develops between Sydney and Mac but the focus of the story is definitely Sydney and her complicated relationship with her parents and her brother. It was great to see her finally take a stand and tell her family what she was going through and I was pleased that her parents eventually took notice. This story is all about family and finding your place, it's also about friendship and first love and so much more. It's a beautiful book and it's definitely made me realise I need to start working my way through Sarah Dessen's back list.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204PYIXBANZ8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451474708#wasThisHelpful","R204PYIXBANZ8L","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have absolutely loved reading the Edge books and I'm actually kind of gutted that Steel's Edge was the last one but if you're going to end a series then what better way to end than with a high like this! These books grabbed my attention from the beginning but they really did get better and better and Steel's Edge was probably my favourite. Any time I pick up a book by Team Andrews I know I'm going to love it, they excel at kick butt heroines, fantastic character development, relationships with depth to them and of course off the charts action and you'll get all that and spades in this book.When healer Charlotte gets her heart broken she decides to leave her life in the Weird behind her and she goes to the edge looking to start afresh. Life may be very different now but she's made a home for herself and enjoys using her healing abilities to help the locals, it's not easy to earn the trust of the edgers but she's made some very good friends and she's happy with her lot in life. All until one terrible day when a badly injured man is brought to her door, Charlotte is determined to save his life but his enemies aren't far behind him and suddenly she finds herself in the centre of a battle that could destroy everything she's worked so hard to build for herself. Now that Charlotte is involved she isn't going to sit back and meekly let her enemies get away with it so she sets out to rescue Richard and to claim her revenge.As someone with incredible healing powers you wouldn't necessarily expect Charlotte to be a fighter but she's actually one of the most deadly heroines we've met in the series so far. She has a darkness inside her that she's constantly fighting but when her buttons are pushed she will push back hard. Imagine someone who has the ability to cure illnesses, now imagine that she knows exactly how the body works and that she can reverse her ability to actually make someone sick. Imagine the plague she could bring down on the heads of the people who have wronged her. Yes, Charlotte isn't someone you want to be on the bad side of and I loved how capable she is. She is actually a perfect match for Richard, they're both incredibly noble and always try to do the right thing, they protect the people they care about and their own safety is the last thing they think of. When Charlotte finds out more about the gang of human traffickers that Richard has been trying to take down she knows she has to do something to help him no matter what it costs her.Steel's Edge is darker than the previous books, Charlotte and Richard are about to unleash a whole world of hurt on their enemies and I loved every minute of it. You'll still find the humour you'd expect from Ilona Andrews but there are also a lot of battles and a fair amount of blood and gore. These characters are fabulous, they have such depth to them that you'll feel like you met real, living people by the time you've finished the book. They're both messed up in different ways but they compliment each other perfectly and where one is weaker the other compensates for it. I loved seeing them work together and I really enjoyed the developing romance, here are two people who have spent their whole lives doing right by others and it was about time that they took something for themselves. It was great to catch up with some of the previous characters too and I just loved the whole story from beginning to end. I'm really happy that some characters from these books are now starting to appear in the Innkeeper's Chronicles which is another excellent series from this husband and wife team and I'm definitely going to continue auto-buying anything that they write in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KP5ROMKXNUAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937007820#wasThisHelpful","R2KP5ROMKXNUAB","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read nearly all of Ilona and Gordon Andrews' books over the last couple of years but there are still a few short stories that I needed to get around to and Of Swine and Roses was one of them. Then I found out that this was actually the first story set in the Hidden Legacy world so since I loved Burn for Me I knew I had to pick this up ASAP.This short story introduces us to teenager Alena Kornov who is under pressure from her family to date Chad Thurman, a boy from one of the local families who they need a favour from. Alena has absolutely no interest in Chad but her mother is a master of guilt manipulation and Alena ends up agreeing to her demands. What follows is an absolutely hilarious first date from hell. I'm not going to say any more than that so you'll just have to read it for yourself but it was definitely a fun read.It's official, team Andrews can do no wrong! Even in a 23 page short story they manage to hook me completely in and get me fully invested in the characters they've created. I actually would have loved to see this turned into a full length novel but it was surprisingly satisfying for such a short read. I do kind of hope that we might get a glimpse at these characters in one of the Hidden Legacy books though so I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that they'll make an appearance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S2PN8JN3SSRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QT6ZPK#wasThisHelpful","R2S2PN8JN3SSRP","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Asking for It touches on a bit of a controversial subject and I'll warn you now that if you have triggers it's probably a book you need to stay well clear of. There are flashbacks to scenes of rape and abuse, not between the main characters but to things that have happened to them or that they witnessed, so that is understandably going to make some people uncomfortable. I don't tend to read many dark books but I like to step out of my comfort zone occasionally and I was intrigued by this one.I'm not a fan of the term ""rape fantasy"" because I don't think things are that simple, there is a very big difference between a woman fantasising about rough, out of control, sex with a guy (even a stranger) that she finds attractive to her being forced into something against her will by someone that she may or may not be interested in sexually. I don't have a problem with someone wanting to give up control and experience a darker side to sex but I really don't think the word rape should be used to describe it. The very fact that Vivienne is fantasising about sex with Jonah, that everything they do is discussed in detail before it happens and that they have set rules in place to make sure everything is completely consensual meant I was able to enjoy reading the sex scenes between them. They definitely both like things on the rough side but there is no denying the chemistry between them or how mind-blowingly hot this story was.What I really enjoyed about Asking for It was how well we got to know the main characters, even though the story is told from Vivienne's point of view I felt like I got to see a bit of what made Jonah tick and I really liked them both. They're both more than a little messed up thanks to things from their past but I enjoyed seeing them get to know each other and it was good to see Vivienne starting to accept her desires and realise that there was nothing wrong with her kink. They go into things determined to keep their relationship purely sexual, they will indulge in their wildest fantasies together but they have no plans to get to know each other or start dating. Of course now that they've both found the person who can give them everything they ever wanted it's not quite as simple as that and it doesn't take long before the lines begin to blur. It was fascinating to see the growing connection between them and I liked that it wasn't all about the sex.This isn't the kind of story that gives you a happily ever after, or even really a happily for now, but I have extremely high hopes that they'll be able to make things work eventually and I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of the sequel Begging for It. Lilah Pace has tackled a difficult subject with sensitivity, she made me believe in both of these characters and want to see them get the love that they deserve. She's definitely an author to watch out for and her future books will be going to the top of my to read pile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GFJMKV1AZ3CM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425279510#wasThisHelpful","R1GFJMKV1AZ3CM","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chinese government has spent the last forty years creating the most spectacular zoo the world has ever seen and now they're ready to share it. They have invited a small group of prominent international journalists for an exclusive VIP tour so that they can go out and spread the word before the grand opening. China's best kept secret is about to be exposed and nobody will be expecting the majestic beasts that await them but is the zoo really as safe as they think it is?It's been a long time since I've had so much fun reading a novel and I devoured all 544 pages of The Great Zoo of China in a single day. I've seen a lot of comparisons between this novel and Jurassic Park and to be honest I can completely understand why, in fact the author states that Jurassic Park is one of his favourite novels and I very much got the feeling that this is an homage to the original story. In spite of the similarities I feel that Matthew Reilly has done enough to make this stand on it's own two feet, he did a fantastic job of creating a believable mythology for his dragons and how the Chinese discovered them and he really brought the animals to life.Reading this novel is like watching a movie, I could totally see this appearing on the big screen and you can be sure I'd be first in line to buy a ticket. The action is pretty much non stop and the characters bounce around from one crazy situation to the next surviving against impossible odds. You have to take things with a grain of salt, it's like the best possible blockbuster films where you know the events are ridiculous but you're having so much fun waiting to see what will happen next that you just don't care.These dragons are big, they're intelligent and they have a plan. All that remains to be seen is whether they can be stopped and who will live to tell the tale. I honestly don't want to say too much more about the plot so I'll just tell you to expect the unexpected, buckle up and enjoy the ride. You can't take this novel too seriously, it's meant to be fun and I'm pretty sure you're meant to be rolling your eyes at the ridiculousness of it but I'm sure you're going to enjoy every minute of it. This was my first book my Matthew Reilly but it definitely won't be my last and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5JSEDOYSMFIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476749558#wasThisHelpful","R5JSEDOYSMFIE","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Curious Case of the Werewolf That Wasn't, the Mummy That Was, and the Cat in the Jar is a short story set in the world of Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate series that gives readers the chance to meet Alexia's father Alessandro Tarabotti. Although this technically is a prequel I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point if you're new to the series but if you've already read at least Soulless then you'll probably enjoy this glimpse into the past.I've been wanting to know more about Alessandro's past ever since I first started reading the series so I had high hopes for this story but while it was a fun read I have to admit I think it needed to be longer. At only 32 pages we don't get much of a chance to get to know the characters, it was great to see another side to butler Floote but the length of the story doesn't allow for much character development of Alessandro or anyone else. I was excited when I realised we were witnessing his first meeting with Alexia's mother but it was incredibly brief and didn't even seem to show him being attracted to her so I have no idea how they ended up married which is one of the biggest mysteries of the series!This story does have all of the humour you'd expect from this author, I liked the Egyptian setting and I did enjoy seeing Alessandro working a case for the Templars but I think it could have been a much more satisfying read if it had been at least double the length.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91NRRBZAO6H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEWYNXS#wasThisHelpful","R91NRRBZAO6H5","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsUnforgotten is the second book in Jessica Brody's Unremembered trilogy and picks up a couple of months after the ending of the first book. Seraphina and Zen have fled back to 1609 to escape the Diotech scientists and if they can just keep their heads down there is no way they can ever be traced. Unfortunately while Zen has settled in quite quickly Seraphina is struggling and the villagers look at her with suspicion in their eyes. When Zen becomes ill and an accident causes Seraphina to be accused of witchcraft she suddenly finds herself in more danger than ever before and she may just have to team up with the enemy if she wants to save the boy she loves.I really enjoyed Unremembered so I was looking forward to continuing the series and seeing what happened to Seraphina next. I really enjoyed the beginning of the book, it was great to see Seraphina and Zen so happy together and I was enjoying the glimpse into the past through their eyes, everything is so different to what they were used to but neither of them cared about missing modern conveniences as long as they were together. Then Zen got ill and things started going horribly wrong, Seraphina's actions caused a record of her existence to be created which meant Diotech were able to track her down and suddenly Kaelen is on the scene. Kaelen was created by Diotech just like Seraphina and he has all of her abilities and then some so Seraphina is in deep trouble. There is something hidden deep in her memory that Diotech wants and when Kaelen promises to give Seraphina the cure Zen desperately needs she has no choice but to travel with him into the future while she tries to unlock her memories.I hate to say it but I was disappointed by Unforgotten, it isn't a bad book and I definitely still want to finish the series but for me this just didn't quite live up to the potential of the first story. I think I was just disappointed that Seraphina and Zen were apart for so much of the story, after everything they'd been through together I wanted to see them continuing to work as a team. I definitely wasn't happy that it seemed like a convenient way to introduce Kaelen as a potential love interest, I would have been fine with him as an enemy or a potential ally but I didn't want or need a love triangle in this series. Come on authors, how many times do we have to read these trilogies where the main plot point is a love triangle? I'm so sick to death of that trope that I'm actually bored of complaining about it. It's definitely makes me wary of picking up new series and I hate that.So if I wasn't so annoyed at the triangle I probably would have enjoyed this more, there was plenty of action, some intriguing plot twists and it was interesting to see the future the way Jessica Brody has imagined it. I'm invested in these characters enough that I want to see how things resolve themselves so I will be picking up the final book but I am now more wary about reading it and my expectations have definitely been lowered. Let's just hope that the series can end on the high note that it started with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DRHEZC7C0R90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250056969#wasThisHelpful","R3DRHEZC7C0R90","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When investigative reporter Tessa Novak witnesses a young girl being gunned down in a drive by shooting she becomes determined to find out what happened to her. Her investigation leads her to Julian Darcangelo, an undercover FBI agent, who she initially suspects of being the young girl's murderer. The last thing Julian needs is a reporter drawing attention to him, he has been working for years to bring down a ring of human traffickers and he's closer than ever to getting justice for their victims. It's not only a case of keeping Tessa quiet though, he also needs to keep her safe now that she's drawn attention from the dangerous gang who will think nothing of destroying as many lives as it takes to keep the money rolling in.Hard Evidence is the second book in Pamela Clare's I-Team series and I enjoyed it even more than the first. This is a fantastically written series with great characters, intense story lines, incredible action and steamy romance. I love how realistic these characters are, witnessing the shooting has a lasting effect on Tessa, not only does it make her realise how precious life is but it also brings out her protective instincts. It may be too late for the girl who was killed but she wants to get answers for her family and she wants to make sure the same thing doesn't happen to someone else. She's incredibly brave to keep looking for answers even when it becomes clear that she is attracting dangerous attention but she isn't stupid and she knows when she needs to ask for help. I loved how courageous Tessa was and I liked that she had a strict code of morals that she wouldn't cross, even to get a story, which is something that can't be said for her boss.Julian has spent years working this case, his dedication has cost him everything and it's all he can focus on. Good men died fighting this gang and Julian will do whatever it takes to bring them down permanently. The last thing he needs is a reporter getting in the way but Tessa brings out all his protective instincts and he has to keep her safe, it's not easy for him to trust her though and he worries that anything he tells her will turn up printed in the next day's newspaper. Although the two of them are instantly attracted to each other I was pleased that it took time for them to learn to trust each other and to start working together. Julian was very secretive and broody but he's also quite sweet when he wants to be and he was definitely sexy as hell.I think one of the things I love most about this series is how much insight it gives into some horrific crimes, Pamela Clare does a great job of showcasing how human trafficking victims are treated in this instalment and it's not always comfortable reading. It never feels gratuitous but it's definitely a learning curve and it shows how important it is that we have people like Julian and Tessa out there putting their lives at risk to stop the bad guys. As much as parts of the story are quite dark this series still contains a lot of humour which helps to lighten the mood. The reporters on the I-Team all have a great bond and I loved seeing their interactions, they were protective and caring but also very nosey and enjoy snooping on each other. I also thought the blend of romance and suspense was pretty much perfect, we get a whole heap of action but the relationship development was satisfying too. This is quickly becoming a favourite series and I can't wait to start the next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYPRTQADIO0ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425212602#wasThisHelpful","RYPRTQADIO0ZA","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heaven Can't Wait is a novella in Pamela Clare's I-Team series but I think it's best to point out that this is more of a straight up contemporary romance than a romantic suspense like the rest of the series. It's an excellent read and one I'd definitely recommend but if you go in looking for suspense then you could end up disappointed. What you'll get instead is a super hot, incredibly sweet and sexy romance between two fantastic characters and if you're anything like me you'll love every minute of it.Lissy and Will are crazy about each other and with only two weeks to go before their wedding everyone knows it. Lissy wants to make sure their wedding night is special so she suggests to Will that they hold off on having sex until the big day. Will isn't keen on the idea but when Lissy turns it into a bet with the first person to ask for sex having to pay a forfeit he can't resist. Egged on by a few of their friends they both set out to make the other cave first and it doesn't take long before things are really spicing up between them.This was a fab little novella and it was a great way to get to know some of the side characters from the series a little better. We also get cameo roles from some other familiar faces which was nice but I loved that Lissy and Will were the real focus of the story. They are a fantastic couple who are clearly madly in love, the sex was scorching and the banter between them and their friends was incredibly amusing. If you're looking for a quick, hot read then you really can't go wrong with this and I'd highly recommend checking out the rest of the series too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HA7E445AGRXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BRBCG0#wasThisHelpful","R2HA7E445AGRXF","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsThe end of Changeless saw Alexia discover that she was pregnant then immediately get accused of infidelity by her husband Conall. She has now returned from Scotland and after Conall told her he never wanted to see her again she's had to resort to moving back in with her family. We've all seen just how badly her mother and stepsisters treated her before so having her move back home in disgrace hasn't improved their relationship at all, especially not when the whole of London is talking of her assumed indiscretion. Alexia is determined to find out more about the abilities of the Soulless so that she can clear her name but when it becomes clear that the vampires have decided to execute her she realises it might be time to leave London. She sets out to Italy in search of the Templars in the hope that they'll have the information she desperately needs but danger isn't far behind her and she's going to have to figure things out quickly if she wants to survive.I was incredibly disappointed with Conall's behaviour at the end of the previous book, I can understand why he was sceptical because werewolves can't have children but surely the fact that his wife's touch turns him human should be enough to make him pause before accusing her of something so horrible. It was the fact that he didn't even speak to her that really annoyed me, she wasn't even given a chance to defend herself before he had her thrown out of the house and basically abandoned her. Alexia is rightly mad at her husband and even though she wants to prove to him that he's the father she isn't so sure she can forgive him for doubting her, something I couldn't blame her for in the slightest. I was hoping that Conall would come to his senses quite quickly but he spends the majority of the first half of the book drinking away his sorrows and feeling sorry for himself. Meanwhile Alexia is dealing with the shock of her pregnancy, the disapproving frowns wherever she goes and multiple attempts on her life thanks to the vampires.The poor girl has a lot on her plate but she copes admirably and I was pleased that she takes action rather than sits around mooning. Alexia has always been a practical woman and that really shows here, she reaches out to a few trusted allies and before we know it she is on her way to Italy with Madame Lafoux and Floote for company. As I'm sure anyone who is familiar with this series would expect plenty of hijinx ensue and Alexia is in for quite an adventure as she crosses Europe. One thing I was really pleased with is that Conall's second, Professor Lyall, believes Alexia is innocent. He tries talking sense into his alpha but the man is stubborn as hell and he's so drunk on formaldehyde that it takes quite a while for the truth to sink in.I have to admit that as much as I still love Alexia and I enjoyed seeing her adventures I'm still annoyed at Conall. He takes far too long to come to his senses and when he finally did go after Alexia it was a case of too little too late for me. I expected him to do some major grovelling and for Alexia to make him work at earning her forgiveness so I was angry that she took him back so quickly and I'm no longer feeling quite so confident in their relationship. I'm hoping that we will see him really make amends to her in the next book, he's made a start but he has a long way to go in my eyes before I'll forgive him completely.As much as Conall irritated me I still really enjoyed the rest of the story, there are lots of crazy antics, the story moved at a fast pace and this whole series really keeps me on my toes wondering what could possibly happen next. I'm very curious to see how Alexia copes with impending motherhood, she seemed quite cold when she thought about the baby in the beginning but by the end of the story it is obvious she has already become quite attached to the ""infant-inconvenience"" and I think it'll be fun to see her as a mother. Whatever happens I think the baby is going to make life interesting for the whole pack and it's sure to have a knock on effect when it comes to the whole supernatural community so I'm definitely looking forward to Heartless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSB1ZB7X5V4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316401765#wasThisHelpful","ROSB1ZB7X5V4N","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simon was one of my favourite characters throughout the Disillusionists trilogy so I was really excited to find out that Carolyn Crane had given him his own story. When I first saw he was being paired up with Fawna I wasn't convinced though, the two of them are so different that I wasn't sure what they would really see in each other but I actually think that's what made them work so well.We already know how reckless Simon is, he is constantly taking risks and putting himself in harm's way but we never really understood why so it was great to get a bit of his back story. I'm not going to go into details but it was surprisingly emotional. Fawna is a character we didn't know much about and to be honest I'd still like to learn more about where she spent her missing years but I found myself really liking her in this story. She tries so hard not to use her gift of seeing the future but it's not easy to resist and it was interesting to see her fighting herself not to check the fate of people she encountered.Simon and Fawna start as enemies, Simon has a very good reason for not wanting to know the future and Fawna is unable to stop looking at it so they're more natural enemies than lovers. Their differences actually work for them though, they have such a completely different outlook on things and Simon was great at teaching Fawna to live in the present and just enjoy life rather than worry about what fate might be about to throw at her later. Things move fairly quickly between then and as much as I would have loved a longer story with them spending more time getting to know each other I still really enjoyed this novella.Devil's Luck was a nice addition to the Disillusionists trilogy & I liked it much more than the first novella starring Sophia. There are actually a few other characters who I would love to read stories about so it would be great if Carolyn Crane decided to give us a story about Shelby, Carter or any of the others but it's been such a long time since this was published that I think it's unlikely. I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for her future publications though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWUXY3K6NA4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EAZRKC#wasThisHelpful","RTWUXY3K6NA4H","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please be aware that although this review will be spoiler free for Head Rush it will contain spoilers for previous books so please don't carry on reading if you're not up to date with the series.After the horrendous cliffhanger at the end of Double Cross I was incredibly relieved that I didn't have to wait a year for the release of Head Rush and I was able to dive straight into the story to find out what happens next. I just couldn't believe it, after all that time I've spent waiting for Justine to realise that Packard was the one and then Otto goes and has her memory wiped! How could he do that?! I'll admit I was a bit scared when I picked up this book, I really worried that we'd have another whole book of Justine fighting her feelings for Packard and waxing on about how wonderful Otto is. Luckily that isn't quite what happens but you're just going to have to read it for yourself to find out what we get instead.I've had a bit of a rocky relationship with Justine throughout the series, at first I found her hypochondria quite endearing and I definitely love that she's such a unique character but eventually her inner monologue started to get on my nerves and I spent a fair chunk of both the first two books wanting to shake some sense into her. Luckily she started to improve a lot at the end of Double Cross and I actually found myself liking her all the way through this story. After brutally murdering Avery Otto had Justine's memory revised so that she now believes she watched Packard commit the crime, but even though she saw it with her own two eyes her heart struggles to accept that version of events. Deep down she is certain that Packard could never do something like that and it's left her incredibly confused. Otto has used Justine's vulnerability to talk her into marrying him and with the wedding fast approaching she is going to have to look deep inside herself and try to decide what she really wants from life.It was really interesting to see the effects the revision had on Justine, she seemed much more vulnerable in this instalment but at the same time she finds an inner strength I wasn't sure she actually had. When she sets her mind to find out the truth she really comes into her own and I found it very easy to root for her. Of course I've loved Packard from the beginning, even when he was being manipulative, so I was pleased by how much time we got to spend with him in this book. There were some fantastic scenes with him that definitely made me love him more than ever. Shelby is still recovering from a broken heart but I love the friendship between her and Justine. Shelby is always a voice of reason who will tell Justine exactly what she needs to hear and she is always there for her friend which is wonderful to see. Simon has made me laugh throughout the whole series but he outdid himself here, I'm just going to tell you to watch out for the scene when they're shopping for bridesmaid dresses because it was absolutely hilarious!Overall I thought Head Rush was a great conclusion to the trilogy but I was a little disappointed that a couple of plot threads were left open. A few things were slightly rushed towards the end and I think adding a couple more chapters could have tied it all together perfectly. Either way this is a trilogy I'd be happy to recommend, it's like nothing else I've read and the idea of the Disillusionists is completely unique. I'll definitely be looking out for more from this author in the future and I'd be thrilled if she decided to revisit these characters again in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APYKL8V24ZBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006BDKTBK#wasThisHelpful","R2APYKL8V24ZBD","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsThis story was originally released as a 5 part serialized novel (Play Me Wild, Play Me Hot, Play Me Hard, Play Me Real and Play Me Right) but has since been released as a bind up called Play Me: The Complete Story. Although I read this in instalments I'm posting a single review for the entire book. This story works as a complete stand alone but it does feature a cameo appearance from Ethan Frost who has his own series.Aria has left her family and her controlling father behind her and is struggling to make ends meet working as a cocktail waitress in a local casino. When she loses her temper with one of the casino's big spenders who was getting a little too rough she knows she's blown it and is sure to lose her job but she hadn't counted on the new boss. Sebastian never intended to take over his father's casino but when he is called in run the show after his father suffers a heart attack he quickly realises that things have got to change. He won't tolerate his staff being treated poorly no matter who the client is and he's determined to shake things up a bit. The connection between Aria and Sebastian is instant and intense but will Aria risk everything by sleeping with the boss?One thing I can say for sure about Play Me is that it's hot as hell, Sebastian is a delicious Dom who knows exactly what he wants and he's not used to being denied. The sex scenes in this story are absolutely scorching and it was very, very easy to see why Aria would fall under Sebastian's spell, I'd certainly find him impossible to resist! This is only the second book I've read by Tracy Wolff but it definitely won't be the last, in fact after seeing the cameo from Ethan Frost I'm planning on diving into his series very soon.As much as I loved the chemistry between Sebastian and Aria I did feel things moved far too quickly between them. I guess that this is probably because of the serialised format - you have to hook readers into the relationship very quickly and keep them there to make sure they want to continue reading. I just think it could have been so much better if we'd been made to wait for the characters to act on their intense attraction, I think as it was everything happened so fast that I struggled to believe it. This was especially true when you learn more about Aria's background, I don't think there is any way that someone who has been through what she had would be so quick to jump into an affair with a man in such a position of power over her. It wasn't even the speed of them getting down to it that I had an issue with (although I think that was fast too!) but within a week of meeting they were head over heels in love and thinking of marriage and I didn't feel like they'd taken enough time getting to know each other outside of the bedroom.I may have had an issue with the speed of their relationship but I still really enjoyed their story, I love the author's writing style and I would pick up another book about these characters if the author decided to write one. In the meantime I'll definitely be devouring the Ethan Frost series and keeping an eye out to see if Sebastian and Aria make an appearance in there too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FXP56LMZEJAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSSYS4K#wasThisHelpful","R1FXP56LMZEJAQ","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It wasn't even the speed of them getting down to it that I had an issue with (although I think that was fast too!) but within a week of meeting they were head over heels in love and thinking of marriage and I didn't feel like they'd taken enough time getting to know each other outside of the bedroom.I may have had an issue with the speed of their relationship but I still really enjoyed their story, I love the author's writing style and I would pick up another book about these characters if the author decided to write one. In the meantime I'll definitely be devouring the Ethan Frost series and keeping an eye out to see if Sebastian and Aria make an appearance in there too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNAWRLGZ5228/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6V6AHG#wasThisHelpful","R1XNAWRLGZ5228","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jessica Sorensen is one of my favourite NA authors, she always creates such realistic characters, ones who are deeply messed up and who don't always deal with their problems in the healthiest ways but that just makes them all the more compelling to read about. Breaking Nova is about two of these damaged people and about one of them learning to move forward with their life. It doesn't really end with a happily ever after but I'm kind of hopeful that these characters will sort themselves out eventually and I'm looking forward to following their journey.Nova lost the love of her life when he committed suicide and she was traumatised when she found the body. Quinton survived the car crash that killed both his girlfriend and his cousin but because he was the driver he blames himself for what happened and suffers with survivors guilt. They're both in a bad way and have turned to drink and drugs as a way to make the pain stop. I definitely don't agree with a lot of the choices they make but it's easy to understand why they act the way they do. Their lives have been turned upside down and they've got to make the choice to get past what happened so they can find a way to move forward.I think Breaking Nova was probably the darkest book I've read by Jessica Sorensen but I absolutely loved it. This isn't always an easy book to read, in fact at times it's downright depressing, but I enjoyed seeing Nova make such huge changes in her life. She has had it tough but she has come out on the other side stronger than ever and I was really proud of her. On the other hand Quinton is still heading towards rock bottom, I'm kind of scared to see how much harder things are going to get for him before he manages to pick himself back up but I have confidence that he can do it. What I really appreciated was that the romance between them doesn't automatically solve all their issues, they still have to find a way to deal with the past. Nova has some difficult decisions to make but I really felt like she did the right thing and it was good to see her put herself first for a change.This was a heart wrenching story that really tugged at my emotions and I can't wait to see these characters continue to turn their lives around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6AM2KNDNWVWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455582719#wasThisHelpful","R6AM2KNDNWVWZ","A2EU9VP0MRMUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EU9VP0MRMUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Casquette Girls by Arlys Arden is a young adult paranormal romance story.  Adele Le Moyne (just turned sixteen) is returning home to New Orleans with her father after being away for two months.  They had to evacuate the state (Louisiana) when a big hurricane came through the area and then stalled causing considerable damage.  Adele was sent to live with her mother, Brigitte Dupre in Paris (who put her in a boarding school) while her father, Macalister (Mac) Le Moyne worked in Miami.  They do not know what they will find when they return to their home and the bar that her father owns.After arriving home strange things start happening to Adele.  She can move metal items with her mind.  What is going on?  She then finds a journal of her ancestor Adeline Saint Germain that provides some needed information along with some new friends who have some interesting abilities.  Adele and her new friends are going to have to work together to battle the vampires that have invaded New Orleans (and are killing off the citizens of the city).  Will these three teenagers be able to battle the evil in their community?I enjoyed The Casquette Girls.  It is a long novel, but once you get involved in the book you do not notice.  Some sections are a little slow (especially when Adele is ogling the handsome vampire), but I enjoyed how the author tied the past (Adele’s ancestor) to the present.  Some things are a little predictable (like the truth about Adele’s mother—I could see that coming from the very beginning—sorry I do not want to spoil your reading pleasure), but overall The Casquette Girls is a good book to read.  I give The Casquette Girls 4 out of 5 stars.  The writing is good, but Adele’s temper (which always seemed to be out of control) really got on my nerves after a while.  I also enjoyed this author’s paranormal take on the young girls who came from France with their casquettes (casket shaped luggage).  While this is a young adult novel, I think it can be enjoyed by readers of all ages.  I will be watching for more books from Arlys Arden.I received a complimentary copy of The Casquette Girls from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPZGZFJYVF0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SXYWO8#wasThisHelpful","R3KPZGZFJYVF0F","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Death Before Decaf by Caroline Fardig is A Java Jive Mystery novel.  Juliet Langley is turning thirty years old and is returning home to Nashville.  Juliet is a lovely singer, but unable to perform because of severe stage fright.  Juliet was running a café of her own until her scum bag (pardon my language) fiancé cleaned out her accounts, apartment, and left town with the café’s best waitress.  Juliet has gotten a job as manager of the Java Jive where she worked while she was in college.  On her first day Juliet has a run in with the chef, Dave (who likes to violate the health codes).  The next thing you know Dave is dead behind Java Jive.  Juliet is told by Detective Cromwell (of the MNPD) that she is a person of interest.  Juliet sets out to prove her innocence (no matter what the consequences).  Pete Bennett (who owns the Java Jive) who is Juliet’s best friend helps her clear her name.  Juliet also gets help from Seth Davis, a professor from the college, who has been hanging out at Java Jive.  Pete distrusts Seth (he has good instincts), but Juliet refuses to listen (especially since she cannot stand Pete’s girlfriend who is her arch nemesis).  Will Juliet be able to clear her name and find the culprit (and stay alive)?I liked the mystery in Death Before Decaf.  It was not as easy to solve as I thought it would be.  It was more complicated which I enjoyed (I like difficult puzzles).  I did not enjoy the foul language or the sex in the book.  I like to read cozy mysteries because they do not contain bad language (there are many creative alternatives) or overt sex (I am not a prude.  I just get tired of it being shoved in our faces).  I give Death Before Decaf 3 out of 5 stars.  A good start to a new series.  I am hoping the next book will be much better (I am trying to be optimistic).I received a complimentary copy of Death Before Decaf from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIIWGFZQ13XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOYNDKK#wasThisHelpful","R1WIIWGFZQ13XZ","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yappy Hour by Diana Orgain is a new cozy mystery novel.  Maggie has just moved to Pacific Cove, California.  Maggie was a financial advisor in New York.  She has applied for a position with Riviera Cruise Line which is new to the area.  Two reasons Maggie moved to Pacific Cove were her sister, Rachel, and her Uncle Ernest (aka Grunkly).  Maggie gets a text message from her sister asking her to watch the bar The Wine and Bark for a few days.  Rachel does not give her any other information (like who will be the bartender since Maggie has no experience, what type of food she serves, etc.).  Maggie heads over to the bar and finds it open.  She enters and finds Yolanda (a local woman who makes handbags shaped like animals and are extremely ugly but expensive) standing over a man on the floor.  Dan Walters, manager of DelVecchio’s (the restaurant next door) is dead on the floor.Officer Brad Brooks is the police officer assigned to the case.  Since Rachel left town very suddenly (just broke up with Dan and he was trying to close down her bar), she is an immediate suspect.  Maggie wants to prove that Rachel could not have committed the crime (and find out where she went).  Will Maggie be able to keep Rachel out of jail?I found Yappy Hour to be slightly idiotic.  Maggie is a contradiction.  We are told that she was in finance in New York (had a high paying job until the economy tanked), but she acts like a bumbling idiot (and I mean that she is lacking in intelligence and reasoning skills) throughout most of the book.  The sight of a hunky man renders her speechless (several times throughout the book).  The most interesting character in the book was Uncle Ernest.  He was fun and entertaining.  He keeps everything (a hoarder), likes to bet on horse races (horses that do not win), and is very friendly.  I did, though, like the mystery in the book.  We did not get a lot of clues (instead we got talk of food and romance), but I liked that the murder was not easy to solve (I did solve it, but not until I was about halfway through the book).  I give Yappy Hour 3 out of 5 stars (satisfactory or okay).  I just think it needs a little work (like not making Maggie—a college graduate—out to be moronic).I received a complimentary copy of Yappy Hour from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRELO7OZHAZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1HFIAM#wasThisHelpful","R1XRELO7OZHAZJ","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Pain in the Tuchis by Mark Reutlinger is the second book in a Mrs. Kaplan Mystery series.  Rose Kaplan and her sidekick, Ida Berkowitz live at the Julius and Rebecca Cohen Home for Jewish Seniors.  Vera Gold (who was a pain in everyone’s tuchis) just passed away (on Yom Kippur).  Her sister, Fannie Kleinberg does not believe that Vera died from a natural death (since she was getting better after having been ill) and asks Rose to look into the matter.  Rose had previous success solving a crime and has been helpful in finding items for residents (and solving disputes).  Rose and Ida start talking to various people to find out what happened to Vera Gold.  When it turns out that Vera was poisoned, Rose will have to try and narrow down the suspect pool (since Vera managed to alienate everyone she met) to find the killer.I found A Pain in the Tuchis to be just a satisfactory novel.  The story is told from Ida’s perspective so we do not know everything Rose is thinking and doing during the book (which leaves us missing clues since she is the one solving the crime).  There are also many (way too many) Yiddish phrases in the book (some are explained and some are not).  The mystery was extremely easy to solve (though the author tries to mislead the reader).  There are also several side stories going on during the book (Motorcycle Moishe who wants to date Ida, Sol and his issues with his mother-in-law) that have nothing to do with the mystery.  I had trouble getting into this story.  I wanted to enjoy it, but I did not.  I think part of it is the rambling nature of the book.  It is written like Ida is talking to you and telling you a story (but we get everything not just the mystery—i.e. shopping, dinner, tea time).  I give A Pain in the Tuchis 3 out of 5 stars.  I believe the story just needs a little more work (like getting rid of the extraneous characters and all the Yiddish phrases).  I also think the story would be better if it was told from Rose’s point of view instead of Ida’s.  A Pain in the Tuchis is the second book in the series, but can easily be read alone.I received a complimentary copy of A Pain in the Tuchis from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HXOH7W2KPGHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWE4FHO#wasThisHelpful","R2HXOH7W2KPGHH","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Silence of the Chihuahuas by Waverly Curtis is the fifth book in the Barking Detective Story series.  Geri and Pepe (her Chihuahua) have started the Sullivan and Sullivan PI Agency in Seattle, Washington.  However, Pepe has quit talking, and Geri does not understand why he has suddenly stopped talking.  She has taken him to the vet, but the vet just looks at her like she is nuts (do you blame him).  Her therapist believes Geri needs to a little rest and recommends some time at a clinic.  Geri goes to talk to her friend, Brad Best and finds his shop closed.  Geri talks to Brad’s partner, Jay.  Jay has not seen Brad in days (and has yet to report him missing).  Geri decides to visit a client of Brad’s to see if he has been over there lately.  Unfortunately, Geri finds Mrs. Fairchild dead in her kitchen.Brad is the number one suspect in Mrs. Fairchild’s murder.  Geri and Pepe set out to find who killed Mrs. Fairchild and what happened to Brad.  Geri gets a call from her sister, Teri asking for help.  Geri has not heard from Teri in years.  The caller ID states Forest Glen Clinic.  When Geri calls the clinic, they claim not to have a guest by that name.  Geri decides to check it out for herself.  Pepe definitely smells Tina in the clinic.  Geri decides to take her doctor’s advice and have a little rest (i.e. time to snoop).  Why not take that rest at the Forest Glen Clinic?  Can Geri and Pepe find Teri in time?I’m sorry but there was just too much going on in The Silence of the Chihuahuas.  It was enough with the murder of Mrs. Fairchild and Brad being missing.  The story really did not need the third mystery of the sister.  And I have not told you everything.  There is also the boyfriend, Felix Navarro.  He is a pet therapist and trying to get on a new show called Pet Intervention (the producer of Dancing with Dogs).  In addition, we have Jimmy G. (Geri’s former boss) who talks about himself in the third person (which is extremely annoying).  I found the murder was easy to solve as well as what happened to Brad (it was obvious).  I just found The Silence of the Chihuahuas to be over the top on silliness.  I liked the idea of the talking dog (who does not imagine their pet talking) and his blog posts were hilarious.  I give The Silence of the Chihuahuas 3 out of 5 stars (it was okay).

"Joy of Witchcraft by Mindy Klasky is the fifth book in the Jane Madison series.  Jane Madison and her warder/fiancé, David Montrose are opening up the Jane Madison Academy.  They are going to teach students how to use their gift of magic.  Jane and her new students are getting ready to perform the opening ritual.  They must do this task to meet the demands of Hecate’s Court.  Something goes awry (a nasty monster appears and attacks students/warders) and they need extra assistance.  Unfortunately, Teresa Alison Sidney, the coven mother for Washington, D.C. is present (what a coincidence).  Teresa is Jane’s nemesis (which is putting it mildly).  Teresa only helped to collect a boon (something valuable from Jane’s collection).  This is just the first incident.  Things are not going well for the Jane (and it looks like it might be an inside job).  Jane just wants to teach her students (and maybe plan her wedding), but it looks like she is going to have to figure out who is trying to ruin the academy.  Will Jane be able to find who is trying to sabotage her academy so she can have a happily ever after with David?  You will have to read Joy of Witchcraft to find out.I did not enjoy Joy of Witchcraft as much as the other books in the series.  This one is a little more complicated (the magic parts) than the other books (and not as humorous).  I give Joy of Witchcraft 3 out of 5 stars.  I had trouble getting through this book.  The other books I just devoured, but this one took me three tries to finish it.  Joy of Witchcraft is not a book that can be enjoyed alone.  You do need to read the other books in the Jane Madison series in order to understand what is happening (and to know the characters).  I hope that Mindy Klasky returns to her normal light-hearted (and humorous) writing style (that we enjoyed in the first four books of the series) if she continues with the Jane Madison series.I won a copy of Joy of Witchcraft from the publisher and LibraryThing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R237VDIB0N9LEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LYLEIA#wasThisHelpful","R237VDIB0N9LEP","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Max (Maxine) Martinelli is Annie’s friend and an architect.  Max has been unable to move forward with her life since she returned from Paris three years ago.  When Max was in Paris she met and fell in love with Julien Marceau.  Julien was supposed to follow Max back to the states.  Unfortunately, Max never heard from Julien again.  Now Max thinks that Julien could have been in an accident and have amnesia.  That is why he never contacted her.  Max is determined to go to Paris and look for Julien.  Annie has tried talking to Max (to get her to move on) and she has even tried to set her up with Oliver’s old law partner, Andrew Steen.  This is a journey that Max needs to go on in order to have a future.  Annie sends her off at the airport with some special tea.Max goes to Paris and starts searching for Julien.  Will Max find what she is looking for in Paris?  Or will she find something even better?  Join us on Max’s journey in What the Heart Remembers.  What the Heart Remembers is a wonderful book to read.  I did want to strangle Max at times, but I understand how she feels (it is hard to get over someone).  It is nice to revisit the characters in the Memory House Collection.  We get to see how Ophelia Browne is enjoying her new life at Baylor Towers, how Oliver is doing after his accident, and we get to find out if Annie has a boy or a girl!

Zach finally asks her out on a real date and Amy hesitantly accepts.  This is the first of many dates.  Amy, though, will have a long way to go before she is ready for a serious relationship.  Amy tends to make snap judgements and jump to conclusions without hearing all the information.  Amy and Zach will get to know each other better as they work on the school’s holiday program.  When Zach gets an opportunity to have a job at a magnet school will it end their budding relationship (he would like to teach to students who actually enjoy math)?  Will Amy be able to get over her issues to have a wonderful future?A Dash of Daring is a sweet, Christian romance novel.  There is some kissing in the book and a just a hint of an engaged couple looking forward to more after they are married.  The book does have a pregnancy between two teenagers in it.  I liked Zach, but Amy was a harder character to enjoy.  She was so quick to assume things and then would storm off (which I find annoying).  It was nice reading about such dedicated teachers who enjoy their jobs.  We get to catch up on the characters from the past two novels to see how they are doing in their relationships.

"The Crescent Spy by Michael Wallace is a great historical novel.  It is set during the Civil War and takes place mostly in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Josephine Breaux is twenty years old and a reporter for the Morning Clarion in Washington, D.C.  She gets information from both sides (using her feminine charms) which help her write great articles for the paper.  Her stories were published under the name of Joseph Breaux.  Until the day she was exposed and her editor fires her.  Outside the newspapers office she is picked up by Pinkerton Agents.  They believe she is a spy and are going to drop her off in Virginia unless she can convince them she is not a spy (and loyal to the Union).Josephine convinces Franklin Gray of her loyalty and he takes her to meet Allan Pinkerton and President Lincoln.  They want her to go to New Orleans and get them information.  She will be popular in New Orleans since the agents have made it look like she is a Southern sympathizer and a spy for their cause.  Josephine gets a job at the New Orleans Daily Crescent.  This gives Josephine a good cover for going about the city and getting a look at the military boats, installations (forts), and troops.  But then an old friend of her mother’s spots her.  Will this ruin everything that Josephine could do for the Union cause?  You will have to read The Crescent Spy to see what happens to Josephine in New Orleans and how her work helps the Union cause.I truly enjoyed reading The Crescent Spy.  The Crescent Spy is an engaging novel, and I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen next.  There is a lot of history in the book (about fort, troops, and battles), but it is a necessary part of the story.  I liked that Josephine was a brave, confidant woman.  She was determined to use her talents for good.  I give The Crescent Spy 4.5 out of 5 stars.  There are just a couple of areas that are little sluggish, but overall a wonderful novel to read.

"Look Both Ways by Carol J. Perry is the third book in Witch City Mystery series.  Lee Barrett is working on furnishing her new apartment which is on the top floor of her Aunt Ibby’s home (where she grew up).  It is summer time which means she has extra time on her hands.  Lee teaches TV Production 101 at Tabitha Trumbull Academy of the Arts (aka Tabby).  To keep herself busy, Lee has agreed to locate the props needed to the plays being performed at the school that summer.Lee and her Aunt Ibby (Isobel Russell) see a snippet on television about an antiques dealer, Shea Tolliver who has a dresser with hidden compartments.  The dresser is identical to one Lee had as a child that burned in a fire.  Lee rushes over to purchase the dresser.  It previously belonged to Helena Trent who was murdered over six years previously.  When Lee goes back to Tolliver's Antiques and Uniques to look for more items for her apartment, she finds Shea Tolliver dead in the store.Lee sets out to find out who killed Shea Tolliver.  Does it have anything to do with the dresser she purchased and Helena's missing pink diamond necklace (worth a pretty penny)?  Will Lee’s newly discovered scrying talent help in solving this puzzle?I enjoyed reading Look Both Ways.  It is a fun, paranormal mystery novel.  While this is the third book in the series, you can read it without having enjoyed the first two books (though you should read them).  I give Look Both Ways 4.25 out of 5 stars.  I like the characters in the novel as well as the town of Salem, Massachusetts (which I bet is a great town to live in during Halloween).  I am hoping that Lee will embrace her talents more fully in the next book.  One thing I did not enjoy was the addition of dream interpretation and Feng shui.  I did not feel it helped or enhanced the story.  The book already contains witchcraft, tarot reading, and scrying.

"I started using the Retinol Cream Moisturizer about give weeks ago and it made an immediate difference.  My skin is nice and smooth (good base for putting on makeup).  I like that it is not a heavy moisturizer.  It is very light and contains natural ingredients.  I have many allergies and I have to be careful with the products that I use on my skin.  It does have a smell but it is from the natural ingredients and in no way artificial (since I am allergic to many fragrances this is great) nor is it unpleasant.  You only need a small amount to do your face (one pump).  You only need to apply a light coat.  I am very happy with the product. I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased feedback.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31MNESPR58VOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5ERAWQ#wasThisHelpful","R31MNESPR58VOI","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished reading Christmas Bells by Jennifer Chiaverini.  The books takes place in modern day Boston as well as in 1860.  Sophia is music teacher at Peleg Wadsworth Elementary School and due to budget cuts, she will be out of a job at the end of the school year (why do they always cut the arts programs).  Sophia is also the director of the children’s choir at St. Margaret’s Catholic Church.  She is on her way to the rehearsal for their Christmas program.  They are going to perform Christmas Bells in honor of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  The book gives us the history of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and how he came to write Christmas Bells.  It starts in December 1860 when Longfellow was happy with his family and then tragedy strikes.  We get to see how he survived the hardships and came to write Christmas Bells.In modern day Boston we get to see the same day through the eyes of different people all connected to St. Margaret’s Catholic Church.  Father Ryan, Sophia, Lucas (pianist for children’s choir), Paul and Camille Barrett (got to church and benefactors), Sister Winifred, and the Moran family (Alex, Charlotte, Laurie, and Jason).  At the end of the novel, it moves forward through Christmas and the children’s concert at St. Margaret’s.Christmas Bells is a lovely novel.  I enjoyed the modern day scenes better than the historical ones.  The novel is well-written and very interesting.  I likes how the author connected people from the past to the present.  I give Christmas Bells 4 out of 5 stars.I received a copy of Christmas Bells from First to Read (www.firsttoread.com) in exchange for points that I earned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JL0NSS5DTV5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02BZ6#wasThisHelpful","R3JL0NSS5DTV5R","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amish Heart of Ice Mountain by Kelly Long is the third book in the Ice Mountain series.  Sarah Mast is the new healer for Ice Mountain and she is moving into the Grossmuder May’s old cabin.  Edward King was just kicked out of his brother's (Joseph) home for his drinking.  He believes the healer's cabin is empty when he stumbles into it to find Sarah.  Edward is wet from the rain and coming down sick.  He takes off his shirt to get dry when Sarah's father and Bishop Umble enter the cabin.  Sarah’s father, Mahlon Mast insist that the two get married and the Bishop backs up the decision.  Sarah and Edward are married immediately!  Will these two be able to make the marriage work?Sarah gets guidance from an old journal that belonged to Grossmuder May.  It provides a look into the life of May G. Miller and how she ended up on Ice Mountain.  That evening a storm comes through and a big limb falls onto the cabin breaking through the roof to the bedroom where Edward was sleeping.  Edward is airlifted to the hospital.  He loses an eye and is left scars running down one side of his face.  Edward’s drinking becomes worse making things difficult for these two newlyweds.  One night Edward decides to take the horse he is trying to train out for a ride and he ends up injuring Sarah.  Will this make Edward change his ways?  Will this accident make someone else change their ways and repent for past misdeeds?  Will Edward and Sarah ever get a happily ever after?The Amish Heart of Ice Mountain is a lovely romance novel.  This novel contains kissing, flirting, lusting, and sex (which is not why I read an Amish fiction book).  There is also drinking, violence, and spousal abuse in The Amish Heart of Ice Mountain.  The book is nicely written, but it is very different from other Amish fiction novels.  I have read all the books in the series (this book can be read as a standalone), but this one was my least favorite (because of the things I mentioned above).  There are some good messages contained in the novel, and I did like the journal entries from Grossmudder May.

"Unspoken by C.C. Hunter is the third novel in the Shadow Falls:  After Dark series.  Della Tsang is vampire and attends Shadow Falls Academy (school for supernaturals).  In fact she is a Reborn (turned twice) and is now bonded to the infuriating and handsome Chase Tallman.  Della, though, has a lot going on in her life (besides adjusting to being a vampire).  Her father is accused of murdering his sister, Bao Yu (who is now a ghost and following Della).  His blood was found on the knife that killed her (his twin brother faked his death when he became a vampire).  Della is determined to clear her father’s name.  At the same time her elderly neighbors the Chi’s were murdered in their jewelry store.  Mrs. Chi’s ghost has come to Della for help (Della is a ghost magnet).  Della believes she saw who killed the Chi’s.  Since Della is unable to work on her father’s case (though she keeps trying), she works on solving the Chi’s murder.  She will have her work cut out for her especially when the police get an anonymous tip that leads to Della.Chase works on getting back into Della’s good graces (she keeps pushing him away despite her attraction to him).  Chase quits his job with the Vampire Council and joins the FRU (Fallen Research Unit which is like the FBI).  Della wants to become an agent and join the FRU when she graduates from high school.  Burnett James (part owner of Shadow Falls—the school—as well as being a part of the FRU) is reluctant to accept Chase because he wants to protect Della (he is like a father to Della).  Della wants to know that being with Chase is her choice and not because of the bond they share.  Della also has not told her parents that she is a vampire.  She is trying to hide it, but her father is treating her differently.  Could her father, Chao Tsang, have figured out what Della has become?There is a lot going on in Unspoken.  It is an interesting book (and told from Chase’s and Della’s point of view) but it was difficult to read with the foul language, teenage angst, and Della’s constantly being angry.  The book also includes teenage intimacy.  It was difficult to get into this book, but it gets more interesting in the second half of the novel.  I believe in order to understand everything that is happening in Unspoken, you need to read the first two books in the trilogy.  I give Unspoken 3 out of 5 stars.  It was an okay novel, but I did not really enjoy this book (I actually found it very frustrating).  A love triangle for teenagers seems a little hard to believe as well as teenagers doing adults work (but then they still act like teenagers with temper tantrums, crying, and disobedience).  I think the novel would have been better with adults instead of teenagers (and the teenage angst).  I love vampire, witches, and other supernatural novels, but Unspoken just did not speak to me.I received a complimentary copy of Unspoken from NetGalley (and the publisher) in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR62JMDJ8CKXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6DRZP2#wasThisHelpful","RR62JMDJ8CKXI","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flipped for Murder by Maddie Day is the first book in the new Country Store Mystery series.  It is opening day for Pans ‘N Pancakes in South Lick, Indiana.  It is a restaurant that sells breakfast and lunch as well as having a country store that sells vintage kitchenware.  Roberta “Robbie” Jordan is excited to finally have her dream become a reality.  Robbie had been working for the Nashville Inn for the last three years (since moving to Indiana from California).  Stella Rogers, assistant to the mayor, gave her a hard time in obtaining the necessary permits to open Pans ‘N Pancakes (her son wanted the same location).  Stella has held the position in the mayor’s office since she was in her twenties (which means she knows a lot of secrets).  Her opening day is a success.  When Robbie comes back from a date with Jim Shermer, Buck Bird is waiting for her.  Buck is second in command at the police department.  Stella Rogers was found dead in her home with one of Robbie’s cheese biscuits stuffed in her mouth (Stella purchased extra biscuits to take home).  Robbie is considered a person of interest.  Someone does not want Robbie to succeed in her new venture.Robbie wants to stay out of jail so she starts looking into Stella’s life to see who wanted her dead.  Turns out that Stella had made a lot of enemies.  Robbie uses her crossword puzzle skills to figure out who killed Stella Rogers and is trying to frame her for the crime.  After twenty-seven years Robbie finds out the identity of her biological father.  Her mother never told her about him and now she is deceased.  Will Robbie be able to connect with him?  There is also an adorable little kitten named Birdy (his meows sound like cheeps).I found Flipped for Murder to be a good cozy mystery.  I enjoyed the characters (and thankfully, there are not too many and they are not too quirky), the town of South Lick (a typical small town), and the mystery (it is a medium level mystery).  The author provided some great clues the lead the reader to the killer (she also provided some information that could lead the reader down the wrong path).  I did like the side mystery of Robbie trying to find out information about her father.  It gives the reader more insight into Robbie.  I give Flipped for Murder 4 out of 5 stars.  I look forward to the next book in the Country Store Mystery series.  I would like to see the characters fleshed out a little more (we did not get many details on Robbie’s past and really no details on Jim Shermer) and a more complicated mystery (I have only been stumped once this year).  There are some nice recipes at the end of the novel (cheese biscuits included) and a preview of the next book in the series.  If you like to read cozy mysteries, you will love reading Flipped for Murder!I received a complimentary copy of Flipped for Murder from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0KUHJFDZK58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE7O9HK#wasThisHelpful","R3M0KUHJFDZK58","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lavender House in Meuse by Gail Noble Sanderson is an historical novel that takes place in France.  Marie Chagall has been raised by her sister, Solange in Marseilles, France.  As Marie grows older she gets more restless.  When war breaks out, Marie wants to be more useful.  She is excited when people are asked to be trained as volunteer nurses (they have to pay for their own training and they never get paid).  Marie goes off for training in Paris and eventually ends up in a field hospital outside Verdun.  One day Marie wakes up injured.  It takes her a long time to heal and recover.  She then decides to go home to her family.  Once Marie arrives home she falls in melancholy (does nothing).  When Solange and her father decide it is time to travel, Marie must make a decision. Does she want to travel with them or go to the house her mother left her in Meuse?  Marie ends up in Meuse and embarks on new experiences (when she is forced to).  Her father has her change her name to Marie Durant and provides her with new documents (I believe it was supposed to have insight on what was going to happen to Jews in the future).The Lavender House in Meuse reads like a biography.  It tells the story of Marie’s life (mostly a boring life).  I did not enjoy reading this book.  If I had lived during that time and wrote a journal, I think it would be like this book.  Marie’s life was dull (they did not devote much time to her nursing during the war) and I quickly got tired of her depressing thoughts (she lapsed into depression or melancholy frequently when she was not busy).  The characters have no depth to them.  This book just feel short of the mark.

"An Endless Christmas by Cynthia Ruchti is a cute Christmas romance novel.  Katie Vale is going home with her boyfriend, Micah Binder for Christmas.  As soon as they get through the door of his grandparent’s home, Micah proposes to Katie.  Katie, who had received a text on the way to the home from the airport, says no.  Now this could make for an awkward Christmas if it wasn’t the Binder family.  Why does Katie not want to get married? Did the text she receive having something to do with her answer?  I think Christmas with the Binder’s will be a life altering experience.I found An Endless Christmas to be a delightful story.  It is a charming story with very likable characters.  The Binder family is a large, loving family.  I, personally, would go crazy with so many people in one house (and I would never consider a window seat a bed which is where Katie got to sleep).  However, it is lovely to read about such a heartwarming, Christian family.

"Q & A a Day for Creatives is a four year journal for people who like to sketch and draw. The book is approximately 91/4 inches wide and 7  inches tall.  It has a soft-cover Kraft color cover with a beautiful frame on it.  There is pink, blue, yellow, and green on the sides of the cover (it is pretty).  The cover lays open nicely for drawing.  The book then has four slots for each day of the year (so you can use it for the four years).  Each slot is a little over 3 inches square.  The paper would be good for charcoal, colored pencils, crayons, and pastels.  You could not use paints, markers, or felt tip pens (I would not use ball point pens either).  They would bleed through the pages.  Since the pages are double-sided, it would be difficult to use the other side if you used those type of mediums.  Each day is a different question or suggestion on what to draw/sketch each day.  For example:  Draw the shoes you are wearing, Design your perfect playground, and Doodle for thirty seconds.  This is a neat book and would make a great gift for the creative person in your life.  I give Q & A a Day for Creatives 4 out of 5 stars.  I wish the paper was thicker and I think the book would be better if it was just for a year.  Than the artist would have a bigger space to sketch with one page for each day.  This is, overall, a nice book.I received a complimentary copy of Q & A a Day for Creatives from Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLOKHHXWTC1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804186405#wasThisHelpful","RBLOKHHXWTC1Q","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moonlands by Steven Savile is a young adult paranormal mystery/romance novel.  Ashley Hawthorne looks like a regular 15 years old girl (almost sixteen), but she is very special.  A group of loyal people took her from the Moonlands almost sixteen years ago for her safety.  Now someone is out to kill Ashley (aka Ashkellion) before she comes of age at sixteen (and can try and claim the throne).  They need to keep her safe.Blackwater Blaze (and his pack) are sent through the moongate to London to kill Ashley and eliminate the threat to the king.  His pack first encounters Targyn Fae (a warden who protects Ashley) and all of the pack is killed except Blackwater Blaze.  At daylight Blaze transforms back into a man (because of the sun).  He continues to watch Ashley hoping for an opportunity to kill her.  Will the wardens be able to keep her safe?  What happens when Ashley finds out her true heritage?Moonlands was a very hard novel to get into to.  It took me four tries to read this novel.  Once I got about halfway through the book, I found it more interesting and engaging.  I think part of the problem was too many characters.  It is hard trying to keep track of all the people protecting Ashley, Ashley’s friends, and the characters in the Moonlands.  There is also the two separate worlds and the magical elements (as well as the evil forces).  There is a lot packed into one book (I just gave you a to-the-point overview). I give Moonlands 3 out of 5 stars.  I found the romantic elements a little strange considering that Ashley was only fifteen (almost sixteen).  She seems a little young for a to-die-for love (but kids grow up so fast these days).

"The Fruitcake Murders by Ace Collins is set in 1926 and 1946.  In the opening Jan Lewandowski is a candy maker who is heading to his factory to get a present he had hidden there for his daughter.  On the way he sees a man leaving Geno Lombardi’s grocery with paper sacks full of items.  Jan notices that his fruitcakes are not in the window as Geno promised.  Jan goes into the store to speak with Geno and finds him with a knife in his back.  Jan, in a bad move, takes the knife out of his back and holds it.  He then checks the cash register getting blood on the money.  Then in walks a cop who accuses Jan of murder.It is near Christmas in 1946.  Lt. Lane Walker is an ex-marine turned homicide cop.  He is at the house of Ethan Elrod, the district attorney who was found dead at his desk with a knife in his back.  The knife did not kill him.  He was actually killed with a blow to head from a tin of fruitcake (I guess that is one use for it).  Ethan Elrod was a notorious good guy.  Who wanted him dead?  Tiffany Clayton is a reporter with The Chicago Star.  Tiffany and Lane have a history (they kept making dates and Lane kept not showing up for them).  Tiffany was to interview Ethan that evening for a story.  Now Tiffany has a bigger story.  Two more people are killed in the same manner.  Will Lane and Tiffany be able to solve the case?  Who wants them dead and where did they get the old fruitcake (I bet you can guess whose fruitcake it is).The Fruitcake Murders is a book that is trying too hard to a book from the 40’s.  There is a lot of 40’s lingo thrown in like dame and doll (it was just overkill).  I found The Fruitcake Murders to be a slow paced book.  Besides what I mentioned above there is also a Santa scam and a mob boss.  I give The Fruitcake Murders 2.75 out of 5 stars.  I think the story had potential, but the execution was lacking.  I think with a little more editing, the book could have been better (that is just one person’s humble opinion).  The mystery was easy to solve (as well as figuring out what happened to Jan’s children).  One thing that I found odd was instead of staying “Lane said” it would read “the cop”.  It was just strange, and it was sprinkled generously throughout the book.I received a complimentary copy of The Fruitcake Murders from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1UMC8MNVPLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXJK94O#wasThisHelpful","R1X1UMC8MNVPLG","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dangerously Dark by Colette London is the second book in A Chocolate Whisperer Mystery series.  Hayden Mundy Moore is a freelance chocolate expert.  She helps companies improve their products.  Thanks to an inheritance, Hayden can pick only jobs that appeal to her.  Hayden is heading to Portland, Oregon for an engagement party weekend for an old, college friend, Carissa.  Hayden arrives in Portland and goes to Cartorama where Carissa has a cart called Churn PDX.  Every food cart specializes in chocolate.  Carissa opens her food cart and they find the dead body of her fiancé, Declan Murphy.The police declare Declan’s death an accident.  Hayden does not believe it is an accident and decides to poke around a little.  She is still running on a high from solving the mystery at her last assignment.  Carissa (who does not seem very upset over her fiancé’s death) also asks Hayden to take over Declan’s Chocolate After Dark tour.  It is already been scheduled and publicized (I think Carissa has an ulterior motive).  Hayden agrees to run the tour since it will give her more time to poke around.  Her friend and security expert, Danny Jamieson shows up to help out (and try and convince Hayden to leave Portland).  Will Hayden find out that Declan was killed?  Who would want to kill him and why?I found Dangerously Dark to be a silly novel with a very simple mystery.  I was really hoping the second book in the series would be significantly better than the first (it is actually worse).  Hayden does not really solve the mystery.  They seem to solve themselves.  Hayden is more focused on guys (especially Travis, her finance manager) than the mystery.  I have no idea why she is friends with Carissa who was more concerned over making connections than the death of her fiancé.  I give Dangerously Dark 2.75 out of 5 stars.

"I just finished reading Derinda Babcock’s Dodging Destiny.  It is a Christian novel about learning to listen to God.  Lexie Logan has broken off her engagement to Lance.  Lance has decided (after much prayer) that he is being called to be a missionary in Guatemala.  He wants to run an orphanage.  Lexie has dreams of her own.  She wishes to get into the Master of Arts Program and play the violin with the Topeka Symphony Orchestra.She goes to the University of Kansas to sign up for her master’s program.  While she is waiting for her appointment, she falls asleep in the library (you have an hour to spare before an important appointment so you hole up in the library for a snooze fest).  She wakes up in 1857.  She wakes up in the back of a covered wagon with her bag (packed with all types of helpful items).  Lexie was found by the Bell family who graciously take her in.  Lexie learns what it is like to live in 1857 (without running water, cars, electricity, or good hygiene).  Will she learn to listen to God?Dodging Destiny is an interesting novel, but it is very preachy (a lot of prayer—and I have nothing against prayer--and many Bible verses).  I liked the time travel element (which is unusual for a Christian book). One thing I found extremely annoying was Lexie’s obsession with table manners (if I had to read one more description of people eating I was going to be sick). I also felt we were not given much information on some of the characters like Lexie's fiancé, Lance (we were never told his last name). I like the message that is being conveyed in the novel, but I found the story to be a little simple (needed more depth).  The ending was also very abrupt and seemed incomplete (needed an epilogue).

"The Good Neighbor by Amy Sue Nathan is a novel about how secrets can cause harm.  Elizabeth “Izzy” Lane is thirty-nine and divorced.  Her husband, Bruce Silverstein decided he needed to find himself (typical).  Izzy and her son, Noah (five years old) have moved back into her family home.  She has taken over the mortgage from her parents and they have moved to Margate.  The day her husband left, Izzy started a blog called The Bizzy Blog (she did not want to use her real name).  Izzy gives advice and tells stories about dating (Izzy is a school guidance counselor during the day).  It has become very popular and now her friend, Jade wants Izzy to write for her Pop Philly site.  Izzy would write Philly over 40 (even though she is only 39).  Izzy agrees to write the column because she needs the money on the condition that she remain anonymous. Bruce has decided to go to California with his girlfriend, Amber.  Bruce has lost his job and cannot continue his financial obligations to his son (he is a real gem).The one thing that Izzy fails to mention is that some of the information in her blog is fiction.  She has been writing about dating Mac.  Mac is a fictional boyfriend.  Will Izzy be able to keep up her lie and who is she going to hurt in the process (you just know that this is not going to end well).  I found this to be a mediocre novel.  It is okay, but very silly and bland (like food with salt, pepper, and spices).  The characters lack depth.  The most interesting character is the elderly neighbor, Geraldine.  I give The Good Neighbor 3 out of 5 stars (for okay).  This novel was lacking in depth and humor.  It could have been a funny novel, but it missed the mark.I received a complimentary copy of The Good Neighbor from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MUZKBTSGASG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V37BCTM#wasThisHelpful","R3MUZKBTSGASG","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Murder at Redwood Cove by Janet Finsilver is the first book in a new cozy mystery series.  Kelly Jackson is an Executive Administrator for Resorts International.  Her first single assignment is the Redwood Cove Bed and Breakfast.  The manager, Bob Phillips died in an accident and Kelly has been sent to take over as interim manager.  Redwood Cove, California is a beautiful location with a lovely town.  Shortly after arriving Kelly meets the Silver Sentinels.  A group of senior citizens from the town who solve crimes.  Bob Phillips was a member.  The Silver Sentinels do not believe that Bob’s death is an accident, but they are unable to convince Deputy Sheriff Bill Stanton.  After Bob’s office is ransacked, Kelly discovers an envelope in the safe.  Bob had written in the information in code but there was a note asking that the contents be given to the Silver Sentinels.  The group is thrilled to have something to investigate.  Kelly decides to help the group and starts asking questions around town.  Kelly is hoping to find out Bob’s movements the day he died from his phone.  The phone is returned to Kelly’s office and stolen before she can look at it.  Someone has something to hide.  Will Kelly and the Silver Sentinels be able to figure out who wanted Bob dead and why?I enjoyed reading Murder at Redwood Cove.  It is a good first book in a series.  I liked the setting of Redwood Cove and the Silver Sentinels (a fun group).  I think Kelly will be a good main character, but she needs a little more development.  We are given just a few details on Kelly’s life prior to coming to Redwood Cove (I found out more about Fred the basset hound than I did about Kelly).  The mystery was complex (just how I like them) and not easy to solve (though I did).  I will definitely be reading the next book in this series.I received a complimentary copy of Murder at Redwood Cove from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IS5MTWRAAK5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNBLYD4#wasThisHelpful","R1IS5MTWRAAK5U","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the One You’re Witch by Randa Flannery is a paranormal romance book and the first book in the Magically Yours Series.  Anastasia Gregor is a witch who works for the paranormal division of an investigative firm (special divisions have been created since the coming out of vampires, witches, werewolves, etc.).  Anastasia does not want to work with vampires, but she forgot to inform her boss or HR when she started with the company (Anastasia had a bad incident with a friend who turned into a vampire and then tried to turn her against her will).  The case involves the daughter of Moira Vincent.  Moira is the matriarch of an old vampire family.  The daughter, Erica is under the influence of a strong love spell.  It has her attracted to her mate’s brother, Lucas Vincent.  Erica’s mate, Kristof really wants the spell broken (and so does the rest of the family).  Erica is a little over the top under the spell and getting on everyone’s nerves.When Anastasia meets Lucas there is an instant attraction.  After breaking the spell, Anastasia finds out the attraction is because they are destined to be mates!  Anastasia informs Lucas that witches do not mate.  However, she cannot deny the attraction and the need to be with Lucas.  Since Anastasia has to find out who created the spell in order to finish her task, she does agree to spend time with Lucas.  Are Anastasia and Lucas destined to be mates?  Who created the spell and who was it really intended for?  You will have to read Love the One You’re Witch to find out.Love the One You’re Witch is a funny, quick book to read.  I found it severely lacking in substance, but it was long on humor.  It is mostly a little bit of magic and a lot of lust/attraction (there is even a sex toy store).  I give Love the One You’re Witch 3 out of 5 stars.  I wish the characters had been more developed.  We were given very little information on them.  I felt like the book was just rushed.I received a complimentary copy of Love the One You’re Witch from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRIP0OKOJ8YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VEGCX8#wasThisHelpful","R3FRIP0OKOJ8YZ","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pop Goes the Weasel by M.J. Arlidge is the second book in A Detective Helen Grace Thriller series.  Detective Inspector Helen Grace has returned to her job at the Southampton Central Police Station as a leader of a Major Incident Team.  She has kept herself busy (with work) since she killed her sister Marianne (serial killer in last book).  DC Charlie Brooks will be returning to work in the next few days.  She has not worked since she was held hostage by Marianne.  Charlie lost the baby she was carrying.  Instead of going to another department or station, Charlie is returning to the team.  They also have a new boss, Detective Superintendent Ceri Harwood.  Harwood is very different from Michael Whittaker (former boss and Grace’s mentor).  Harwood is the type to let others do the work and then she takes the glory for promotions.  Harwood also believes in working with the press.  She has decided to work with Emilia Garanita, a reporter with the Southampton Evening News (a royal pain in Helen Grace’s behind).There is a new killer in town.  The killer is sadistic and takes an organ from the victim.  The perp then delivers the organ to family (or co-workers).  Will the team be able to catch the killer?  Pop Goes the Weasel will keep engrossed until the very last word.  It has great characters and a juicy mystery.  I was a little disappointed at how easy it was to figure out the killer.  Pop Goes the Weasel is superbly written, and I was interested to find out what happened to the characters after the death of Marianne.  The book does contain explicit violence and sadomasochism (fair warning).  I give Pop Goes the Weasel 5 out of 5 stars.  In order to understand Pop Goes the Weasel, you do need to read the first book in the series (which you will enjoy).  I cannot wait for the next book from M. J.

"I just finished reading Gone to Ground by Brandilyn Collins.  It is told in the first person perspective from the three main characters.  There have been five murders in the last three years in Amaryllis, Mississippi.  Each person was killed in the exact same manner and then stuffed into a closet.  The Amaryllis Police Department has been unable to solve the crime and catch the Closet Killer (as he has been dubbed). Then there is a sixth victim.  Three different women believe they know who the Closet Killer is.  Tully Phillips is nineteen years old, married, and expecting her first baby.  Her husband, Mike came home late the night of the sixth killing and he had bloody hands.  Deena Ruckland is thirty-two and owns Deena’s Cut ‘n’ Style.  Her brother, Steve showed up at her house the night of the killing with blood on his uniform.  Steve is mentally challenged and has been picked on his whole life.  He refused to answer his sister’s questions.  Cherrie Mae Devine is a house cleaner.  One of her clients is Mayor Austin Bradmeyer and his wife, Eva.  Cherrie Mae was cleaning his office and looked in one of the Mayor’s desk drawers.  She noticed a file that was marked “Closet Killer”.  The file contains photos of each victim and the ring of the last victim is in the drawer.These three ladies will come together to unravel the clues and solve the killings.  Who is the Closet Killer?  I found Gone to Ground to be a difficult novel to read.  The women talk with a Southern accent which was hard to read.  I did not enjoy the first person perspective.  If it had been told from one person’s point-of-view, it would have been okay.  However, it kept switching between the women making the reader guess which lady is it now.  I did like that this was a Christian mystery (no foul language or sex).  The mystery was very easy to solve (I was hoping it would be more difficult).  The writing is good, but I felt the book needed a little reworking.  I give Gone to Ground 3.75 out of 5 stars.I received a complimentary copy of Gone to Ground from the author (and Book Club Network Inc.) in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4WL256GX2DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433671638#wasThisHelpful","R2W4WL256GX2DL","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Streams of Mercy by Lauraine Snelling is the third book in the Song of Blessing series.  It is 1907 in Blessing, North Dakota.  Anji Baard Moen has returned to Blessing after the death of her husband, Ivar.  They had been living with his parents in Norway, but she did not like the lifestyle for herself or her children.  Her in-laws were wealthy and children were raised by nannies and rarely seen by their parents.  Anji was happy to return to Blessing.  She is currently staying with Rebecca and Gerald Valders.  Anji has taken a job at the school.  She will be teaching Norwegian history and the language at the high school.  Anji is getting to spend time with Mr. Thomas Devlin who is also teaching at the school.Then Stetler and Sons Traveling Circus comes to town on the train.  They have sick people on board and need assistance.  The town agrees to help them (they are definitely going to regret being so nice) and then they find out that the sick people have diphtheria.  Who will be left standing in the wake of the disease?  Will Anji and Thomas get a happy ending?Streams of Mercy is a heartfelt book.  In order to understand what is happening in Streams of Mercy you do need to have read the other books in the series (it would actually be best if you have read all the books by Lauraine Snelling that are set in Blessing, North Dakota).  I have been reading Lauraine Snelling’s books since the beginning when Ingeborg came from Norway with her first husband (before there was a town of Blessing, North Dakota).  Streams of Mercy is a complicated book.  There is quite a bit going on in the book (I have actually only given you a small summary).  We get to become reacquainted with our favorite characters and see how they are faring.  This book will make you laugh, cry, and sigh.  I give Streams of Mercy 4.5 out of 5 stars.  It is well-written and thoughtful.  Streams of Mercy is a little more series than the other books in the series.  I look forward to the next installment in the Songs of Blessing series.I received a complimentary copy of Streams of Mercy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FF9ZQRJ94T3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012H0ZSD4#wasThisHelpful","R1FF9ZQRJ94T3X","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ghost of a Potion by Heather Blake is the third book in A Magic Potion Mystery series.  Carly Bell Hartwell is getting ready for her yearly hibernation (starts at midnight on Halloween and ends at 11:49 p.m. on All Souls Day).  Halloween starts the next day and Carly stays inside her home to avoid ghosts (the ones that have not passed over).  Carly had experienced a bad ghost seven years previously and has not been able to deal with them since then.  That evening Carly is attending an event at the Ezekiel Mansion (they will own the house if the lost heir does not claim it by January 1).  It was just restored by the Harpies—The Hitching Post Restoration and Preservation Society (what did you think I meant).  Carly’s mother is trying to get her husband into the society (to keep him busy and out of her hair).  Carly will be attending with her on-again-off again (currently on) boyfriend, Dylan Jackson (who is also an officer with the Hitching Post Police Department).The evening does not start out well.  Patricia Davis Jackson, Dylan’s mother, does not like Carly and hits Carly with a few zingers as a greeting (and tries to ruin her beautiful dress).  A little while later they hear screaming.  Patricia is standing over Haywood Dodd with a candlestick in her hand.  Haywood is dead.  Haywood was going to make a big announcement at 10 p.m. and he would not give anyone a hint.  Patricia, of course, is the main suspect which means Dylan is not allowed to investigate the case.  As for Carly, she saw the one thing she wanted to avoid—a ghost!  Haywood Dodd’s ghost noticed Carly and followed her home (she ran the whole way).  Carly has no choice but to help Haywood.  Carly sets out to solve the murder with help from Dylan (and friends).  It looks like Carly is not going to get to hibernate this year.  She might even pick up a few more ghosts along the way that she will have to assist (much to her Cousin Delia’s delight).Who wanted Haywood Dodd dead?  What was Haywood’s big announcement and did it have anything to do with his death?  You will just have to read Ghost of a Potion to find out.  Ghost of a Potion is a hilarious book.  Hitching Post, Alabama is a charming small town (with a lot going on).  Ghost of a Potion has unique, quirky characters and a mystery that will leave you guessing (it is a windy path to the killer). I give Ghost of a Potion 5 out of 5 stars.  Ghost of a Potion has humor, romance, magic, and a good mystery.  The perfect ingredients for a delightful cozy mystery.  While Ghost of a Potion is a part of a series, it can be read alone.  However, I think you will want to read the whole series.  I cannot wait for the next book in A Magic Potion Mystery series.I received a complimentary copy of Ghost of a Potion from the author (I won a copy on Facebook) in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G84HGFVXMFFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OJCK#wasThisHelpful","R1G84HGFVXMFFM","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An Amish Christmas Gift (various authors) is a lovely book to read. It contains three Christmas stories that will put you in the mood for Christmas (makes me want snow too)!  The first story is Naomi’s Gift by Amy Clipston.  Caleb Schmucker is a widower with a little girl named Susie.  They are visiting his family in Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania from Middlefield, Ohio.  They stop to pick up a pie (because Susie was told that you should always take a gift to the hostess when visiting).  Susie stops to look at quilts on display and meets Naomi King.  Susie is instantly taken with Naomi and so is her father.  The two continue to meet while Caleb is on vacation.  But will Sadie, his interfering sister, get in the way of his happiness?An Unexpected Joy by Ruth Reid is the second story.  Abigail Kemp is twenty-three and not married.  She earns money by baking but has found it difficult using the family horse to deliver her items to town (five miles away).  Abigail has decided to save up for a horse and is getting close to her goal.  When Abigail goes to deliver her latest items, the store is unable to take them.  Abigail was seen talking to her cousin, Malinda Lambright.  Malinda’s family is close to being shunned and the community is to avoid them. Then Abigail hears Micah Zook needs a caregiver for his grandmother.  Abigail believes it is the perfect solution.  Micah was looking to hire Abigail’s sister, Elizabeth to watch his grandmother, Edith while he works on his glassblowing orders.  Abigail is something of a chatterbox (as well as pushy and determined).  Micah ends up hiring her and has no idea what is in store for him!  Micah’s quiet life is about to be turned upside down!Kelly Irvin’s A Christmas Visitor is set in Bee County, Texas.  Frannie Mast has been sent to live with Abigail and Mordecai.  Her parents wanted her to get away from an Englisch influence.  Then one night Richard “Rocky” Sanders shows up.  He is the Englisch influence.  Abigail and Rocky are in love with each other, but Frannie will not leave the Amish faith.  Rocky does love Frannie, but he is also needing a change.  He feels that something is missing in his life.  Can Rocky find what is missing in Bee County, Texas?  Will there be a happy ending for Frannie and Rocky?I enjoyed all three stories in An Amish Christmas Gift.  They can be read as part of their series (like Kelly Irvin’s The Amish of Bee County) or by themselves.  All three are very well written with quaint settings and charming characters.  The first story, Naomi’s Gift is the longest and takes up most of the book.  The other two stories are shorter but just as good.  A Christmas Visitor will have you laughing throughout the story.  I give An Amish Christmas Gift 5 out of 5 stars.  I like reading stories that are heartwarming and contain no foul language or sex.  An Amish Christmas Gift contains some good messages and will definitely put you in the mood for Christmas.I received a complimentary copy of An Amish Christmas Gift from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVYWKONFS0VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDJSWMY#wasThisHelpful","R2WVYWKONFS0VC","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Skeleton Haunts a House by Leigh Perry is the third book in A Family Skeleton Mystery series.  Dr. Georgia Thackery is dressing up as Thelma for Halloween Howl at McQuaid University in Pennycross, Massachusetts.  Sid wishes to go as Scooby Doo this year (he wanted to do something different this year).  Who is Sid?  It is their skeleton person (not sure how else to describe him).  He is a skeleton with a great personality.  Sid came to life about twenty years ago at Fenton’s Family Festival when Georgia was a little girl and needed help.  Sid has been with the family ever since.  Everyone accepts him except Deborah.  Deborah is Georgia’s sister and she tends to ignore happy go lucky Sid.  Halloween is the one time of the year that Sid can go out in public without too many issues (and he is so excited).An old building on campus has been turned into McHades Hall.  Deborah (the sister) is in charge of the event and Madison, Georgia’s daughter, is working the event.  Madison reserved special tickets for Sid and Georgia (she did not know that Georgia does not do haunted houses).  Unfortunately, a dead body is discovered while Sid is inside and the place is locked down.  Sid quickly ditches the Scooby Doo outfit and blends in (thankfully there are “fake” skeletons in the haunted house).  Deborah actually asks Georgia and Sid to investigate the case (the whole family is shocked).  They will have an inside track thanks to Sid being stuck in the McHades Hall (he can eavesdrop) while the police did the initial investigation.  Sid works his fingers to the bone on this case using his crackerjack computer skills to look into the victim, Kendall Fitzroy.Georgia’s parents, Dr. and Dr. Thackery are back home from their sabbatical.  Georgia’s mother has a grad student with a crisis (they are both English professors at McQuaid University).  There is also the possibility of a little romance as Georgia meets and spends time with the new adjunct professor Dr. Brownlow Mannix.  Sid is also very busy.  When he is not sleuthing (he is Sherlock Bones to Georgia’s Dr. Watson), he is taking an online art history class (he has a lot of time on his hands since he does not sleep).The Skeleton Haunts a House was a fabulous book!  I do not say this that often, but I really enjoyed (loved) reading the latest addition to A Family Skeleton Mystery series.  The characters are a riot.  Georgia’s parents (especially her father) just added to the hijinks.  I enjoyed reading the description of McHades Hall with all its scary rooms (I do not blame Georgia for not wanting to go inside).  Pennycross, Massachusetts sounds like it is a typical collegiate town (can you just imagine New England in the fall).  The Skeleton Haunts a House had delightful characters and a masterly mystery.  The author did a superb job.  She really had me doubting whether I had picked the right killer (I had picked the right one).  I give The Skeleton Haunts a House 5 out of 5 bones (I could not resist).I received a complimentary copy of The Skeleton Haunts a House from NetGalley (and the publisher) in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6JKV362RD702/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02E4O#wasThisHelpful","R6JKV362RD702","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Murder, Plainly Read by Isabella Alan is the fourth book in An Amish Quilt Shop Mystery series.  Angela Braddock is the owner of Running Stitch a quilt shop in the town of Rolling Brook, Ohio.  She inherited the shop from her Amish aunt about a year ago.  Angie is also a town trustee.  She is taking a quilt that her quilting circle made (customer order) to Austina Shaker, the librarian on the bookmobile.  Angela gets roped into running the library sale that weekend (someone hurt themselves and cannot run it).  When Angela shows up the next day, she finds Austina standing over the body of Bishop Bartholomew Beiler.  Bishop Beiler was against the bookmobile and books in general.  He felt that they would corrupt the people in his district.  When Sheriff James Mitchell (and Angela’s boyfriend) shows up, he is not happy to see Angela at the scene of another murder (she does have a knack for finding dead bodies).  Austina is the immediate suspect (she was standing over the body and no sign of forced entry).Austina asks Angela to investigate the murder and clear her name (actually insists).  Anna Graber (a feisty Amish friend of Angela’s in her 60’s) loves investigating and tells Austina that they will take the case.  Angela sets out to clear Austina’s name and find out who killed Bishop Beiler.  Along the way Angela will have to deal with her interfering and overbearing Mother who decides to help with the book sale (and push Angela towards the alter).I found Murder, Plainly Read to be so much fun to read.  There are times when you will be laughing out loud (especially from the antics of Angela’s mother).  It was nice to revisit Rolling Brook, Angela, Anna, Mattie, Sheriff James Mitchell, and the rest of the characters.  I found the mystery to be medium level (I solved it before I was halfway through the book) but the author did a good job leaving clues and trying to lead the reader down different paths.  Murder, Plainly Read is well-written and is a pleasant way to while away a few hours.  I give Murder, Plainly Read 4.75 out of 5 stars (since I was able to figure out the killer early in the book).

"The Imposter by Suzanne Woods Fisher is the first book in The Bishop’s Family series.  David Stoltzfus is a widower who moved his family (six children) to Stoney Ridge, Pennsylvania when he was approached by Bishop Elmo Yoder.  Bishop Yoder has now passed away and the lot went to Freeman Glick.  His brother, Levi was chosen to be the new minister (to replace Freeman—what a coincidence).  David is not sure this is going to be a good thing for their community.  Freeman and David have differing ideas.  David is also the object of some matchmaking.  Hank Lapp put an ad in The Budget and has gotten some responses.  This could get interesting.  David’s son, Jesse has returned to the community.  He was at a relative’s house helping out on their farm.  Jesse is a smart young man (sixteen) but he gets bored quickly (and into trouble).  David has decided to apprentice him to Hank Lapp to learn how to repair buggies.  Hank, though, is busy helping Edith Fisher with her chickens (her son left for Colorado).  What trouble will Jesse get into this time and how will it impact David?Katrina Stoltzfus is David’s oldest daughter.  When Thelma Beiler hurts her shoulder, Katrina is asked to go stay with her.  Thelma hired Andy Miller as a farmhand at Moss Hill.  Andy is not from the community and Katrina can keep an eye on Thelma and Andy (to protect Thelma).  Katrina has been depressed since her boyfriend, John broke up with her.  Her father is hoping that Moss Hill and Thelma can keep Katrina busy and help her get over her hurt.Birdy Glick is thirty-one years old and the brother of Freeman and Levi Glick (she is a big girl at 6’ 2”).  She lives in a small house on the family property.  She loves birds and gives bird watching tours at the Wild Bird Rescue and Animal Shelter.  Her brother, Freeman has decided that she is to be the teacher at the new school (I am really not liking Freeman).  Birdy is in love with David Stoltzfus (not that he notices).  Whenever she is around him she gets extremely clumsy.  Can Birdy get David to notice her before it is too late (thanks to Hank’s matchmaking)?There are troubling times ahead for the community of Stoney Ridge, Pennsylvania with Bishop Freeman and his new ideas.  Will David be able to save their community from a split?  He might need a little divine intervention.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Imposter.  Some parts will just have you laughing out loud.  The Imposter is well-written and keeps the reader engaged during the whole book. There are some great characters in this book and a lovely setting.

"Plain Again by Sarah Price is the third book in her Plain Fame series.  Amanda Beiler Diaz has had to return home to Lititz, Pennsylvania to take care of her sick father as well as the farm.  Alejandro is not able to come with her.  He is preparing for their South American tour with rehearsals and media interviews.  Alejandro has hired help for the farm as well as arranging for a nurse and physical therapist for when Mr. Beiler returns home.  Alejandro is miserable without Amanda, but she does not feel that she can leave the farm.  Her sister, Anna is getting married in a few weeks (in Ohio) and Amanda does not want to destroy her chance at marriage and happiness (I was amazed she went ahead with the wedding while her father was still in the hospital).  The media has descended again on the small farm making life difficult and they are continuing to print lies.  While they are apart, they have communication problems, gossips, and people interfering in their lives (in a bad way).  Amanda is glad to be home, but she no longer fits in with the Amish community (nor do they give her a warm welcome).  Will Amanda and Alejandro be able to withstand this separation?Plain Again is an easy book to read with good writing.  It is nice to revisit the characters of Amanda and Alejandro as well as Mr. & Mrs. Beiler.  The farm sounds like such a peaceful place (if only the press would stay away).  I really hope that this poor couple get a happily ever after soon (somehow I do not think it is in the cards in the foreseeable future).  I give Plain Again 4 out of 5 stars.

Clarita is a very small Amish community in Oklahoma.  Miriam has been teaching for the last three years while living with her Uncle William and Aunt Frannie.  Miriam receives a letter from her mother stating a surprise will be coming her way.  Miriam has no idea what the surprise could be, but she has an idea.Tyler Johnson is freelance journalist who took an assignment to write on how the local Amish community has recovered from the tornadoes a few years ago.  One of the farms Tyler visits is the Beiler’s.  William welcomes him to the greenhouse and invites him to dinner.  Miriam is instantly taken with him (gets tongue tied and flustered) and Tyler with her.  Miriam, knows though, that it cannot be.Miriam surprise is Minister Mose Stoll from Possum Valley, Ohio.  He is a widower looking for a new wife.  Miriam’s future brother-in-law mentioned her to Mose.  Mose then asked several people about Miriam including her father, the deacon, and the bishop.  Mose has come to Clarita to see Miriam in person (to interview her).  After talking with Miriam (and just about everyone else in the small community), Mose decides she is the right person for him and asks to correspond with her (to get to know her better).  Miriam is not really not given a choice in the matter and agrees.  She knows that marrying Mose is what her family wants for her.  Her heart, though, does not agree especially as she encounters Tyler more and more in the community.  Does Miriam follow her heart or her head?  What will be the right choice for her?I was a little disappointed in this last book in the Land of Promise series.  Can you imagine having no choice in who you marry?  I felt that Miriam should have spoken up (but then there would not have been a story).  I have just told you a little of what goes on in the book.  There is also Tyler’s investigation.  His research uncovers some startling information.  It was nice to revisit Clarita and the characters we have come to know in the series.  It is a nicely written book with a good flow.  Miriam and the Stranger has a lovely and enjoyable ending. I give Miriam and the Stranger 3.75 out of 5 stars (I liked it, but did not love it).I received a complimentary copy of Miriam and the Stranger from NetGalley (and the publisher) in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK27XVBPH3GIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BBIMKK#wasThisHelpful","RK27XVBPH3GIZ","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Cherry Cola Christmas by Ashton Lee is the fourth book in The Cherry Cola Book Club series.  Maura Beth McShay and her husband, Jeremy are returning from their honeymoon in Florida (The Keys).  She returns to find out that someone stole tip money off a table at The Twinkle.  Also, several businesses are closing or relocating to another town.  Things are not looking good for Cherico, Mississippi.  Maura Beth decides to hold a special meeting of The Cherry Cola Book Club for Christmas.  She is hoping that many of the townspeople will come and she wants people to share inspirational stories.  Maura Beth is hoping the stories will inspire the people of the town (to find a way to save their town) as well as put them in the right mood for Christmas.I liked the quirky characters in this book.  I found Cherico, Mississippi to be a lovely town with good Christian values (I would love to find a town like this).  This is the first book in the series that I have read, but it can be enjoyed without having read the first three books in the series (though it would be helpful).  I give A Cherry Cola Christmas 4 out of 5 stars.  If you enjoy Christian stories with just a hint of a mystery (that was child’s play to solve), you will enjoy A Cherry Cola Christmas.  This book will put in the mood to celebrate Christmas in a different way (without all the gifts and hoopla).I received A Cherry Cola Christmas from NetGalley (and courtesy of the publisher) in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32VXXYF1J2K3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT305Y#wasThisHelpful","R32VXXYF1J2K3Z","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scrapbook of the Dead by Mollie Cox Bryan is the fifth book in A Cumberland Creek Mystery series.  Annie Chamovitz is a freelance reporter working on her last story as a freelance reporter in Cumberland Creek, Virginia.  Randy Swanson found a dead body in the freezer of Pamela’s Pie Palace owned by Pamela Kraft.  The young woman is Marina Martelino.  She was found with a scrapbook page in her hand.  Marina worked at Pamela’s Pie Palace as a baker.  The next day her sister, Esmerelda is found dead.  She also had a scrapbook page in her hand.  Who wanted these two women (sisters) dead and why?Both girls are from Mexico. The two women came to America through an agency as do many of Pamela’s kitchen employees.  Annie, DeeAnn, Sheila, Vera, Cookie, Karen and the scrapbook group set out to solve the crime.  Annie is surprised to find out that there is a large Mexican population in Cumberland Creek.  She has not noticed it before this case (it’s a small town.  How could she not notice?  She is a reporter.)  Will the scrapbooking group be able to solve the crime before the killer strikes again?I have read previous books in the series, but this is the first one in over a year.  I found it to be very confusing and hard to read.  It jumps around from Annie to Sheila to Karen then Vera.  It is hard to keep it straight.  There are just too many people in the book (you have the main characters as well as their families).  I wish just one person like Annie was the main character and a couple of side people or friends.  The scenes changed quickly which added to the confusion.  One minute you are with Annie and then Karen and then someone else.  There is too much going on in the book.  Besides the murder, we have Annie doing her last story, Karen dating someone that the group does not like or approve of, scrapbooking (I liked this part), Sheila’s not happy with her job, DeeAnn’s back injury and pill addiction, Cookie’s amnesia, and Emma Drummond agoraphobia.  I just think that too much was packed into one story (because there are too many characters).  I did like the scrapbooking and card making tips as well as information on digital scrapbooking.  Overall, the book does have a lovely setting (Cumberland Creek, Virginia), interesting characters (just too many), and an interesting murder mystery.  The author provides some twists along the way to solving the murder.  I liked that the mystery was more complicated and not easy to solve.  I give Scrapbook of the Dead 3.75 out of 5 stars.I received a complimentary copy of Scrapbook of the Dead from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5J58QFJA2FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT30J0#wasThisHelpful","R3E5J58QFJA2FG","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pane and Suffering by Cheryl Hollon is the first book in her new A Webb’s Glass Shop Mystery series.  Savannah Webb has spent the last few years in Seattle studying at the Pilchuck Glass School.  She had to return home to St. Petersburg, Florida due to the passing of her father, John Webb.  She was told that he had a heart attack which made no sense.  Her father was in good shape and did not have a heart condition.  Savannah enters the glass shop on Monday to sell the shop to her father’s longtime friend and co-worker, Hugh Trevor.  When Hugh does not show up before the scheduled class, Savannah starts teaching it.  Then Jacob Underwood, apprentice, enters the custom workshop and finds Hugh dead.The officer assigned the case (a blundering and incompetent idiot) does not believe it is a crime.  Savannah cannot believe that two people from Webb’s Glass Shop died of a heart attack within days of each other.  Then she finds a note that her father left for her.  John Webb was a cryptographer during the Cold War and taught Savannah ciphers.  He has left her clues to follow to find the person that killed him.  With the help of her new friends Edward Morris (owns Queen’s Head Pub) and Amanda Blake (new assistant manager at Webb’s Glass Shop), Savannah sets out to find who hurt her father and Hugh Trevor.  Will she be able to convince the police that they were murdered?  Will they be able to find the murderer before he takes another victim?  And why were those two people killed?I enjoyed Pane and Suffering.  It was a fun book to read.  It started out at a fast pace and just slowed down some in the middle.  The books was easy and fun to read.  I like the characters (Savannah, Edward, Amanda), the setting (St. Petersburg, Florida—I am about an hour or so from this city), and the ciphers (I really liked the ciphers probably because I like puzzles) as well as the geocaching.  I have only seen one other cozy mystery use geocaching.  I found the murder mystery to be a medium level mystery (though the author was clever).  I was able to solve it before I was halfway through the book despite the authors attempt at misdirection.  I cannot wait for the next book in this series.  I give Pane and Suffering 4.25 out of 5 stars.  I think Pane and Suffering is a very good start to a new mystery series.I received a complimentary copy of Pane and Suffering from NetGalley (and the publisher) in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6YZHEQKB8EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT32HK#wasThisHelpful","RS6YZHEQKB8EP","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished Vannetta Chapman’s latest book Anna’s Healing.  Anna Schwartz has moved from her home in Goshen, Indiana to Cody’s Creek, Oklahoma to live with her Uncle Samuel, Aunt Erin, and her grandmother, Ruth.  She is helping with the corn harvest when a tornado touches down.  The horses take off and Anna is thrown from the wagon.  Jacob Graber, a young Amish man who is a traveling farm worker, finds her first and saves her from the second tornado.  Anna is airlifted to Tulsa where it is discovered she has suffered a spinal injury.  She has a complete break in her lower spine.  The doctor states that she will not be able to walk.  Anna is confined to a wheelchair and the family as well as the community work on revamping her Uncle Samuel’s home to suit a wheelchair.  Anna’s accident turns out to be a blessing for the family.  It changes her dour Uncle Samuel and Aunt Erin.  They start becoming more sociable, friendly, and a stronger faith.Anna’s friend, Chloe Roberts is there for Anna.  Chloe met Anna while writing an article on produce stands in Amish country for Mayes County Chronicle.  They become friends and starting spending more time together.  She also introduced Anna to her mother who is involved in making quilts for Project Linus.  Anna starts making colorful little quilts for the project.  Jacob and Anna grow closer during this time, but Anna does not feel that she would be a good wife.  Jacob states he is willing to wait.Nine months later after being ill for some time and everyone thinking Anna would not recover, Anna wakes up and can move her feet.  She gets up and can walk.  Everyone is shocked and thrilled.  The doctor does a new MRI and Anna is completely recovered.  The media flock to her uncle’s farm as well as people who want her to heal them.  Is it a miracle?  How did it happen?  How will this affect Anna’s family and friends?Anna's Healing is well-written and interesting.  Is there such a thing as miracles?  The book is heavy on scripture as Anna’s Mammi frequently quotes scripture and prayer.  Can prayer and a strong faith make a difference?  I did not enjoy Anna’s Healing as well as Vannetta Chapman’s other books.  I found some things to be a little odd in the book.  For instance they let Anna goes off by herself when people are trying to get her (and they have a Governor’s special task force protecting her and the farm).  This book will leave with you questions and you will think about it after you have finished reading the book (which is what books are supposed to do).  Some sections in the books were easy to read and others were more difficult (like slogging through a mud pit).  Overall, I enjoyed Anna’s Healing and I look forward to reading more books by Vannetta Chapman.  I give Anna’s Healing 4 out of 5 stars.I received a complimentary copy of Anna’s Healing from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QAGYASVXDLGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736956034#wasThisHelpful","R3QAGYASVXDLGO","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Followed by Frost is the latest book by Charlie N. Holmberg.  Smitha Ronson is seventeen years old and very self-centered.  Smitha has been spoiled by her father her whole life.  Mordan Alteraz is a new arrival in the town of Euwan.  Most people were skeptical of him, but Mr. Ronson welcomed him to town and gave him a job at his turnery.  Mordan has been especially interested in Smitha since his arrival despite the cold shoulder Smitha has given him.  One day she gets frustrated by his attentions and tells him how she really feels about him (she is cruel).  Turns out that Mordan is a wizard, and he puts a curse on Smitha.  He curses her to be as cold as her heart and that cold will follow her wherever she goes.  Mordan then disappears.Smitha runs home to her parents’ house.  Her father immediately sets out to find Mordan, but he cannot be located.  Smitha hair starts turning white, her skin is very pale and her lips turn blue.  Everything she touches turns to ice.  A snow cloud follows her dumping snow about a mile around Smitha.  Smitha takes to her bed while everyone in town is huddling in their homes from the icy temperatures.  When a child becomes ill and then dies, the town turns on Smitha.  Smitha does not believe that the little boy is really that sick and pays him a visit (pushes her way into the family’s house).  Smitha sees Death next to the little boy.  Smitha and Death are both surprised.  Smitha runs while Death looks thoughtful.Smitha is forced by the town and her parents to leave Euwan.  She takes to the woods and starts traveling north.  Smitha at first hopes to find another wizard who can help her break the curse.  Smitha is surprised one night to be visited by Death.  His name is Sadriel.  He is glad to have someone who can see him and talk to him.  He would love Smitha to come over into his world.  But that would mean Smitha giving up her life and the cold would still be with her.  Smitha refuses.  She travels through the mountain for the next three years.  She cannot go into towns and then people start hunting her in the hills.  One day she is chased but men on horses.  But these men need her help.  Prince Imad Al Hraith of the Fourth Generation lives in the Untamed Lands (the desert).  They have had no rain for a long time.  They are out of water and need her help.  Smitha agrees to go with them to Mac’Hliah (the main town with the palace).  Will Smitha finally find people that will accept her (curse and all)?  Is there a way for Smitha to break the curse or will she give in to Sadriel?I have enjoyed Charlie N. Holmberg’s other books and was eager to read Followed by Frost.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  It is an interesting idea that had great potential, but I just felt that the story turned out to be a long drawn out romance.  It was a disappointment.  At the beginning it goes along smoothly (and quickly) and then it slows down to a crawl until close to the end.  The book was missing something.  It needed more.  The writing is okay, but this book was not as good as the author’s previous works.

"Come Rain or Come Shine by Jan Karon is the book that readers have been looking forward to for a long time.  Dooley Kavanaugh and Lace Harper are getting married.  They have decided to get married at their new home, Meadowgate.  Meadowgate is a farm in Farmer, North Carolina.  They want it to be a simple wedding (no wedding is simple).  The wedding date is set for June 14.  Dooley and Lace decided to make it a potluck dinner reception (asking each guest to bring a dish).  Until the wedding, they have plenty to keep them busy.  Dooley has to finish veterinary school and graduate.  They are busy fixing up the farm (the house, fences, and barn).  They have purchased four cows and are awaiting the arrival of their new bull, Choo-Choo (I am not kidding).  Dooley will be taking over a veterinary practice after graduation and they will be installing a new sign that reads “Kavanaugh Animal Wellness Clinic”.Lace is looking forward to her new life.  She is busy looking for a wedding dress (she wants to get one for $100), making and selling her paintings (which will pay for some extras, and creating a wedding gift for Dooley.  Father Tim and Cynthia have moved out to the farm to help out until the wedding.  Lace and Dooley also have a special surprise for their parents.  They have had something in the works for two years, and it is finally happening just before the wedding.  Let us hope that everything goes off without a hitch.  What could go wrong (rain, not enough food, surprise guests, escaping animals)?Read Come Rain or Come Shine to find out what happens.  I was so excited when I got a copy of this book.  I have read all the books in this series (and loved them).  Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment.  The main problem is the way it was written.  It is written from the perspective of the different characters (not just one as in first person).  It jumps around and it can be very confusing.  One moment it is Lace, then Father Tim, and then who knows who.  You have to guess sometimes (because the author only used pronouns and not names) and it changes abruptly (you had to guess based on what the person was saying).  This made the novel hard to read.  I do not know what possessed the author to write the novel in this format.  I wish it had been written differently so Come Rain or Come Shine could have been more enjoyable to read.  I give Come Rain or Come Shine 3.75 out of 5 stars.I received a complimentary copy of Come Rain or Come Shine from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50KH6E7ZFTRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZKLS#wasThisHelpful","R50KH6E7ZFTRR","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All Fall Down by Jennifer Weiner is a book about a wife, mother, and blogger that gets addicted to pain killers.  Allison Weiss (almost 40) is a wife to Dave, a reporter for the Philadelphia Examiner.  They have a daughter Eloise (they call her Ellie) who is extremely sensitive (doctor’s diagnosis).  Everything is too loud, too rough, or harsh for the little girl.  Ellie also has attitude issues.  She acts out in public, yells when talking, and definitely likes to get her way (or temper tantrum time).  Allison was originally a stay-at-home mom, but then she was hired to be a writer for the blog Ladiesroom.com.  Allison writes stories about marriage and motherhood.  Dave is at work most of the time or training for a marathon (instead of spending time with the family he is “training” on the weekends).  Allison’s father has Alzheimer’s and her mother is having difficulty coping.  Her father always took care of her mother (took care of finances, they had a housekeeper, and she does not even drive).  Now Allison is having to help her mother in addition to her responsibilities.Allison hurt her back working out at the gym and her doctor gave her some painkillers.  That was the beginning of her addiction.  They meds helped her get through the day and also helped her writing (she became bolder with her writing).  It starts out with one or two pills a day (she has them in little Altoid’s tins), then two pills at a time, and then five or six a day (Oxy, Vicodin, and Percocet).  Allison was doctor shopping (going to various doctors to get multiple pain prescriptions).  Then Allison discovers a web site where she can get the meds without needing a prescription (how handy).  Allison was up to over 600 milligrams a day of Oxycodone when her functioning became impaired (with the help of a glass of wine).  She goes to pick up Ellie at school and is stopped by a teacher (a teacher monitors the pickup line at Ellie’s school), Allison knows she needs to do something.  She contacts a doctor who gives her Suboxone (it takes care of pain without the opiates).  Allison ends up in the hospital.  Will she get the help she needs or will she lose everything?All Fall Down tells of how she got addicted and what happens after her addiction is discovered.  I found it to be an interesting story and well written (the author has a good writing style).  One thing that is odd is Allison’s lack of emotions.  She is more matter of fact.  You do not feel her love for her husband or daughter.  I expected more emotion especially during the second half of the book.  We do not get much detail on the husband.  His character is also very different in the last half of the book.  Davie is made out to be distant and uninvolved (especially with daughter), then he completely changes (it was odd).  However, the book had me hooked, and I stayed up late to find out what happened to Allison.  I give All Fall Down 3.75 out of 5 stars.  I did not like the ending.  It was abrupt and leaves the reader with questions.  I wish the author had included an epilogue.I won a copy of All Fall Down from Goodreads First Reads Program.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RTKA8V4BA3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM909W#wasThisHelpful","R28RTKA8V4BA3T","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Poet and the Prophecy by Cecilia Tan is the fourth book in the Magical University series.  This book is an erotic novel with a magical theme (the cover makes it look like a young adult or children’s book).  Kyle Wadsworth is entering his senior year at Veritas (next to Harvard).  It is a college for magical students.  Kyle has been asked to move back into Gladius House (like a dorm), and that Timothy Frost will be moving back in as well (Kyle is in love with him).  Kyle cannot forget Frost, but Frost wants Kyle to keep his distance.  Frost is a man during the day and a girl at night (Frost thinks it is a curse and dislikes his female form).  Kyle broke the enchantment that kept Frost a man full-time and no one has been able to fix it.  Kyle wants to try fixing the problem for Frost (and hoping it will mend their relationship).There are some big problems in the magical world.  People are losing their abilities (the Sight) and people are saying that the Burning Days (the end of magic) are coming.  Kyle and his friends work to find a solution.  Can they fix the problem in time?  Will Timothy Frost ever let Kyle get close to him?I find Timothy Frost to be a very weak character.  I got very tired of him pushing Kyle away and the whining.  He was dealt his lot (and he has suffered a lot in his short life), but he has to find a way to live with being two genders.  The Poet and the Prophecy got much better in the second half of the book.  It is not as good as the first book in the series, but much better than books two and three.  The book does have a good ending and a nice epilogue.  I give The Poet and the Prophecy 3.75 out of 5 stars.  I think the author made the magic a little too complicated (I started skimming through the technical talk after a while).  I also do not think this series lived up to its potential.  The first book was very good and interesting, but the rest of the series just to live up to that first novel.  Please be aware that the novel does contain foul language and explicit sex scenes.  You do have to read the other book in the series in order to understand what is going on in The Poet and the Prophecy (otherwise you will be lost).I received a complimentary copy of The Poet and the Prophecy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CXP9MVLM7YSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143VTT26#wasThisHelpful","R1CXP9MVLM7YSG","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tea, Tiramisu and Tough Guys by Harper Lin is a fun cozy mystery to read.  It is the second book in the Cape Bay Cafe Mysteries.  Francesca “Fran” Amaro owns Antonia’s Italian Café.  She serves all types of coffees and some sweet treats.  Thanks to a British customer, Fran is exploring adding tea drinks to the menu.  Fran and Matt Cardosi have been spending more time together since Fran solved the murder of Matt’s father.  Matt and Fran grew up together and are now neighbors.  They are also exploring have a closer relationship (as a couple).  Things are going along smoothly when the local gossip tells them that Joe Davis has been stabbed to death in the parking lot of Todd’s Gym.  Joe is a few years younger than Fran, but her second in command, Sammy grew up with Joe.  Turns out that the owner of Todd’s Gym was the guy Fran had a crush on in high school.  His name is Todd Caruthers (typical sports jock).  Fran decides to investigate the murder (she cannot help herself) despite warnings from Mike, the local police detective.Todd turns out to be the main suspect, but Fran is sure he is innocent (based on two conversations).  Matt tries to show Fran that Todd could be guilty based on the facts.  This case puts Matt and Fran at odds with each other (I think Matt is jealous of Todd).  Who really killed Joe Davis?  Can Fran solve the case?  What will happen to the budding relationship between Matt and Fran?  You will have to read Tea, Tiramisu and Tough Guys to find out!  I found this to be an enjoyable novel to read.  It provided many laughs for me.  I give Tea, Tiramisu and Tough Guys 4.25 out of 5 stars.  My one problem is the person who committed the crime was not introduced until late in the book (and then it is obvious he committed the crime). My favorite part of a cozy mystery is solving the murder and I did not get the opportunity with this book.  This book can easily be read without reading the first book in the series (I did).I received a complimentary copy of Tea, Tiramisu and Tough Guys from the author in exchange for an honest review.

"Her Final Breath by Robert Dugoni is the second book in the Tracy Crosswhite series.  In the first book they mentioned the case of Nicole Hansen, a young woman that was killed in a motel.  The person had hog tied her so that if she relaxed, she strangled from the rope around her neck.  The A-Team of the Violent Crimes section was unable to solve the case (Tracy was working on her sister’s murder case at the time) and after a month their boss, Captain Johnny Nolasco moved the case to the Cold Case Unit.  Now Tracy Crosswhite and her team have another victim.  The killer is escalating.Tracy is also having trouble with her boss, Johnny Nolasco.  He is determined to get rid of Tracy while making himself look good (he has carried this vendetta for twenty years)!  He is setting Tracy up for failure with The Cowboy Killer case (as this guy has been dubbed).  Tracy is enjoying her relationship with Dan O’Leary.  He is still living in Cedar Grove, but he frequently drives to Seattle to spend time with Tracy.  Dan also gets involved in the Cowboy Killer case.  They have a case that was closed nine years earlier that could be related (Beth Stinson).  It was closed by Captain Johnny Nolasco and his partner who were known for cutting corners (and working the evidence to frame who they believed was the guilty party).  Tracy cannot work the case at work because of Captain Nolasco (he will not like it).  Dan starts questioning the witnesses and Wayne Gerhardt (who was convicted of the crime).  Can they find the killer in time?  How many more victims will there be before they catch the Cowboy Killer?Her Final Breath was a good book.  It has a lot of twists and turns on the road to finding the killer.  However, the killer was very obvious.  I knew who it was from the moment the character was introduced (I avoided descriptive pronouns so there would not be a spoiler).  The writer did provide some great clues and wrote a good mystery.  I felt that Her Final Breath was a little long (it is longer than the first book and twice the length of a cozy mystery).  I think there could have been some editing to make it a better novel (a lot of descriptive paragraphs).  I give Her Final Breath 4.5 out of 5 stars (since I was able to solve the mystery).

"My Sister’s Grave by Robert Dugoni is a great mystery novel and the first book in the Tracy Crosswhite series.  Tracy Crosswhite has been haunted by the disappearance of her sister, Sarah (disappeared in 1993) for the last twenty years.  Tracy lost her husband (he could not take her obsession with the case), her father committed suicide, and she changed jobs (from teacher to detective).  Edmund House was convicted of the crime of kidnapping and killing her sister, but Sarah’s (Tracy’s sister) body has never been found.  There was also something wrong with the evidence and testimony at the trial.  After twenty years the body has been discovered.  It was previously covered over with water from a dam which was why it was not found previously.  Tracy reconnects with her childhood friend, Dan O’Leary.  Dan is an attorney and Tracy asks him to look over her file.  Dan agrees that something was going on at the trial and with some of the evidence.Dan takes on Edmund House’s case.  All the evidence will be brought out again and witnesses will be questioned.  There are some people, though, that do not want this to happen.  Some things are better left alone.  Tracy cannot let the case rest.  She has unanswered questions.  Tracy wants everything out in the open, so she can finally put it behind her.  Will Tracy get the answers she desires?  Who really killed Sarah Crosswhite and why?I enjoyed reading My Sister’s Grave.  The novel grabbed me in the first chapter.  I think some sections could have been eliminated, but it was overall a well-written book.  I figured out the mystery, but I loved following the clues.  I give My Sister’s Grave 4 out of 5 stars.I received a complimentary copy of My Sister’s Grave from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25U7VAWS3JZU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2EOONI#wasThisHelpful","R25U7VAWS3JZU3","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Detective’s Secret by Lesley Thomson is a very long drawn out novel.  Stella and Jack have other jobs, but they have also had success in solving mysteries.  William Frost wants to hire them to find out what really happened to his brother, Rick.  Jack actually saw Rick run and jump in front of a train.  Was it suicide or did someone make him do it?  There is also the mystery of what happened to a man who was locked in a water tower back in the late 1980’s.  The two mysteries are linked.  Stella and Jack work to solve them.I did not enjoy The Detective’s Secret.  It is a very long and protracted novel with an extremely confusing beginning.  I did not think it would ever end (and I was sorry I ever agreed to read it).  I managed to finish the novel, but my heart was not in it.  The main characters are not likable.  Jack is creepy and likes to say these strange rhymes.  Stella is a worry wart and I did not like her attitude towards Stanley, the dog.  The only interesting thing in this book was the two mysteries (that were tied together).  I give The Detective’s Secret 2 out of 5 stars (for the mysteries and how they were linked together).  There are a lot of descriptive paragraphs that could have been eliminated (they were completely unnecessary).I received a complimentary copy of The Detective’s Secret from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBF5LZXFD3NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KN78GU#wasThisHelpful","R1IBF5LZXFD3NJ","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Loft by Bette Lee Crosby is the second book in the Memory House series.  Annie Cross is marrying Oliver Doyle.  It has been a year since Annie stumbled across The Memory House Bed and Breakfast and Ophelia Browne in Burnsville.  Ophelia and Annie are a family.  Annie is leaving on her honeymoon when she has a feeling that something is wrong with Ophelia.  They turn around and find out that Ophelia decided to drive herself to church (after not driving for a year) and suffered a heart attack.  Ophelia needed surgery and then has to have six to eight weeks of rehabilitation.  The doctor states that Ophelia will need to make some life changes and that includes no stairs (the stairs in her home lead to her beloved loft). Oliver and Annie decide to build a duplicate to Ophelia’s precious loft on the ground level.  They enlist the services of Max Martinelli.  Max is an architect with a special soul.  She can feel the wonderful memories in the house.  Annie and Max hit it off right away.Ophelia, though, while in rehab makes some new friends and discovers a new life.  A life of living with friends and fun (instead of living with her memories of her deceased husband).  Ophelia meets Lillian Markowitz.  Lillian is loud and brassy but extremely friendly.  Lillian and her friends show Ophelia that there is fun to be had with new friends and, maybe a new home!  Can Ophelia move on without hurting Annie’s feelings?  Annie has a new husband and the beginnings of a new life.  Is Annie ready to embrace this new life or will she cling to the Ophelia?  Oliver just wants Annie to be happy, but he also wants her to love him as much as she does Ophelia.  Just when things are going good for Annie, something tragic happens.  Annie had so much happiness that the scale was tipped too far in one direction.  Annie will have to have faith and love to get the scale back in balance.The Loft was such a lovely novel.  It is a Christian themed novel, but it is not in any way preachy.  It is well written and enjoyable to read.  The book just moves along nicely (no chopping endings or rough transitions).  You will smile, laugh, sigh, and cry while reading The Loft.  I give The Loft 4.5 out of 5 stars.  The ending is the one thing that bothered me.  We are left with a question.  We will have to wait until the next book to find out the answer.I received a complimentary copy of The Loft from the author in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TIEX2IXG5XU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0139IB0M6#wasThisHelpful","R2TIEX2IXG5XU3","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Scam by Janet Evanovich and Lee Goldberg is the fourth book in the Fox and O’Hare series.  Kate O’Hare is an FBI Agent who has an unusual partner.  Nicolas Fox is a world class con artist and thief.  Kate caught him and the FBI is now using him to catch other criminals.  Their latest assignment is taking them into the world of gambling and money laundering in Macao (China).  They are going to take down Evan Trace who owns Cote d’Argent (a hotel in Las Vegas as well).  He lets unscrupulous people launder their money through his casinos (for a fee).  Kate and Nick will have to come up with a good plan to take down Evan Trace.  They will have the help of Kate’s father, Jack O’Hare (retired army who loves weapons, spending time in jungles, and blowing up things).  This team will have to work quickly and be able to adapt in order to catch their prey.The Scam is a fast-paced novel that is so much fun to read.  There is a lot of action in the book as well as some steamy romance.  I give The Scam 4.5 out of 5 stars.  The one thing I did not like was the cliffhanger ending (spoiler).  You can enjoy The Scam without having read the previous books in the series (I did).  If you are looking for a thriller/suspense book with a lot of action (and some fun), this is the book for you!I received a complimentary copy of The Scam from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNVJLCFH7R6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSSMKF4#wasThisHelpful","RFNVJLCFH7R6W","A2ROA7E44PBCS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ROA7E44PBCS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Already being a fan of OZ Naturals Skin Science Nature Products, I was excited to get to try this Tinted Moisturizer 30 SPF Sunscreen.  I am very fair skinned and I use a sunscreen every day of the year, so I never get any color from the sun.  I like that this has a medium tint to it and gives me that healthy sun kissed glow without being fake or orange or unnatural looking. I like that it comes in an easy to use squeeze tube with a hinged cap.  It is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  I just make sure to apply evenly, leaving no dry spots on my face, neck and upper chest, so the color will be even and natural looking. I really like how this works and does not stain or streak.  I use it as a part of my daily regime and I reapply during summer months when I am out all day in the sun, water and wind. I received this product in exchange for a review.

"Having only one spigot outside our home, I was happy to get this Garden Hose Splitter- 2way Y Shape by GardenPro. I like how easy this splitter is to attached to the spigot and the hoses.  It works great, has a tight seal and does not leak.  I like that the on/off handles are large and not difficult to push.  I love that I can water my backyard and my side yard at the same time and not have to worry about dragging the hose to the side yard after the backyard has been watered.  This saves me a lot of time and work.  I also like that I can have an open spigot for kids to wash hands off and to fill their water toys, without them having to unscrew the hose.  This little garden hose splitter really does come in handy, I would not do without it now that I have it! I recommend it for anyone who does any yard work, car washing, gardening etc.  I think it would make a nice gift especially for someone who cannot manage to drag the hose around the yard.

"Having seen these wristbands, I thought of a few different ways of using them, so I was happy to get these Tyvek Wristband Rainbow 200 Count Variety Pack by Goldistock.  Our 1st graders school colors are this color blue so I thought these wristbands would be perfect to put on her as a reminder of the days events.  Sometimes she rides the bus to school and gets picked up on the way home. Sometimes she gets a ride to school and takes the bus back home, since she is in 1st grade and does not always remember, I thought this is a great way to remind her and her teacher whether she rides the bus home or not or is being picked up. I also like that if she has an appointment I can write that on their as well. I also think these wristbands are nice for when we have day trips to the zoo or the water park or theme park, I can write my phone number on the band just in case she gets lost.  I have also used them to tag the stroller and backpacks.  They work great on all size wrists, a sharpie marker works to write on them, they don't stretch or fray throughout the day and the writing stays legible, even in the rain.  I am sure there are many more uses for these wristbands. I am glad I got them because I feel good knowing my girls have this safety measure.I received this product in exchange for a review.

The zippered case with handles is very nice for storage, it is flat and thin and can fit just about anywhere when not in use.  I like that the door flap can be tied up so there is an open entrance or the kids can close it if they want.

"For international and other network use, the phone can be unlocked by your provider if you fulfill their unlock requirements. Be aware that TMobile's unlock rules differ if it's prepaid vs postpaid (Simple Mobile) service. These phones can also be unlocked by paying an unlock service (google). The going rate for unlock service is $40 so it may be better to buy the cheaper AT&T 635 model (as opposed to the more expensive TMobile version) if you are going to use an unlock service. I used an unlock service to unlock an AT&T 635. I also had TMobile unlock several 635s. In all cases, the phones work wonderfully well on French LTE service and likely on LTE anywhere in Europe. I'm getting up to 85Mbps downloads on French Bouygues service. That's hugely fast for any 2014 year phone and service, much faster than my tests in America. TMobile's Simple Mobile plans are industry leading for international travel and their unlock requirements are far better than AT&T. A reason to buy the TMobile version (must use a TMobile SIM card) is WiFi calling feature. WiFi Calling allows you to call and receive calls on any WiFi network. It works everywhere across the world given a healthy Internet connection. That said, I have experienced both good quality and frequent dropped calls on WiFi Calling everywhere -- it almost works well but not quite mature yet.

"Cleverly designed product. microSD card fits into the full-sized USB end thus saving space. Works well with a Samsung Pro 64GB card (80MBps+, NTFS formatted). If you need to transfer lots of GB at a time, I recommend having a second microSD reader that offers USB 3.0, otherwise you'll be transferring at USB 2.0 speeds -- potentially an hour or more.

The light itself is a pleasing color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32VO814RK7XBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8ONAMU#wasThisHelpful","R32VO814RK7XBT","A1UEL5C1N6E5SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEL5C1N6E5SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can confirm that the five port Anker 25W 5V / 5A(Max) Model E150 USB adapter can simultaneously charge two tablets (iPad 3 and Nexus 7) and three smartphones. That feat suggests that 25W output may be close. I could not get two tablets and two smartphones to charge on a competitor's 20W 4-banger device. I'll take the Anker over the other guy's any day.The device's 5 ports are really useful at airports and cafes where people would otherwise battle over wall socket rights. If you're a frequent traveler, you know what I mean. AC input is 100-240v 50-60Hz enabling worldwide electrical compatibility. The power cord is around 3 foot and uses a common appliance 2 wire connector to mate with the device. You can probably find a replacement cord that's longer or has a different plug for international use. To use worldwide, you'll need either a physical adapter or a different power cord. An EU version of the device is sold on amazon.de.Testing note: I took some missteps in early testing. I initially used a Triplite multi-plug adapter to plug in the Anker. The fuse kept blowing. I assumed the Anker was doing so but it was actually the multi-plug adapter. Next I noticed the iPad would charge for seconds and then stop. Turns out the cheap iPhone USB cable I was using doesn't connect well in an Anker port but does connect ok with the Apple charger. Likely the cheap iPad 3 cable is out of spec, probably not the Anker(?). All other USB cables worked fine with the Anker. The lesson is it's easy to misjudge fault even with such a seemingly simple device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKTF4B0G1W34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVH62J2#wasThisHelpful","R1XKTF4B0G1W34","A1UEL5C1N6E5SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEL5C1N6E5SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 26-Jun-2013: Hurray! The touchpad issues have been normalized with a driver update from ASUS. I downloaded and installed SmartGesture_Win7_8_VER201 from ASUS website. It fixes the issues with the touchpad. However, I still prefer turning off all features in ASUS Smart Gesture except for single touch ""Select"" and ""Activate"". Also, I prefer, in Control Panel->Mouse->Pointer Options, select ""Fast"" in pointer speed and check ""Enhanced pointer precision"". These have been a major improvement so I've raised my rating to a full 5 stars.Update 18-Mar-2013: Wanted to specifically mention that battery endurance is impressive for my usage. I can get up to four hours of web surfing if I needed it. I find that I'm more productive with this computer because the processor and SSD (user upgrade) are quite fast. My morning web surfing episodes are noticeably shorter.Update 15-Mar-2013: I improved the touchpad by installing ASUS touchpad driver from their website and customizing features. The current driver is named SmartGesture_ASUS_Win7_8_VER1036.zip. Once installed, double click the ASUS SmartGesture icon in the taskbar (usually bottom-right on desktop). My preference, YMMV, was to uncheck all features except Select and Activate. I still don't like the touchpad but now it's more predictable. I also changed Control Panel->Mouse->Pointer Options->select-a-pointer-speed a couple notches faster.The ASUS X202e (ASUS S200e) is an excellent value despite its flaws. Here's some tweaks to share. Some require hacker-level experience. I use the X202e mainly for web surfing. Your tweaks may vary with use case.1. Replace the hard drive with an SSD for much faster speed. The processor is quite fast for web surfing but you'll really appreciate the added speed of an SSD. I only need a 60GB+ SSD for my usage. Be sure the SSD is a 7mm height drive such as a Samsung 840.2. I hate bloatware. I reinstalled Windows 8 from a generic 64-bit Windows 8 DVD. No activation key was needed. The only driver I needed beyond what Windows 8 installed was the audio drivers for the microphone. I downloaded from ASUS support web page. I installed using a generic USB DVD drive.3. The default screen settings make the display a bit washed out looking. To fix, right click on the desktop->Graphics Properties->Display->Color Enhancements. Change Brightness to -20, Contrast to 51 and Gamma to 0.9.4. I use Ninite.com to quickly install many often used programs.5. I swear the touchpad has been improved by an initial cleaning. I used window cleaner.6. I haven't found a better touchpad driver than the stock Windows 8 driver. I'm open to alternate drivers. Please make recommendations in comments but please, document any non-standard settings.7. I reset the BIOS to defaults and then chose ""Optimal Settings"". Don't assume the manufacturer installed with optimal settings selected.8. I love Windows 8 but only when with the Windows 7 shell, so I installed EX7FORW8 software. Recommended. Touch continues to work.With these tweaks, you'll get a much better X202E experience. I'm hoping a new driver will improve the too touchy touchpad. Yes, the screen could be a bit better but it's acceptable. Battery life is ample with my usage. I get about 4 hours web surfing -- more than expected and more than needed for my usage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R201LR8AJFAI5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AP66YL8#wasThisHelpful","R201LR8AJFAI5Y","A1UEL5C1N6E5SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEL5C1N6E5SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Part of the function of Amazon user reviews, besides qualitative ratings, is to supplement and refine information about a product. One wonders how so many good products, such as this tiny wireless router, become under-described and thus under-purchased. Let me do this router justice by filling in some significant details.1. It's a travel router, the size of a jigger, light as a feather.2. It has two Ethernet ports -- one more than the competition. The additional port is an extremely useful and unique feature. It enables use as a transparent wired-to-wireless bridge. To do so, plug Ethernet into the LAN port, leaving the WAN port unconnected. It will broadcast WiFi using the same subnet (same IP range, you must disable DHCP server) as its Ethernet connection. You can give it the same/different WiFi password as the other access point. I'm not aware of any other travel router that can use an existing subnet. The others create a new subnet.3. It works everywhere in the world. A dual voltage (100-240v) US adapter is supplied, but it also works off of any USB connection such as on a notebook computer. A USB cable is also supplied.4. The WAN port, in addition to dynamic DHCP, also offers static DHCP, PPTP and L2TP modes. PPTP and L2TP are required for setting up the router as direct to VPN. I use this feature (not yet tested on this router), to connect to the popular HideMyAss VPN service to impersonate an IP address from another location, useful for receiving NetFlix while traveling abroad.5. I can confirm this device can WiFi broadcast Internet to at least 15Mbps, probably somewhat higher. I haven't benchmarked an all wired scenario.6. I'd like to highlight that this router is ipv6 compatible. That's a bit rare for travel routers. I haven't tested this feature.A minor con is the device does not come with a travel bag. I keep it in a Ziploc bag.Update: 9-Nov-2012: I'm unable to get the VPN feature (PPTP or L2TP) to work with HideMyAss VPN service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBUVVQQTXTQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0069ABLF8#wasThisHelpful","R2QBUVVQQTXTQK","A1UEL5C1N6E5SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEL5C1N6E5SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first tale, Confederacy in Blue, takes a look at the legends -- and the modern, historical perspective -- of the anti-abolitionist movement in Columbia County, the hatred for Lincoln and distrust of the Union army, and racist perspectives that linger to today. Writing from points of view set in 1864, when the killing of a bounty hunter looking for draft dodgers set off harsh reprisals by the Union, and 2013, when a modern scholar wrestles with the contemporary perception of those events, Laubach links the racism of the Civil War era with the racism of the Obama presidency.It ends a little too abruptly, though, leaving the reader to wonder what happened next in both eras.Season of the Witch explores a very different place in history, the 1928 slaying of a powwow doctor in York County by a man who believed he was ""hexed."" The story pulls together the paths of John Blymire, who believes his own healing powers have been snatched away by a more established practitioner, Nelson Rehmeyer, and is led to murder by the advice of Nellie Noll, the River Witch of Marietta.The stories place the reader in the moment of both events, rounding out the facts as they are known with well-reasoned fiction.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYWENVP4HEEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991096258#wasThisHelpful","R2HYWENVP4HEEB","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But what I get from this product is roughly roundish ice shapes that have roundish parts but aren't really round.The problems are, they design doesn't really keep water from seeping between the four ice chambers, so when you open this up you have a sheet of ice connecting the balls, and it's impossible -- unless maybe you're using a funnel of some kind -- to fill the spherical chambers properly without overflowing and getting a slab of ice on top.So it's a good idea but the design isn't perfect.

"I enjoy some young-adult novels, but it’s rare that I -- my youngest child is 17 -- will go out and buy an illustrated children’s book. An exception to that statement is any book penned by Jane Yolen, who has written so many good books for adults, young adults and children that I would never hesitate to curl up with her latest to read.This one is special, because it deals with one of my favorite topics: whales. And, as Yolen is an honest sort, she doesn’t sugarcoat the reality of the central leviathan in this tale.“Stranded Whale” is obliquely about a massive sperm whale that beaches itself on a remote Maine beach in 1971. It is more directly about the three school-age siblings who find the helpless animal and do what they can -- all well-intentioned but ultimately fruitless efforts -- to save it.This story is not a feel-good yarn, nor should you expect a happy ending. It touches briefly but deeply on the emotional impact a creature in peril can have on a person, no matter how fleeting their interaction.Illustrations by Melanie Cataldo suit the story neatly, with muted colors and a slight graininess to the art that reminds me of classic children’s books from my youth.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBE9FFSZUAQVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763669539#wasThisHelpful","RBE9FFSZUAQVC","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item free in exchange for an honest review. I had previously received an ice-ball mold that produced four balls in one, and I had less than stellar results. This product is far better.For one thing, the four molds are not attached to one another, so you don't have that pesky overflow of water that freezes and bonds them together. These molds hold their shape better, without leakage, so you actually get ice balls that are ROUND. The holes at the top are easy to fill, and the molds are easy to separate once the water has frozen. You're left with large, almost perfectly round balls of ice that melt slowly in your drink and look cool all the while.I'm a fan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4X2DFX43OHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK593E6#wasThisHelpful","RP4X2DFX43OHZ","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At the same time, they're not something I'd use very often and I can't really see the point of them.

"I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. And, I suppose, because I'm a notorious tippler who would appreciate products made for the discerning drinker of alcoholic refreshments. Which I am.The glasses are plain but stylish even so, with the double-walled glass adding a classy-looking thickness to the set. The gap between walls means your glasses shouldn't sweat, and temperatures should not transfer as much between the drink (hot or cold) and your hands. In my experience so far, this would be true.The whiskey stones are great for anyone who wants to chill a beverage without the dilution that comes with melting ice. They are sturdy and attractive, and they hold a chill for a good long while. I'd be careful about dropping them into a glass from any great height, but overall they're a nice touch to the experience.I'm not sure I'd sell these products together; although related, they seem more like accessories to one another, rather than a matched set.

"This fountain water dish and feeder, which I received free in exchange for an honest review, is pretty cool. I like the pump, which keeps the water moving and seems to please my dog, too. It holds lots of water. The little nightlight, which also makes it easy to see how fool the tank is, is also a good idea.There are a few minor issues that I hope they fix if they redesign this product. They're not deal-breakers, but they could make it even better.- White isn't a great choice when you're dealing with dog food. It looks dirty almost immediately after you begin using it.- The fountain turns on when you plug it in. A switch would be nice; I don't like to leave it running constantly, and I don't like having to reach around to plug or unplug it every time I want to flip the switch.- When it's off, the water drains into the reservoir. It would be nice if some water remained up top so my dog could get water even when it's off. As it is, I either have to keep it on constantly or I need a second water dish.- The food bowl is right beside the water dish. If your dog is a sloppy eater -- and mine is -- that means you'll get food in the water, sometimes even in the hole where the water percolates up from the reservoir.Like I said, these aren't big flaws but they are small annoyances. I hope they take another look at the design and make this product even better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GSUFHL61Y52Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE7ETJQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GSUFHL61Y52Q","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Valerie Estelle Frankel is far more invested in the Holmesian tradition than I. In fact, one might assume she has studied the great detective's many lives under a magnifying glass, deerstalker cap firmly planted on her head.Her book is an exhaustive bit of research. She examines the particulars of the BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as his erstwhile companion, Dr. John Watson, and she relates every plot twist, every minor character, every tiny clue and textual reference to Doyle's original work, as well as the various classic screen portrayals. I suspect the reading would be a little dry if you saw down and read the book through -- unless, I suppose, you are a true Holmes fanatic. I instead kept the book handy, and each day I read one or two chapters, most connected to a single episode and its many references.Frankel examines each episode's title, its story, connections to canon, locations, innuendo (are Holmes and Watson more than friends?), ties to the actors' outside work and references to pop and British culture, such as the closely connected series Doctor Who and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the protagonists' work on The Hobbit.It's a little daunting to see how much work the show's makers put into these little Easter eggs for fans, and it's even more so to imagine how much time Frankel spent finding them all.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365DGQ2P2027C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615953522#wasThisHelpful","R365DGQ2P2027C","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Annually, some of the best musicians from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, throw a week-long party -- the Celtic Colours International Festival -- and they invite a bunch of friends from nations and musical styles around the world. It's an experience not to be missed, in part because of the musical friendships and collaborations that form during that week of music.In 2011, the Barra MacNeils -- a talented musical family from Sydney Mines -- were artists in residence for the festival. They closeted themselves in the studio with some of the guests that year, producing 10 tracks that blend voices and techniques in combinations that will likely never again be repeated.The result is amazing.

"I had high hopes for this album, solely because I have had exceptional luck with music from the Nova Scotia region, which boasts some of the finest Celtic performers on the market, whether playing purely traditional music or taking it in new directions. At the same time, I was wary, because the name ""Celtic Angel"" and the title ""Celtic Hits"" sound like gimmicks meant to snare tourists, rather than appeal to true fans of Irish, Scottish and Maritime culture. The selection of songs -- chestnuts including ""Wild Mountain Thyme,"" ""Danny Boy,"" ""Scotland the Brave,"" ""Skye Boat Song,"" ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Loch Lomond"" -- also had me worried, since Fraser obviously is treading well-worn paths with her choices.My fears were justified, while my hopes were not.

"""Kama Sutra: Connect the Dots"" by Eland Sparklers (a pseudonym, obviously) is exactly what it says it is -- a copy of portions of the Hindu sex manual with numbered dots replacing some of the more intimate bits.

Question is ... why? What is the target audience here? Face it, connect the dots is a child's pastime, something that hones artistic skills and fosters creativity at an early age. Are there really adults out there who are so hard up for a glimpse of entwined limbs and sketchy nudity that they'll connect the dots to get it?

"Taped live in 2007 at the Millburn Stone Memorial Theater at Cecil Community College in Northeast, Md., this concert recording features singer Charlie Zahm at his vocal best.The CD is dominated by Scottish and Irish songs, including ""Westering Home,"" ""Follow Me Up to Carlow,"" ""Mairi's Wedding,"" ""Minstrel Boy"" and ""Scotland the Brave."" Other songs range from Nova Scotia (""Out on the Mira,"" ""Farewell to Nova Scotia"") to Broadway (""Memory"") and include a handful of Zahm originals: ""Summer Rains,"" ""Sweet Virginia,"" ""Lighthouse on the Shore"").All combined, it's an excellent concert experience, proof that Zahm sings equally well in the studio or on the stage.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HVDDB11QN1L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GI72P2#wasThisHelpful","R1HVDDB11QN1L7","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collections of quotations are by their nature hit and miss affairs. Any good collection, on any topic, will provide pearls of wisdom or wit that the reader has never before seen or heard. At the same time, every collection at some point lets the reader down, omitting some key phrase or source that absolutely MUST be included.“The Quotable Sailor” draws its quotations from varied sources: authors, poets, philosophers, sailors, political figures and more. Topics include sailing, the sea, sailors, boats, weather, engines, racing and philosophy.Those who appear in these pages range from singer Jimmy Buffett to naturalist Rachel Carson, from President John F. Kennedy to authors Joseph Conrad, Jack London and Herman Melville, from philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau to the poet Homer.I was vaguely disappointed not to see anything from the likes of Forester, O’Brian or Pope, although Douglas Reeman (aka Alexander Kent) makes one appearance.But, all in all, it’s a nice collection to keep handy, to browse when you have a few moments to kill.

"Ever since people first took to the sea in boats, there have been accidents and disasters large and small. Many of these were unavoidable collisions with the forces of nature -- unpredictable and uncontrollable movements of storm or sea that led ships to their destruction.Many also were caused by simple human error -- ""blunders,"" as author David Blackmore describes them, in his book Blunders & Disasters at Sea.The book begins in the Nile Delta in 1176 BCE, when the ""Sea Peoples"" were routed in a naval encounter with Egyptian forces. It ends in December 2002 and a series of collisions with the wrecked vessel Tricolor in the English Channel.And between the two, more than 100 separate incidents, each with one or more wrecked ships and great loss of life.It's interesting reading. Blackmore doesn't spend much time on each, but presents the facts concisely before moving on to the next. As novelist Wilbur Smith notes in a quote on the back cover, ""There is material for a hundred or more novels in these pages."" I'd probably enjoy reading those novels, too -- but in the meantime, I thoroughly enjoyed Blackmore's brief, more anecdotal versions.Wooden sailing ships, steamships, cruise ships and massive World War II battleships all have their place here, and many still rest at the bottom of the ocean because, ultimately, someone goofed. My only complaint? Too few pictures.

"The title of Robert Elias Cahill's ""New England's Naughty Navy"" was apparently chosen more for alliteration's sake and less for the actual meaning of the words. The phrase ""naughty navy"" conjures images of sailors engaging in shenanigans on shore leave. This book is nothing like that.For the most part, the book is a perfectly serviceable text on the formation of the first American navy during the Revolutionary War. It's intestesting enough stuff, too -- it's a fascinating period of history, and those upstart Colonials were pretty plucky to take on the mighty British navy in their whaleboats and converted merchant vessels.But it doesn't deliver on the promise of its title, or even of chapter headings such as ""Washington's Wet and Wild Warriors"" -- which might lead one to assume the soldiers competed against the British in wet T-shirt contests or something.This book obviously was titled solely with the notion of attracting the eye of New England tourists in gift shops, who would pick up the slim volume in hopes of alluring anecdotes of salacious seamen.

"Richard Woodman likes yanking his readers right out of the action in order to lay a little exposition on them.Believe me, as an avid fan of nautical fiction, I enjoy learning the details of history from the Age of Sail as much as the next person. But Woodman, who in An Eye of the Fleet has crafted an otherwise excellent start to his Nathaniel Drinkwater series of novels, seldom bothers to work facts seamlessly into the story; instead, he just plops a few paragraphs of textbook narrative into the tale wherever he deems appropriate.Worse, Woodman often throws in historical trivia that had not, as of the time of this novel's setting, occurred. It throws off the mood of a period novel when the reader is abruptly thrust into some other era, with details that could not be known to the characters in this story.That complaint aside, the novel is an entertaining introduction to Drinkwater, who would go on to be the protagonist of 14 novels by Woodman. He begins the novel young and unsure of himself, low in confidence and even a bit cowardly in the face of danger. He grows rapidly in the role, however, exceeding his peers and gaining the attention of his superiors in short order. Without knowing what lies waiting for him in the series ahead, I can suppose he has a promising career in store.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KP46N2Q6TVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1574091239#wasThisHelpful","R25KP46N2Q6TVQ","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beginning a new nautical series is usually a treat, and one from McBooks -- a careful and quality publisher of historical fiction -- is most often an auspicious occasion. So I was delighted to start The Valiant Sailors, the first volume in V.A. Stuart's Phillip Hazard series.Unlike the majority of books in the genre, Valiant Sailors is not set against the backdrop of Britain's wars with France, but rather is launched at the onset of hostilities between Turkey and Russia.Phillip Hazard is a likable and capable man, first lieutenant on the steam frigate Trojan. Both ship and crew are far better than the Trojan's mean-spirited and heavy-handed captain should warrant; much of their success is accomplished in spite of, rather than because of, Captain North's cruel leadership.The greatest failing here is Stuart's lack of detail regarding the ship itself. Steam-driven ships were a far cry from the previous generation's fleet, which had only wind and tide to drive it, and many of the officers during the Crimean War were slow to grasp the possibilities of a steamship's maneuverability. Stuart touches only lightly on the subject, however, and the dangers inherent in the new technology are ignored completely.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIA63LY4HQFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590130391#wasThisHelpful","RIIA63LY4HQFM","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had heard whales ""sing"" before. It was at one time in vogue for musicians to slap a humpback whale or two in the background for atmosphere. But Paul Winter has gone a step further, treating recorded whalesong as the melody and the human musicians as harmonists. The result is surprisingly good, even to someone who has long been a fan of humpback whale recordings.Whales Alive! is, oddly enough, a byproduct of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The movie, directed by ""Spock"" star Leonard Nimoy, featured two Earth-saving humpback whales, and Nimoy approached cetacean biologist Roger Payne -- best known for his recordings of humpback whales -- for the necessary sound effects. Payne introduced Nimoy to his friend, Winter ... and somehow that meeting led to this recording.To make the album, Payne sat in the organ loft of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, playing his recorded whalesongs on a tape player. Organist Paul Halley, a long-time collaborator and friend of Winter's, improvised organ harmonies to mesh with the whale melodies. Winter, sitting down in the cathedral nave, listened to both organ and whales and wove his own melody and harmony lines into the sound on his soprano saxophone. It is an incredible example of improvisational recording, and Winter was careful to give the whales equal credit for the tunes' composition. (Winter, writing in the liner notes, said the whales are ""such inventive melodists, always taking us in new and unexpected musical directions."") Nimoy later added passionate recitations of old and new literature about whales, and additional members of Winter's consort added extra layers of harmony and rhythm to complete the recording.The outcome of this unusual collaboration is amazing. The whalesong sweeps and swells in patterns no human throat could duplicate, wrenching emotion from the soul of anyone with an appreciation for the beauty of nature in all its myriad manifestations. The instrumentations successfully match the melody in quality, emotion and pure musicianship. The whales, I think, would be pleased.And let's talk about Leonard Nimoy. Love or hate Star Trek, there's no denying that Nimoy has a deep, resonant voice very appropriate for this sort of emotive, dramatic reading. The words of poetry and prose -- chosen from a broad range of whale-related literature -- roll from his tongue like honey from a worn wooden spoon. It's possible to get lost in those words, to close your eyes, push the distractions of your world into a corner for a while and just soak in the beauty of language.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UI0NW1JAAVYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000000UC#wasThisHelpful","R3UI0NW1JAAVYG","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"John Braginton-Smith and Duncan Oliver detail those early “fishermen” who first harvested the oil and bone from drift whales, or those who beached themselves on their shores, and later set out for short distances from the coast in small whaling vessels, usually oar-driven and carrying only a handful of men. These vessels would usually “gang up” on the whales, attacking from several sides until the whales died and could be towed back to shore, or until the whales sank and, the men hoped, washed ashore within the next few days.Their story is interesting, as they devised ways to defeat creatures many times their size with only rudimentary weapons. Men, too, died on those expeditions.That said, the authors here have presented the meat of their story in a bland sauce. The text here is dryly written, poorly organized and often-times repetitive. (I lost count, for instance, of the number of times I read that Jacobus Loper was invited to Nantucket to teach them how to hunt whales, but he didn’t go.)And, at less than 100 pages of text, it still feels like Braginton-Smith and Oliver were scrambling to find enough to fill a book. They present a great amount of dull, unnecessary detail that really doesn’t further our understanding of early whaling, and they use a large number of very similar photographs of dead whales on the beach -- in fact, they use the same photo twice -- and of illegibly scribbled documents.This book bored me.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWKB108C0CQKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596294299#wasThisHelpful","RWKB108C0CQKE","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jacky Faber's waters never run smooth, and this time the calm is disturbed by the arrival of a pirate ship carrying a grudge and a British naval warship with orders to capture the fierce pirate that is 16-year-old Jacky Faber and return her to England for trial and hanging.But, while we might expect the winsome lass to wrap the crew of HMS Dauntless around her small finger, her plans for escape run aground when a French naval fleet sails into view with its eyes on a ripe British prize. Before you know it, Jacky and her shipmates are imprisoned and bound for the guillotine.I'm sure it gives nothing away to assure you Jacky does not have her head chopped off. Instead, the book takes her in entirely new directions, from the British Secret Service to a Parisian brothel and to the elite conquering army of Napoleon Bonaparte himself.Louis A. Meyer, the Maine writer and artist responsible for the Bloody Jack series, has once again raised the bar with this latest installment. The irrepressible Jacky is a darling character who will make you laugh, sigh, shed a tear and loudly cheer at every turn of her misadventures.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAK0ETGPV58O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0152061878#wasThisHelpful","R3HAK0ETGPV58O","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cracking open a Jacky Faber novel is like taking that first breath of sea air after a long, stuffy car ride. There's a hint of fish and tar on the wind, a fiddle tune in your ear and you can almost feel the deck rocking beneath your feet. It's refreshing, and it fills you with excitement for what's to come.In the Belly of the Bloodhound is no exception. Our young heroine, Mary ""Jacky"" Faber, late of London, Boston and the high seas, continues to prove that no dreary episode can stifle her general good cheer and optimism for long. And believe me, that's a quality she'll need in spades in this latest installment from Maine-based author L.A. Meyer.Jacky, freshly escaped from British naval justice (over a little thing having to do with piracy on the high seas) in the confusion that was the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, has made her way back to Boston, where she was last seen fleeing after her questionable involvement in the setting of a really big fire. The Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls was left in ashes, but the unflappable Mistress Pimm has rebuilt from the ground up, and she calmly welcomes Jacky back into the fold of high-society ladies-in-the-making. For Jacky, it's a way to hide out in good company while avoiding those seeking the price on her head, but even a quiet sojourn at an elegant school can't keep her contained for long.An innocent trip with her classmates onto the briny sea leads to their capture and confinement on a slaver bound for North Africa. And, while Jacky has proven herself resourceful in countless grim situations, the other 31 girls in her company are prone to panic at the sight of a broken nail, much less the dank, rat-filled hold of the slaveship.Fans of Meyer's series so far will delight in the fourth installment. In the Belly of the Bloodhound takes Jacky and other familiar characters into new places, fresh dangers and entirely new limits of excitement. Whether faced with a cat-o'-nine-tails or freshly cooked rat, our heroine provides an entertaining read.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V9PNL3AUM07C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0152055576#wasThisHelpful","R3V9PNL3AUM07C","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jacky Faber is back at sea. Under the Jolly Roger begins with Jacky's arrival back in London, having crossed the Atlantic in service to a whaling vessel of some renown. After a clever wink and nod to Moby Dick, author L.A. Meyer begins to unfold the next tumultuous chapter in Jacky's topsy-turvy life.A misguided attempt to surprise her long-lost love leads to a serious misunderstanding, and Jacky -- disguised once again as a boy -- is pressed into service on another British vessel. This time she's sent to a ship blockading French ports, and the vile British captain -- who proves to be greedy, lustful and in ill health -- refuses to send her ashore. But Jacky is nothing if not resourceful, and she has a knack for making the right friends in the right places, and -- well, let's not spoil the surprise. The title of the book is enough to tell you she doesn't remain under proper British rule for long.Under the Jolly Roger includes plenty of action at sea and intrigue on board, as well as the kind of heady, high-spirited character development that has proved a hallmark of Meyer's work.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DK7F6QHV3T97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=015205345X#wasThisHelpful","R2DK7F6QHV3T97","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One would never expect the challenges of a respected Boston finishing school to equal the dangers of a life at sea. But Jacky Faber is no ordinary young lady.Jacky, who survived a childhood on the streets of London and more than a year at sea in the service of the British navy (disguised as a boy), was revealed as a girl at the close of Bloody Jack and left to the tender mercies of Mistress Pimm at the Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls, where she must learn to be a proper lady. Her midshipman's share of HMS Dolphin's prize money stands her in good stead for an education, but her disposition may be unequal to the task.While used to a life of discipline, Jacky is not accustomed to the many limitations of her sex -- and Boston, circa 1800, has a lot of them. Jacky is free-spirited and direct, gregarious and full of zest. She loves music and dancing, and she enjoys the rough company of a seaside tavern more than the refined air of an afternoon tea. She is neither modest nor circumspect. Fortunately, Jacky is resourceful.Author L.A. Meyer continues Jacky's story in fine form in this second novel in the series. This novel is very different than its predecessor -- trading a nautical setting for Colonial New England -- but maintains the flavor that made the first book such a joy.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG2NENZ9NZNLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0152054596#wasThisHelpful","RG2NENZ9NZNLU","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dudley Pope lays bare the details of Trafalagar -- Horatio Nelson's greatest and final naval victory -- in a brilliantly clear and highly detailed narrative that almost reads like a novel.Decision at Trafalgar begins very nearly at the end. Nelson is dead, the battle is over and a heavy gale is fast approaching, and the wee ship Pickle is sent 1,000 miles home to England -- followed by many rough miles over land to London -- with the news. The frantic pace of that journey sets the tone for the book, which soon pulls back in time to set the stage for the conflict to come.You'll get to know Nelson, as well as other great figures in this drama from their respective English, French or Spanish stages. You'll learn a great deal about the state of England as the threat of French invasion drew ever nearer, and you'll discover a lot about the movements of British politics as well as the actions of British sailors.The amount of detail packed into this book is astonishing, but it never reads like a textbook. One can easily see why C.S. Forester, author of the enduring Horatio Hornblower novels, urged Pope to write fiction.Without ever letting his prose become tedious, Pope introduces us to officers and men throughout both fleets and, through his painstaking research and fluid way with a pen, we come to know them, what they were thinking and feeling preceding and in some cases during the battle, and what their fates were by battle's end. By God, we know Nelson, and we understand what he was thinking and why his men, from senior captains to the lowest tar, loved and respected him.And Pope, who knows a thing or two about seamanship, makes sure the reader smells the smoke, feels the wind fill the sails and suffers the impact as cannonballs slam into wooden ships and fragile men.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S9KKNZHAEF3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805061363#wasThisHelpful","R2S9KKNZHAEF3Q","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Captain William Proby sounds like a likable enough man. As described here by Dudley Pope, he seems a fair and competent leader who did good service for his ship and her crew, as well as Britain's ongoing war with France.Why, then, was Proby labeled ""the devil himself"" by the men who mutinied against him? We may never know the full story behind the insurrection onboard the former French corvette, now serving in the British fleet as HMS Danae. A careful read of The Devil Himself: The Mutinty of 1800 makes it plain that there were several bad seeds among the crew -- men who would always be unhappy at sea, men who had mutinied before.Pope, who has often demonstrated his excellent grasp of naval history and tactics in his fictional adventures of Nicholas Ramage, here goes into thorough detail as he explores the background of the ship, her men and the political climate surrounding them.

"A whole lot happens in Ramage & the Rebels, not the least of which involves a ship full of slaughtered civilians and an island -- yes, an entire island -- that wishes to surrender to a lone British frigate.The frigate Calypso is, of course, commanded by Capt. Nicholas Ramage, one of the youngest rising stars in the British navy. Ordered to patrol for privateers -- and, consequently, fatten his admiral's purse with prize money -- Ramage is not quite prepared for the responsibility for a whole Dutch island. The Dutch, of course, are allied with the enemy French, but in this case the colony is more immediately threatened by a large body of revolution-hungry rebels and bloodthirsty privateers.One privateer in particular is responsible for the aforementioned slaughter -- it's a subplot that seems underused and largely unfulfilled here. And author Dudley Pope -- who is among my very favorite nautical writers -- uses a technique here that I don't like; he slips into the present tense, usually when some third party is observing Ramage and admiring his looks, bearing or skill in some way. It's a distracting style that interrupts the flow; if he's done this in previous books, I managed to overlook it.Otherwise, Ramage & the Rebels is full of thrilling action and the usual amount of Ramage luck. Sure, no real person could ever hope to conjure the amount of lucky breaks that Ramage gets, but I can't help enjoying his unending succession of victories.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29G4J2Z7HPUG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935526919#wasThisHelpful","R29G4J2Z7HPUG0","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicholas Ramage, beloved leader of men, the target of a ship's mutiny?Or is Ramage, ever the obedient officer of the King's Navy, himself the leader of an uprising against his immediate commander?The title of this volume of the Dudley Pope series, Ramage's Mutiny, raises a few questions, the answers of which may well surprise you.The book begins with Ramage still riding high after his many successes off French-held Martinique. His admiral, who should by all rights be doting on his daring and astonishingly profitable junior captain, instead sends him off on what should by all rights be a suicide mission: bring back the Jocasta, a British frigate whose crew mutinied more than a year prior, murdering the captain and officers before sailing into a Spanish port and turning over the ship in exchange for their freedom.It doesn't seem to matter to the admiralty that the task appears to be a suicide mission. This ship, fully crewed and manned with a detachment of some 300 soldiers, is moored in a harbor protected by a narrow channel and three heavily armed forts. Another British naval captain has already fled from the assignment, deeming it impossible.Of course, he was no Nicholas Ramage.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFT9DIPNPDP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935526900#wasThisHelpful","RYFT9DIPNPDP8","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This time, Ramage is serving as lieutenant in command of the brig Triton and is part of a British navy escort of a massive convoy of merchant ships bound for Jamaica. One ship in particular is carrying especially valuable cargo -- important and secretive passengers, actually -- who must not fall into enemy hands. It's a given privateers will make an attempt at some point during the voyage -- and that Ramage will be on hand to deflect it.The mission is complicated by Ramage's own lack of favor with superior officers in the fleet. One in particular will do anything to disgrace the young lieutenant, and the voyage will offer plenty of opportunities for a fatal misstep.A massive hurricane is another hitch -- and here in particular, Pope excels with fine storytelling that puts the reader on deck as the winds howl and waves surge over the scuppers. There's also a little time spent on a tropical island, of sorts -- and a treasure hunt that is perhaps just a trifle silly and too easily resolved -- and a tense, high-stakes court-martial proceeding on charges of cowardice that could ruin Ramage's career, or end his life.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQTKU52XMJ81F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=093552679X#wasThisHelpful","RQTKU52XMJ81F","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a simple enough mission, transporting a pair of Italian dignitaries to Gibraltar. Even the fact that Lt. Nicholas Ramage, captain of the cutter Kathleen, is madly in love with one of them shouldn't interfere too much with the easy cruise. But when he stumbles upon a drifting and defenseless Spanish frigate, Ramage's sense of duty leaves him no choice but to capture it -- even though doing so is a direct violation of orders.The capture is simple enough, but towing the large, disabled vessel makes Kathleen herself an easy target -- and all too soon, Ramage and his crew are captives themselves. But, resourceful as ever, Ramage manages to put his time in Spain to good use as a spy. Then, with priceless information in his grasp, he makes his way back to the British fleet -- and soon finds himself, once more in command of little Kathleen, sailing into battle against a massive Spanish armada on Feb. 14, 1797.Historians will thrill at Dudley Pope's in-the-thick-of-it retelling of the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. And, while the actions of Kathleen and her crew aren't part of the official record, they certainly could help to explain the outcome. ... When Valentine's Day dawns and the British fleet sails into battle, you will read one of the most extraordinary naval narratives yet published.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EVBAN6CZU6PE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935526773#wasThisHelpful","R2EVBAN6CZU6PE","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dudley Pope doesn't waste any time getting into the action.Ramage, the first book in a series, begins with the frigate Sibella already sinking after a brutal attack from a French ship of the line. Sibella's captain and senior officers are dead; the only surviving officer is junior lieutenant Nicholas Ramage, himself badly wounded. With only a small portion of the crew still alive and able and the ship sinking fast, Ramage comes up with a plan to escape the scene, leaving only the wounded behind to be captured and, he hopes, treated for their injuries by French doctors.Once free of the ship, Ramage decides to complete his late captain's mission to rescue a group of influential Italian aristocrats from Napoleon's advancing army. But there are other issues that face this young officer, from the inevitable court-martial for surrendering a British vessel to unexpected charges of cowardice in the face of the enemy. Somehow, in the midst of all that, Ramage finds time to fall in love -- and then there's another rescue to effect, when a British ship runs aground under the guns of the French invaders.There are weaknesses here. One is Ramage's habit of day-dreaming when his attention really should be focused elsewhere; this is obviously a tool Pope uses to bring readers up to speed on important information, but it strains believability to have a man of Ramage's station drift off during combat, for instance, or while being interviewed by the esteemed Commodore Nelson. Ramage's endless stream of good luck and happy coincidences also tests the reader's credulity.But there is plenty to like here, and I like Ramage a great deal. This is only the first book in an 18-book series, and I know already I'd love to read the lot. Ramage is a promising character with boatloads of growth potential, an interesting set of character flaws and a personal history that could stand in his way. Pope, meanwhile, has an obvious knowledge of and love for the sea, and it shines through in his writing.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IE8ZHZRNWYRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935526765#wasThisHelpful","R3IE8ZHZRNWYRI","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a desperate age of battles at land and sea to prevent the further spread of the Corsican, Napoleon Bonaparte, across Europe, one would hardly expect the Royal Post Office to serve as the basis of a dramatic novel.In the hands of Dudley Pope, however, the mail service is perfect grist for the mill. Ramage's Prize takes Pope's eponymous hero, Lt. Lord Nicholas Ramage, from the sunny Caribbean back to England aboard a mail packet; his mission, based on true events, is to discover why so many ships bearing royal mail have vanished on the high seas, falling prey to French privateers in unprecedented numbers.Before he and his crew see England again, there will be poor seamanship, a lukewarm sea battle, wood rot, treason, murder, kidnapping and more, all wrapped up and delivered in a neat parcel befitting Pope's skill at naval wordsmithery.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVDM48GNXV1EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935526803#wasThisHelpful","RVDM48GNXV1EX","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It begins with a hearty breakfast, as all good adventures should, of cold tongue and oysters.Then there's a grand ball, and an urgent message to Lord St. Vincent and Lord Nelson, and before you know it, Lt. Nicholas Ramage has been assigned to penetrate revolutionary France and determine whether Bonaparte's Army of England, which has been massing along the French coastline, has much chance of crossing the English Channel. The mission requires the aid of smugglers, including a navy deserter whom Ramage has had flogged, and a great deal of intrigue in France to avoid the highly suspicious officials of Napoleon's government.Ramage & the Guillotine lacks the action at sea that is a hallmark of this series, and it once again counts on the protagonist's amazing good luck to see him through.

"Ramage's Diamond, the seventh book in the Dudley Pope series, finds Nicholas Ramage newly made post-captain and assigned to the Juno, a frigate whose previous captain was drummed out of the service in disgrace. Ramage reports to find the first lieutenant drunk, the crew unruly and the ship in disarray, but with a few new officers, his longtime sailing master Southwick and a handful of men from his previous command, he manages to get the ship in good order en route to his new assignment in the West Indies.There, Ramage is given the unglamorous assignment of blockading a French port in Martinique. Fortunately, Ramage is not one to sit idly by, tacking back and forth and waiting for something to happen. There is, very quickly, a lot of ship-to-ship action, including a dramatic cutting-out action involving an enemy frigate, a bit of cat-and-mouse with a pair of privateer sloops and the interception of a well-defended merchant convoy.Ramage, as always, relies heavily on good luck to see his way through a series of potential misadventures. But he also knows his way around a plan, too, and this one involves Diamond Rock, an otherwise useless lump in the water that he puts to clever use.Luck aside, Ramage's adventures are a pleasure to read because of Pope's enthusiasm for and thorough knowledge of his subject. In fact, perhaps because his protagonist has finally ascended to captain's rank, Pope here takes more time than before to educate readers about the ways and means of preparing and sailing a ship. It's never a dull textbook, though; I, at least, enjoyed the education immensely.by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.NET guy","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1Y3X5D8IF1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935526897#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1Y3X5D8IF1K","A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So, if you move AT ALL when you're sitting at your desk, you'll find that this mat is climbing up either side of your desk and then you have to bend it back down into place, usually with a heavy box or something.  The bottom of this mat is super smooth so there's absolutely no friction to hold it in place.  Stupidest design for a mat ever!

"I was overjoyed after blowing this up because this slide is freaking HUGE!  It's MUCH BIGGER than others like it.But...a couple of issues:1) There is NO bottom anchor to keep it from not moving.  Other slides like this will have a bottom part that you fill with water to keep the slide from going anywhere.  Not this one!  There is NOTHING to keep this in place, making it move all over the place including it escaping into the middle of the pool.  That sucks!2) Because you constantly have to keep pulling the slide BACK in place over and over again, it split the seam at the very top to where it was a gaping hole large enough to put a child's fist in it.  In other words, it can't be repaired, especially with that useless patch they give you for ""repairs.""The good news, the company I bought it from (VM INNOVATIONS) had me send in a piece of the slide to them so they could replace it.  This is their policy provided that it's within 60 days.  So I have a second one coming to me as a replacement.Still, if I would have known that there is no way to weight this down to keep it in place, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, as I'm predicting that the next slide I get will also last a single weekend before ripping apart.  Totally flawed design.  Don't bother!UPDATE:  Received the 2nd slide (for free) from the vendor BUT it also lasted 2 days and then the seam split in the EXACT same location as the prior slide we had.

I got it here for much less!Yes, it states its for kids 8 and up but it seems to be okay for kids 6 and up.  I have a 5 year old neighbor boy and he's a tad too young to ride this.  He maneuvers it well at his age BUT has a tendency to run over other kids with it.For kids 6-9...awesome go cart.

"These are dreamy sandals.  I have a pair of Nike that I bought a couple of years ago.  I bought a pair that were my exact size except that they seemed to fit my foot perfectly.  I hate it when sandals fit perfectly without having at least a 1/4 or 1/2 inch extra.  Unfortunately Nike didn't have 1/2 sizes and I wasn't going to size up a whole size on the sandals.  So, when I decided to buy different pair for my recent spring break trip to Hawaii, I bought these.I love, love, LOVE these soooooo much.  In fact, they're 100x more comfortable than the comparable Nike sandals and they fit great (with that extra 1/2 inch) without me having to size up on the shoe.  I decided that I'll be retiring my comparable Nike sandals (that look almost like these except they're all black) and I'll be getting more colors of this brand for sure.  They cost less, are a high quality sandal, and are super comfortable.  If you're sitting on the fence between these and the Nike ones like these, GET THESE INSTEAD!

"Really nice.  I used this to put something on top of my kitchen cabinets since it was barren and plain up there.  This ivy looks really nice and adds a lot to the kitchen without looking gaudy or lame.  However, there is a strong smell when you first open up the bags.  (I received 4 bags.  Each bag contains 72 feet, I imagine.  And then in each bag, 2 strands are tied together.  Therefore, each strand is actually only 36 feet long.)  It smells like bacon or something...but it airs out after a day or so.  Probably contains some heavy cancer-causing chemicals that don't legally have to be disclosed due to this product coming from China.

"Years ago I paid for this joker's video set which ran about $500 at the time.  I followed everything he advised and ended up losing thousands of dollars.  First of all, he suggests that you have customers call you on a toll-free number that you have on the postcard.  Then you have people listed to some 2 minute sales pitch.  At the end of the sales pitch, customers are supposed to fork over their credit card info and then end up on some monthly payment plan for whatever home-business system or health supplement you're selling to people.  I wanted to test out whether this all worked or not and ended up losing just under $10,000.I actually do make money using postcards but it's not AT ALL how this joker suggests to do it.  First of all, why the toll-free number?  They are EXPENSIVE and a lot of people just don't want to call a number.  They'd rather look at a website.  So, I send out postcards with a website address and NOT with a phone number.  Then your website does all the work, takes the order, and allows for your customer to download a virtual product (of course, you have to ship a product if you're selling health supplements or something shippable).  If you do it this guy's way, you have to pay for a toll-free number, pay for a special type of voice mail that's attached to a live order-taking service (which is VERY EXPENSIVE) and then manually input the credit card orders into the system (requiring MORE admin work) or have the order taking service do it for you, requiring an extra fee.  His way: EXPENSIVE and OUTDATED.I like reading other reviews because it's clear that they just read this hack's book but never actually put any time, effort or cash into their postcard enterprise otherwise, like me, they'd quickly realize that this guy's stuff MAY have worked 20 years ago before the Internet became hot and heavy but it's just not realistic to do it his way now.

"These pillows totally suck.  I'm used to sleeping on a Tempurpedic pillow but I have had insomnia lately so I figured I'd try these.  I ordered directly off the infomercial on the MyPillow website.First of all, unlike what they claim, these pillows DO GET HOT!  Yes, they get hot.  No, they DO NOT stay cool.  NOT BY A LONG SHOT!  I can't stand sleeping on a hot pillow, especially one that seems to get HOTTER than other pillows I've had.  Yes, it cools off quickly when you get up, use the restroom, and come back but...who wants to do that every 30 minutes?  I found myself having to flip the pillow all night because of this.Second, these pillows have some kind of foam cubes or chunks in them.  You can feel them.  They should have ground them down further and not kept them in such a large size.  This makes the pillow uncomfortable, cumbersome, and hard to sleep on.  The foam itself is a medium-density.  Not soft and not super hard.  But not comfortable either.Third, yes, you DO have to fluff this pillow CONSTANTLY in order for your head to not ""sink in"" like it would in a feather down pillow.  It actually reminded me of a down pillow because it kept sinking in the middle, pushing all the foam pieces out to the sides.  I kept having to fluff it up ALL NIGHT LONG.  I personally can't deal with feather down pillows BECAUSE they part in the middle and because of those pokey feathers.  I've tried down alternatives which have helped alleviate the feather ""poke"" problem but I still can't deal with having to fluff a pillow all night or sleeping in a ""crater.""  And this is exactly what I had to do with these MyPillows...fluff them ALL NIGHT.I'll be going back to my Tempurpedic pillows and these will be getting shipped back as soon as I submit this review.

Don't even think about buying these piece of crap pillows.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XUNFBXPPTZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCZ7YZY#wasThisHelpful","R34XUNFBXPPTZU","A2FDGCKOWQBSGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FDGCKOWQBSGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a fan of English country houses and gardens I found this book to be a very enjoyable read. The author travels through several centuries of private houses that are palaces unto themselves. The history behind each house is long enough to be very interesting but well short of being long winded. I enjoyed all of the photos of the houses, many of which I had not heard of before despite being keen to the subject matter. Many of the photos show how truly amazing these houses were and still are, albeit all the photos are black and white. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in architecture, design, or just a fan of great English houses.

"It could have been better but it got the job done. I had three 4.5"" holes to bore through 6"" concrete foundations in order to install some PVC vent pipes, so this drill in combination with a MK diamond bit got it done. The ""instructions"" are useless, you are on your own. An email and call to the company were never returned for more info on set up, so don't expect additional help from them. Ideally you should install some anchor bolts and mount this in the drill spot so the base doesn't move which is safer and easier to get more downward force, but it can be used just by standing on it too because it is heavy. Only one speed and the bit can bind up if not perfectly straight, but even when the magic smokes comes out just turn it off and give her a minute to rest and it will work again. I used it for both wet and dry cuts and worked fine for both. For minimal (by comparison) cost, this is the best option I found when I just needed a few holes drilled.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TB6PMHGWCUQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UB1YGY#wasThisHelpful","R3TB6PMHGWCUQO","A29U3AWYCDMCE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29U3AWYCDMCE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Read the book in about two hours as it is a fairly quick read. I skipped 6 or 7 of the sections that did not appeal to my interests but most of the other ones were both interesting and inspiring. Many of the were from folks local to me so that was neat. Nothing too in depth, each story gets 6-7 pages with plenty of photos. Chickens, bees, urban farms, rooftop gardens, mushrooms, aquaponics, permaculture and similar topics. Time to get out and do some more gardening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYKYCCDXLW0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594857113#wasThisHelpful","R1WYKYCCDXLW0U","A29U3AWYCDMCE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29U3AWYCDMCE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also ventured beyond into the bees, chickens, small livestock and other aspects of your own mini farm in your backyard.

"Oh, my gosh - this thing is spectacular! Who knew I'd use that word to describe a utilitarian laundry drying rack?  DH said this item should win a design award for it's brilliance AND soundness.  There is nothing weak or wobbly about this.  It's incredibly sturdy for being so lightweight.  We have an electric dryer that's on casters. It was expensive, holds a third of wash load at a time, and takes so long to dry, but it's the only thing we could use in our rental and it had to move to be positioned in an outside doorway to vent outside. This rack holds an entire load of DH's size 2XLT shirts, socks and undies with room to spare due to the horizontal rack within the A-frame.  FREAKING AWESOME!  I just came back to leave my review and to buy a second rack. I enjoy doing laundry (yeah, I do!) and with a second rack, I can wash two loads back-to-back and have both loads dry outside. If I had more outdoor space, I'd buy a third.  It's SO lightweight and convenient, I just close it up and bring it back inside when done. There's is nothing cumbersome or difficult about using this. It's completely assembled; just remove it from the box and off you go. Super easy to set up and to close up and put away.The crossbars are tubes (not wires) and don't take regular clothespins, but you won't need clothespins as you drape the item over the bar itself.  If I have a smaller load, I drape across two more more bars for more airflow and a faster dry time.  Yesterday, I draped my quilted twin mattress protector over the entire thing with the ""wings"" out straight - boom!  The cover doesn't dry evenly in our little dryer even with multiple stops mid-cycle to rearrange it several times.  Absolutely no problem draping this or a bedspread or sheets over this.  If the item is longer, you can adjust the wings at a higher angle to prevent touching the ground.BOTTOM LINE: Buying another one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTSGB61RD4AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQU1C60#wasThisHelpful","RSTSGB61RD4AB","ASJE1XJY3EIN2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASJE1XJY3EIN2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like and expect things to work as advertised. It doesn't even fit like the picture shows.I could like this if it fit.  The straps aren't long enough to deposit the velco on the sides of the fan - it would have to curve around onto the grate edge and that's not practical since it would be permanently glueing the grate to the frame and I'd not be able to remove the grating for cleaning like I do.  I'll be returning this.  :(ETA: NO WAY does this fit and you certainly won't be placing the receptor velcro where it's shown in the picture.  It should be just a shade larger towards each corner and the straps should definitely be longer. I'd keep this IF the straps were long enough to attach this, I'd live with some fan not being filtered, but at least it would mostly work.This is the fan I bought to put this on:  Lasko #3723 20-Inch Premium Box Fan 3-SPEED","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26QW00051EHBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3DDZQO#wasThisHelpful","R26QW00051EHBD","ASJE1XJY3EIN2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASJE1XJY3EIN2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These just don't close well enough to actually grab hair to tweeze  :(  The metal is too flexible.  The flexibility makes it easy to pinch closed, but not firm enough to grasp hair, fine or coarse. I don't know if the tips are sharp enough or calibrated or if it's overall design.I feel like picky Goldilocks because some other tweezers can be too stiff and difficult to pinch closed.It's too bad because they do come with a nice little case for them and they're packaged with an offer to enter and win $50 and a 15% coupon - that I didn't do of course. It took very little time to see that these just don't work.  It may be that I got a bad pair or a cheap knock off, I don't know.  It's a cute presentation and I do love things like this, but only if the main purchase does what's supposed to.I don't mind paying $12 for tweezers and I'd rather have $12 worth of tool, than carrying case I wouldn't use because they go straight into my makeup bag.  I may go back to my old standby Revlon slant tips for $4 and pay for sharpening.

"So far, it's okay.  Super noisy high shrill sound, I'm considering ear plugs, seriously.  The concept is great - think Dustbuster on a stick with a mouth attachment for ""rolling"" across carpet.  The attached roller/mouthpiece gives the impression that the suction part is wide, but it's still the same little 3"" or so opening.  The suction is okay, but it's basically a $50 dealy. I have to clear the filter every few minutes.  It's a bagless, and the filter has a velcroed wraparound paper filter surrounding it. That gets blocked pretty quickly.It's extremely lightweight, I laughed the first time I picked it up.  The on/off switch is on the vacuum part itself, none on the stick, but no problem.

"Overall, these are pretty nice shoes. They look good, and are reasonably comfortable for heavy boots. I only have a few small complaints. The shoes themselves run very large. I ordered two sizes smaller than I typically wear and I was still swimming in them. They also have a sort of odd foot shape. the sides of the shoe fit well, while there was still another two or three sizes worth of extra length. If you have longer thinner feet, these would probably fit you really well. Lastly, the upper portion of the boot is made from thinner leather than I would have expected. My guess is that it is for appearance, since it makes the boots look a little more worn in once they are tied down tight, but I'm not 100% sure what it would do to durability. Ultimately, the boots just weren't going to fit my foot shape, so I ended up returning them, but for the right person, they'd be very nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVIBTUXND1CZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IKSQ6A#wasThisHelpful","RDVIBTUXND1CZ","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These picks look good, and while the hole in the center doesn't really seem to help me personally, others might really like it. My issue with them is that they are made of a very stiff/smooth plastic. I think it's delrin, but since I don't see that confirmed in the description, it's just my guess. The bee graphic (which is only on one side) is the only place that seems to grip for me. If you held your picks a little tighter than I do, so you could make more use of the hole in the middle, these might work really well. They just aren't for me. The delrin (assuming I'm right about that) is also much stiffer than a normal pick, so while these pics are .80 mil, they feel more like 1.00 or so. It's subtle, and probably not worth griping about, but they do feel different from typical picks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQOC6QW9O7H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005J2PXV0#wasThisHelpful","R3QQOC6QW9O7H0","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the most part, these picks are just like any other standard celluloid picks, so there isn't really any point going into anything except for the star shaped punch out in the middle of the pick that is supposed to give you a better grip.I think the concept is probably sound, create a bit of skin to skin contact in the middle that keeps the pick from sliding around, make the edges of the hole jagged so it can't twist, and you'll end up with a better grip on your pick. The problem is that I don't grip the pick nearly hard enough to make the hole in the middle work for me. When I'm holding the pick naturally, my skin doesn't press into the cutout, so it slides around just as easily, if not more so than the rest of the pick. This might not be true of everyone. If you grip your picks significantly harder than I do (I have no idea where I am on the gripping spectrum, so I couldn't really tell you if I'm closer to tight or loose, though I suspect I'd be on the looser grip end) this might work great for you, so they are probably worth a try. For my money, they aren't really any different than a standard celluloid pick. If they were both sitting at my local music store counter, I'd literally just buy whichever was cheaper.Also, this doesn't really have anything to do with the product itself, but I received half .71 mil and half a lighter gauge. I don't have any handy, but I know it was less than .50 That's on the seller, not the product, but you might end up with an assortment, so just be aware of that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DEEMFCFLYXH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNJHBEU#wasThisHelpful","R1DEEMFCFLYXH3","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a couple of these Biltwell shields, two tinted ones and a clear one for night riding, but I picked up this one because amber tint is legal after dark in my state (Colorado), and I was sick of switching back and forth.They all fit a standard five button really well (a Bell three quarter in my case), and are all reasonably scratch resistant. They let enough air through to keep from fogging without vibrating or getting that great wind tunnel sound. They're also easy to attach, less than ten seconds at most.As far as the nighttime riding is concerned, which is likely why you are looking at an amber shield, I find that this one works very well. Blocking out the harsher light does sort of mellow the glare at night and makes the shield very reasonable to ride with after dark. I see the most benefit in the twilight hours, where it gives things a sort of greenishy almost ""tornado weather"" appearance and really seems to up the visibility factor.Over all, I'd recommend any of the Biltwell shields. They are tough, easy to install, and very reasonably priced. And, I do think this amber is great for nighttime riding.

"These earplugs are great, and I wholly recommend them.I'm just providing a few pros and cons for those who want them.Pros:- Solid volume reduction. Ultimately, that is what earplugs are meant to do, and these do it well. There is a tradeoff for the higher sound quality, and these don't reduce volume as much as the foam or wax ones, but the sound quality is much better. I think the balance is a good one for musicians or people who like to be up close at concerts.- Great sound quality. Things don't sound muffled, and I feel like I'm getting a much truer sense of the sound I'm producing with these than with the foam or wax ones.- The stem makes them less finicky to get seated properly in your ear. It's not a big deal, but I was surprised how nice having the little stem there is. With the foam ones, you have to compress and get them in place, then if they aren't in the right spot, you have to completely reinsert it again.- The little carry case is nice. It's not a big deal, but it's a kind of soft plastic, so much less annoying to have in my pocket if I'm out and I don't have a good place to put it.Cons:- Less sound reduction than foam or wax. If you need to shut down volume at the firing range, these aren't for you. They do most of what I need when I'm playing my bagpipes, but for anything louder, they really wouldn't work well.- The rubber has a little bit of memory. When I first got them, they were sort of smashed flat, and it's taking a little while for the rubber to spring back. It still makes a good seal with my ear, but I think it might be just a little harder to get seated.- I have bigger ear canals, and the tapered shape means that these insert farther than I'm in love with. I sort of wish there was a way to remove the smallest little dome. I got used to it fast, but it's annoying.- The little stem can get knocked around. It only happened once when I was moving my pipes on my shoulder, but it's not a pleasant sensation.- There are much much more expensive options, but there are also foam plugs that are like ten sets for three dollars, so I'm counting the price as kind of a con. You have to really want the higher fidelity, otherwise spending anything over a quarter on a pair of earplugs is pretty unnecessary.I still wear my foam plugs if I'm sleeping or using a saw or something, but for playing or listening to music, these are definitely the way to go. I will be buying more if I ever lose or need to replace these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBMHMC6S34B4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015WNZB8#wasThisHelpful","R1XBMHMC6S34B4","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Walsh practice chanter reeds are my personal favorites. When I'm on my practice chanter, I'm working on fingerings, not lung strength, so I like that they don't seem to take nearly as much air pressure to get a sound out of, and seem to be very forgiving when you aren't focused on your breath. They seem to have a long life, and are easily adjusted with a piece of sandpaper, if need be. At the time of this review, this is the best price on Amazon for Walsh Standard Practice Chanter Reeds, and I definitely recommend them.Also, it's a silly thing, but the little plastic case is sort of nice. I have a bad habit of mistreating my practice chanter, and regularly have the reeds knocking around loose in the bag. I probably should have grabbed a plastic box like this years ago, but didn't.

"Like the title says, I think this is great shave soap. I get a very close shave, on par with any others I have tried, and I personally like the scent. To me, it smells more like chai tea than it does like bay rum, but it's not far enough off to be surprising when you first get it. I'll be getting more when I run out.That being said, I have two issues. First, it seems to be a little more finicky to lather than other soaps. It's fine, but it doesn't seem to get quite as thick as others, and takes longer to get to a good consistency. It's not a real issue, though I do use a cup. I don't know if it's going to be your best option if you like to do the lathering on your face. Second, it seems to dry out extremely fast. You need to apply the soap to your face, then immediately reach for the blade. If you wait a minute or so, it will already be starting to thicken back up. It's plenty of time to get a good clean shave, but you just can't goof around while it is on your face.Both issues seem to happen no matter how dry or wet I try to make the lather, and no matter how long I use the brush, but if you disagree and feel like it's a mistake I'm making, please do let me know.

"I'm not sure what this item was actually supposed to be.

Considering it was a third the cost of something made by Dunlop or Fender, I would highly recommend giving this a try first.One caveat. The thing is heavier than a lot of similar items I've used.

"Like the title says, I love this little thing for the price. I'm just providing a few quick pieces of info.- As others have said, the item wouldn't trick you into believing it's a key. It's thicker than a normal key, and even when closed, the blade is clearly visible. If your keys were sitting on the table, I doubt someone would pick out that there was a knife on your keychain, but if someone takes the time to look, it's very clear that this isn't a key.- The mechanism is smooth for an eight dollar knife, but it's an eight dollar knife. Temper your expectations on that one. It feels like a lot of other cheap blades in that respect, not scratchy, but not buttery smooth like something pricey- This seems solidly built. I won't be prying with it any time soon, but it locks in place and i'm comfortable using it to open packages or cut cord, it's intended purposes for me.- All and all, I'd pick it up again.

"Like the title says, I'm a new runner. I did plenty of running for football in high school and whatnot, but as far as just taking off to run a few miles, I'm very new. The being said, here's a few impressions I've had so far.These are impressively light. I imagine they are on par with most running shoes, but the last pair of shoes I ran in were cleats, so maybe I'm easily impressed.So far, they seem very comfortable. There are no seams in uncomfortable places, and the top material is flexible enough to allow for a good fit.They breathe very well. At the end of five miles, they are still dry and comfortable.The tread is solid. I live in Colorado, and almost certainly will be running in these when there are small patches of ice out, and I'm not worried.They seem to position you very close to the ground. I'm enjoying that feel. My normal shoes feel like platforms now.I personally like the position at which these allow my foot to strike the ground. I gather that is very specific to the gait and the foot, but I have higher arches, and tend to strike more towards the front of my foot. I imagine similar people would find these comfortable.All told, I'd buy these shoes again.

"I'm reviewing these right after receiving them, so I can't speak to any kind of longevity. I'll update my review if they fall apart early. If I haven't updated, you can assume that these are still going strong, or lasted as long as the shoes.I've noticed a few reviewers saying that these were difficult to get on without instructions. I have to say that wasn't my experience. You simply press the button then slide the laces through. It's a tight fit, and it did take a little bit of wiggling and finessing to get the laces through, but I didn't find them confusing or complicated.They seem sturdy. This is day one, but I'm happy with the weight and feel of the laces themselvesI got the package with the five different colors, and I don't think they are quite as bright as in the pictures. It's a tiny difference. I honestly might well be imagining it, but just so know.I put them in three different pairs of shoes, and they fit easily in every pair. The aglet is the same size as all the original shoelaces, so I can't see why they wouldn't work on any pair of shoes you own.When I tied off the laces and trimmed the excess, there was a bit of fluff from the sheath portion of the laces. Pro tip: a little heat from a lighter will shrink that fluff right up if it bothers you. Just be sure not to get too close; you could damage the elastic.The moose isn't as noticeable as it seems in the pictures. It may be stupid, but I don't like the moose. I was pleased to see it's not something you would notice if it wasn't pointed out.Be careful to get the shoelaces entirely in place before trimming the excess lace. Once the aglets are gone, it would be almost impossible to get these back through the push-button mechanism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZ3N3G1ZVAYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBF4K4I#wasThisHelpful","R2VZ3N3G1ZVAYK","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I like this shavette. Most of the attributes are just as easily pros as cons depending on your preference, so the list below is more just FYI than anything else.Pros:- The size is pretty comfortable. It's smaller than my other one, but not enough so as to cause trouble. It will accept both the shorter and longer blades- The system for holding the blade in place is pretty solid. I'm confident the blade won't shift or slide, and it's very easy to clean.- The lighter feel is a mixed blessing. On the plus side, it's easier to feel which areas are stubble free. There is sort of a . . . gritty sensation in the hand holding the shavette when it moves over an area that isn't completely smooth. It's hard to describe, but it's something that has been very helpful.- The plastic piece that holds the blade in place has a tiny protrusion that covers the corner of the blade. In my experience 95% of my nicks come from the corner of the blade scraping me, and that'd be almost impossible with this shavette. In my opinion, it's worth the price of the shavette alone to fix that problem, but if that doesn't happen to you, it's not going to be of major benefit.Cons:- The flip side of the lighter weight is that it doesn't have quite as solid a feel as some of the other shavettes out there. It's nothing horrible, but I could see someone complaining that it didn't have the premium sensation that some of the heavier ones had.- I could see someone not liking the smaller size. It doesn't bug me, but it would be understandable if it did.- The system that holds the blade in place, while really easy to clean, is a tiny bit harder to seat the blade into. It's a small thing, and only took a day or two of getting used to, but I thought I'd mention it.- If I were actually designing my own razor with the people from Dovo, I might let the blade hang out just a hair more. I'm probably just used to a little more blade hanging out because that is the way my last one was. It's by no means hard to work with.I'd definitely pick up this shavette again, but a ton of personal preference is going to play into your opinion on it. From a ""just the facts"" perspective, it seems well made and does a fine job holding a razor for a shave, which is it's real purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVCOO2ZT7FSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ASOD86#wasThisHelpful","RGVCOO2ZT7FSK","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These gloves are great in lots of ways. The pair I got seemed solidly built and were comfortable. The style is a tiny bit flashy, but it's nothing unforgivable. They aren't spectacularly warm, but I'd say for running around town on cold windy days they'll be just fine. I wouldn't use them as my only gloves in sub zero weather, or if I were headed out to shovel the walk, but for most days they should be great. They also fit mostly as I expected. Maybe the tiniest bit on the small side, but just barely.My issue with the gloves is that they didn't work for me. I was able to get my phone to broadly respond to them, but they didn't register lots of taps or almost any precision movements.I don't think it's entirely the fault of the gloves. I use one of the glass screen cover on my phone and I suspect that is the culprit. At dinner with some friends, we tried it with about a half dozen phones, and it worked just fine with everyone else's (both with no screen covers, and with the plastic variety). Since mine was the only one with that specific kind of screen cover, I'm thinking that's probably the issue.It's totally understandable that the gloves might not work great with every screen cover, but if that is the case, I'd really like to see it added to the description. These gloves would get five stars with any of my friends phones, or if the potential issue had been listed somewhere in the description.

"I have a newfoundland, and being built for the cold weather he tends to get cracked and chapped areas on his nose and paws during the summer. Using Bag Balm on his paws and nose during the warm months completely clears it up. He hates it, but it does the trick.I haven't noticed any stains anywhere (I believe someone had that question in another review), but the smell really leaves something to be desired. I wouldn't put it on him before people were coming over, that's for sure.As far as humans go, I use the stuff to help with cracks in the skin on the soles of my feet when I'm running too much. No matter what I tried in terms of pumice stones or lotion, I kept getting cracks anywhere the skin on the bottom of my feet was flexing when I ran. I put the stuff on more or less daily and it doesn't completely get rid of the cracks, but it keeps them from stiffening up and getting painful. I absolutely love it for that. Give it a try if you get that kind of repetitive damage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3SGT0Z7739L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014CI4X8#wasThisHelpful","R3D3SGT0Z7739L","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice ice pack, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.Pros:- The two different cooling temperatures does work nicely, but you can get the same effect from a washcloth between the pack and your skin.- The wrap around strap for knees, elbows, ankles etc is solid and reasonably comfortable. I have no doubt it will last the life of the pack itself.- The gel material allows it to wrap the way it's supposed to, so all is well on that front.Cons:- The price. At Walmart, for five bucks less, you can get more solidly made/comfortable packs. I personally prefer my Thermipaq. They'll do hot/cold, and the ""clay"" type material seems to stay in better contact when wrapped. Again though, buy that type at Walmart, they are one third the cost.-  The double sided velcro (which is necessary to allow for the dual sided option) can be uncomfortable if it doesn't lay in the right position on your body. When I ice my knee, it sits towards the back and it's not as though it's painful or unbearable, but it'd be nice not to have.- It feels just a little cheaply made. It's a bag filled with gel, so it's not as though there is a huge range in quality of materials, but the bag is the more ""plasticy"" variety rather than the vinyl variety, and is just a bit thinner than my other packs.- There is no great way to clean the blue side of the pack. The blue half is sort of a felt material (not the best way to describe it, but the closest I can really think of). A decent number of my iceable injuries come with some breaking of the skin, and I'm not thrilled about the idea of having lingering blood stains. With the pure plastic kind you can just wipe clean, and with the cloth types with the removable cover you can just toss it in the laundry. Long term it'll be an issue, but it's a fifteen dollar item. If I have to toss it at the end of the year because it looks like a scene from Dexter, I'll have gotten my money's worth.- This is kind of a pro/con combo, but the gel seems to cool down and heat up faster than my other packs. Means you don't get as much time on the area you're icing, but also means you can repeat more often. It's up to you how you decide to view that attribute.All told, it's fine and I'll use it, but I think there are better options.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJFBZPLTKUIR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016L4T0O#wasThisHelpful","RJFBZPLTKUIR1","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Above the line is my review of the Phantom I&II, below the line are a few comparisons of the two ballasts for people who  have used the original Phantom.)In my opinion, if money isn't an issue, these are by far the best ballasts on the market.Most ballasts these days have a lot of the same features so I won't go into those (dimmable, HPS or Halide, 120/240, internal breakers and the ability to restart with a hot bulb in the event of a power outage etc...), but there are a few things that are worth mentioning as pros/cons.Pros:- Indestructible. I've never had one of these fail on me, and I've run enough ballasts to have one of most every kind give it up eventually. Also, the casing seems extremely sturdy. I have yet to drop one of these, but of my ballasts I'm willing to bet that this would be the one that would survive a fall the best- Cools itself without a fan. I think this might be part of why these last so long. There is no fan, so there are no moving parts, or open portions of the casing. You'd think this would make it run hot, but it doesn't in the slightest. This is among my coolest ballasts.- Comes with a power cord that is large enough for the thousand watt load. I bet half of my ballasts came with cords that I would consider unsafe under a thousand watt load, which I immediately replaced. The Phantoms both come with large gauge power cords completely suited to their task.- The Phantom II's wall mounting system is smooth, easy and stable. Great for wall mounting.Cons:- As far as I'm concerned, the only flaw with this ballast is the price, while not ridiculous, you can get very solid ballasts for almost half of what this one costs. I have bought ballasts all through that range, and this one is by far the nicest, but you will have to decide for yourself where the best value point is for you.- The original Phantom's wall mounting is clumsy and complicated. It can be wall mounted just fine, but the Phantom II is MUCH better if you are going to be wall mounting your ballast.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have used a Phantom I, this should seem pretty familiar. It's an almost identical piece of equipment, and I've repeated a lot of the same things I said about the Phantom I. There are only two major changes, and they are both awesome.The first change is the size. This is just slightly smaller than the original Phantom. It's subtle, and not a monster difference, but it's always nice to save a little space.The second, and much more important change, is the wall mount system. The mounting system on the original Phantom was clunky and basically just pinned the handle on top to the wall. It stuck out, it had lots of moving parts to fail, and I was NOT a fan. It was my only complaint of the old unit. This model has completely changed that. Now, two large bolts go into the wall, and the ballast slips over them. It's simple, it's stable, and the packaging even comes with a handy little measuring template to get the position of the bolts right.  The Phantom went from having the most precarious wall mounts of my ballast to having the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AL6Z8EMRUIRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JASZK3K#wasThisHelpful","R2AL6Z8EMRUIRB","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From what I can tell, these things seem great, though thankfully I haven't had occasion to use them on a person. The few pieces of info below are based on as much info as I can get without actually shooting someone.- According to the instructions, you are supposed to test them when they arrive, and both cannisters worked smoothly.- The mechanism to fire is simple and well designed. I bought these for running in a somewhat nasty neighborhood, and I doubt they will accidentally go off in my pocket, or in my hand, due to motion. That being said, they are simple and I think I'll be able to fire them reasonably quickly.-The cannisters seem sturdy. I wouldn't want to drop anything on top of them, but they seem to be about on par with a can of shaving cream. I'd trust these in a bag or purse.- In as much as it matters, the split ring to attach these to a keychain is on the tough side, no worries about losing keys off of it.- The expiration dates on the cannisters are four years out, so there won't be any need to replace them for a good long while.Beyond that, I can't provide much information. When I tested these outside, the smell alone made me feel like they'd probably be very painful and effective. I couldn't speak to the effectiveness of the UV dye.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GNPFXINY8X40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002B3WOW6#wasThisHelpful","R3GNPFXINY8X40","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think this is what I'd go with if I was honing an extremely expensive blade, but this is a fine sharpening stone for the four dollar price tag. The fine side on this is a bit rougher than some other stones I've seen, so again, probably not the worlds best bet for putting a razor edge on super high quality blades. The course side seems to be about the same as most of the stones I've seen.

"I really like this little TARDIS keychain, and I'd probably give it four and a half stars if Amazon would allow it. Below is just some extra info and a few pros/cons.I think a lot of people are disappointed because the white accents in the picture aren't present. If I hadn't read the reviews and known this ahead of time, I think I'd probably be a little bothered to. From what I can figure, the picture is of a different TARDIS keychain that can be found elsewhere on Amazon. This one is just blue, no accents except for the brand name on the bottom.People who say you can't fit bills in here are a little nuts; it's not a wallet, you are going to have to do some folding. I folded five twenties in half lengthwise then rolled them up, simple as that, and they fit great. One hundred bucks is plenty of emergency cash for me, but if you wanted you could always use hundreds and have half a grand in your keychain. As far as keeping enough cash inside, I think that's plenty, but that's just me.Pros:- I love the appearance. The white accents would have been cool, but the TARDIS is well cast and the paint is solid.- Fits enough bills to accomplish its purpose.- Is larger than I pictured (could be a pro or a con I suppose). Other reviewers gave dimensions I believe, but I'll just repeat. The base is an inch square, and the tardis stands just over two inches high (if you include the little peg the keyring goes through, just under two inches if you don't). 1 x 1 x ~2- Feels solidly made. I have no doubt that if I don't lose it, it will be hanging around in ten years.Cons:- The flip side of being solidly made is that this thing is heavy, weighing in at 86g. For reference purposes, that is the weight of about 15 quarters. Maybe not a big deal if you keep your keys in your purse or on a table, but mine are usually in my pocket. Lighter would have been nice, but it's a minor complaint, and the good news is that if a puma comes at me, I know I can always bludgeon him with my keys.- The logo on the bottom is huge. It's hidden from view if the TARDIS is upright, but I don't totally see why ""WOW"" needed to cover the entire bottom side of the keychain.- The rubber O-ring holding the internal piece in place seems to work pretty well, but I would prefer it were a tiny bit more snug. I'm probably just nervous because I'm not used to having 100 bucks on my keychain, and I think realistically it will stay put just fine, but a tiny bit thicker O-ring wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world.All in all, I'd definitely make this purchase again. If you are looking for a sleek way to keep a few extra bills, and you are a fan of The Doctor, it's a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RV2CF3SZWQFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GBLK5I#wasThisHelpful","R1RV2CF3SZWQFZ","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to incorporate some Manga elements into some of my cartooning, so I picked up this book along with four others. This seems like one of the best. A few pros/consPros:- To start with, the book is gorgeous. There's tons of color and great illustrations. The physical quality of the paper and the printing is excellent as well. You could almost leave  it  out as a coffee table book.- Strikes a good balance between starting at the beginning and talking down to the reader. Some of the books I've found (even beginner ones) assume skills that aren't really universal. Others seem to want to start by explaining what a pencil is. This one started at the beginning but was challenging.- There is a nice progression. The book takes you through various aspects of a finished drawing piece by piece, breaking it down in a very logical way.- Includes some very cool topics not really approached in other books. Specifically, non humans. It's nice to see them tie some drawing basics into something a lot of other books handle as almost ""mysterious.""- The drawings in this book seemed much more polished than those in some of the other books. It's hard to describe exactly what i mean, but in some of the others, the end product is more ""cartoony"" than I would have liked. Sort of a silly criticism to make of a book about Manga, but it's the best way I can describe the difference. A lot of other books have artwork that just seems flat.Cons:- I say this about every single drawing book, so I don't  take stars off for  it, but why can't they make these coil/spiral binds? Every single person using this book is going to want to have it open while they have their hands busy with the lesson they are working on at the time, why not set it up to lie flat. Just a pet peeve, but I'm hoping someday a publisher might notice (Pro tip: you can get things coil bound at fed ex kinko's for five bucks or so, well worth the frustration you'll save).- There was a lot of included artwork that, while gorgeous and interesting, wasn't really helpful to actually learning anything. I really enjoyed it, so I'm not taking stars off for it, but I could see someone feeling like the book wanders from the point a little.If you are interested in learning some Manga techniques, this book is an excellent choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZUPLVSZ8EEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307985504#wasThisHelpful","RDZUPLVSZ8EEU","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this stuff; it's a great combo product:Pros:- The color seems about as natural as you can ask for, and goes on pretty smoothly. It did slightly darken a callus on my hand, but that was the only issue.- No issues with stinging in the eyes. Super important for this sort of item since if you can't go close to your eyes it is going to end up looking very strange.- The SPF seems to work as promised. I haven't seen any burning- Smells about as nice as you could ask given the combination of products here.Cons:- Super slight staining of a callus or two on my hands.

"Like the other reviewer, I picked this bag up to house a dulcimer, which is probably very similar to his strumstick. I did throw one of my guitars in it, just to get a sense of how it would work for it's intended purpose, and it is very typical of an inexpensive gig bag. Here are a few things I've noticed just as FYI's.- The padding is on the thin side, but it's not just a bag. There is definitely some foam worked in there to cushion the instrument. I wouldn't trust it in a drop, but if I clipped it on a door as I turned or something along those lines, I think this would protect it.- The bag is SMALL. It is only going to fit electric guitars on the smaller/shorter end of the spectrum. If you are looking for something to house a dulcimer/strumstick/bass ukulele or something along those lines, this is an excellent choice.  If your instrument is much larger than an average stratocaster, I'd look elsewhere.- This is simple, but well made for the price. There are only two pockets (aside from the main one for the instrument), but they, as well as the handles and shoulder straps, seem to be well stitched and secure.- The outer material is tougher than I expected. Not the super rugged stuff you might get on a higher end bag, but not the windbreaker style material you'd often find on cheaper bags.All and all, for the ten to fifteen bucks these seem to be going for, I think they are probably one of the better deals on Amazon.

This is my first drawing pad, and I never realized how much I rotate and shift the ""page"" as I draw until the cord was getting in the way of that.High quality item overall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UVJAN8ST6GDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MRAVFE#wasThisHelpful","R2UVJAN8ST6GDF","A24CVTS4QZM2EL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24CVTS4QZM2EL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The title says it all. Just providing some additional info.- This is really a decent sized bracelet. I got mine to use as a sort of mini mala, but I can get it over my hands, which are larger than average but not by much, and it doesn't look ridiculous (size wise at least) on my wrist. Based on the adjustments, I'd say it would fit the majority of people from child to adult.- The beads are well formed and polished. In the picture, it seems as though they taper as they head towards the adjustment (at least to me it does) but they are the same size the whole way around.- The cord seems very tough, and a kind of ornate slip not is used to adjust the size of the band.

"I like these boards, and I'll be buying more as I lose these. This is just some info for potential buyers.- These are typical padded emery boards (the larger size, a little smaller than the width of my thumb)- The colors seem to be random, only one of the ones I got matches one in the picture.- For the most part, these are like the colorful ones you would find in a cup next to the register, but one of mine is labeled as ""eco board"" and has the brown color of recycled paper, or a paper shopping bag. Don't know if that will be the case with yours or not.- They are different grits, but four out of five are more or less what I am used to, one side a little courser than the other, but both pretty fine. The fifth is HEAVY grit. I don't know that I'll ever actually use it on my nails, maybe my toenails I guess.I really like these overall.

"This is a wonderful tablet/phone stand. I would say this was specifically designed for Apple devices because of the small half circle hole on the edge. It allows me to press the home button without taking my phone out and then pressing it. The inside has rubber stamps that protect my phone from hitting the hard aluminum. The angle is adjustable by pressing the button on the side, so it will stay in place when not pressed.

"I have never tried glass nail files before, but this has been a great first experience with them.I love the color and feel and look of these files, not too light, not too heavy. The color is also a nice gradient of blue to white.Works very well, there are 3 sizes to choose from. The end is rough and jagged like sand paper but the part you hold is smooth.Because these use the natural hardness of the glass to file your nails, I would say this is a much better investment than normal files, as those tend to wear out quickly because of the small amount of sandpaper glued onto plastic.I was provided a discounted/sample product for my unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R201QMCP005G3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016NR86WC#wasThisHelpful","R201QMCP005G3T","A1UIJH922C7LMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UIJH922C7LMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seriously, youth these days are blasting music on their headphones like no tomorrow. Why even use headphones? They turn it so loud it is like speakers and you can hear it all the way across the room.On the other hand, this is a dangerous practice and it can definitely harm your hearing. Children are especially prone to this.Yes these are great headphones for children:There are no tangled cords to go through, it is all wireless by bluetooth.There is a volume limitation on these things, so the max is 85 decibels.I love the soft head band and the size length adjustments are effortless.The sound is less bassy and more balanced and clear, which can also help reduce ear trauma.I was provided a sample product for my unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SUD2CJSJZF2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CLDSQK#wasThisHelpful","R1SUD2CJSJZF2N","A1UIJH922C7LMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UIJH922C7LMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The earphones come in a hard shell carrying case.

The cords are flat instead of round and tangle less. I like the control board, looks very simple and is easy to operate.

"This being my first try at a virtual reality headset, I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be uncomfortable to wear, but that is not the case. The 2 side straps are elastic and stretch, only needed to adjust the top strap. There are also foam covering the parts where your face would touch the headset. The set up was easy, I just installed a VR roller coaster app on my iPhone 6 and slid it into the opening slot. I am not sure about Android devices, but I think this only works for iPhone 5 or later phones. There is a specialized iPhone 5 slide insert included, so there is support for it. There are slits along the sides of the opening slot so you can pass your earphones through it and enjoy a even more immersive experience. Also, there is foam protectors inside the slide in slot, so my phone will not get scratched.

"This is a good budget smart watch for Android users, (I do not think it is worth it for iOS users. The iOS system is just too restrictive with 3rd party apps and products. Even with the app installed, the functions are very limited.) With Android, the options are a lot more open.The watch charges with a micro usb cable that is included.The icons in the smart watch look a lot like the official Apple icons, so there is definitely charm in that.The volume can be easily configured by tapping the middle button on the smart watch.When someone calls on the phone, you can accept it on the smart watch. You can also play music on the watch, but it is quiet and when it is loud the sound becomes very distorted.There are a lot of useful functions though, the basic one is obviously the ability to tell time.

The yellow lens limits blue light that prevents you from sleeping when using electronics. Sure you use the polarized lens, but actually most electronic displays are innately polarized and if you looks at it with another layer of polarization, the screen turns pitch black.

"This mattress is for those like myself who like to sleep on a traditional spring mattress instead of the all foam type. Recently I purchased a similar product from another brand that is 6 inches and it's been performing wonderfully. When I got this mattress I expected it to be slightly better due to having 2 extra inches of cushioning and I was right. It's a very comfortable mattress with good support. Not too firm and not too soft. I'm not a very heavy person at 130lbs so this mattress works well for me. That being said if you're much heavier your comfort level using this mattress may be different. For the price this is probably one of the best foam/spring hybrid mattresses out there. As far as unpacking this mattress, it was very easy but care has to be taken because it's tightly rolled up and wants to spring open once you cut the wraps off. One thing I did not like was the fact this product does not ship in a cardboard box like my other mattress so it could easily be damaged in transport. Luckily mine didn't have any damage to the packing bag that it came in so the mattress didn't suffer any damage either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ME6HS1AP4SJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI1O4JQ#wasThisHelpful","R3ME6HS1AP4SJI","A2PREU4LOFQRB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PREU4LOFQRB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow LG knows how to make a beautiful PC! Not only that but whoever was in charge of the internal packaging is a genius. Normally when you open up a box with a large LCD monitor it's very difficult to remove because it's big and bulky. Then you have to find a place to put it and figure out a way to install the stand before placing it on a desk. Not so with this unit since you are able to easily install the metal stand before even taking the monitor out of the box! By the way did I mention this computer is absolutely gorgeous? Even the white keyboard is curved!In terms of functionality, it uses a 3GHz Intel i7 mobile processor so it's very responsive. Also the graphics is via a Nvidia GeForce 840M so it's no slouch when it comes to 3D. System RAM may seem to be on the lower side at 8GB but since the CPU and GPU is very good you won't notice it in normal day to day use. Also Windows 10 is more efficient than ever and doesn't require as much RAM compared to the older versions. Even users who like to have many applications open won't notice much slowdown. The 1TB HDD is on the smaller side in my opinion so I would need to have external USB HDD's for extra data storage. This PC comes with Windows 10 Home 64-bit and it didn't require too many updates out of the box. It has built-in 802.11AC 5GHz WiFi support as well as Bluetooth. The popup webcam with mic is nice but since the mic is integrated with the camera there's no way of using the mic with the camera retracted. This could be an issue for people who are afraid of ""hackers"" using the computer's webcam to record them.When it comes to visuals, the ultra-wide 2560x1080 IPS curved display is great but it does display differently compared to a standard flat display so it may require some getting used to. For example windows will appear to have curved borders even if they are completely straight. It's kind of like a pincushion anomaly affecting the top/bottom borders. I could see this being an issue when using this display for editing photos/graphics where visual confirmation of geometric distortion and alignment is important. That said the ultra-wide aspect ratio is very nice...it's almost like having two monitors which makes for side by side windows a breeze. The display can be setup for fast response for gaming related stuff but out of the box it is set to medium at the factory. On a related noted my PC was set to 59Hz instead of 60Hz in the Windows display settings so I manually changed it to 60Hz...strange.Anyway the rest of the hardware is fairly standard with two USB 2.0, and two USB 3.0 ports, a SD card slot, dual speakers, headphone jack...though the HDMI input is very useful for split screen viewing. Also the inclusion of an HDMI OUT means this PC has dual display output capability so attaching a 2nd monitor is no problem.Finally the only other ""negative"" points that I could find are:1. USB receiver for the keyboard/mouse uses up one of the two USB 2.0 ports. On other modern designs the receiver is internal and doesn't use up an external USB port.2. Mouse is LED based not laser based.3. The built-in jog based menu system for adjusting the display looks really crude and pixelly.Overall a really good Windows 10 PC that's not just about looks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GM3FWHOOI51K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158XK5OE#wasThisHelpful","R1GM3FWHOOI51K","A2PREU4LOFQRB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PREU4LOFQRB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That said I was not able to get the automatic clock setting to work. Maybe where I live the signal just isn't strong enough? Anyway I just set the clock manually. The temperature readings for inside/outside is pretty cool and it works well. Cool thing about the remote outside temperature sensor is it uses 2 AAA batteries which is easily replaceable after the recommended 6 months so no wires or power outlets to worry about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NUYLJKTG41Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016S6J6OK#wasThisHelpful","R23NUYLJKTG41Y","A2PREU4LOFQRB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PREU4LOFQRB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I currently use a single HDD docking station so I'm not new to these types of devices and can appreciate the dual slot design that this product offers. I mainly use it with my old drives when upgrading to newer larger drives. So far this device has performed very well. I haven't had any issues and it offers very fast data transfers. I like the fact it has a power switch and indicator LEDs for each slot. Inserting the drives into the slots was very easy with a nice tight fit. I have not used the clone function but it is a nice feature to have. Build quality seems pretty good but the plastic used seem fairly cheap and it has a ""hollow"" feel to it.

"When I first got these pedals the first thing I did was spin them to see how freely they spun. I was disappointed that they did not rotate very freely despite being smooth without any notchiness.

They're also not that big which for me is good since I don't have big feet and my bike is a folder where space is important. In use the platform side offers good grip due to the spiked cage.

This thing was extremely easy to ""setup""....just fill the tank, plug it into an outlet and power it on...that's it. Now if you want to make some adjustments there are many to choose. You have a 12hr timer that could be set in increments of 1hr. You also have a choice between cool or warm mist. There's also the amount of mist and the amount of humidity. Best of all the unit is completely silent except when you push the buttons which beeps. This unit comes with pipe extensions so if you place the humidifier on the ground you could pipe the mist up higher. I keep it next to my bed and the pipe extension allow the mist to exhaust over my head. The pipe has a dual swiveling spout allowing two independent exhuast directions.

"I got this to use with my Dahon Mu P8 not realizing that it doesn't work with 33.9mm diameter seatposts. The screw that squeezes the two side clamps together is not long enough when used with large diameter seatposts. I found out that you could get it to work somewhat if you remove the stock rubber bushing/washer and replace it with a thinner metal and/or rubber bushing. The carrier itself is very well made considering its tubular nature. It's made of aluminum and painted or powdercoated. It's very lightweight but stiff and not flimsy. There is a rear plate for mounting a taillight/reflector or even a miniature license plate. The rack is positioned far rearward so it doesn't interfere with your saddle too much. If mounted low enough on the seatpost there is plenty of clearance allowing for adding a seatpost bag. I prefer this design over fixed units that are mounted to the frame.

"This carbon seatpost is made for various folding bikes which use the larger 33.9mm diameter seatposts such as the Dahon and Tern folding bikes. I got this for my Dahon Mu P8 and it fits perfectly. It's slightly shorter than the stock post by about an inch which is a good thing for me since I like to sit lower. When adjusting for a lower seating position the bottom of the seatpost sticks out the bottom more and you don't want that because it could hit curbs etc. The bottom of the tube has a rubber cap to protect the carbon from chips and dings when the post is lowered all the way to the ground during folding. The carbon tube itself has a very nice non-glossy matte finish. There are white markings on the rear for height adjustment. It is very light about 300g compared to the stock aluminum one at 700g. The quality of this post is very good and the clamp is forged aluminum so it's strong. Angle adjustment is continuous instead of ratcheting. There are two stainless bolts that are mounted at an angle used to tighten down the rail clamps.

"So I've been reading about other people's experience with this bike and it seems they didn't know what these bikes are designed for. This bike is NOT a BMX style bike! It cannot take the abuse like a normal fixed frame bike. There are many reasons for this. 1. The frame has a folding hinge which is a weak point which means if you abuse the bike it will eventually break in half...simple physics. 2. The tires are very thin and are designed for ROAD use. Since the tires are thin they need to be inflated to a very high pressure which means there's very little compliance so all the stress will be transferred to the frame...there's no cushioning effect. 3. The handle bars are telescoping which makes it weaker...again basic physics. 4. This is an aluminum bike so it's not going to be as strong as a Chromoly Steel bike.Now with that said if you ride this bike as intended it should last for many years. Yes it will eventually break but all bikes break. I got this bike for cruising at the park, beach etc. It is not an urban commuter that is designed to overcome potholes, jump curbs etc. For the price I think it's a great deal for what it offers. It's easily foldable, it's light, it's small, it has good quality components, it's stylish. I myself plan on getting another bike for off roading and urban riding. It will be the Montague Paratrooper Pro 18"" Military Mountain Folding Bike. It's also a folding bike but the way it folds it doesn't make the frame weak. It also has front shocks and thick tires to handle bumps and jumps. I love my Dahon but horses for courses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FFQFU34UWS3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CY1BBA#wasThisHelpful","R2FFQFU34UWS3F","A2PREU4LOFQRB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PREU4LOFQRB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the equivalent of a motorized toothbrush for your skin and it works the same way. If you've ever used a Sonicare electric toothbrush you'll know what I'm talking about, however if you haven't then imagine a vibrating brush that you move across your teeth but instead for the skin. This works extremely well and it's less labor intensive. It removes oil and dirt much better because it basically ""vibrates"" the contaminates loose.

"This humidifier works good but when set to high it's fairly loud. You could hear the water boiling as if you had water boiling in a kettle on your stove. The unit is fairly large but it isn't heavy.

"This seems like a very good cable both in terms of quality and usefulness. It's very thin and flexible which is a huge bonus if you need a cable that could snake around obstacles with sharp bends.

"I was really impressed by this BT speaker when I opened up the box. It's much larger than I had expected and that's a good thing because it means big sound which is exactly what this speaker provides. Not only can it play loud but the sound is nice and clear from the front. From the back is where the bass seems to be coming from so when place near a wall it really produces strong and loud bass. It has built-in SRS WOW HD bass processing too to enhance low frequency output but I've always left that feature turned off because it's not adjustable. To do that requires pressing both volume buttons simultaneously. Overall build quality is very good. The buttons are rubberized but this 805 model is not splash resistant. This speaker comes with a AC/DC adapter for charging the internal 4400mAh battery and cannot be charged via USB. The USB port allows charging devices at up to 2A which is very good.

"This is your typical articulating LED desk lamp. It is a pretty good basic model but there are better ones out there. For example the Lampat Dimmable LED Desk Lamp is a better model overall. It's slightly more expensive but it was worth it. That model has a auto off timer and built-in USB charging port. It's also nicer looking and the touch controls are better with better overall build quality. The only advantage the Seville Classics has over the Lampat is the rotating arm. What it doesn't have is a swiveling base like that of the Lampat. Overall this is not a bad lamp but considering the price I would spend a little more and get the Lampat instead of ""settling"" for the lower cost Seville Classics. I got the Lampat for only $50 so not a significant price difference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D57EW06WVHH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHNSAMI#wasThisHelpful","R1D57EW06WVHH0","A2PREU4LOFQRB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PREU4LOFQRB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you who like to record videos but have always wanted better sound will like this wireless mic system. The sound is very nice due to the 24-bit 48kHz format and the dual antennas gives the mic very good distance and reliable audio transmission. The Lavalier package comes with a detachable mic so if it gets damaged all you have to do is swap in a new mic. There are different mics you could get from AT that works with this wireless system including handheld models. The receiver has a small LCD that shows Tx/Rx signal and RF power levels. The receiver has a built-in battery that's charged via USB and included is a wall plug. The Rx has a monitor/headphone out jack which is very useful for making sure you're getting the sound to your recording device. The transmitter uses AA batteries which is nice allowing convenient swapping out of batteries. The power switch doubles as a mic mute button. Overall this is a great wireless mic system that is super portable. The camera mount is a pretty cool addition allowing the antennas to get better reception although the receiver has a built-in ""belt clip"" if you prefer not to mount it on a camera or tripod.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AA29VLNPSJCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJXNEWW#wasThisHelpful","R1AA29VLNPSJCH","A2PREU4LOFQRB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PREU4LOFQRB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For reference I'm currently using a 22"" 1680 x 1050 HP monitor that I've calibrated myself using available software online so it's no slouch even though the resolution is much lower than this DELL unit but first impression is that the thin bezel on this DELL is very attractive and the detachable swiveling stand is quite nice because raising and lowering is linear requiring no forward or backward movement which wastes space. My HP monitor uses up some space in this regard because it uses an angled stand. Both my HP and this DELL pivots so nothing new for me but it's a fantastic and useful feature nonetheless. Touch controls on the DELL are nice but I had to touch them almost on center each time..this is difficult when there are no lights or physical indicators on the touch sensitive buttons. I've found that the best way to activate the touch sensitive buttons is to swipe them with my finger from top to bottom or from left to right depending on if I'm making a selection or just activating the menu from standby mode. Input ports are awesome and I like the fact the USB ports can be set for continuous power output even when the LCD is in Standby. This LCD is not heavy so that's a nice bonus during initial setup. The Displayport cable that came with the monitor is a nice inclusion but since my PC is located away from my desktop display to save space it was too short...not a deal breaker but it means I need to buy a longer cable. Nice thing is my PC has multiple video output types so I used a long 10' HDMI cable I had and it works great.As for the image quality it's very good...DELL even includes the color calibration report printout with each monitor...nice! When set with a black background the LED lighting is fairly smooth with little to no hotspots or edge leakage. Blacks are very nice for an LCD and viewing angles are really good. On Windows 8.1 the monitor's native resolution is automatically detected. The high native resolution means when I'm using programs like Paint Shop Pro X6 I have more room to view and edit an image without having to move tool boxes out of the way. This DELL is now my main landscape monitor and my HP is rotated for portrait use. Oh almost forgot the sharpness setting is great.  I tested the fast response time setting using my Xbox One game console and it seems to improve the image quality by reducing ghosting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9FBDLLW1OKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0EQD1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3S9FBDLLW1OKT","A2PREU4LOFQRB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PREU4LOFQRB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is by far the best table top light that I've owned to date. It's very stylish and the light quality is superb. With 4 light modes and 5 levels of brightness you have plenty of light output options to choose from. With a CRI of over 90 you will also appreciate the accuracy of colors illuminated by this lamp. The swivel and multi angle adjustment works great as well as the 1hr off timer and built-in USB power port. Since this lamp uses only LEDs the power consumption is very low and there's very little heat generated. The LEDs are also covered by a diffuser so there's less glare. The controls are soft touch so they're very easy to use and clean. The base is weighted so no worries about it tipping over. Even though this unit is made of plastic it is very high quality and doesn't look or feel cheap.

"This is my second brite-view box, not finding anything better.  I love the fact I can throw just about anything at it, include DVD .iso files and it will play it.  I connect via smb on the Mac and dump my files into a directory then play it back on the TV.  I've given up on wireless anything - wireless printing, wireless streaming, etc so I've got a hard line connected to it.Although it supports a wide variety of HD formats for an external drive, the only format which worked without it crashing was NTFS.  You can power it off, but it does not like to stay off.  It will wake up if it senses any IR commands from any IR remote.  I just put a piece of black tape over the front.Oddly enough, it plays great over UPnP using Serviio once I forwarded the port on the router.  It will connect to my older Mac but not my newer Mac for file browsing and I've lost patience trying to figure out why since UPnP works fine from the same machine.The company still kinda sorta supports it but they're more difficult to find in stock and it doesn't look like anyone is developing updated firmware for it.  If you're looking for something which plays many formats, is somewhat functional, and you are willing to put up with the quirks - you should give this box a try.Perhaps the company will once again invest some money into a next generation product because I couldn't find anything as functional from the competition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GAMNTCEM22RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TUB2VE#wasThisHelpful","R2GAMNTCEM22RL","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a refurbished Samsung 28 inch LED 720p TV to replace the 32 inch ""SmartTV"" which smoked and died after just 4 days in service.  Disappointed with how little I received in exchange for a huge price tag, I decided to go to the opposite extreme - let's get something really cheap, factory refurbished.My first apprehension was that whatever caused the set to be refurbished could still possibly re-surface.  Since I already had to ship back a broken TV, the fear of the unknown was overcome by the desire to save a few bucks.  It was shipped in its original box with all the accessories although the box was covered with shipping labels and looked well traveled.The TV itself was spotless and there was no indication other than it was delivered right from the factory.  It has a USB media browser which was far superior to Samsung's ""SmartTV"" browser i.e. the downgrade in software was an improvement.  Like other appliances, it did not recognize the exFAT partition but FAT16 came up just fine on the USB stick.There are just enough tweaks to adjust the picture to clarity.  Mind you, watching mp4's on a 28 inch monitor brings out all the motion artifacts (blurry blotches during fast motion).  The sound is decent and has significant low frequency response so I do not feel compelled to run out and buy a sound bar for it.  It's far less quirky and has less picture and sound adjustments than the higher end ""SmartTV"" yet was easier to setup.Compared to a television costing 3.3x as much, I'm actually happier with this cheaper, refurbished one.One advisory - 28 inch flat panel is good for a bedroom, man cave, or small livingroom while being too large for a kitchen.

"In the industry, it's known as infant mortality - that is electronics which tend to fail will do so shortly after they've been put into service.  Doing some quick searches it appears that Samsung needs to investigate their power supply design.  It started as quirky behavior, like the screen suddenly becoming very dim or ignoring my picture settings.  The picture did not always look as good as nice as the LCD which was to replace it, my Samsung LN32B530.  It is an older model, also getting lackluster mid-range quality picture reviews which are probably rumors started by manufacturers trying to sell you 4K TV's.  This new LED set looked better, sometimes.  Other times everything looked odd.I toned down much of the auto power conservation settings and motion smoothing which made the picture look dark and fuzzy.  After a few days of adjustments it still didn't look right... then it died and I needed to return it.Aside from LED vs. LCD, all the things I was trying to improve by upgrading was the ""smart TV"" features.  The apps - yea, nothing I could really use.  It gave me the 3rd or 4th way to access Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube.  The Amazon and Pandora apps never worked, telling me I was in the wrong country (I wasn't).  The built-in web browser does not accept cookies, making it difficult to navigate.  The mini keyboard and mouse I ordered for the TV never really worked right with it, if at all.It pulled streaming content off my Mac easily enough after I installed Serviio as well as running off the USB hard drive.  But, the media browser would display only the first 8 characters of every filename in a difficult to read tile type display.  I miss that feature, until I figured out the Roku 3 will do all of that and I already owned one.  I just needed to add the USB and Media player channels - and, it's works better, other than the Roku works with a USB stick but not a hard drive.I'm glad the thing smoked and died, forcing me to return it.  Had it been the only set in the house, I would have replaced it with a new one with an extended warranty.  But, rather, I've decided to buy a refurbished set for empty room and keep my older Samsung LCD.  The color is wonderful and it's proven itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R272NGH9ZMO8QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9U8T2W#wasThisHelpful","R272NGH9ZMO8QY","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You get a lot for the money for this cheap action cam.  The audio is great.  The video can be set to one of three different resolutions.  And, it uses SD cards (not microSD).  SD cards are easier to deal with.  Recording inside did amazingly well in low light.  The LCD is low resolution yet provides quick feedback on settings and video.There are some differences between the S300 and the S200.  The S300 is more low profile and does not use a touch screen nor does it have an HDMI output port.  There is also no AV cable provided with the S300.The on-screen menus provide a way to format the card and set the time and date.

"GPS units have come a long way in the past 5+ years but I've been putting off buying one because they look exactly the same and do the same thing.  But, with processors getting faster, screens getting larger, and prices coming down - not to mention lifetime map updates and traffic with no pop-up ads, I decided to upgradeThe Garmin 2797 is just a sweet unit.  In a small SUV I thought the size was perfect, although that big bright screen depletes the battery very quickly.  My last Nuvi 500 I would charge in the morning and it was good to just toss on the dash for a couple of days.  With the 2797, the battery is there just for brief periods of time so you can change the settings and add a waypoint or two with the main power off.It's heavy.  Twice the unit went flying on the bean bag mount when I made a sharp turn.  I needed to tape some non-skid material to the bottom to keep the beast from slamming against the right door on a turn.  Luckily the unit is made very sturdy and is no worse for wear taking a few knocks.I use Basecamp and Google Maps to enter lat/lon coordinates as well as the street address.  Still, the routing feature has difficulties with entrances to malls so it just guesses.  Bear in mind, although they appear intelligent, they're really quite dumb and should be considered a navigation aid rather than being in command of your trip i.e. know where you're going and how to get there and understand it's ok to ignore the instructions being given to you by this gadget.Mine spoke English but I wanted it to speak with a British accent.  Venturing to the Garmin WebUpdater said I could update voices, but only to ""fun"" voices like Yetti.  I did find an update for the voice, selected it on the GPS, but it went mute.  This was my only question to tech support.  Apparently, to add additional languages, you need to use Garmin Express, drill down to ""other files"" which hide a few updates with a note telling you that they're not needed.  Ignoring the comment, I installed ""English"" since there was nothing marked British English.  This did the trick and installed all the English flavours of voices including Australian English.Voice command - meh.  It does better with street numbers and names which it can pull from its street database rather than restaurant names and poi's, which may not even be available.  After a week I turned off the map layer for poi's because it was too cluttered and easily accessible from the ""up ahead"" feature.  Voice works great for when you're stuck in traffic and just want to tell it, ""Go Home!"" without taking your hand of the wheel.Keep all your cables as Garmin uses unused pins on the mini and micro USB connectors.  You can hack an ordinary cable up to use with it, but it's nearly not worth it.  The software is running wonderfully on the Mac's Yosemite.  Almost no issues, except that Basecamp's UI gets confused if you update a field and click another tab before updating the value.  Just don't do that.  I also block Basecamp's internet connection because I couldn't find a way to opt out of anonymous data usage tracking by Garmin.  No means no.Map updates were a breeze, although it takes several hours for the full continental U.S. to install.  I have not needed the microSD card as there is tons of memory available.  When I first bought my Nuvi 500, I was able to add points by manually editing the XML files, placing them on the SD card, and rebooting.  The method is still the same, but now done entirely thru BaseCamp.  Or, simply talk to it and tell it the address you're interested in.  It's very good.I love all the information on the screen, which includes the intersection I'm approaching on top with the road I'm on at the bottom.  Additional trip information is available at the touch of a button.  As a turn is approaching, the screen gently zooms in for the best detail, then promptly zooms out after I've made the turn.  If I ignore a suggested turn, it doesn't get all verbose and starts to yell at me.  Rather, the next suggested turn quietly appears as it quietly re-calculates the route.  Every time I start the car the next day, it assumes that I arrived at my destination and doesn't try to navigate me ""home"" when I'm starting from there.  And, if I start driving, it displays the map without me having to reach over and touch the screen.Oh.. but, I *hate* this feature.  This is where my new travel companion crossed a line with me.  You might ask, What can an inanimate object do to make the hair on the back of my neck come up?  After a week of driving, the GPS learned which waypoint I was traveling to every day, my place of work.  On Friday, rather than the GPS faithfully giving me upcoming intersections, it ASSUMED that I was on my way to work, told me what time I would arrive at work, and what traffic I would encounter on my way to work!  No No No NO!Who are you?  My boss?  Computers are slaves and shall not take that tone with me.  It guessed correctly that I was on my way to work and when I arrived I deleted all the accumulated routing information as it yelled at me for erasing its memory.  It was pretty handy, I admit, but it crossed a line with me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBOD8M7PG8EAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXX0JOQ#wasThisHelpful","RBOD8M7PG8EAL","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who spends this much money on a toilet seat?  I found one ""open box"" (don't judge me) for a bit less.  I've been a big fan of wood seats, which is the only material I've used at home.  I've tried hard resin and padded seats.  The last seat was really small and I had to wiggle onto it like was sitting on the opening of a coffee can.Since I found it on special, I grabbed the self-closing feature model.  The mounting bolts - everyone has their own design for how to mount the bolts.  These are clever, tho the instructions aren't very good.  I found the best way was to unlock the tabs, push the bolts in, lock the tabs, then mount the seat.  Centering the seat is important before you tighten the bolts which really needs to be done with a 1/2 inch socket wrench.  Forget about using an open end wrench.  Just ratchet tight and the outer portion snaps off once you've reached the proper torque to protect the fixture.  Yet, it leaves plenty to grab to remove at a later time.The color - wow, it was spot-on for the fixture I had, this powder blue.  The self-closing feature?  eh.  yes, You can just tap the lid closed and it will slowly close without making a sound.  But, not the bottom portion - only the lid.  It does come in handy.So, about the fit?  again, wow.  This is the most comfortable seat I've ever used.  It looks great and feels great.  I can't believe they've given me such a roomy seat.Cons?  Just two minor ones.  Since the bolts self-destruct when installing, it would be nice to have a spare set of bolts since the quick-release mechanism is non-standard.  The other is that the plastic appears to scratch easily.  It is comfortable, flexible, and doesn't have that ""cheap"" feel.  But, it has a gloss finish which appears to scuff easily if it comes in contact with something hard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YT3KAE1UP5GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9AWVDE#wasThisHelpful","R2YT3KAE1UP5GM","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you put all the divers who like purge valves together in a room with divers who hate purge valves you would start a riot.  The problem is not purge valves.  The problem is nobody makes a decent design.Back in the 70's and 80's was this design of a flat piece of glass with a purge valve which stuck out front.  The nose pinch was behind the valve built into the rubber.  The design was fine, but fell out of favor because it looked ugly; called the ""pig snout.""  Newer designs pushed the lenses back, reduced the volume, and improved peripheral vision.  One gotcha - a protruding soft nose pocket became the standard.  If you wanted a purge valve, it went into the nose - or up your nose and/or prevented you from pinching your nose.  It's a bad design.This design is the best of both worlds.  Now you have the customary nose pocket back, but it's not really a nose pocket.  It's a purge valve pocket - stylish, functional, and does not interfere with the nose pinch.  On my face, I can pinch my nose easily and it makes a great seal.I will be buying a second as a backup.  Great design with a strong solid tempered glass with peripheral vision and a purge valve which doesn't look like a pig's snout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I0MAGIRZBI08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O8Q9G6#wasThisHelpful","R1I0MAGIRZBI08","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I formatted a USB stick for FAT and copied a few movie files onto it from Mac.  It has a nice auto-play feature, but it chokes on hidden files which Apple likes to leave.

"First let me say the device calibrated my screen quickly and easily on a Mac Mini running Yosemite.  Perfect color.  My monitor never looked so great.  I just wished the software was a bit less annoying.  It's a bunch of little things.I needed to register and activate the software.  This seems a bit obnoxious considering I'm paying for the hardware.  Each time I let it activate on-line, it sent me an email with my activation code while telling me that activation failed.  I went back and did the activation through the website which worked fine, followed by half a dozen emails with my activation code.There's no way to move the app when it's running, forcing me to move my webcam out of the way as the sensor insists on sitting dead center.  The counter weight was very close to the sensor and didn't move easily.  I had to work out that I could move the weight so the sensor would drape over the screen properly.I had to swear that I was not using a hub and there was no ambient light falling on the screen.  I lied.  It works fine on a hub.  With that being said, if you have Win7/8, avoid using USB3 hubs which are problematic.  No issues on the Mac tho.  I had to wrestle with it as it kept telling my monitor was too dim.  Looks fine to me.  It was unclear if I won the argument but finally got it to calibrate, then reduced my backlighting to a comfortable level.After it completed, a yellow icon which looked like an ugly nose appeared on my Mac's toolbar.  I tried to remove it, but the only way it would go away was to quit the background program.  Apparently there's a background task which expects me to keep the sensor plugged in all the time to measure my ambient light.  I quit the task.

"Who wears a watch when the exact time is always displayed on your cell phone?  At some point, I decided that it was more convenient to use a watch rather than dig out my phone every time I wanted to tell the time.  I was really picky.  First, it must be a tritium watch so I can see the time in total darkness.  The second hand must be illuminated.  And, it needed to display the date.My next set of criteria was a sapphire crystal since I'm always scratching plastic watches.  Some reference to 24 hour time would be most welcome.  Dive watches were a possibility, aviator or chronometer styles were tempting, but dress watches were out.Then I found this unique looking fellow.  It's rugged looking, but without the unnecessary depth gauge and helium mixture calculator.  It has a sapphire crystal without being too expensive.  And, has an illuminated second hand and date display.I was originally sold on the Reactor watches with the Never Dark design.  But, let me tell you - this is plenty bright.  In a brightly lit room you'll barely see the hands glow.  As I move into an unlit room or outdoors at night, I can see the time clearly without waiting for my eyes to adjust.  The only situation in which I can't tell time is while driving at night with bright headlights all around me.  Then, my eyes never have time to adjust to the darkness - but, I've got that covered.From what I've read, Traser is the brand of mb-microtec, a Swiss company who makes Tritium tubes for other watch companies.  They diversified with their own brand of watches at an affordable price and have a good reputation.  While you can find cheaper watches, you probably won't find the same quality for the price.The watch is a little heavy but not too big, most definitely a man's watch.  Traser sells a healthy assortment of watchbands if you're not ""feeling"" the green.  I searched for years for a watch, knowing that most of the time it will sit on my desk while I type.  If you want to own only one watch, this one is a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CSQ1CRBKM3ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JEH0OU#wasThisHelpful","R1CSQ1CRBKM3ZJ","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for a reliable splitter made from quality parts.  This one is is.  Some of good features include a solid built plug with a blade type 15A fuse cleverly built into the handle, heavy cord, 4-way rather than 3-way and that extra socket can actually accommodate a genuine lighter if you're so inclined.Mind you, cigarette plugs and sockets are a gimmick.  It was never designed for electronic gizmos and such.  If you have a device which has a plug which falls out of this, consider replacing the plug, not the socket.Anyway, I bought this for an ""off the grid"" 12v battery system for when the household AC goes out.  I wanted to charge my power-hungry smart phone - check; it has a nice 5v USB socket in the rear.  And, lots of juice available (10 amps) for lights and other gadgets.But, wow - that LED draws a lot of current.  I nearly returned it, but decided to void my warranty ;)  The front LED is connected via a 1k resistor to 12v.  That equates to a healthy 12ma just to keep an LED lit which I didn't really need.  There's an additional LED in the rear which tells you the status of the 5V USB port.  I think there are just way too many LED's in gizmos these days, so a simple wire cutter dropped the current draw to almost nothing.

"Just amazing reception, clear picture, and (fairly) easy interface.  I am 50 miles from the nearest transmitter and can still pick up a few stations with the whip antenna, but not very well.  This is for emergencies after the storm knocks out all the electricity, phone, internet, and cable television.  Here's the good and bad:Good:Runs on ordinary AA batteries.  No rechargeable built-in battery to run out during a power failure.Excellent sensitivity capable of picking up signals where I would never expect possible.Great color and picture.Easy controls - not the best, not the worst, I can kinda figure out what button to press.Cons:5v adapter input rather than what should have been a mini-USB.Really oddball external antenna input.Built-in antenna very delicate and I expect to break it in the near future.Here's how I overcame the reception problem.

"I felt the need to write a few words about this film after the feedback.  Ignore the negative comments.  Perhaps it's billed incorrectly as a sci-fi thriller where the operating system of a computer becomes a sentient being.  uhh, yea, kinda; but, not the reason to watch.  If you're expecting anything science-fiction-ie, you're going to have a bad time.What I see is a collection of metaphors, how we deal with technology, how we deal with people, how technology is becoming a part of our lives, how we see each other, our full-time connection to the Internet, what is to be human, what it is to be machine.  Then, the film takes some of these concepts and lets them run off the rails like an out of control game of The Sims to see how far the simulation can go until it becomes absurd.Perhaps those negative comments come from those too young, who not yet experienced a real human relationship, spending too much time in the basement playing video games.  This movie more for adults who can spot a relationship running amuck or those little clues that you need to put some space between you and the woman you're dating - immediately.Or, perhaps this illustrates what can happen when we don the video glasses and talk to our cell phones like they're human.It's a love story which has only one person in it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUX9GMQRRE4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9HZITU#wasThisHelpful","R3TUX9GMQRRE4I","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I originally had a pair of LLBean's, but they proved too difficult to slip in and out of.  I don't like laces.  Zipper boots have bad reviews.  Then, this BOA system closure caught my eye.  Some have had problems with cable failures.  Now that I own them, I see where they're going wrong.  It's very tempting to ratchet the cable very tight, which gives it no ability to bend or flex, so it breaks.  I just snug them down as tight as I would make lace boots.  I think it will last the life of the boot.  I took an extra precaution of buying spare parts.  The mechanism and lace appear easy to replace and BOA provides a warranty.  It's only a few bucks to replace and it's always nice to have a backup.  It's geared more towards ski boots, so I needed to send a few emails to find the correct replacement parts for these.Then, there are the replaceable soles.  It came with a snap-on set of ice spikes.  The non-metal spikes on the boots seem aggressive enough for most conditions.  I was tempted to swap them out, but they're really stiff and difficult to change i.e. I would only switch to metal spikes for actual walking on frozen ice all day, not for normal use.  Best, if the soles wear out, just snap on a set of new ones.Breaking in - the boots were very stiff and difficult to walk in at first.  I was surprised when after wearing them for just one day, the softened up enough to be easy to walk in and not a problem in the car to drive with them on.  Nice and water proof.  I had no problem walking around in a foot of snow.  I plan on wearing them through most of the Winter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FWG2RYXZ19P6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBU6DGC#wasThisHelpful","R2FWG2RYXZ19P6","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've only had them for a few days, so assuming worst case I need to replace them for some reason, they are inexpensive enough and slip on without sticky adhesives.If I had to say one thing bad about them, when I slip my glasses on, I hear a noise as the foam moves past my ears; but, not while I'm wearing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33IS3J8NCT2JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006KWXJJQ#wasThisHelpful","R33IS3J8NCT2JJ","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was doing research on alum and came across these solid blocks of salt for both deodorant as well as shaving.  It's Potassium Aluminum Sulfate, aka alum or potassium alum or barber's alum.  I gave it the acid test.  I shoveled the walk, worked up a good sweat and stench.  Just a few passes of this alum and the odor was gone.  It works by killing off bacteria which cause body order.Potassium Aluminum Sulfate is a very old substance, dating back to at least 200 B.C.  It's a deodorant, water purifier, after shave, makes a good fire extinguisher - it's just an amazing little molecule.  Many commercial deodorants contain aluminum chlorohydrate, which is a smaller molecule and more easily absorbed by the body - which is more unhealthy.Now, a word about aluminum.  There was a study done back in the 70's which remarked about the unusually high concentration of aluminum in the water supply of a patient with Alzheimer's.  As it turned out, there was no link to aluminum, but it was enough to cause everyone to throw out their aluminum cookware.  The fear and ignorance continues.Aluminum chlorohydrate is safe, but tends to be absorbed by the body whereas Potassium Aluminum Sulfate is a larger molecule and not as easily absorbed.  This makes Alum a preferred substance.But, to say that Aluminum Sulfate contains aluminum and is dangerous is just wrong on several levels.  It's like saying that H2O aka water aka dihydrogen monoxide is poisonous because it has (something) monoxide in it.  Or, saying that water is explosive because it has a very flammable substance, hydrogen coupled with an oxidizer, pure oxygen.  If you have never been exposed to chemistry, H2O aka water may seem like an extremely flammable substance.  Yet, in the real world, we extinguish fires with water.Such is the same with aluminum.  When atoms combine to form molecules, the new substance takes on entirely new properties.  Do not confuse Alum with aluminum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNFSIIFDDI09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CJYUOQ#wasThisHelpful","R2RNFSIIFDDI09","AWZR0O65DL2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWZR0O65DL2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are considering this AT-214, compare also the AT-213.  It's the same tripod but folds into fewer, sections.  The trade-off is how short the tripod is when it's folded vs. how many sections you need to pull out when you setup.  I went for this model the smaller folded size.  Also watch the 22lb weight limit if you're shooting with a long lens.  Fear not, they make heavier models such as the 313 and 413.I've been a huge fan of Bogen tripods until discovering Induro.  Here are the things I love about this model:  It comes with a case which quickly and easily tosses over my shoulder.  I've never been able to carry a tripod using a strap or a sling before today.  It has nicely padded legs - no more foam covers which slip out of place.  When open, it's reasonably level and very sturdy, doesn't wiggle like others I've owned.  It has all the classic features, like a removable center column and clips for attaching a sandbag or accessories.  It also comes with a tool kit in a pouch which attaches to the tripod.Other nice things, the carry bag is large enough to carry the tripod attached to one of the largest heads Induro makes, the 5-way pan-head.  The twist legs are so nice, compared to clamps, but that's a matter of taste.  They work well with a smooth operation.To be fair, here's what I didn't like.  I didn't care for the ""Made in China"" stickers, but they're easily removed.  The country of manufacturer in no way distracts from the quality of construction.  Second, to switch between spikes or pads, one needs to use the tool kit to unscrew one and screw in the others.  I guess I'm a bit spoiled with other tripods which convert between spikes and pads with a twist.  This one, not so much.  So, once you've got your spikes on, it's a commitment.  I shot with spikes in soft sand and pads inside on a smooth floor.  Both worked well.Induro is more like a shooting assistant than dead weight to be lugged around.

"This is the most versatile head I own.  I can quickly and easily pan, tilt, swivel all with precision.  Just a really well-built, sold, yet surprisingly compact head.  It's not lightweight, but lighter than you would think just by looking at it.  The best feature is the folding control arms - just really well thought-out by people who live on the tripod.There are just a couple of things you must be aware of.  First, bubble levels cover this thing - a bubble level for every axis you can imagine.  They are just not very accurate.  My Pentax has a 2-axis electronic level which made leveling the camera much easier than using the tiny bubble levels on the head.  ok, not a big issue and probably not unexpected.  btw - you can find hot shoe mounted bubble levels which do a better job for you.The second issue is the quick release.  Love 'em or hate 'em, we are treated to a universal Arca Swiss Style quick-release mount rather than a proprietary mounting plate.  As I fiddled with the knobs to setup the camera, I turned the quick-release knob which protrudes out further than the swivel knob.  Just a touch of this knob with the camera in a vertical position sent it accelerating towards the ground at a great acceleration.  Thankfully I had a hand on the camera at the time and felt it slip, grabbing it just in time.  whew.  Really close and enough to make me not so found of the quick release.I noticed some small text on the knob, telling me to hold my camera while turning this job.  yea, no kidding.  I put a rubber band around it, hoping that it will remind me to not grab that knob ever again.Still tho, I thought some more and realized I could reverse the quick release plate 180 degrees.  This puts the quick release knob in a very awkward position making it difficult to turn; perfect.  Depending on your setup, you may or may not have the room to face this knob forward, placing it under the lens.  But if you do, do it.  It's one less knob in your face, making operation easier.  You may never have to face that ""ah ha"" moment when you realize, Oh, wow, that's what that knob does!With the little ""issues"" behind me, this tripod head has become my favorite.Edit 12/2/13: I'm a bit more knowledgeable about the Arca Swiss Style quick-release plates.  The problem I was having was I had purchased the head used and the previous owner had apparently removed the two ""safety screws"" which prevent the QR plate from sliding sideways as I had described.  After some emails, the manufacturer understood the situation and resolved all my issues.  so, I'm adding another star if the system will let me.Great tripod.

"I've never had great luck with electric shavers, but recent experience with a competing brand convinced me that there may be some merit in their use. After looking at the feature set and construction of the Norelco, I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.Things started out well. I was impressed with the construction and look of the razor and love the fact that all three of the rotating heads pivoted independently of each other, something that my other three head razor does not do.I also thought that the combination charging and washing system was fantastic. I like the way it looked, and like the idea of having the entire razor cleaned and lubricated after each use. Sadly, it was in critical areas of actual use that this razor showed its weakness on my beard.In testing it I used it dry (which I found it fairly uncomfortable, not at all what I would think a razor for sensitive skin would feel like), wet with just water,  with gels, and with traditional shaving creams. I used it regularly for 3 weeks, to make sure that I gave my skin ample time to acclimate to the new razor.The results of all my testing were disappointing. I do have a fairly coarse beard, which has caused problems with electric razors in the past,  but I thought that a razor carying this price tag would be able to handle it. No dice.To get anywhere close to a reasonable shave, I had to apply more pressure than I found comfortable, and continue going over the same spots again and again and again; they felt irritated long before they were clean shaven. I tried it with less pressure to allow the blades time to conform to my face, but it made no difference at all and I was never able to get a suitably close shave with this razor.The rest of the system worked flawlessly though, and I found it easy to clean, easy to charge and easy to hold onto wet or dry. For these reasons, I very much wanted the razor to be functionally excellent. Instead, I'll be going back to my older rotary razor which actually does a fine job even on my course beard, and I'll be passing this one along to my son who has very fine whiskers that are removed easily with the Norelco.If this actually works on your beard, it's a wonderful razor with great construction look and feel. However if, like I, you have a course beard or simply one that just doesn't want to work with this guy, no amount of wonderful features will make up for the fact that you won't be clean shaven, and you'll be looking around for a traditional razor in no time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GNM4MC06YXYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOTALG#wasThisHelpful","R1GNM4MC06YXYM","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is it possible to make the perfect travel pack? I don't know, but this gets close.Honestly, if I were to design exactly what I wanted in a weekend travel pack, this would ALMOST be it. First of all, the pack itself is very well made, with nice materials, high quality SBS zippers, an strong stitching throughout. The handle on the top makes it simple to use as a carry-on bag for flights, while the well-padded shoulder and waist straps tuck away into a zippered panel in the back.There are plenty of pockets, including two mesh water bottle slots, and a nicely padded laptop pocket that had no problem swallowing a 15"" computer. This is my only real complaint, as the pack itself is wide enough to handle a 17"", but they've made the laptop slot a bit narrower.There's a lightweight aluminum and HDPE frame in the back that allows the bag to hold its shape while empty. And it's removable - sweet.Then there's the killer feature - the outer section of the pack zips off and can be used as a small day pack, complete with shoulder straps. What a great feature for travelers! Leave the bulk of your things in a hotel or tent, and head off for the day with your camera, wallet, pad and paper,... whatever you want close at hand is there, without the hassle of carrying everything everywhere.Bonus: behind the zip-off pack is a hidden zippered pocket, which makes it easy to keep important documents (passport, etc.) or extra cash in a more secure spot than a pocket open to the world.I can guarantee this: the next time I or a member of my family goes on a 3-4 day trip, this is going to be the one piece of luggage that is going for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21THKL38DJPYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOYLCCY#wasThisHelpful","R21THKL38DJPYV","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Enough heft to add to a strike, but not too much so that it's a pain to carry.- The blade is beautifully made and razor sharp.

"There's a lot to lke here, not the least of which is the 300-400 bucks that stay in your pocket after purchasing it over one of the flagship devices offered by most carriers.First of all, it looks fantastic and feels like a premium device in the hand with nice fit and finish. It's very light and slim as well, which is great for those that like to keep their phones in their back pockets. How it would stand up to being sat on though, I do not know.It comes loaded with Kit Kat 4.4.4, and I've not heard about any upgrades to Lollipop, but that's not a huge issue to me. The version of Android is lightly skiined by Huawei which allows it to be very quick and responsive.Call quality is excellent, and the volume on the speakerphone is plenty loud and clear. This was a real treat, as most phones in this price range tend to sound pretty poor.The screen is one of the obvious cost-cutting decisions the company made - it's only 720 x 1280, which doesn't bother me as much as the fact that it's also not particularly great looking. Colors aren't quite right, and off-axis viewing isn't up to snuff. However, considering the price point here it's not a deal breaker at all.The camera software I found to be quite good, and photos and videos are better than I expected at this price point. If you're looking for a flagship--killer you might want to look elsewhere, but for basic snap shots and videos, though, it does a fine job.There were a couple of software issues I should mention. First, Auto Brightness on my review model was completely non-functional. Bummer. Also, I was excited to see that I could adjust color temp, as it is extremely cold from the factory, but that, too, didn't work. Weird, but I assume easily fixable in a patch.All in all, this is a fine effort from Huawei. I'm really glad that there are reasonably priced unlocked phones on the market now, as I really dislike the absurd pricing on cellular service and devices. More choices like this will hopefully get the big carriers to be more aggressive not only in device pricing, but airtime as well, which is a win for everyone.Faced with the choice today of buying my current phone, a Droid Turbo (which is my favorite phone I've ever owned) or the P8 lite, I'd have a tough time deciding. But I'm telling you right now: I suspect I'd be walking around with the extra money in my bank account and the P8 in my pocket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EUYSKWCZUPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3WTLHQ#wasThisHelpful","R3EUYSKWCZUPE","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vacuums seem to be getting more and more gimmicky lately - not something I'm particularly a fan of. So when this one arrived on my doorstep, I was pretty excited to check it out.My first question was ""what makes this a commercial vacuum?"" I suppose in this case it's the lack of the gizmos and gadgets that so many vacuums come with. I've read that often the commercial models don't have rubber bumpers, but this does, or that they have bigger motors, but this is a 12 amp, just like my regular vacuum. So really, I suppose it's the utilitarian look and feel, along with the bright orange heavy duty cord.This assembles easily with a screwdriver and was ready to try out in no time. As I said, there are very few frills: it comes with one plastic tube extension for the hose, one crevice tool that can be attached to the extension, and one non-moving basic brush attachment. That's it. Happily, they all live on the vacuum so they're always handy. Construction is pretty good, though some of the plastics felt quite cheap. On the other hand, then weren't to rigid, so perhaps they'll last longer under stress and won't snap easily.As for functionality, I'm very happy. It has tremendous ability to pick up whatever I run it over, either on rug or bare floors. Rugs in particular get a fantastic cleaning, and I was able to get a ton of dirt up that my other vacuum had left behind. Bare floors suffer a tiny bit because you cannot turn the motorized brush off, so things can sometimes get flung backwards, but it happened rarely and the overall effectiveness made up for it.The hose attachment clicks into place on the body, which I really like, and is released with the push of a button. The hose is long, but not quite as long as I'd like. However, the suction it produces is epic. Seriously more powerful than any vacuum I've used in recent memory. The tools, basic as they are, do their jobs well and I don't find myself wishing for any additional attachments.Emptying the canister is extremely easy: take it to the garbage and open the bottom. One nice feature: the switch to pop open the bottom is on an extension, allowing it to be released from a ways up the canister. This makes it possible to push the canister farther into the garbage before opening it, and keep my hand from getting dirty or dusty.The top of the canister opens easily if you need to clear anything from the upper chamber, and the filters are easy to reach, remove and clean.Some reviewers have complained about the noise level, but it's quieter than my last upright, and WAY quieter than our Shark, which actually hurts my ears. So I'm extremely happy in that regard.Overall, it's become my go-to vacuum now. It's relatively light, it's powerful, and it's effective. If the hose were just a bit longer and I could turn off the motorized brushes, this would be a 5 star for sure. But even with the ding of a star, it's still my daily driver.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKRNLHZRWK0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO9VLLW#wasThisHelpful","R2CKRNLHZRWK0J","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, I'm an adult. Let's not make a big deal about it.The fact is, this thing is great for any age. It's really well constructed, has an excellent quality large-tooth zipper, and is stupidly cute. The concept is simple: write down your worries, and stick them in the mouth for Saggo to eat up.For children, this is a great exercise in identifying what worries them, and then writing them down can help make them far less scary than when they live inside their heads. If you have very young kids, you can tear them up and put them back for them to find later, which would further help them let go of their fears, while bringing a little bit of magic along for the ride.For adults, well, read the paragraph above. Except for the tearing up part. Though come to think of it, why not that too?My whole family actually loves this, and my daughter's 18-year-old boyfriend was the first to use it.

"Maybe it's because my wife's eyes are only 45 years old and not 65, but this product had limited appealApplication is lovely: it has a nice texture and smells nice as well. It feels great going on and remains comfortable. Makeup can be applied over the top of it if you wish, or you can go out with just the serum. Once applied, it does have a nice tightening effect that lasts for a few hours, though it has not, as of yet, provided any long term positive results.Again, this may be a function of my wife's eyes having only light lines so there's not much to fix, but for her, while it was a very pleasant experience with a nice temporary effect, there did not seem to be any permanent line reduction over time. Perhaps, as another reviewer pointed out, was the skin looser and/or creased with more lines, there would have been a lasting change.In the end, it's a lovely experience but has not (yet) shown us the kind of performance that would prompt my wife to purchase more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMPHE7LC53P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB865F8#wasThisHelpful","R3EMPHE7LC53P4","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a juicer before. Sold it because it wasn't used enough. Why? It was a bit of a pain in the but to set it up, prep the fruit, then clean it up all for a limited amount of juice. This KitchenAid I'll be keeping though, even if it has one unbelievable design flaw.Out of the box it's great looking. Good quality, well-made components and an overall feeling of real quality. It assembles easily, too, with only a few main parts to assemble. The unit allows you to choose how much pulp you want as well, with three settings ranging from low to high. The instructions are a bit confusing as to which setting is which, but looking at the top of the screen while adjusting it makes things clear.The feed chute is quite wide, which allows for dropping whole (small) apples in at once, and minimizes how much you have to cut down items that don't quite fit. The chute is great when putting a big clump of kale or other greens in as well.The juicing process works just fine. Two speed allow you to use different types of fruits and vegetables, and as long as you keep the pitcher under the spout with the cover on it, there's no mess at all. However, something that I thought would be a great feature turns out to be the first minor problem: the spout is hinged, allowing you to flip it up a bit when you're done, ostensibly to keep any last bits of juice from pouring onto your counter after you remove the pitcher. A great idea in theory, but mine leaks a bit of juice each time you flip it up or down. It's not terrible, and not as bad as it pooling on a counter, but the front of the unit does get dirty.Another thing I noticed is that as you push the fruit or vegetable through, particularly in the case of soft fruits like pineapple, the last bit seems to get slung right into the waste bin, not quite fully extracting all the juice. I ended up with a lot of pulp in some instances that could have been better extracted. This may be just how they all work though {I can't remember how my last one did it} and it's not throwing entire chunks of fruit - just a large clump of pulp that looks like it had more to give.As the name implies, this is very easy to clean, with the one exception I alluded to in my opening paragraph. Each piece comes apart easily and I have, for the most part, made it to the sink without making any mess on my counters. Once in the sink, it cleans up well, and the included brush gets the juicer screen quite clean. Parts can be placed in the dishwasher if you wish, and I had no issues when I did so.The problem is that there is a section of the unit, just above the spout, that is completely inaccessible to anything except flying pulp. It's hard to explain, but there's a one-inch square slot that's open at the bottom but closed at the top into which various bits of pulp must ricochet, because when I go to clean up there's a bunch jammed in there. The problem is that the construction of the thing is such that it's impossible to get anything in there to clean it: it's completely blocked by the bottom of the bowl, and you really cant spray it out or anything. I had to find a pipe cleaner, bend it up, and wiggle it around in there and STILL couldn't get it clean. For the life of me, I cannot understand how this flaw was left in place: one use and it's obvious that the section has to be sealed up or users may well end up with rotting bits of fruit and vegetable up there. If you are extremely patient and let water wash in and out of the section, it will eventually get most of the pulp out - but without the ability to directly spray or clean it out, it's a total fail in the ""Easy Clean"" department. The irritating part is that it would have been incredibly simple to just close the slot at the bottom and avoid the whole issue.One final note regarding the pitcher: the cover on it is designed to supposedly keep foam from pouring into your glass. It doesn't work very well at all. I can see how the design SHOULD work, and perhaps it would in a perfect world, but my world is apparently not perfect.In the end though, I really like this juicer and have been using it quite a bit. With the exception I talked about above, it really is easy to clean, it works really well, and looks nice on my counter so I don't mind leaving it out. Considering getting them out and set up is half the battle with juicers, that's actually a bigger deal than it sounds like. Were it not for that one ridiculous design flaw, this would be a 5 star product. But those flecks of fruit and vegetable are really tough to deal with, and I don't want to ignore them and let them mold. I'll probably see if I can figure out a way to block it off {though as I said is so inaccessible it's tough to see how I could work on it}, but it's an amazingly dopey oversight and costs one star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15UK83UNPFC2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O50Q5Y6#wasThisHelpful","R15UK83UNPFC2X","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking for a nice drive to carry critical files around for a while, and I'm very happy with the P20.The drive has a metal back with a plastic front cover, and a plastic switch to retract and extend the USB plug. The construction is extremely solid and the device feels like a quality piece.Speed is excellent - by far the fastest flash drive I've tested thanks to the USB 3.0 capabilities, and I have had no issues with my computer detecting it as USB 3.0 vs USB 2.0.The encryption software is robust and simple. They've included EncryptStick Light, which provides a quick and easy way to create an encrypted vault on the stick. Basically, you run the program, it creates a ""vault,"" you set a password and then open the vault and drag and drop files that you want to encrypt into the window. Close it up and you're encrypted. When you look at the stick, you can see the vault of course, but you cannot open it without opening the program and entering your password.This does NOT encrypt the entire stick, which is as it should be. As many other files as you wish can be kept on the stick in an unencrypted state as well - the vault essential acts like a folder on the drive that's encrypted. It's the easiest and most intuitive process I can think of to provide the service. You can also upgrade to the full version which includes syncing and auto-backup of your encrypted vault. A very nice simple program.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the stick. My only complaints are that I wish it were smaller, and that the only way to put it on a keychain is using the super-thin lanyard that they enclose (which is a PITA to attach, actually). But those are small complaints. It's fast, roomy, and comes with free encryption software.

"I've checked out a few routers in my day, and in many respects this is the top of the heap, with one annoying issue.Setup is easy, either wired or wireless. Login, follow the instructions for basic setup and you're good. If you want to get in and make changes to specific parts of the router, that's easy as well, as long as you understand the system of course. Every aspect of the router is fully configurable, as it should be at this level.This simultaneously runs a 2.4 GHz network and a 5 GHz network, as most good routers do now. The 5 GHz provides faster theoretical connections though range isn't as solid as the 2.4 GHz. However, running on 5 GHz, assuming your wireless device supports it, gets you off the crowded 2.4 GHz band, which may be an advantage for you. Both networks can have their own names and passwords, so it's easy to assign each to different people or networks if you wish.The router also offers a guest network as well, running on 2.4 GHz. This is where my one complaint with the AC 1200 lies. Rather that setting up an third network secured by a standard encrypted password, it's an unencrypted network that you must use a web page to enter the password in. So your guests select the network, then open up a web browser and try to go anywhere but are blocked until they enter the password into a web page. I find this system to be ridiculous, frankly. I don't want to have to explain to friends such a silly system - I'm not Starbucks or a hotel for goodness sake. I just want to say ""log onto network a, use password b."" That's how my Archer C5 works, and it's a great system and all of my kids' friends are able to connect to Wi-Fi easily, without me worrying about our network security.In range and signal strength tests against my Archer it's a toss up on the 2.4 range, with both having excellent coverage and range, though the Linksys does have a slight edge in 5 GHz network signal.Additional feature-wise, the Linksys is packed with goodies like the eSATA and USB 3.0 connection for external storage, and the ability to run OpenWRT, the open source Linux-based OS. That's a great feature if you are really going to geek out with this thing.So in the end its a super solid router with excellent range and signal strength, great build quality and a full suite of advanced features. If you're looking for a basic and fast router for your home network, you may be better off spending a bit less money on something comparable but with less features, but if you're looking for all the goodies and can excuse the guest network implementation, the AC1200 is definitely worth a look.5 stars - 1 for the guest network","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSNIH2Z8G7XYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20T0#wasThisHelpful","RSNIH2Z8G7XYI","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like bluffing games. I'm not great at them, because despite thinking I know when someone is lying, I'm not. But I still love bluffing games. Add in foam guns and being members of a gang that turn on each other and you've got my idea of fun.It's a simple set-up: you've just pulled off a robbery and you and your cohorts have all decided you want more than just  your share. Who gets shot and who gets away with the loot? It all comes down to bluffing and a bit of luck.Along the way, there's plenty of. opportunity for players to channel their inner De Niro, Buscemi, Madsen or Fiorentino.It's a fast play, fun and full of laughs. It's also best with more players.

"They say if you build a better mousetrap the world will beat a path to your door. If that's true, it's going to get crowded outside this company's offices,  because this IS better.I've tried humane traps repeatedly to no avail, and needed to get serious about de-mousing my workshop, so I finally caved and went with the other option. However, I hated the idea of poisoning for a couple of reasons, and whatever method I chose had to be as humane as possible - I think this Victor is it.The bar has enough power to dispatch mice quickly and as humanely as I'd think possible under the circumstances, and the bait area is more than sufficient.But the reason I find this particular trap to be ""better"" is the way it's set: I used to hate setting the old style snap traps and haven't messed with one since, because I always thought I would end up snapping one on myself (ok  - I was a kid when I last set one, so maybe it's an unreasonable fear, but I still hate them). This trap doesn't require setting a trip bar across the open snapper: you just pull the bar back until it clicks, and never have to risk getting your fingers smacked. Fantastic.Disposal is equally easy as setting, and the thing is all plastic so it's easily washable if necessary.A great basic solution for mice that works, is humane, and is reasonably priced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KCRT4SI32GVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JG3MKXM#wasThisHelpful","R3KCRT4SI32GVQ","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here's the thing: I always approach headphones from a quality of sound angle. Maybe it's because I was a recording engineer, maybe because I listen to music almost constantly - it doesn't matter why though: sound comes first, everything else follows.And that explains my three star rating. The sound is just SO not up to par. The bass is fine, I'll give them that, but the midrange is missing and the high end is completely inaccurate. It was a rather bizarre experience actually: I put them on and they sounded really hollow making me feel like my ears were almost being sucked out into them.I compared them to a huge range of headphones and earbuds, and they came up way short of all of them. Which is too bad, because functionally they're really good. The built-in mic works really well, and the controls are easy to find and use. They've avoided the trap of putting the mic on the cable, and for gaming they're really great. They do come with cables that will allow them to be used with a phone as well as a computer, so they're really flexible, too.But, like I said, for me it's all about the sound and these don't make the grade in that regard. If I were only concerned with gaming I'd give them a four star rating for sure, but since I use headphones for games, phone calls and a ton of music, these just don't rate more than a three.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27CXU4W65QIO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF1EC1W#wasThisHelpful","R27CXU4W65QIO0","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fire pits are pretty basic affairs. Four legs, a bowl, a grate, a top, and a tool to lift the top when it's hot.What it comes down to in the end is how well it's built and how nice it looks, and in this case I think it rates above average on both counts.Assembly was simple: remove four nuts from each of the four leg positions, place the legs over the bolts, and replace the nuts to hold them in place. Flip the thing over, then drop the bowl into the middle of the circle of tiles, place the grate in the bowl, attach the handle to the top and you're done.The hardware is sturdy and heavy duty, as are the legs, so I have no issues there. Each leg has a foot screwed into the bottom which is an excellent touch: you can adjust them for height if you wish, but the major benefit is keeping any potential rust from the legs from staining brick or concrete. A nice touch.The grill is sturdy and sprayed black, as is the bowl, and the top is not nearly as flimsy as some I've seen. The tile work around the perimeter looks nice and has a suitable rustic feel to it, though for some bizarre reason the grout is tinted pink. Not a fan there - but at least it isn't a bright pink...NOTE: It is NOT rustproof, and the instructions recommend covering it with a vinyl cover when not in use. I suspect that other fire pits come with the same caveat though, so it's not a big deal.Pink grout aside, this is a well-made fire pit that is easy to assemble, looks good and works well. If you're looking for a nice fire pit and can live with pinkish grout, this makes a nice choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAWF3CFH3XDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LILH3PK#wasThisHelpful","R1AAWF3CFH3XDL","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea of what to expect here, so I was extremely surprised to find out how much I enjoy this. In short, the point is to help you learn to calm your mind in the hope that the effects will carry through to one's day to day life, and in my experience that's what has happened.Setup is pretty simple: download the app, link it via Bluetooth, and follow the instructions that are clearly and calmly spoken via the app. They recommend using headphones, and I'd concur, though earbuds are a much better idea so that you don't jostle the headband.Getting the headband properly reading all five sensors is critical. Thankfully, I'm bald, and it was easy. However, it did appear that I was losing contact with a couple of them, but I wasn't - I was just moving around a bit (which defeats the idea of calming down, so my bad). Once I was still, all five sensors read clearly and solidly.Once the sensors are set, you go though a calibration process in which you think of as many things as you can in specific categories (the app suggests them), then you begin to work on calming yourself.The app indicates increased brain activity by using both auditory and visual cues. This can start a cycle of overthinking of course, but that's a good thing: once you get how to calm yourself back down those skills can be used any time at all. At the end of a pre-selected time (they suggest starting at 3 minutes), you see how much of the time your brain spent in various stages of activity. As you work with the device and software, you learn how to increase the amount of time you're calm and decrease needless activity.As for real-world results, I definitely find that I am less anxious and more content to move calmly through my day when I use the Muse regularly. My calm times have gone up, and with them the amount of balance I've found each day.Meditation is a proven way to help reduce anxiety and increase clarity, so it's no surprise that it works while using the Muse. The question is, can you get the same results without the Muse? I'd say certainly you can. But if you, like I, can get slightly obsessional (am I doing this right? Am I really calm or just thinking I'm calm?), or if you'd simply like actual data on how you're doing, Muse is a great tool. I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OC9321A35UBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LOQR37C#wasThisHelpful","R1OC9321A35UBI","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to enjoy these fellows - I've reviewed some Jabra ear buds in the past and found them to be excellent: sadly, they were stolen (or lost) while I was in a hospital room in an induced coma (who does that?). Unfortunately, these don't come close in sound or comfort.First off, the manual is wrong: if you hold the multi function button down and wait for it to tell you it's pairing, you'll be waiting a long time. It simply lets you know it's on. Once you realize that, pairing is smooth and quick.They come mounted with the mid-sized ear cups mounted, and these were too small for me. Getting a good seal is absolutely essential to getting any bass response, so I swapped them out for the large. Things went better then, but I still had trouble getting a good seal (maybe my ears are wacky?) but was able to at last. It was during this process that the first negative popped up: they're kind of a pain to get on. I'm aware that the fact I wear glasses doesn't help, but I still found it uncomfortable to put these into my ears far enough to get a seal as the black plastic electronics section would irritate my outer ear.I did, however, get them on and sealed and get going with them. After all the work, I was disappointed in the sound. At first blush it seemed alright, but almost immediately the over-accentuated mids made their presence known, and I found the treble shrill and less than optimal. Those two things combined with a distinct lack of bass left me wanting my old Jabras back badly.I had a few ergonomic problems as well: while I was glad they put the controls on the cord and not an earpiece, and while it was easy to figure out what button was what, it hangs behind the ear and over the shoulder, making it a bit of an awkward reach. Worse, though, is the fact that since they are worn with the cable behind the neck, sitting in a chair can easily tug them and move the earphones irritatingly in the ears. Bummer.I had no problem with battery life or pairing, so functionally they worked as they should. But the ergonomic and audio issues let me down sufficiently that I don't think I'll be reaching for them any time soon, unless I'm running (which I rarely do any more due to an injury): getting rid of the cord in that case may make the other issues bearable for a bit.Perhaps there are better ears out there fitment wise, and perhaps some will enjoy the sound profile.

"So first off, yay for more female heroes. It's refreshing to read a crime thriller in which the protagonist isn't a (usually) misogynistic egotistical superman with a heart. Alexandra Hemingway is a 6-foot tall, pregnant, highly educated and independently wealthy NYC cop on the hunt for a serial killer of children, partnered with a highly decorated veteran detective that has a bit of a father complex for Alex.Not the freshest idea on the block of course, but not so bad, either. The problem for me, character-wise, is that Pobi has chosen to make Alex a tough-talking chick ""with balls"" as her partner says. So we get the same tired tough-talking cop cliches but with less penis. And that's too bad: I'd have liked to have a female NYC detective that actually read like an Ivy League-educated trust fund recipient rather than a rich girl trying to act like Dirty Harry.There are problems with the mechanics here, too (warning: very minor early-pages spoiler coming). In the opening of the book, two young men try to carjack Alex on her way to work. She guns them both down, of course (with the requisite tough-guy lines spoken as she does so) then heads to work. Apparently, there was no need to say put and deal with the scene that she caused, nor was it necessary to file reports, turn in her gun after the shooting, sit down to explain it to her captain, meet with IAD etc. etc. In what version of New York do two young black men get gunned down in the street by a white cop without there being at least some investigation? Not the one I grew up with, notwithstanding the cell phone video tape shot by tourists (to whom Hemingway flipped the bird, to further establish her cliched tough-girl anti-authority street cred).There are many other less egregious examples, as when Hemingway meets a character that owns a Beretta handgun. She lets us know immediately that Berettas are useless unless you throw them at someone, and that the owner knew nothing about guns and bought the most expensive one thinking that would make it the best. Which is simply bizarre to anyone that has even a passing knowledge of guns.Odd things ranging from stupid (the Beretta commentary) to unbelievable (that opening scene - in fact the prologue contains even more bizarre leaps that didn't quite make sense)WTF? How did this get by? It make thoroughly pepper ""American Woman"" and, while some may not effect the overall story, they took me right out of the narrative while I thought ""s no sense."" Some sections bothered me enough that I reread them thinking I must have missed something or misread it. Nope - they were just... not great.That's too bad, too. Because Pobi has a good story here, and some of the characters are beautifully drawn. As others have said, it can be a tough read due to the tortures visited upon the 10-year-old victims, but I'd have liked to enjoy this book absent so many glaring oddities that took me out of the story.In the end, what started out with a nice premise devolved into what I've read too many times before and, while I was interested in the story and wanted to stay on board to the end, I don't think I'll remember the name or the plot of this book in a few months.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPYS6HAVSFUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477818219#wasThisHelpful","R2YPYS6HAVSFUS","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK. Yes. The idea explained on the cover of a disease ravaging the world that causes people to forget things like how to breath sounds like a great setup for an apocalyptic thriller.  And no, the disease doesn't really matter at all here, which is a lost opportunity (it sets up a trip to a research center 8 miles under the sea - that's about it). But the question is, does the story that proceeds from there make the book a worth read?Well, yes and no. The first two thirds of the book I enjoyed. Not ""oh man, this is incredible"" enjoyed, but definitely ""wonder what's going to happen next"" enjoyed. I mean, it kept me in to the end, which is something a really poorly written book would not.While Cutter's descriptions of claustrophobia and the creeping horror under the sea were solid, the problem for me lay in the inclusion of too many cliches, combined with some logical leaps and behaviors that I didn't particularly go along with. As the book progresses, things devolve quite a bit for the characters, and there's a slide toward either insanity or the invasion of psyches by some external force (you'll have to read to find out which). But by the end of the book, things had unspooled to such an bizarre extent that it felt like the author was trying (and failing) to channel both Barker and King.I found myself just getting a bit exhausted, frankly. Cutter has a hell of an imagination, and he's quite good at laying out some fairly unpleasant imagery, but for The Deep it would have helped to get it all in check just a bit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTV4RNDCJ50XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717737#wasThisHelpful","RTV4RNDCJ50XV","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First important thing: despite it not being mentioned in the description, this IS a dual link DVI cable and has no problem giving me full 2560 x 1440 resolution on my 27"" monitor.One of the things about a 27"" monitor, by the way, is that they're 27"". A monitor that large requires a fair amount of space, and the distance from it to my computer could barely be spanned my my standard cable - this almost absurdly long one solved that problem neatly.Construction is excellent. It's think and strong without giving up flexibility, and the connectors are solidly attached and feel extremely strong as well. The screws are well made and turn easily, and the pins were all aligned perfectly on my cable.All in all, a great value for a beautifully-made cable that gives me extra flexibility for monitor placement.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these AmazonBasics cables, and they'll be the first brand I'll  be checking out when looking for cabling in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWKER8583CLTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMFK44#wasThisHelpful","RWKER8583CLTJ","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You'd think there isn't much to say about memory cards, and you'd be right. But what little there is can be extremely relevant.Obviously you want a card that is well built so that it can stand up to being taken in and out of devices, dropped in bags, etc. The Samsung passes with flying colors, feeling a bit heavier and more substantial than other cards I have. The lock switch is smooth and easy to move as well. It looks nice, too, which may not matter when it's in a camera, but it's still a nice plus, and the white and orange color scheme make it easy to find in a bag.But where the rubber hits the road is in speed: can it keep up with shooting multiple stills as well as HD video? In the case of the Samsung, I found no problems at all and it was able to keep up with whatever I was doing, whether in my Canon EOS or my Sony HX300.However, as another reviewer said, when tested, the Samsung has a great read speed, but the write speed is  lower than some competing cards which may result in a slow down when the buffer on the camera is full. However, when I used the card that didn't hobble me - perhaps if I had the fastest shooting camera on the market it would, I don't know.A fast, sturdy, good looking card with a 32 GB capacity for under 20 bucks?

"There are two main aspects of this case that need to be looked at: protection and the claim that it makes your iPhone louder. Incredibly, Speck delivers in both areas.Why incredibly? Because people have been making claims like Speck's since health potions were sold from the backs of wagons, and they've rarely delivered. In the case of this Speck case though, there's been no false advertising claimes I've been able to see. Slapping an iPhone into this thing really DOES deliver a huge increase in volume. Is it double? I don't know - but I do know I have to ask my daughter to turn down the music despite the fact that the door is closed. That's impressive.As for protection, the Speck delivers here as well.

I consider that a huge win - she's killed more than her share of iProducts (both phones and pods).For me though, there's one fact that really closes the deal for me.

"I've gone through a lot of cases in my day and frankly, I change it up a lot. I get bored, to be honest, and want to change the look and feel of my phone fairly often. But I'm never willing to forgo quality, and with the Otterbox there's absolutely no worries there.Keep in mind that the GS5 is pretty big to begin with. Not Galaxy Note big, but no lightweight, either. So by definition, you're going to be pushing the limits of your pockets (I don't do holsters) no matter what case you drop the phone into. And that being the case, if you're going to make the phone considerably bigger, you'd better at least be gaining a ton of protection. On this, the Otterbox delivers.Fit and finish are both excellent. The case goes on easily but holds the phone tightly. All cutouts are clean and perfectly positioned, and the button overlays are easy to use and positioned accurately. It's a two-part case, with an inner synthetic rubber sleeve (synthetic rubber?) and an outer polycarbonate shell. The Otterbox also includes an excellent screen protector that is cut accurately and, if applied correctly, is effectively un-noticable. The combined effect made me feel like my S5 was as indestructible as possible for a modern smart phone, and I was extremely impressed.However, I don't use it every day. As I said, the phone is big to start, and it's made bigger with the Otterbox. For my usage, I prefer a slimmer TPU case. BUT - were I out on the road more often, and certainly if I'm going on a trip, I think the Otterbox is unbeatable. It's tough, good looking, and adds as little bulk as possible to provide the level of protection it delivers.If you tend to drop your phone a fair amount and need a good, tough case - the Otterbox is a great choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1QKA7PLTP8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPGW2DY#wasThisHelpful","R3O1QKA7PLTP8C","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first stand-up paddleboard (SUP) and I love it. I have borrowed friends' before and enjoyed it, but I'm no expert at all. This thing suited me perfectly.First of all, it's inflatable, which means I can store it easily and don't need a roof rack to get it to the water. Great. It comes with a large backpack-style bag that holds the board, pump, fins and leash, making it relatively easy to lug to the water (it ain't light, I can tell you that). It inflates quickly and easily as well. So how does it work?Really, really well. It's extremely stable and neither I nor anyone else in my family had any problems getting on and paddling around. We tried it in the Intracoastal, which is calm and easy going, as well as the ocean - and it was equally at home in either. The stability does come at the price of speed, but that's a very fair trade off, and yes, you can catch waves with it.The downers? Well it's pretty spendy, but not having used any other inflatables I don't know if the extra money buys features or quality others don't have. Also, it does NOT come with a paddle. Not a deal-breaker of course, but something you may want to know.  Finally, it's not as easy getting it BACK in the back after deflating it as it was when it arrived all flat and nice.

Instead, I got a set that with some sources bested my Sennheiser HD 580s. Here are the relevant bits:Fist of all, construction is exceptional. They're heavy and well-built without being too much to bear on my head.

Very thoughtful.The cords themselves are obviously removable (good) but they can be plugged into either ear cup (great). The plugs themselves are extremely high quality and attach by plugging in to the ear cup of choice and then rotating 90 degrees to lock them in (fantastic). No worries about the cord accidentally getting pulled out.Comfort is quite good. Not as plush as my 580s, but I had no problem using them for extended periods of time. Which is something I wanted to do because they sound really, really good.As I mentioned before, there is no absurd bass boost here, despite the marketing. What there is instead is a very smooth, very accurate representation of source material. If your material is bass-heavy, these can handle it no problem, but they aren't going to make The Beatles sound like P Funk - which is a good thing. The low to mid range were not muddy at all, with each instrument easily picked out and not getting lost. Mids were accurate and not accentuated, and the high end was sweet and clear without being harsh.As I said, on some source material I found these preferable to my HD580s which is high praise indeed. In fact, it was only when listening to older jazz material like the Ahmad Jamal Trio recorded live at the Pershing in 1959 where I found myself wanting to return to my Sennheisers, which delivered more air and a wider sound stage, feeling almost like I wasn't wearing headphones.But I was extremely impressed otherwise. These are beautifully built, well though-out, come with multiple cables and a nice carrying case, are efficient enough to be driven by an MP3 player but work great with a stereo (they come with a mini-to-1/4"" adapter as well) and sound fantastic. If you had asked me if I thought Pioneer would pull of a trick like this I would have said ""not a chance - they'll be bassy and muddy"" - but I would have been very, very wrong.Great job Pioneer. Really.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M74YBXZVTNNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXUUVWU#wasThisHelpful","R3M74YBXZVTNNJ","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So here's the deal: I've reviewed more than a few sets of headphones and earbuds. I was a recording engineer and record producer for a while and I'm pretty picky about sound, so I tend to check out new sets looking for a nice surprise sound quality-wise. Sadly, these did not deliver.Construction wise they're pretty alright. Seem well-made, fold up small, fit in the football-shaped case that's included. The cord is removable (good), but can only be plugged into the left ear (less good). The Star Wars branding is really nicely done, and the swag is ok I suppose, but none of that means a thing if you can't get good use out of the headphones, and there are two reasons that just wasn't happening for me.First, they just aren't very comfortable. The band over the top is thinly padded and the cups are on the small size, making the grippiness intrude on the listening experience.Second, the sound is just nowhere near where it should be for a set of headphones like this. The upper mids are strong, but bass and lower mids are muddy and lack definition. The high end is attenuated, making it sound like a cloth has been tossed between the cups and my ears when I compare it to other sets I have on hand (Sennheiser HD580s and Pioneer SE-MX9s which I'll be reviewing when I'm finished with this piece). The one nice thing I can say is they are extremely efficient, making it no problem to use a portable music device to drive them sufficiently.In the end though, as much as I'd like to love them, it looks like all the care went into making a package they could sell to Star Wars fans rather than important things like long-term comfort and sound quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TJWW7F76Z24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IORDBR0#wasThisHelpful","R18TJWW7F76Z24","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Movie Studio before and found it effective and rock steady - version 13 is no different, though the learning curve can be a bit steep.Installation was a breeze and went quickly. Startup is relatively fast, and once in the program you're presented with  multiple ways to get started, tutorials, etc. Help bubbles are on by default, which is helpful.As far as functionality, the program just works. Once you get your head around how to use it (there are plenty of tutorials out there to help) the workflow makes sense and things move along quickly. It handles all relevant formats, including 4K video, which is fantastic. The included filters and plugins are extensive and useful, and really I can't see most users outgrowing this software unless you're moving into a professional setting.Then you've got music - which is a huge bonus. In addition to Sound Forge, which is an incredibly solid and useful music editing program, Acid Music Studio is included, which makes it relatively easy and fun to create your own music for your video projects.Frankly, I'm blown away by how much value is in this package - great video editing, audio editing, audio recording/creation and dvd authoring that would destroy far more expensive programs that were out only a few years ago. To get this package at this price is a steal, and I can recommend it wholeheartedly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNCA08Z4CSCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRQB28Y#wasThisHelpful","R1XNCA08Z4CSCX","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the deal: the period in McCartney's life from the Beatles break up to John's death has always had some mystery around it. I mean, we all know he was busted in Japan, we all know he was working on a record when he heard about John's death (and wrote one of his best pieces of music ever about his relationship with John - ""Here Today"" which is just heartbreaking), and we all know about the Wings mishegas. But beyond that, what was going on?This book provides the background that McCartney fans have been wondering about for years. Author Tom Doyle had conversations with McCartney for years in preparation for this book and it shows. He gained a level of trust from his subject that allowed him to provide an honest and revealing look at not only what happened, but what McCartney was feeling and thinking all those years.If you're a Beatles fan, particularly if you fall down on the McCartney side of thing, this book is fascinating.

"I've had some poor luck with suction cup holders, and had pretty much given up on them. Then the Arkon arrived, and my opinion changed (and my mood improved).This thing just works - which is really all I was looking for: something that will work on the windshield or dash, is easy to position, and will hold whatever phone I happen to be using with no issues. I've used it with my Galaxy S3, which I've since changed to an S5, and it held both perfectly, even with a TPU case on my S5.Easy on, easy off, holds stuff steady.

"UPDATE: After less than a year, this thing completely fell apart. Started with leaks at the ends, then spread to leaks throughout so bad that it no longer worked at all. JUNK.Original Review: I've always thought these lightweight expanding hoses were a gimmick that preyed on people like my mother-in-law: she'll buy anything, really, and went through a couple of these things with horrible results. And while that may be true of many of the hoses in this class, that has NOT been my experience with the Rumford.This thing has been fantastic since the day I got it. There is a procedure to using it of course, which some may not like: close the valve on the delivery end (a really well-made brass valve, not a piece of crap), then turn on the water at the source - allow the hose to pressurize and expand. After use, shut off the water source and open the valve to allow it to empty and contract again.Since we've had it, this thing was worked flawlessly, expanding to its full length and allowing me to get where I need to, while contracting to a tight and easily hung up size when I'm done: at last, I could throw away that crappy crank on wheels contraption that I kept my old-school hose on.The only downside is that when you extend it fully, then use it, the decrease in pressure can cause it to contract (and therefore shorten)  a bit, so the actual useable length isn't quite it's fully extended size. But that's a small complaint, and overall I love this thing. If you like the idea of an expanding hose, stay away from the crappy ones you see in front of the supermarket or at big box stores and jump right into this one: it's great.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FI5BYAPVUA74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HD55RA8#wasThisHelpful","R2FI5BYAPVUA74","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a new Samsung dishwasher that actually requires using a rinse agent, so getting my hands on Finish was great. It works as well or better than the other major player, allowing glasses and silverware to not only come out with greatly reduced spots, but lets us empty the dishwasher faster because things are dryer sooner.Some of the Circulon dishwasher-safe pots that I've cleaned still came out a bit spotty, but that's true of any rinse agent I've used.

"I received the wired version for review, so I cannot comment on the Bluetooth version, but the wired version is pretty good.While the trend these days is to overdrive bass (e.g. Beats by Dre), the Adaros for the most part avoid that trap. For me, that's a good thing; I was an engineer and producer and value flat and true to booming bass. This isn't to say the Adaros are totally flat, because they aren't: bass is boosted a bit and the mids and highs could be a bit smoother. But in today's market, these are among the best you can get in this price range.Comfort wasn't there for me though. I found the ear cups a bit small and hot, and the head band didn't have enough padding for me: it felt like something hard was pushing into the top of my head. A drag, because I'd love to use these when I go for a bike ride or long walk as they are easily efficient enough to be driven by an MP3 player or cell phone and blow away ear buds away.Which may well be why they get as many glowing reviews as they do: for people raised on those crappy ear buds, these things will be a revelation.Overall, they're fairly well built (though a replaceable cord would be nice) and sound pretty good for something in this price range. If comfort isn't an issue (I have a fairly large head) and you like the trend towards a fuller, accentuated bass sound but find Beats to be too much, give these a shot. However, if you want something that more accurately represents what the artist and producer intended and that are (in my opinion) more comfortable, check out the AKG K240s in the same price range.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22AYECKEW04D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4XMJ22#wasThisHelpful","R22AYECKEW04D6","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's not easy finding treats for our dog that aren't of questionable quality, so I was excited for her to try these; they're made with no artificial colors or preservatives, there's no sugar or grain in them, and they're made in the US, not in a questionable factory on the other side of the world.Of course, none of that means a thing if our dog dislikes them, but she LOVES them. They keep her busy for a while, too, though perhaps not as long as I would hope.She had no side effects other than blue-tinted poop, so she (and I) are really happy with them. The only downside is the price, which averages over $3.50 per treat and worth dinging a star for .

"The first thing to keep in mind when you're looking at this monitor is that although it's a 27"", the resolution, AT 1920 X 1080  isn't any better than on a good 24'. That's not a bad thing as long as you know it going in; you aren't going to be able to fit more information on the screen than any other (smaller physically) 1920 x 1080 screen. However, what you get is pretty darn nice.Clarity and color rendering are quite good. Not up to par for graphic design of course, but this wasn't built with that in mind. The screen is matte, not glossy, so it's resistant to reflections - I like this quite a bit. The screen tilts, but is NOT height adjustable, which is a bit of a drag, and the stand feels just a bit on the small side for the size of the monitor.Inputs are via VGA (a bit of a waste) and HDMI, which is the way I went and which netted a nice full HD picture. There is NO DVI in put, which can be an issue for some people and is a bit of a minus.If you need a super high-res monitor, or work with graphics and photos a lot, this isn't for you. But if you're looking for a nice, bright, clear 27"" monitor that does every day jobs quite well and at a bargain price, this is worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFLOYWDSMUHQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK0ERMW#wasThisHelpful","RFLOYWDSMUHQW","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second Powerline adapter kit, and I love it. We have a house that doesn't particularly like passing WiFi signals so, for example, my daughter's room is left in the cold. I used this adapter to replace an older one that was in her room that served to feed a second WiFi router, allowing her to have a network for her phone, computer and Roku box.Setup is quick and easy: plug it in to the two outlets, wait for them to connect, and plug in your Ethernet cables. I've had a fast and dependable connection since setting them up and anticipate no problems. I've also used them to connect a PS3 to my router via Ethernet, as the WiFi always seemed slow to me - connection speed and dependability improved immediately and substantially.If you need to add a new or extend your existing network, or need to get an Ethernet port to an electronic device nowhere near your router, this is a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UJ1BTFZ7YPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF8ZRPU#wasThisHelpful","R5UJ1BTFZ7YPX","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Frankly, I can't believe the quality manufacturers are pulling off at a reasonable price point. I've gone through quite a few audio interfaces in my day, and this is up at the top of those in my home studio -- and I've honestly never been a big fan of M-Audio in the past.It's solidly built and flexible. All inputs sound dead quiet, and the mic pres are pretty darn good. I'm not retiring my Joe Meek outboard pre yet (a personal love affair of mine), but if I didn't have it handy I'd have no issues using these phantom powered-equipped ones. The four inputs make this a great box for doing scratch recordings home or on location with a band as well, so I'm really not complaining.Finally, latency is next to nothing, which is a big, big deal for me (as, I suppose, it is for everyone). The Avid software that comes with it is useful for basic recording, though not, obviously, on a par with the major players in the space.But for the price, I can't see doing better.

"I've been spending quite a bit of time lately watching UK crime dramas. Sherlock, Luther, Broadchurch - all quite fantastic shows. So I was hoping for a bit more of the same with Jack Taylor. And it's good, but not quite as good as the others I've mentioned.Taylor is an ex-guard, fired for hitting a politician, with a drinking problem. While the cliches don't end with that initial premise, Iain Glen's portrayal of the flawed protagonist kept me watching through all three films, and I'm glad I did - the second and third installments were both better than the initial outing, which felt to be trying a bit to hard to define Taylor's character all at once, as opposed to letting it unfold naturally over time.But that's not too much to put up with for the payoff of a pretty good group of films. The settings are fantastic, it's well shot, and the I've always been a sucker for a characters that actually have human failings and struggles.In the end, Glen doesn't quite pull of amazing performance that David Tennants turned in as Alec Hardy, but Jack Taylor isn't Broadchurch either.

"I'm going to say right out that unlike many people, I prefer the Playstation controller shape to that of the Xbox, so going into this the SC-1 was at a disadvantage.  That said though, this wasn't a bad bit of kit, but it's not a total winner either.Right off the bat, you'll be disappointed to know this requires a dongle. For those that don't want to give up a USB slot, or have their PS3 positioned where a permanent USB stick could cause problems, this can be a bad thing. One past that though, it works pretty much like any other controller.Charge time is relatively quick, and the battery seems to last plenty long - perhaps not as long as my PS3 controllers' but it's fine.Construction is ok - not amazing, but not junk. Buttons and switches have a firm, positive feel and are easily controlled. I personally do not like the shape of the R1 and L1 buttons, but that's a personal matter.Turbo mode works fine, as does the limited macro programming (chaining together multiple moves and assigning them to a single button). However for me, I prefer to just play using my (limited) skill sets; if I can't win on my own, I'm OK losing.In the end, it's not a bad option for people who want an Xbox controller on their PS3, particularly if they'd enjoy the turbo feature. For me though, it's not my first choice. Perhaps I'm just used to the PS3 shape, but the design coupled with the lack of Bluetooth connectivity have kept this one in the controller storage box more often than not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQEZ196YGYYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B15EXJC#wasThisHelpful","R3TQEZ196YGYYD","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm new to the projector world, so I have no real way to compare this bad boy to other models, but I can say this: it is great.I've used it in the two environments one might expect: work and home, and it performed beautifully in both.It's light and easy to carry from room to room (or to head outside to the yard), as well as from home to office. Once in your destination, it's also easy to set up and get running. Horizontal, vertical and focus adjustments are all manual, but extremely easy to execute, and once in place you'll be ready to start in no time.The projector provides a decent range of inputs, though it is missing DVI, so computers without an HDMI output won't be able to run in 720P. However, for DVD players and computers that have an HDMI out, you'll be treated to a really wonderful picture. I've used it in office environments that weren't exactly dark, and the Epson provided plenty of brightness to get the job done.But it really comes alive at home - in a dark room this thing looks just great. I've used it in the living room and finished basement with great results, and last weekend set up an outdoor movie viewing party for my kids, using a screen borrowed from my cousin. Extremely impressive performance at a 10' screen size. In fact, it's been fantastic in every environment.The only downside is the lack of an audio output. While the built-in speaker is ok for some uses, a real stereo pair (or more) is pretty much necessary for a movie, so you'll have to use an audio out from your source.But that's a small tradeoff when the picture is this good. I'd ding it a half star for no audio out, but the rest of the package is so impressive that this has certainly earned a solid five star ranking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C60XVP5K9O1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EU9V3YO#wasThisHelpful","R1C60XVP5K9O1S","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a lot of Android phones, and while this isn't the very best, there are things about it I like more than any others I've had.To begin with, form factor is excellent. Compared to my Galaxy SIII, it's narrower - but that makes it far easier to hold and text one-handed - something I'm fond of doing. The back of the phone is also nicely textured, minimizing the chances I'll drop it (I've, um, dropped my GSIII due to it's slick and sexy back).Verizon bloatware is extreme though - and some of it caused a major problem for me until I updated it. One of the apps was failing and throwing error after error message (on screen, too - not some hidden file) that could not be cleared. Like I said, once I updated it, the problem stopped - but it should be noted that Verizon was NO HELP fixing this at all - they were utterly clueless about this phone. And once that was resolved, I was still stuck with a bunch of crappy software I didn't want and couldn't delete which is extremely irritating to me. Sadly, it's all too common these days.The screen is quite good when viewed head on, though it does lose some of it's color accuracy when viewed off-axis. Not a problem for me, but it may be an issue. It's quite bright though, and colors are strong, if a bit on the cool side. The high resolution in a smaller overall screen size may make for slightly smaller type, but it's also sharper than on my GSIII thanks to the smaller pixels. The glass is not up to the quality on my GSIII though - in what way is hard to explain, but it just never feels as smooth and clean. I had no overt issues with it however, and it cleaned up well and suffered no scratches during my time using it.Although the dual-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon chip is slightly underpowered compared to today's fastest phones, I found no issues starting up, opening apps, and running multiple apps. I had no problems with any of the apps I downloaded.Sound is better than I expected. Rather than using an open speaker port, the Hydro Elite transmits sound through the glass on the phone. I found no real downside here, and you actually CAN hear the thing if you're wearing a motorcycle helmet, or hat, or whatever. Very neat bit, that. External speakers for media are, of course, crap - but that's true of every phone I've ever heard, so take it with a grain of salt. Earphone volume, though, is extremely low. While not an issue with headphones, I can't come close to getting enough output for the Aux-in in my car (a total drag) to deliver music to my (admittedly on the loud side) liking.Kyocera runs a skinned version of Android (as almost ever phone on the market does), though I find it less intrusive than the interface on my GSIII. Odd, perhaps, as the GSIII has more bells and whistles, but then I don't really like gimicky features - I just want a phone that works and works well, which the Kyocera does (pretty much).Batter life, which I thought was a bit short, is actually longer than on my GSIII, so no complaints there. Finding spares is a bear though; I couldn't find any vendors that supplied them, so if you like to carry a spare, you're out of luck right now.The 8 MP camera is actually quite good - sometimes. Settings offerings are about average, with different focus, white balance and shooting modes (including color effect modes and HDR), and it often takes beautiful pictures. However, in tricky lighting situations (even mildly), it's totally hit and miss. While shooting a closeup of some soap I recently made, it kept adding an odd purple tinge in the middle of the shot (no, it wasn't a lens flare or smear). Irritating. The front-facing camera is fine - about average in class. One quick note here: you CAN turn off the camera click, which you can't (stock) on my GSIII. Yay Kyocera.Video quality is on par with stills, which is to say that sometimes it's quite good, but in any tricky lighting you're going to be gambling.Then there's the waterproof bit, which is really the meat and potatoes. In a work: excellent. I can't tell you how much I like not worrying about spilling a drink on the table, or leaving it out on a chair in the rain. Plus, it's fun to throw it in a sink of water in front of unsuspecting friends and family. I have submerged it, poured water all over it, even used it in the shower, and have had NO ill-effects. Plus, the chunkiness of the thing makes it feel sturdy enough that I feel far more secure carrying it than I do my GSIII.Frankly, the decision about which to carry is MUCH harder than I thought it would be. I really, really love a lot about this phone - in partiuclar, of course, it's ability to shower with me. But the occasional camera issues and low-level headphone output have me jumping back to my GSIII (particularly if I'm driving anywhere), which is where I'll probably stay. For now.A solid mid-range phone with a fantastic feature: it doubles as a shower buddy!Update 6/18/14 - This phone began having very strange issues after a while - wouldn't answer calls occasionally, odd software glitches, and the camera actually started to look worse. I've downgraded the rating accordingly and would recommend looking elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16WB8WYJDWGCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP2CAFW#wasThisHelpful","R16WB8WYJDWGCL","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this drive despite having had a few issues getting my head around how, exactly it's set up. Before proceeding I should mention that I've been working on computers and setting up most operating systems (including FreeBSD!) for about 2 decades.Setup in its most basic format is simple as pie: plug it into the wall, plug it into your router, look for it under network on your Windows PC. Easy - acts exactly like another drive, and you can use it from any computer on the network to backup or store files with no hassle at all.However, once you log into the system to check out settings and update firmware, things can get a little confusing. You're asked to set up a username and password for every computer on the network to use. OK - fine. But a folder is created with that user name, which appears alongside a folder named public. And thenceforth, to log onto the drive AT ALL from a local computer, you need to use that username and password - what's odd about that at first is that Public isn't actually public, as you need to log onto the drive to see it.Shortly though, it became clearer: once you set up ANY user at all, the entire drive in not accessible on the network without a password, EXCEPT via DLNA (or anonymous FTP - more on that below). So, in effect, the entire Public folder becomes the main media serving folder for the network, and accessible via any DLNA client. Getting onto the drive itself anywhere including Public requires a username and password.This allows setting up all Public media in one space to stream to devices, while allowing the addition of multiple users with private folders - once logged into the drive using one set of credentials, all that are accessible are the public and individual user folders. It's actually a pretty good way to set it up: the problem was that those details are spelled out exactly nowhere in docs with the drive, or on the Seagate website.Remote access via the Seagate website worked flawlessly, which was nice. It's easy to access any folders from any computer anywhere, as long as you set up a remote user and run the service on the drive. I'm curious about the security here (didn't have time to research it), as you actually log in through Seagate's site - until I know how that works I've turned the service off. But assuming it's entirely secure, it's a neat and easy-to-use feature that does not require you remember your home IP address.Both SFTP and FTP are available as well; using anonymous and a blank password will allow you access to the Public folder only, while using a username and password will drop you into that private folder and allow you to back out to see the entire file structure (assuming that the user has admin privileges).Transfer speeds could be faster. I was getting 10 - 13 MB/s average using Windows transfer and my wireless router as a hub. Yes, it could well have been the router, but I don't have a spare GB hub here to test, sorry. Noise level was extremely low though and was never bothersome at all.All-in-all though, it's an excellent and fairly good looking box that does exactly what I want it to while having a ton of flexibility for people with deeper skill sets. A great buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPS3XOGBNSDKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARB5FPM#wasThisHelpful","RPS3XOGBNSDKG","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping for a set of headphones that would be easy to pick up and use with my tablets and phone - perhaps a nice pair for in-bed movie viewing while my wife is asleep. Unfortunately, these ultimately missed the mark.Design is basic, with volume up/down, skip fwd/back and a Bluetooth button all on one side. Setup and connection were easy - I charged them quickly and paired them easily with three different phones and had no problems. Oddly, I could not find any indication of a right/left side on them though; I figured it out but when the skip buttons skipped in the wrong direction. Hint: controls go on the left.Sound quality is actually better than I was expecting - when these were in stock on Amazon I believe they were selling for only about $20. At that price, I was thinking they would be utter garbage, but to my surprise the sound wasn't torturous. My set did not have the buzz that others have complained about, and while the sound lacked detail and upper-mid to high-end clarity resulting in a bit of a boxy feel, overall it was better than I expected; I think that I'd have no problem using them for casual media usage. If I could stand to wear them for more than 10 minutes that is.They're just incredibly uncomfortable to me. While they're fully adjustable, the bar over the top of the head is incredibly under-padded, making it feel as if there's a hard piece of plastic pushing down on top of my head. Loosen them up so the bar doesn't touch and they just sag, of course. I simply could not find a position in which I could stand wearing them for more than 10 minutes, which was an extreme disappointment to me. It's worth mentioning that the ear cups were also made with low-quality padding and a cheap covering material, resulting in no joy for my ears, either - this, though, was a far less egregious ergonomic error, particularly at the price point I noted.In the end, while they certainly aren't studio-quality, the acceptable sound and Bluetooth would make them a steal at only $20. If only they were comfortable...","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HMRECHPUA12E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVYGGY0#wasThisHelpful","R1HMRECHPUA12E","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's not a lot to say in describing this: it's a thick, squishy rubber mat. But it really does make life easier when I'm standing in one position for an extended period of time.I have bad knees and a bad back (genetics can be pesky, can't they?), and find standing in place for too long can cause a fair amount of pain in those areas. But using this mat actually helps; and I was a real skeptic about it.I use it in the kitchen when cooking or doing dishes, but the real benefit comes in my work studio where I make soap. Soaping requires long periods of time blending, as well as lifting and pouring large quantities of oil. I've found that I have less general aches and pains in my back and knees after a long time at work while standing on this.Really, there's not much more to say: it's a simple tool that does a basic job, and it actually works for me. I've noticed absolutely no changes in thickness or springiness since I started using it either - in fact the ONLY issue I've had is that the ""Y"" in Stanley came off (they're actually thin black rubber stickers on top of raised yellow letters), but that certainly doesn't effect it's usefulness.A winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGN7E1C26JNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ9PVFM#wasThisHelpful","R3UGN7E1C26JNV","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea what to expect with this light, but I was hoping for something that would be a nice addition to the house (for me or my kids). However, between the build quality and the feature set, this has made its way into the pile of unused stuff in the garage.To begin with, it feels and looks cheap. That may not be an issue for some, but at this price I can't imagine anyone opening the box and feeling particularly good about the purchase. It's clearly a cheap Chinese import that's being re-sold as a supposedly high-end device. And looks are not entirely deceiving. The buttons have bad tactile feedback, and sometimes it's unclear if they've been pushed or not. While the menu system is pretty simple and easy to set up, the overall usage experience does not build much confidence.In actual use, I was not very impressed either. The gradual increase in light does work as advertised, starting dim and getting brighter, until it's at full brightness at your alarm time, at which point the alarm sounds begin. Theoretically, this would be the way to make it work, but the actual experience isn't great.To begin with, the selection of nature alarm sounds is terrible. You get a choice of three birds, all of which sound fake and distorted - they're annoying scrapey-scratchy-squeaky noises that make my skin crawl in the morning (and bum my dog out). Then, once the unpleasant noises wake you up, you're treated to the fun of looking into the sun while trying to find the button to turn the alarm off, thanks to having the membrane buttons directly above the blinding light. And if you're looking for a snooze feature, don't bother - there isn't one.The kicker is that I could tell no difference in how I felt after getting up using this alarm clock save one: I was irritated from dealing with the thing. I suppose it may have some value as a ""light therapy"" device, and perhaps some may find the limiting features, annoying design and poor construction worth it for an improvement in their wake-up routine, but I found no such value.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VV54R2HAOSTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QV2JPO#wasThisHelpful","R3VV54R2HAOSTU","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is about my tenth laptop, but my first 17"", and I'm very happy. Before I go on with why, I just want to make one point about the size - it's big. Not heavy and fat (see below) but just... big. As in: I have three different backpacks designed to carry a laptop, and this won't fit in ANY of them. If you're looking for easily portable, look at 15"" and smaller. If you're looking for a great desktop replacement and don't mind using a briefcase-style laptop case (or larger than standard laptop backpack) to transport it, read on.First of all, despite my comment above, it's lighter than I thought: under 6 pounds with the battery, which is surprising indeed, and it's fairly thin, at about an inch. The charger is also reasonably-sized, which makes the entire package easy (relative to other 17"" units of course) to travel with.The case itself is great - I love the textured finish on it, and it feels extremely sturdy and well-built. There is no latch to keep the laptop closed, instead relying on a hinge that requires both hands to open it. I prefer this setup: I like just popping it open. The finish continues on the inside on the palm rest, and I really like it; it's very comfortable and stays cool.In fact, the whole thing stays cool - quiet too. I truly dislike loud fans spinning up and making a racket almost as much as I dislike burning my lap with computer/heater. But despite having a sufficiently fast chip, this laptop never gets irritating in either department.The screen is quite good, or at least as good as you're going to get without going to an IPS or equivalent screen. I'm usually unhappy with most laptop screens, but this ranks at or near the top of the class.Keyboard quality is excellent: keys have good action and are generously spaced, making typing or using the number pad easy and comfortable. There's a full compliment of media control keys as well (start/pause, skip fwd, skip back, vol up/down) which I appreciate - I hate having to go to a mouse or touchpad to skip tracks.The touchpad is average, with the usual compliments of multitouch, including two-finger scrolling up/down and right/left, plus gestures designed to mimic the gestures one would use on a Windows 8 touchscreen laptop: swipe all the way right to left, the charms pop up, left to right switches between running programs, top to bottom is like a right click, giving the menu and options for the program you're in. For the most part, it accurately reads touches and swipes, though it's not quite as consistent as the best I've used.Battery life was sufficient for me, but not stellar: maybe 3-4 hours. This isn't such a bad thing though: as it's a 17"" screen, it's really not the unit I'd choose to run around with all day - it's really more of a desktop replacement that you can cart from home to work, or set up at your hotel when you're on the road. Thus, I have it plugged in as often as not.On-board audio is OK, but not great. No matter what these manufacturers claim, laptops are never going to sound great. I use Bluetooth to connect to an external rig, or headphones if I'm away from my desk.An full set of modern ports is included: 2 USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0 ports, an Ethernet port, HDMI out, an 8-in-1 card slot and a headset port in which either a combined mic/headphone or headphone-only rig will work. Of course there's also a DVD reader/writer for installing software and burning DVDs or CDs.I've touched on performance, but want to expound just a bit. I find performance excellent, as long as I'm not asking it to do what it really isn't meant to do. Booting is reasonably fast (it's only got a 5400 RPM drive), and restore from sleep is quick.Program performance as well as base operating system performance are both snappy - I can switch between multiple programs with no lag, and Office 2013 loads fast and runs flawlessly. So for an office desktop that you can move from place to place, this is great (and, in fact, what I've been using it for as I've been starting a new business across town). However, this is no gaming computer, and certainly not designed for things like digital audio (where the slower hard drive would hobble it anyway).Of course this comes loaded with Windows 8, which I'm not totally sold on, and there's no easy way to ""downgrade"" to Windows 7 - one of my only complaints here. I am getting used to it though, and wouldn't ding my review because Microsoft's latest OS is a bit of a let-down.So, bottom line, what we have here is a very fast (for its intended use), light and thin (for a 17"" screen) laptop that has great build quality and makes a fantastic office desktop replacement - and the entire package comes in at under $550. It's an excellent value that would have been unheard of not so long ago, and a laptop that I can easily recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ENDU8SC7N5Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRGJDD0#wasThisHelpful","R2ENDU8SC7N5Y3","A3SX5MZTCZRQLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SX5MZTCZRQLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jeepers! The sound delivered by these gamer headphones is amazing. Watch out – if you turn them up really loud they even vibrate a little. It makes you feel like you are at a rock concert standing in the front row about six feet from the stage.Of course, you shouldn’t listen to anything that loud – not for long, anyway – because it can damage your ears and hearing. But I trust your good common sense in that regard.Excellent bass tones and sweeping, scintillating highs. For the price range of this set, the sound it delivers is way more than your money’s worth. If you are using this for gaming, put your bigger cash into your games and get this relatively inexpensive set to handle your sound.However, the incredible sound these bad boys deliver is not the only feature about this gamer-oriented headset with microphone that I found to be terrific.Let me be clear: These must be the most comfortable headsets I have ever tried on!I asked myself: Why can’t all headphone makers go with a design like this? The dual band bridge construction is highly flexible and light weight – you could wear these things for hours and never get that fatigued feeling of something irritating your head and ears.The microphone is so well hidden into the design that, at first, I almost thought it didn’t have a microphone. It’s built into the left earcup and slides out or “flips down” to position just right toward your mouth – it’s not in the way, but gives your voice perfect access.I own four other Sentey headphone models – three of them Bluetooth and one other cord-jack model. I can tell you from experience that it’s a good brand, and they have responsive customer service.One last note: When you plug this set into your computer via the USB jack, they light up with a high-tech looking blue light. It’s cool.So it’s all good. Note that I received this particular set free in exchange for a 100% honest, objective and unbiased field test and review. My 100% honest opinion is that these Sentey Gaming Headset Microphone Artix Black Gs-4561 are a no-baloney honest-to-goodness great deal on a set of headphones for gaming, or listening to music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JNHIJRE02W5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","R3JNHIJRE02W5X","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a basic, good quality belt.The craftsmanship is solid, the stitching is firm and the materials would seem to be tough and strong, yet comfortable -- after you break it in for a week or two. It's a bit stiff at first, but that's okay because it's a solid product. The heavy-gauge metal of the buckle is more than adequate, in my opinion.I like the fact that the holes are reinforced behind with a narrow, extra strip of leather. That means these holes will wear well and remain firm for a long time. Positive points in that regard!It's wide, but not too wide -- I measure it at exactly 1.5 inches wide. The length, not including buckle, is 45 inches. The buckle itself is 2-and-a-quarter inches across.I see little not to like, and after wearing it for about 10 days, it's absolutely fine. I think this belt will be even better when it wears in and  softens a bit after some use -- but all in all, the price is quite reasonable, and I think for around $10 you're getting a slightly better belt than you might expect at that price.I received this belt for free in exchange for a fair and honest review. My honest opinion is that this is a good quality belt, and I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5H68US4BEQW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R9XTJM#wasThisHelpful","R5H68US4BEQW0","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s often the simple things in life that bring us the most pleasure – case in point, this basic back and body scrubber will not only exfoliate your skin, but also go a long way toward reducing the stress of a long day as you enjoy a hot bath or shower.The product is well constructed and the materials are of sufficient high quality, in my opinion, to make for a lasting scrubber that will give you many sessions of cleansing, relaxing pleasure.You get a soft side of terry cloth and a looped scrubber on the other side which is just textured enough to give your skin a vigorous treatment, without harshness or causing redness.If you have extra-sensitive skin, don’t worry. This loofah will treat you with some real TLC.Note that that the loofah also ships with a matching oval scrubber pad that fits easily in your hand. The primary loofah has a soft rope that makes it very easy for you to get this around to get your whole back, and any other part of your body.This price is reasonable, and this product delivers exactly that it promises, and thus I give it the full five stars, and please note I received a free sample in exchange for a 100% honest, object and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZHJ1Z5TLR3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131MHXIA#wasThisHelpful","R2SZHJ1Z5TLR3E","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is much to like about these basic, well-functioning Bluetooth headphones that are affordable, deliver decent sound, including good-enough bass and clear and crisp high tones.This is the kind of set you want for basic daily use at a price that won’t bust your budget. They are simple to use and reliable.  I like the big button “on-off” switch on the right earpiece – you don’t have to fumble to find it.The look of the phones in my view is just a tad “blah” but this is a total a nonissue for me. Other may like the muted, understated blue-black color scheme. For me, it’s all about the sound, easy function and reliability. I don't care if my Bluetooth devices have ""bling"" or ""flash"" in terms of looks.Speaking of reliable, these will fit in any ear well because it comes with interchangeable ear tips sizes and bands to help you secure and anchor the buds to your ears. So whether you are just sitting at your desk, or getting in a job or workout at your health club, these will stay in your ears as you enjoy your favorite music, audio books, or whatever.I know the signal is good to at least 20 feet, and maybe further.All in all – a solid product at a good price. I can recommend them without reservation.

"I have a lot of different kinds of Bluetooth headsets, from the cheapest “low-end” earbuds to the “higher-end” sophisticated models, and I can tell you that these Sentey V4.0 are not only a fantastic deal for the price, but they also deliver high quality sound that left me impressed.In short, I love these headphones. I would gladly recommend them to anyone. Again, for fifty bucks, these headphones give you a “high-end” listening experience, with a lot of other functional capabilities thrown in to boot – from built in microphone, incredible 15-hour battery life, handsome look, terrific carrying case, obvious high-quality construction, and they look slick.Oh yeah, and they’re comfortable on your head and covering your ears. You get great sound channeled to your ears while outside noise is effectively blocked out.To be sure, I compared these headphones carefully and side-by-side with at least a dozen other Bluetooth models I own. (Three of the others are also Sentey products!) think these are the best.If you love a lot of heavy bass, these phone have that – but you don’t sacrifice some tingling, scintillating highs.One of the aspects I like best about this set is the volume – it goes way up. A lot of headsets actually limit how loud you can tune up, but these allow you some leeway to go as loud as you might dare. I know, I know, listening to really loud music can be dangerous to your ears and can result in hearing loss, but I’ll trust that each one of you is responsible enough to use good common sense in this regard. I like having the option to go a little louder than perhaps I should go, just every once and a while.Pairing was easy and effortless and glitch-free with all my devices, from HP laptop to Kindle Fire and all else.The packaging is attractive. The oval-shaped carrying case is sleek, strong and terrific. That’s one of the factors that will make this a great gift. Unboxing it gives you the impression that your getting a gift that will be really nice, and it’s something you actually want! (Not socks, or a another necktie!)I can’t think of any downside to your consideration of this item. Certainly, you can find all kinds of Bluetooth models for less than $50 – but if you want to start getting into high end sound and comfort without spending more than a hundred bucks, (or hundreds), then get these. It’s just a great deal.Please note that I received these headphones free in exchange for a 100% honest, unbiased and completely objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CXBFJA7HO2QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRK7VU#wasThisHelpful","R3CXBFJA7HO2QF","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This scarf is a lovely, elegant item that is at once understated, yet fashionable enough to complete that warm winter look you are going for – depending in your sense of style. It’s all about personal choice, of course, and if this is the look you’re going for, well, you’ll be well pleased.This is a scarf that looks like something a wonderful grandmother would knit for you personally because she wants you to stay warm on a chilly day, and also show a bit of chic panache.It is incredibly soft and won’t itch or feel scratchy at your throat, or when it touches your face.The item ships and comes to you enfolded on its own hanger with Velcro to help secure it, so it’s easy to hang up in your closet, or coat rack pegs.The colors are somewhat understated, yet I really think the bright red provides just the right about of “flash” if you want to make just a bit of a statement. This is also a terrific holiday look.The price is right for an item that is well put together and really looks hand-made with care and personal attention.You’ll be warm, cozy and look great. What’s not to love?Please note I received this item free in exchange for an objective, honest and unbiased review based on actual “in-the-field” test of the product.

"This is an okay light that is priced inexpensively and it functions as promised. In short, it gets the job done for what you want it to do, and so I give it 5 Stars.I use it to mostly to chop wood in the dark. I live in a remote region of extreme northern Minnesota where it gets dark early in the winter, and it seems like I am always a bit behind in getting my firewood split up for our bitter cold winter days and nights.I always tell myself that I am going to get all my wood split and stacked during the warm summer months, but you know the way life goes. There is always so much else to do when the weather is warm and nice.EXCELLENT STRAP DESIGNOne of the best things about this item is the well-designed three-pronged strapped that makes for a secure, comfortable hit on your head. It won’t shake or fall off. It’s adjustable so it will fit any head.MULTI-FUNCTIONThe light also has several modes of function. First, you can make the beam “zoom in tight” or spread out for wide dispersal of the light. All you have to do is pull out the lens, or push it back in. No fumbling around.It also has bright mode, a dim mode and a flashing mode. Just “click, click, click” the power button and it moves you through each mode.It raps out at 50 lumens in the bright mode, so this is plenty bright enough for any situation.EASY TILTYou can easily tilt the light up or down to get the light to shine it just where you want.PRICE IS RIGHTI own several of these kinds of head-mounted utility lights – one of them is a $35 model – and that one is far superior to this one. I won’t elaborate, except to say that sometimes you get what you pay for.However, if you don’t want to spend a lot of money, and just want a basic light that gets the job done, I can heartily recommend this inexpensive and simple light that works great.Please note I received this item free in exchange for an honest, objective and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7AJYHL8N5WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","RO7AJYHL8N5WD","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, it’s a real challenge to review these headphones because so many variables come into play.I’ll talk about all that, but just let me jump to my overall conclusion: I rate them 4-Stars.This is an item that has so much going for it:• Super high quality construction.• Solid design that is sleek and modern.• Comfortable fit on over the head and on the ears.• Foldable and easy to store, carry, travel with.• Rich, elegant look. Stainless steel and painted black rubber.• Comes in attractive carrying case and packaging.• Would be a great gift.So why do I detract one star? Well, the reason is somewhat ironic. It’s because I own another pair of headphones made by this same company – Sentey – and those headphones have vastly superior sound.The issue for me is that I compared this non-Bluetooth, (cord-jack-connection only) set side-by-side with the Sentey Bluetooth Headphones V4.0 – the Bluetooth version blows away this jack-enabled version.When you consider that both units are being offered for the same price (as of this review) – both at $49.99, it makes me wonder why go with this corded headphones when you can enjoy the tether-free version for the same price, and with much better sound.Don’t get me wrong – I would call the sound deliver of this model as “adequate.” But again, when you do a side-by-side comparison with the Sentey Bluetooth model, I mean, there is just no comparison.Or, you could look at it this way: This set of headphones is excellent for all other uses besides music, such as pairing them with your smartphone or for other voice and non-music uses. They sound is crisp and clean. But they just don’t have the bass – and the volume – of the Sentey Bluetooth V4.0.It is agonizing for me to detract a star because, overall, this is such a beautiful, well-constructed and well-packaged product. These come out of the box looking easily like a $100 -- $150 set of headphones. So at about fifty bucks, it’s a decent buy.If you are a bass fanatic, and like to turn up the volume dangerously loud, these are not the phones for you. But this is a nice, high quality, well-built headset that will give years of faithful use – if it were me, I would use these around the office while doing business, talking on the phone, or listening to meditative sounds, such as binaural beats, etc. When I want to kick back with some excellent music, I switch to the Sentey Bluetooth model.Please note that I received this item free in exchange for a 100% honest, objective and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CIVC190EWOOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R3CIVC190EWOOI","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating this little keyboard has been a very tough call for me.For the most part, I think it is a slick little item – incredibly lightweight, slim, and attractive. I like the snappy feel of the keys. It’s small, but not too small to make for uncomfortable typing. It paired effortlessly with all my devices. I was soon typing away, unfettered and free of cords and cables.NEEDED REPLACMENT: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICEHowever, first one I received was buggy. It worked, but it tended to have some occasional minor problems. For one thing, the indicator lights for the “power,” “Bluetooth” etc., seemed to have a life of their own. For example, the pad could be fully operational even when the power light was off.Sometimes the Bluetooth light indicator kept flashing all the time, even though the pairing was working okay. There was also an occasional blip in the keystrokes – displaying the wrong character, etc.So I emailed the company, and their customer service was beyond excellent. They immediately sent out a replacement, which I had just two days later. The new tablet works just fine in all respects.IMPORTANT NOTE:The instruction say the keypad comes with a “PU Leather Stand Case.” It DOES NOT. I asked the company about this, and they said: “The instruction manual is out of date. The item no longer ships with a leather stand.”MY OVERALL FEELINGAfter testing two of these keyboards, my impression is that, if the one you get works fine, you’ll have a terrific keyboard that should do what you want it to do. Great for traveling, for example, and using with your smartphone or tablet.However, in reading many other reviews, and testing the product myself, my impression is that this product may have a likelihood of being “buggy” or “glitch-prone.” But if you get a lemon, I’m sure the seller will make good on it and give you another.The price is very reasonable. So I’m going with 4-Stars based on all of the above – it may be a 5-Star for some – and for others, it may be “less than.”The only thing I remain uncertain about at this point is how long this item will last – can it take “millions of keystrokes” like the manufacturer says?

"This is a surprisingly nice set of sunglasses that comes with a set of four extra lenses in addition to the primary set, for a total of five interchangeable lens choices of different color and shades.The design is rather unique, unlike any other sunglasses I have seen.The feature that really struck me is an inner frame just inside the primary lenses -- it's really a terrific idea. It adds a sense of stability and comfort that has to be felt to be appreciated. Trying these on feels immediately great on the face.This clever ""inner frame"" gives you a feeling of confidence that you are wearing a solid piece of equipment on your nose, and that your eyes are protected by more than just blocking light.SO YOU GET:1 frame5 pair of colored lenses1 adjustable strap1 cleaning cloth1 soft pouch case1 Hard CaseComplete instructions.The hard case is solid and attractive, about seven inches long, and just over four inches wide. It's about two and one-quarter inches thick. It opens and closes with a smooth-glide zipper.The hard case is important for storing your extra lenses as well as the shades themselves. It contains tight-fitting slots for each extra lens set. That way you can't lose them, and they won't get scratched up just sitting around. You also won't lose them if you keep them snug in their case.Of course, you can use the soft case or ""pouch"" for carrying these around when you're ""on the go.""The lenses are of five different colors: black, clear, yellow, blue and mirror.It will take you a bit of practice to get the hang of removing the lenses and switching in the others. You might find yourself pulling quite hard -- but just take it easy and use a firm steady motion and don't force anything. A little practice makes perfect. Follow the instructions provided and noodle around and I know you will get the lens removal/attachment process down. It's not rocket science.The most important thing is that this set does an excellent job of blocking out the harsh light of the sun -- and also gives you many choices based on how bright or dull the weather in on any particular day.THE BOTTOM LINE:I say that, for twenty bucks, this is an extremely good deal on a ""low end"" that almost seem like ""high end"" set of very cool looking shades that I think any one will find excellent for day-to-day use.Why spend $100, $300 or $500 (and more) for one of those ""Big Name"" brands when you can get these for twenty bucks -- if you're like me, you tend to lose your shades easily, or sit on them, or forget them somewhere -- I say cheap and good is the way to go.As I said, these shades are almost like a high-end set for a fantastic price, so even if you break or lose them, you're out only a Jackson.Please note I received this set free in exchange for an honest, objective and unbiased test and review process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUU4CKQ07MHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015LVJIXW#wasThisHelpful","R1GUU4CKQ07MHN","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually a difficult product to review. On the one hand, for the low price and the simple or ""cheap"" thrill the product delivers, I could easily see giving these tattoo sleeves a 4- to -5 Star review.On the other hand, this is not a super-high quality item. Do they really look like real tattoos? Not in my opinion. The lights in the room have to be pretty dim to fool anyone into thinking you have a real ""arm sleeve"" tattoo.The feel of the sleeve is similar to a woman's nylon stocking, I guess. They also tend to ""run"" like a nylon, similar to the old kind of nylons that women once wore more commonly. (Do women still wear nylons? I'm clueless).But, anyway, I know my niece wore these as part of her Halloween costume and loved them for that purpose.So the bottom line is, these fake tattoo arm sleeves are a certain amount of fun for a very low price. In that sense, it is a great deal. But if you are expecting to fool anyone into thinking you have a real tattoo even for five minutes, you are not likely to achieve that goal with these.I grant 3-Stars overall. It's a tough call. For the price, they might be 4 or 5-Star, as long as you know what you're getting.Please note I received a free sample in exchange for a review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBX2JH3NZ4XE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI8J276#wasThisHelpful","R1VBX2JH3NZ4XE","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I do when I get a bag of ginger like this is open it up and stick my nose in -- you can tell the quality of an excellent ginger if you get that definite ""ginger blast"" that is really ""gingery"" but perhaps not overpoweringly so.This ginger product passed my ""big whiff"" test with flying colors. It's almost like aroma therapy. Wow, this is some really nice ginger.One of my favorite things to use ginger for is cooking a Thai dish, such as a ginger-chicken stir fry. I used two big tablespoons, and I hit it just right. I felt like I was enjoying an authentic Thai dish that didn't taste like some generic premix powder.This ginger is very finely ground, very ""powdery"" so be careful -- I think you can use a lot less of this than a lower-grade brand because the taste really comes forward easily. You don't want too much of a good thing when it comes to ginger flavor.I can't wait to try this spice in a variety of recipes, especially some baked creations, such as cookies.

"This book purports to tell of true events of extraordinary paranormal happenings in a remote region of Utah. The author grants that slight fictional elements have been employed for the sake of telling the story more smoothly.Just a few years ago I would have been mostly skeptical of the strange events described here, but subsequent study and research, including conducting my own personal investigations of similar claims, lead me to conclude that all or most of this is likely true – it all really happened.Telling his story through a ghostwriter, a retired career military man takes a job as a security guard on some property in northern Utah, a 500-acre plot which is owned by none other than Bob Bigelow.If you are a dyed-in-the wool UFO junkie (like me) you will know that anything associated with the name of billionaire Bob Bigelow is inextricably tied to the endlessly multifaceted, layers-deep and conspiracy-infested universe of ufology, government black-ops and secret space programs.The book reports that Bigelow purchased the 500-acre cold, dusty property in northern Utah precisely because of its reputation as a UFO hot spot, not to mention centuries of reports (including a rich legacy of Native American lore/religion) telling of bizarre phenomenon, from orbs and strange energy manifestations, to bizarre creatures sighted moving in and out of portholes to alternate dimensions.Let me just say that the hero of our story in this book has many occasions to encounter much of the above in his job a night watchman on the grounds of this freakishly-haunted property.I won’t go into more details of what this guy encountered because I don’t want to issue a spoiler alert, except to say I was intrigued and did not expect what the “main event” of his experience turned out to be.I am delighted when a book of paranormal phenomenon can surprise me and deliver something beyond all the standard stuff – UFOs, ghosts, Bigfoot — we’re accustomed to reading about. The idiosyncratic nature of the events described here and a rich detailing of the smaller incidentals add to the credibility of the narrative.This book is available as a Kindle Unlimited selection, so if you subscribe to that, this is a good chance to get it for a fast read. It took me only a long evening to breeze through from first page to last. The quality of the writing is quite good – a no-nonsense clear and lucid style just tells the tale, while also putting us into the scenes effortlessly with minimal but vivid description of landscapes and the other minor players, all of whom come alive as “characters” taking part in the strange events.Erick T. Rhetts is the pseudonym of a guy who has produced a number of similar titles on similar topics. Some simple Internet sleuthing reveals to me that Mr. Rhetts is freelance writer located in Patchogue, New York. He claims authorship of this book on his LiknedIn Page under his real name, which I will let anyone here investigate for themselves if they are dying to know.Whatever the case and whomever the author, this is a worthy little gem to add to your collection of titles exploring bizarre phenomenon and paranormal topics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJ7RARJGOGI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY5F4FY#wasThisHelpful","R1PJ7RARJGOGI2","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My ""acid test"" for a great cinnamon is how well it does in two of my recipes: My homemade apple pie and zucchini bread. The quality cinnamon can make or break these two favorites.This organic Ceylon Cinnamon distributed by Kazu passed with flying colors.My apple pie was infused with that rare combination that delivers a definite ""cinnamony"" taste without overpowering with the sensation of being too spicy.The aroma of this cinnamon when I was mixing it with the melted butter of my pie filling was heavenly. Sampling some crunchy pre-cooked apples coated in a mixture of cinnamon, sugar, butter and nutmeg is an exquisite taste sensation.My zucchini bread recipe also turns heavily on the quality of the cinnamon. It can either ""get lost"" in the other ingredients, or enhance and bring out the rest. The zucchini in zucchini bread is basically neutral in flavor, so you want the cinnamon to deliver a punch, without taking over the whole taste regime.This spice is very finely ground -- it's powdery -- and that tends to mean you get a deeper, more integral sensation of the cinnamon. I also feel good about this product because it is organic and free of unwanted chemicals, pesticides, etc.This brand is clearly a cut above the average or generic cinnamon you'll find in any grocery store. It's probably one of the highest quality spices I've worked with in some time.Please note that I received a free sample in exchange for an unbiased, objective and honest review of this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34I1Z1KILG1RP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125P6EDY#wasThisHelpful","R34I1Z1KILG1RP","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This remarkable little camping light proves that a BIG LIGHT can come in a SMALL PACKAGE. This item just barely fills up the palm of the average hand, but easily lights up an entire room.Inside a small tent, the entire interior would be filled with light.I have reviewed three or four camping lanterns here in recent months and, while the others are nice, I have to say this one is by far the brightest, and the one I would choose to take with me if trapped on a desert island and if I could only bring along one light. (Especially if I had a way to charge it with solar, but this light does not have solar capability. That would really make it amazing).COMPACT AND LIGHTThe item is so small and light-weight it adds net to nothing to the load you have to carry around while camping or hiking. This will fit easily into any pouch on a backpack, and can even be shoved into a pants pocket in a pinch.SOLID AND WATERPROOFThe light is solid and well constructed. It's made of heavy, durable plastic -- and oh yes -- it is waterproof! That's a terrific bonus, in my opinion.MULTIPLE LIGHT FUNCTIONThe light has five modes:Press the button once and a small indicator light comes onPress twice and you get the full blast of bright white light that disperses widely.Press three times and you get a dimmer light that uses less battery power.Press four times and you get a slow flashing light.Press five times and you get a rapid strobe light.Press again and the light turns off.HANDY HANGING CLIPThere is a very small clip in the back that folds flat to the surface, or can be turned out to either prop up the light or hang it on something. The clip uncouples in the middle so you can more easily fit it around or hang it on a hook, or wherever.RECHARGEABLE INTERNAL BATTERYThis light has a built-in 1800mAh lithium battery that cranks out 180 lumens at maximum.The battery is recharged with a provided USB cable. You can use your computer, or a one of those plug in chargers with a USB port to give it more juice.BURNS FOR HOURSI know the light will burn at least 4-5 hours on a charge at maximum brightness, and certainly longer on the dim setting.THE BOTTOM LINE: CALL ME AMAZEDI can's say enough good things about this little but powerful camping lantern. I absolutely love it. It's a home run and gets my very top recommendation.

"So far so good -- this LED chandelier bulb is working flawlessly in a handing lamp with three outlets above our kitchen table.It casts a sufficiently bright light, and because LED lights are extremely stingy on power-usage, I feel much better about burning this bulb than I do more standard models. Saving electricity is extremely important for one's budget, but also for environmental reasons. I like to feel good about using the most efficient products in terms of power usage. That's why I like this bulb.I have read in a lot of other reviews that there have been problems with flickering or incidents of ""going dead,"" but all I can say is that the bulb has been performing solidly for almost three weeks now.Certainly, a test of two to three months will be a much better indicator of the quality of this bulb, so stay tuned and come back here for updates.For now, I'm giving this 5 stars, with the understanding that my test is ongoing, and I will keep readers updates if I encounter any future problems.I should also say the item arrives in time and was well packaged in a study plastic cylinder, and that the company contacted me a few days after I received the bulb to check on my satisfaction.

"I've always gasped with amazement at some people who pay hundreds of dollars, and yes, even thousands of dollars for a pair of sunglasses.I know there is a popular brand (I won't name it here) that sells a pair made of carbon fiber with a titanium spine -- they cost $4,000! What if you accidentally sit on them? Or forget them at the bus stop? What if they get stolen at the beach? Yikes!No, I'm more the kind of guy who likes to pay twenty bucks for a decent, serviceable set of shades for daily use. At that price, these Ponosoon 819 Polarized Sports Sunglasses are a sensible choice and good deal. They even look good.They come with five interchangeable lenses, and a few other extras, too. That includes a solid carrying case, a very nice silky-black tote sack and an ""antiskid"" rope to hang the glasses around your neck.These glasses feel solid on my face. They are tightly constructed and are made of a fairly high-grade plastic.I must say they don't exactly have the feel pf a high-end set of sunglasses -- I mean, they are NOT dollar-store cheapy in ""feel"" -- but they definitely don't feel like a expensive custom fit set of glasses either. They're fine.But I really like the way the bows hug my face snugly, and the rubberized nose grip gives a real a feeling of security -- these won't fall off you face, even when doing strenuous activities, such as playing a rough game of volleyball on the beach, or riding your bike or motorcycle.Again, for the price, this is an excellent deal. I was leaning toward 4-Stars, but after wearing these Ponosoon's around for a couple of days, I'm comfortable with giving them 5-Stars -- and especially because of the price. For around $20, this set with five different lenses is a good choice for anyone who doesn't want to spend north of $50 or $100 for a pair of shades.Please note I received this item free in exchange for an honest, objective and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38KBHKP3YVKHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOAMULY#wasThisHelpful","R38KBHKP3YVKHO","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing when I received this bag of turmeric spice is give it the ultimate test: I put a raw teaspoon of it on my tongue, and then closed my mouth to get a sense of the full flavor.My judgement is that this is an excellent spice, a definite cut above the average or ""generic"" turmeric you buy in any grocery store.This organic and imported turmeric from Kazu has an authentic taste. It's bolder, more pungent, fragrant and the flavor goes deep. For serious cooks who really want to capture the true sense of an authentic Indian, Sri Lankan or Mideast dish, this is the spice you should choose.HEALTH BENEFITSI am also convinced of the health benefits that turmeric delivers as a bonus to the avid spicy food fan. Turmeric contains a substance called curcumin, which is an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties.Solid scientific tests show that turmeric can even be a substitute for some drugs. It can help treat chronic hepatitis, colorectal cancer, diabetes, and high cholesterol. (As always, consult your doctor before changing any medications you are taking right now, or even adding tumeric to your diet as a raw supplement).Turmeric is part of the ginger family. Cooking with turmeric is an acquired skill, and it may take a lot of experimentation on your part to find out just how you like to use this flavor and in what dishes.But have no doubt, when you find recipes that call for turmeric, you could do no better than select this brand. It's absolutely excellent.Please note that I received a free sample of this spice in exchange for an honest, unbiased and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DKAN3UVVYUUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125EHCMM#wasThisHelpful","R1DKAN3UVVYUUU","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a silky-luxurious eye mask that will feel as soft as an angel's wing resting across your eyes. Additionally, a gentle lavender scent will calm your senses and give you a feeling of blissful relaxation.It sounds like a bit of paradise, and I think for many, or most people, it will be. It's a lovely item.For some, this might be slightly less than a 5-Star item because of some minor factors -- they may be minor -- but to be thorough in my review, I'll mention them.First, because this eye pillow has no straps, you can only use it while lying flat on your back. It will fall off as soon as you roll over. This might be a drawback for some.I found the lavender scent just right, but my wife thought is a bit overpowering. If you are one of those people who just can't stand scented items, such as some laundry soaps and fabric softeners, you may not like the scent too much. The scent fades over time, however, and if you heat and cool the item.I'm going to settle on 4 Stars with the understanding that others might easily consider this a 5-Star item.

"I was all set to rate these glasses as a 3-Star item, but then my wife tried them and said, ""I love them!"" Darn! what to do now?Here's what's good:The item delivers on its promise. It allows you to lie down and read a book without having to lift your head or crane your neck to see your book. Obviously, this is also a good way to watch a video on your Kindle to favorite computer tablet.The glasses are also well constructed. It's a solid item with decent-grade plastic that is well put together, and which will  last a long time under normal use.The mirror-lenses are also of a very high, reflective quality that delivers a clear and sharp image of what you are viewing.They are comfortable to wear -- and the really do work well. You can be much more comfortable sitting or lying in bed as you read. Your hands and arms won't get tired holding up your book or tablet, and you won't have to bend your neck to watch TV.MY PROBLEM IS ...The catch for me is that I already where prescription eye glasses, and I can't see or read a thing without them. The problem is that I have to slide these Lazy Glasses on over the top of my regular glasses, and this creates a less--than-comfortable situation for me.First, it's slightly cumbersome wearing two sets of glasses because they may pinch your nose and bump against your face in an irritating way.Second, when you wear these glasses over the top of your normal glasses, it creates just a bit of space between your eyes and the mirrors that help you see at a 90-degree angle -- in short, for this renders these glasses far less effective. For me, it caused eye strain that I just can't withstand.That's why I was going to give it 3-Stars. For a person who wears no regular eyeglasses, this is a useful and helpful item. My wife would give them 5-Stars. If you need to wear your regular glasses while you read or watch, these may not work so well.So I am going to compromise between my 3-Star judgement and my wife's 5-Star rating and settle at 4-Stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XEG5KFWMQY0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01676VTK0#wasThisHelpful","R1XEG5KFWMQY0H","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mankind’s never-ending search for the perfect set of headsets never rests.That search is also my search. Thus, I was eager to test this Soundpeat Q800 addition to a field that is crowded with makes, models and competitors.My judgement: Well, these are darned nice. If they’re not the ultimate, perfect design for a set of Bluetooth headsets, they offer enough perks and benefits to get a high rating from me.Here’s why I like them:• Big, easy-to-find volume controls – most Bluetooth headphones have tiny, hard-to-find and manipulate volume controls, but these have big raised buttons in the shape of “plus” and “minus” signs. You can easily find these buttons in the dark, such as when you are resting in bed in the dark, listening to an audio book, music or meditative tones. There’s little or no fumbling around, or a need to turn on the lights to find the volume controls or skip button. You can ""feel"" the ""Plus"" and ""Minus"" with your fingertips without looking at them. So these would also be great for the vision impaired.• Well-though-out ergonomic design – The main body of the unit rests around your neck like a loose necklace, or collar. This places the unit where it is convenient for you to reach up and manipulate the controls – but it also secures the headset to your body making it tough to fall off or shake off when you are active, especially if you secure them to your clothing with the provided anchor clip.• Earbuds that fit – The earbuds that are pleasantly rounded on the outside and fit securely inside the ear, and you get different sized tips so that you can find the right fit for your unique ear size. The buds dangle from the main frame of the unit, and are positioned right so that you can easily pop them into your ears, or pop them out. This also speaks to the ergonomic advantages I talked about above• Long Range – This headset has a stronger signal than most Bluetooth devices I have tried. When synced with my Kindle Fire, I could hear perfect sound when walking up my driveway – I went more than 30 feet, and did not lose the signal.• Nice sound – The quality of the sound was as good, or slightly better, than many other headsets of this caliber I have tried. The highs are scintillating and the bass is pretty good. I’m not as expert on sound, but these made music sound terrific, as far as my tastes go.• Very long battery life – I used them for at least 8 hours without a charge, and sure they would have kept going. I think they are rated for at least 10 hours play between charges – that’s more than adequate.• Easy charge-pairing – Just plug them into your computer with the provided USB. I synced them to my Kindle Fire with great ease. If a techno-idiot like me can do it, anyone can without a problem.THE BOTTOM LINEWith so many different designs, models, shapes and choices of Bluetooth headsets, this Q800 is a pleasant alternative to a lot of the others that are “more of the same.” It’s a unique design that tries harder to find just the right fit nd comfort level for each person. These are nice to have, especially if you have two or three (or like me, about 10 different sets) to give you a different kind of control and feel for specific situations.I flirted with a 4-star rating, only because I think some might find the dangling earbuds may result in a bit of initial fumbling around to them straight, or they might possibly tangle a bit easily – but here I am just reaching extra hard to find faults just for the sake of making a thorough review that points out all aspects of the item. I’m comfortable with 5 stars, and I think you will be, too.Please Note: I received this headset free in exchange for my honest and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCETEIT99X2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCETEIT99X2T","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book about two ordinary young people who suddenly become extraordinary beings.In the case of the young man, he’s not so typical because, for starters, he’s 17 but already on his death bed. Pax is dying from a horrific disease called scleroderma – it involves the tightening of the skin and connective tissue. It’s an agonizing way to die.His only friend, Scarlett, has problems not quite as urgent: She’s a drab, gawky 17-year-old whose lack of feminine grace, good looks and charm means she’s not exactly the most popular girl in school. She’s an outcast and bullied.But the fortunes of both Pax and Scarlett are about the change in a most amazing way: A couple of meddling “super beings” from the astral world are going to transform them into powerful, indestructible entities with god-like powers – Pax’s diseased body will be replaced with solid titanium and Scarlett will be made of “evil energy” and fire.If it sounds like an intriguing premise for a thrilling fantasy/science fiction novel, well, it is. It’s made more interesting because there is a decent plot here – Pax and Scarlett are immediately caught up in a game of inter-dimensional politics which will determine nothing less than the survival of the entire human race.Author John Patrick Kennedy writes extremely well; his prose is natural and fluid. He has a lucid, no-nonsense style. He definitely has a sense of pacing and rhythm, balancing scenes of intense, violent action with periods of serene and calm.And yet, acknowledging all of the above, I Am Titanium left me feeling bland and uninspired, even depressed. I’ll be brutally honest: I felt relieved to get to the last page – much in the way that people are glad when one of Michael Bay’s over-long Transformer movies finally ends.It’s that frustrating feeling of being inexplicably bored while we're embroiled in long scenes of spectacular, intense action and eye-popping special effects.  But we know on some inner level  that all this eye candy is about as nutritious as real candy – empty calories that taste good, but ultimately leave you starved.The action scenes in this book go on way too long, especially the epic battle between Pax and “the monster” in the latter third of the book. It grinds away page after page and quickly wears incredibly tedious. All that, and the “monster” and Pax end up working for the same cause anyway!There are other factors that also seriously erode our reading experience. For example, before obtaining super powers, Scarlett was a typical angst-ridden teen, at odds with her parents, a loser at love (actually, a total nonstarter) and socially alienated. After she gets super powers, she becomes something even worse. Still angst ridden, alienated and troubled in love – even though all on a different level and for different reasons now.Despite the fact that he’s dying, Pax starts out as a hopeful, even positive young man with a meaningful goal – the study of the astral realms -- but after he obtains super powers, he become a typical moody, sullen teen with an endless stream of things to aggravate him, and to whine and complain about.A long bout of losing his virginity (having sex seven times in one session) only results in complicated “girlfriend” problems.His dialogue devolves into a series of grunted monosyllabic phrases liberally seasoned with the “F word.”His own inept actions (such as accidentally killing a street protester) infuses him with existential angst.His rocky relationship with his mother deteriorates to an even lower order.Speaking of mom, Pax’s mother, Dr. Julia Black, is revealed to have a level of humanity barely above that of the infamous Nazi doctor, Josef Mengele. She becomes the focal point of an almost inexplicable series of scenes wherein she interacts with some AI robots – which is at best, tangential to the entire narrative and, at worst, borders on not making much sense.However, for me, what is truly dejecting and saddening about this book is that the mass of humanity is treated as so much insignificant cannon fodder. Uncounted thousands of people are killed, maimed, burned, crushed, eaten, hacked up, stabbed, flung through the air, smashed against walls, mashed into pulpy lumps of flesh – it’s all collateral damage resulting from the wacky adventures of two teen super heroes fighting to save humanity.I found myself wishing that a book that centers on an epic battle to save humanity would display an overall  greater sense or empathy for that humanity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKH913K0QBFYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100PHIMW#wasThisHelpful","RKH913K0QBFYW","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this little potato slicer/French fry maker a lot, but I think for most people this will be a mediocre product, and thus a 3-Star item, in my opinion.WHAT’S GOODI almost never buy pre-prepared frozen French fries – I much prefer to slice up my own potatoes, so for me this is a handy device. It makes the fries just the right size for my likes – not too thin and not too thick.The mesh of blades are just sharp enough to buzz through a small potato with an easy downward thrust. For me, it was a snap – a smooth, easy action. There are no springs or anything like that. This is strictly a manual product that works with your “elbow grease.”WHAT’S SO-SOThere are actually four separate parts: the cutting mesh, a gripper, the external housing and the part you use to press down. I say this is “so-so” because, while it works okay, it is a tad unwieldy in actual use. You have to just sort of balance the gripper on top the potato and then place the “thruster” over the top of this before you push down – and the gripper is kind of wobbly and just a tad difficult to keep positioned just right on the potato.I’m probably making this sound a little more difficult that it is – it’s just a matter of getting all the separate parts together long enough to make that one-stroke cut – it’s not all that difficult, or really not “difficult” at all --  it’s just not ideal.WHAT’S NOT SO GOODThe cutting mesh is quite small – about 3-inhes wide by 2 ¼ inch wide. That means you’ll need a relatively small potato – or you will have to pre-slice larger potatoes to make them fit. This is not exactly the end of the world, but I’m just saying, it’s rather small. Personally, I don’t mind the small size, but others may find it less than satisfactory.Does not cut a sweet potato very easily and not so good for a variety of other vegetables, such as carrots, maybe – I mean, it will cut carrots well, but you would have to pre-slice carrots a lot to make them fit, and that defeats the purpose of a handy “fast slicer.”ALL IN ALLAgain, despite the flaws, I like this slicer a lot because I don’t mind working with small potatoes, and I would not be using this for anything else, actually – just getting some French fries made for a quick lunch is what I value a device like this for, and it takes just seconds to slice up a decent pile of fries, for one or several people.So all-in-all, a solid 3-Star from me – and please be aware, I received this device free in exchange for a fair and honest review.FINAL NOTE:Everything on the outside of the box is written in French, and that includes the instructions (which are printed on the outside of the box). Even so, a simple graphic diagram shows you how to use the slicer, so the fact that everything is in French should not be a problem for anyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34F1JKAMK4TUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9Q2BGG#wasThisHelpful","R34F1JKAMK4TUG","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: NOVEMBER 21 -- NOT GOOD NEWSOkay, I received these board in July and as you can see from my original review below, I gave them top marks. I'm sad to say that now some four moths later, all three board have fallen apart -- they splintered and broke down the middle lengthwise -- and this was through just normal use, not heavy use, like pounding on them, etc. I never placed them in a dishwasher.The handles broke off first, and the rest of the board came apart shortly thereafter. They just fell apart.Yes, I liked them while they lasted, but the bottom line is, you'll probably be needing another set of cutting board after a few months. that's my experience.**************THIS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:I never realized how nice it was to have three cutting board of three different sizes all at once … until I got three cutting board of three different sizes. It really makes a difference in the kitchen!And I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I love to cook.LET’S TALK ABOUT THESE BAMBOO BOARDS:I’ve had my knives and choppers busy cutting up everything from meats and vegetables, to fruits and blocks of cheese. At first I was skeptical that these boards could withstand a lot of cutting and slicing without getting gouged or suffering slice marks and nicks – but so far so good!They’re way more durable than I thought they would be. In fact, they’re tough to scar or mark.I also like the natural wood feel look of these boards – so much better than synthetic plastic or acrylic boards – that’s something of a purely aesthetic quality, but I also think using a sustainable wood product like this is better for the environment.MORE FLEXIBILITY IN YOUR WORKHaving a selection of different cutting boards makes things easier. For example, let’s say you’re making a chicken stir fry and you have just one cutting board. If you cut up the chicken first, then you have to stop and wash off the board before you dice the vegetables.With three boards, you can have the meat on one, vegetables on another, and whatever else you might need on a third. Then you’re ready to get it all into the sizzling oil of the wok!Of course, three boards means more wash up – so let’s talk about that.CLEANINGThese board are not dishwasher safe, which is okay with me because I don’t use a dishwasher. But I just wanted you to know that it’s not recommended to put these boards in a dishwasher.Other than that, it’s just a matter of throwing them in the sink and scrubbing them clean with some elbow grease. Nothing wrong with that. They wipe off easily and scrub clean with a little natural effort.BOTTOM LINEI think this is an excellent deal, especially for the price. These boards are functional, look great and are made from sustainable bamboo. I like that better than some industrial plastic sludge product.Please note: I received these cutting boards free in exchange for my honest, objective review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PR094FBCGSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCAPEJ8#wasThisHelpful","R3PR094FBCGSD","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost never play “grammar police.” I have given 4 and 5 stars reviews to other books where the grammar was lacking. In the case of this book, however, not only is the grammar absolutely deplorable, but the substance of the information being offered  is questionable at best.It’s as if this book was written by a high school student who is getting a “D” in his freshman English class.While the author is obviously highly motivated guy who is working hard to build a strong public image, why he would allow himself to be represented by such a sloppy, poorly-reasoned book is mystifying. I’ve seen some of his video presentations and he comes off as a bright, charismatic and intelligent young man who truly seems to care about helping others.But just about every single paragraph in this book contains a mangled, garbled sentence that is not only grammatically incorrect, but ridiculously poorly constructed. Take this paragraph:“There was a study done with basket ballers who trained for three weeks to see what had the most effect, training physically, not training at all or visualizing in your head. They come back and the people who didn’t train obviously were the worst, then it was physical who trained physically everyday didn’t come close to visualizing.”GAK! That’s bloody awful!Also, it borders on offensive the way the author invokes Albert Einstein to bolster his claims about the Law of Attraction. Dixon amateurishly writes:“Albert Einstein one of the most smartest individuals in the world new (sic) about this secret law and believed that whatever we focus on consistently we will manifest into our reality.”What a bunch of hogwash! How about citing a source from Einstein’s work – a paper, a quote, a book – that says anything about how Einstein believed that people can manifest things into their lives with the power of mindful intent! The author can’t provide a source because there is none.Please note, I’m not one of these narrow-minded skeptics who automatically discount what is suggested by the popular notion of the Law of Attraction. Yes, I think the concept has merit. But I just loath it when certain charlatans make absurd and clumsy attempts to get the likes of Albert Einstein on their side – twisting his work, words, and theories -- and making claims using his great name and legacy.It’s so frustrating when New Age self-help gurus quote Einstein in shallow and irresponsible ways, not really understanding what they are talking about, not grasping what a guy like Einstein was all about, or what he really thought about the workings of the mind and universe.Finally: What’s mind boggling is that this book is the “THIRD EDITION”Wow!One would hope that after three go-arounds that someone might decide to actually go through the document line-by-line and fix all the bad grammar, poor spelling, incorrect punctuation, and more. But I suppose that aggressive, non-stop marketing and hype is always more effective than bothering to produce a high-quality product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0I794VYLPN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9SFT4U#wasThisHelpful","R1A0I794VYLPN4","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I immediately loved the look, feel and texture of this drawer organizer – the natural, organic bamboo it’s made from just has a natural, warm feeling that you can’t get from some industrial plastic piece of junk.Bamboo is a sustainable material, so that’s a plus for me, too. This item is well-constructed.SIZE AND FITThis drawer organizer can expand to a larger size – when “closed” it is just over 17-inches x 13 inches.When expanded it is 19 inches x 13 inches.It is about 1.5-inches deep on the inside.When closed in smallest form, there are 11 separate compartments. When expanded there are a total of 13.SMOOTH ACTIONPulling the sides out to expand the item to full size feels smooth and gliding in motion, and solid. It’s not rickety and does not feel like it would easily fall apart. It’s well-crafted.ONE POSSIBLE DRAWBACKMost people would probably use this for kitchen utensils, and one problem for me here is that the compartments are not deep enough to accommodate some of my items – such as my larger or wider spatulas – or my potato masher – or my lemon press -- these items just don’t fit well into this organizer.It’s great for flat or “low-profile” knives, forks, spoons, etc. but some of your larger cooking utensils would have to go elsewhere.THE BOTTOM LINEI was thinking of retracting one star for a 4-star rating because of the problem I mentioned above. Again, it will not accommodate some of your larger cooking utensils.However, this item can be used in other areas of your home as well, such as an office desk or hobby room, den or bedroom drawer. You could organize all kinds of things that you collect – and everything looks terrific in this simple, well-designed organizer.I love the warm, “woody” natural feel, and the gentle “nutty” glow of the tawny brown bamboo. The texture of the bamboo grains are pleasing and attractive to the eye. I think it will enhance the look of most drawers, be it kitchen, den, office or other room.Finally, the price is right, so I’m going with five stars..Please note: I received this item free in exchange for an honest and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYDQ6Y5H09QPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCB5CIU#wasThisHelpful","RYDQ6Y5H09QPT","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was considering giving this bracelet three stars, but on further consideration, I am bumping my rating up to four stars, and here’s why:By classic definition, this is “cheap jewelry.” At this price, what else could you call it? I don’t mean that in a negative way. A lot of people like  baubles that cost little but nevertheless look good – let the Royal Family of England spend millions on jewelry!The item is stamped with “925” which means it is 92.5% made of silver. The remaining 7.5 percent is something else, most likely nickel or copper. I don’t know which in this case.The craftsmanship is just a little dicey – I mean, just a little bit off center where the clasps meet – but you really have to look hard to notice this.But again, for the incredibly low price, I think anyone can expect something that is not of Tiffany-quality.I bumped it up to four stars because I asked my wife to wear it to work for a day. She’s works for a large company with 3,000 employees. I wanted to see if anyone complimented her on the bracelet. She came home and said that two of her friends spontaneously told her the bracelet “looked nice.”For me, that says “mission accomplished.” This is a fine item for the price.Please note” I received this bracelet free in exchange for my honest, and objective review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZSZBL92NFH5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ04T9Q#wasThisHelpful","R2ZSZBL92NFH5I","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cleverly-designed device that delivers exactly what it promises – a handy, very secure and solid way to mount your cell- or smartphone on the dash of your car, or various other locations.The unit has a surprisingly powerful suction-cup grip that seems to work on a variety of surfaces, and in all temperatures.I think this thing will hold solid even on the bumpiest roads you’ll drive upon.It will fit a smartphone from 2 inches to 4 inches in width. It grabs the phone really well. A quick release button behind the unit caused the “clampers” to spread out automatically – then you just squeeze the clamps to fit the size of your phone. I have an older model cell phone that is 2 inches wide, and it holds it perfectly.Releasing your phone is also as simple as pushing a button, so you won’t have to fumble with it.The holder rotates 360 degrees allowing both portrait and landscape viewing.The back of the cradle has a rubber cushion to help absorb any shock your phone might encounter.It’s made from a very hard, durable black plastic and looks high tech and attractive. It should last for years on end.On the outside of the package I notice a toll-free 800 number you can call for customer support, and also an email for customer support.Has a limited 1-year warranty – so, all in all – this is a high quality product and a pretty good deal.Please note I received this product free in exchange for my honest, fair and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BAHGIN22VSKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4LV25K#wasThisHelpful","R1BAHGIN22VSKL","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-constructed toy of high quality manufacture – it will almost certainly please younger children, but I also discovered that some boys at the age of 12, even near 13, can have a blast (literally) with it, too.

If you have any adults in the house who are prone to migraine or tension headaches, well, use some common sense and make the kids go outdoors with it.The kids love to sound the siren and shouting goofy stuff at each other – I’ve also discovered it helps to have at least two so that more than one kid can get in on the fun.It’s a toy that lets kids play at being a police officer or fireman in a way that seems more real and vivid to them – so that’s good.

"This item is a surprisingly elegant, attractive and graceful item that not only looks beautiful, but functions well to fill any room with the pleasant scents of aromatic oils.I think it would add an element of grace and charm to any home, across a wide variety of decors and interior design schemes.What’s even more intriguing:  It sends up a delicate, pencil-thin column of mist that drifts upward in a way that is almost hypnotizing.The exterior framework is made of real wood; the natural swirls and grain of the wood is pleasing to the eye.In many ways, this reminds me of a “Genie Bottle,” as in that old TV show, “I Dream of Jeannie.” My only disappointment is that the ghostly, heavenly-scented mist that ascends from this bottle does not transform into a real human figure that was as lovely as Barbara Eden!EASE OF USE AND FUNCTIONSetting up this oil diffuser is quite easy. You open up the bottle by screwing off the top. There you will find a water reservoir – the item comes with a small plastic measuring cup that help you pour in just the right amount of water in a central receiving hole. Then you drop in 3 to 5 drops of your favorite aromatic oil, and replace the top.Note: Oil is not included. I happened to have some lavender oil in the house, so I used that.Next you plug it in, press the “power button” and you’ll hear just a tiny - very soft -- whirring of the water turning to vapor inside. A mist begins to emerge within minutes.The mist goes straight into the air – like a little pillar of fog – about 6 to 8 inches in the air, before the top of the mist breaks up and flutters into nothingness.LOVELY LIGHTSWhile functioning, the item also displays two small lights – a bright red light, blue and a green light. The colors only add to the attractiveness of the look, in my opinion. They’re rich and vibrant, but they don’t glare or offend. They enhance  the charm of the product.You can actually change the color of the lights through multiple presses of the start button – you can press the button up to 8 times (with 8 being “off”) – but as you do that, you get the item to display different combination of blue, red and green lights. Again, this is very pleasant.REMEMBER – THERE’S A POWER CORDThe seller’s picture of this item does not show the power cord – I just want to remind you that you’ll need an outlet nearby – and some of you may think a power cord detracts from the minimalist, sleek design of this diffuser bottle – so you should find a convenient way to hide the cord as best you can. This is probably the only slight drawback to the product that I can think of.ALL IN ALLOne of the best products I have sampled in recent weeks.

"I’m an avid gardener – I’m fortunate to live in a rural area with plenty of space to keep three large vegetable gardens. When you plant a wide variety of different plants, it’s a perennial challenge to keep things straight, and to remember what you planted where.It seems like a simple thing – but it’s just a vexing little problem if you don’t take steps right from the get-go – believe me, before your plants come up, it’s great to know where everything is.STAY ORGANIZEDAnd so, these garden tags are a much appreciated, simple and handy tool that solves a problem. You’ll keep you plantings organized and you stay aware of where things are as they prepare to spring forward for the growing season.EASY TO WRITE ON, WON’T RUB OFFI used a Sharpie to write the names of my plants – it works really well. The surface of these tags takes the writing perfectly without smearing. And once you write the name of your plant on these tags – they won’t come off again! Rain will not wash them off – nor anything else.I was curious to see if I could rub off tags I marked-up with my Sharpie, and found it is nearly impossible to get wipe off what has been written. I used a variety of solvents, from Windex and even nail polish remover -- but I could not rub off the words.RE-USE THEM FOR YEARSYes, that means you can’t wipe them clean at the end of the year – on the other hand, why would you need to?  Just keep them and use them for next year. They are durable enough to last for years, I’m sure.STRONG ENOUGH TO STICK IN THE GROUNDThey are also firm and durable enough to easily stick in the ground; they’re not flimsy, yet they are flexible. Just right, actually.Here is everything I am growing this year:Corn, cabbage, peppers, kale, potatoes (red, white and blue varieties), onions (two varieties), peas, squash, cantaloupe, zucchini, green beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, asparagus, broccoli, rhubarb and celery. I use both raised beds, pots and regular, right-in-the-ground garden plots.I give these tags my top rating because they do what they are supposed to do, they’re handy, durable and they look nice in the garden.Please note: I received these tags free in exchange for my honest, objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26QYP02ITCRHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTH45IG#wasThisHelpful","R26QYP02ITCRHC","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a remote, dark area.I’m way out in the country, and I have no yard light. The nearest city is a small town of just 700 people eight miles away, so I am not plagued by light pollution. You should see how brilliant the stars are here on a moonless night!But when I go out on a moonless night, it can be so dark you can’t see your hand in front of your face.DIFFUSED AND SCATTERED LIGHTThus, my location makes for a perfect test site for this solar-powered lamp, which uses a single LED light.That light is diffused and scattered by the frosted plastic housing that makes up the main body of the lamp.A CHEERFUL AURA OF LIGHTWalking around outside at night, this lamp cast a cheerful aura of white light around me, helping me see several feet in all directions. It is so light-weight, you can hardly feel this lamp dangling from your fingers as you carry it along. Thus, if you are out camping, or for some reason, in the dark woods at night, this lamp will be your lifeline to seeing where you are and where you are going – and you won’t run smack-nosed into a tree!GREAT FOR THE CARAfter testing this lamp, I’m definitely going to get a second one to keep in my car at all times. It would be a terrifi, reliable emergency light if your car breaks down at night; hang this on the inside of the hood of your car, at it will illuminate the whole engine as you try to figure out what’s wrong with your engine.It would also prove a great warning light to other motorists – they’ll see this light from a long way off if you are stranded on a dark road at night.INDOOR USE – PERFECT FOR READING AT NIGHTWhenever you can replace any kind of traditional electrical light in your house, you’re saving energy, not matter how small the amount. I like to place this lamp on my bed cabinet behind me so that I can  use it as a reading lamp during the many nights I have insomnia and resort to reading as a way to get too sleep.It casts a soft, but just bright enough glow so that I can read my Kindle with the just the perfect amount of light – not too harsh, and definitely not too dim.EXCELLENT FOR TENT AND CAMPINGI can’t imagine a better light to bring along on a camping trip. Just fantastic for this purpose. Again, it’s so very light-weight, and you want to pack and travel light when you are camping/hiking/biking. This lamp is small enough to fit in a backpack, and so light, you won’t know it’s there. Light up the inside of a tent at just the level of light you want and inside of test to be.WELL DESIGNEDI like the wire handle, which is easy to grasp, but which can also be positioned so that you can position the lamp to recline in a near horizontal position, which scatters the light more efficiently all around.GLOW IN THE DARK ON/OFF SWITCHThe On/Off switch has just a slight glow-in-the-dark sheen that makes it super easy to find in the complete darkness.CHARGING AND BURN TIMEYou can charge using either the USB cable (provided), or just set it out in the sunlight during the day to make sure it had a charge for the night. It will burn for 8 hours on the low setting, and 4 hours on the brighter setting.EMERGENCY LIGHT FOR POWER OUTAGESI can’t think of a better light to have in case your power goes out during a storm at night – if you have this solar lantern on hand, well, you’ll be happy to have it.I give this product my strongest 5-star rating – I absolutely love it – and remember: “Go solar!""Please note: I received this product free in exchange for my honest, objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BCR3384VMYS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLERZB4#wasThisHelpful","R2BCR3384VMYS2","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No one in my household has an issue with cellulite, so I cannot attest to the how well this item will alleviate that issue – however, I will say that this is a dandy item that offers benefits beyond the cellulite reduction claims it makes.That’s because these well-designed units offer a terrific, stimulating, tingling massage, no matter what your body type. If you are like me, and have a lot of aching sore muscles due to arthritis, getting your blood-flow stimulated is always a good thing. I think these devices can really help in that regard.I’m sure also that you can get a deeper skin-cleansing than you might otherwise obtain with, say, an ordinary washcloth or some other form of sponge scrubber. The soft plastic nubbins on this device get a deep penetration into your upper layers of skin, and press against the muscles just enough to “wake them up” – which makes you feel relaxed and energizes at the same time.As I said, I cannot advise you about the cellulite reduction quality of the product; however, I can give it a strong recommendation simply because it’s an excellent massage, skin stimulation and muscle-relaxing tool that you’ll be glad to have after one of those long days working in your garden, or playing tag football – or whatever you do to challenge yourself physically, but get some aches and pains afterword.Don’t pop a pain pill – get your loved one to give you a good once over with these rollers – you’ll enjoy it and feel great.Please note: I received this item free in exchange for my honest, objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CRP2EHKR456O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UM9R4WQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CRP2EHKR456O","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you can see from the photo I attached to this review, I’m a guy with a lot of chainsaws.I got your standard gas-powered model; your plug-in variety and your little battery powered job.Now I have a fourth kind – this one not powered by gas or electricity – but human muscle and sweat.It’s the Pocket Chainsaw!But the question is: How well does it work?Well, let me tell you, if you had your choice, you would always want to use the gas or electric powered variety of course – who wouldn’t!ADVANTAGESHowever, there may be those times when you don’t want to lug a chainsaw around with you, not even the smaller battery powered kind, such as when you go camping, or when you just happen to be out somewhere and you need to make some quick cuts in a pinch.The advantage of the pocket chainsaw is just that: It literally fits in your pocket. In this case, the device comes with a handy pouch that you can wear on your belt. You might also keep this in the cubbyhole of your manly pick-up truck – like my manly ‘66 Chevy GMC with “three-on-the-tree” shifter.WHAT IS IT, BASICALLY?Anyway, the pocket chainsaw is basically a standard chainsaw chain that some dude has attached a couple of straps to. You grab each one of these, loop it around the piece of wood you want to saw – and have at it!HOW EASY IS IT TO USE?Well, let me tell you, if you had to saw a big ol’ pile a wood using only the Pocket Chainsaw, let’s just say you would quickly be developing some awesome forearms muscles, not to mention beefing up your triceps, quads, deltoids and pecs!Yes, it’s a workout!Even so, I was surprised at how easy it actually is to saw through some smaller branches, say, of 3-inch to 4-inch in diameter. You can cut through something like this probably in 60 seconds or less.What about a log, such as, a standard hunk of wood that you would want to toss into your wood stove?Ahhhh … well, not so much. Let me tell ya -- you wouldn’t want to be sawing bigger logs with this thing. You would be so hot and sweaty after getting through a bigger log, you wouldn’t even have to build a fire after cutting that log because you’d be plenty hot from all that work!That’s not what this is for, though. This is a handy tool for those occasions that you can’t predict, or for situations where you are away from home or in the field, or whatever.GREEN WITH ENVYI know one thing, all your buddies will want to have one as soon as they see this thing. How do I know that? Because I have shown it to a bunch of my buddies and they all say: “Hey! Where can I get one of those?” It’s weird, but your pals will be green with envy when they see your Pocket Chainsaw – and the fact that you have one and they don’t. There’s no explaining the way some guys think.Well, that’s about it.

"You know lately, I’ve had earbuds coming out of my ears!By that I mean that I’ve been sent four different models of earbuds or headphones for review in recent weeks – and this is the third set of Bluetooth wireless earbuds I’ve tested in the last two months.These are my favorite so far. My last set was an even more slightly higher-end model, the A1 also from Soundpeat, but these Qy7 model has them beat.WHY THEY’RE GOOD:• They fit in the ear beautifully, and it helps they provide you with a variety of different earbud caps to match the size of your ear. I think anyone will be able to find a comfortable, tight fit that won’t fall out.• Lightweight. You hardly know they’re there.• Sleek modern design and look. This is just aesthetics, but why not look good when wearing earbuds, especially when you’re out in public.• Great sound. Maybe not the rich bass tones and scintillating highs of an expensive cover-the-ear model headsets, but the sound these deliver is clear, sharp and pleasant all around.• Come with a variety of clips and grasps that really help you get a secure fit; also a clip to secure this to your collar so they won’t fall off.• Easy sync. These paired with my Kindle Fire in seconds – no problem there.• Voice alert to tell you when you’re out of range.• Generous 5 hours of play/talk time.• White noise feature that helps eliminate ambient sounds.• Easy to manipulate and reach volume control and skip button.In short, these are fantastic. I absolutely love them.

"The first thing I want you to know that these cups are “COPPER-COATED” – as in: “NOT SOLID COPPER.”Rather, they are stainless steel coated with a layer of copper. Thus, if you are expecting a solid copper product, this is not what your getting.While these cups are “sort of nice” -- I’ll be frank and say I was a tad disappointed. That’s because I was expecting a heavier gauge copper product. I don’t mind so much that they are only copper-coated, but they have almost a “tin cup” feel to them, although to be completely fair, they do rise above – just slightly – that “tin cup” feel.If they had been made of a heavier-grade stainless steel underneath and then copper coated, that would have gone a long way to pleasing me more – but they are just a bit too light-weight to give that luxurious weighty feel in your hand.I am also not overly impressed with the handles. In a copper cup, I prefer a handle that is slightly flattened. These are round “wire-like” handles – yes, they are just a tad fatter than “wire” but, for me, the handles are too narrow to get my full approval.I struggle with giving these cups two stars or three. I settle on two because, at $25, I don’t think they are quite solid, heavy and durable enough to command that price – but you might disagree. I almost awarded three stars because, well, they’re “sort of nice.” That’s the best I can say about them.Please note: I received this two-set of these copper-coated mugs in exchange for my honest and objective review","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XLIMZ0YMEIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPX8CUG#wasThisHelpful","R35XLIMZ0YMEIR","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me tell you, I have owned dogs for all my adult life. Over the years I think I have gone through 15 to 20 different models of these retractable leashes, and they are definitely all not created equal. Some of them break in a day or two, others sort of hang in there, while some have been solidly built and have lasted a year, or two, or three.This retractable dog leash from Pet Magasin is certainly the best I have ever encountered.Believe me, I thoroughly tested it on my extremely rambunctious, speed-demon, bounding Australian Shepherd/Border Collie – if there was ever a “destroyer of leashes” it’s this guy.This leash can handle even him.WHAT’S GOODI like everything about this product. It’s solidly built and the ergonomics are excellent. Fits very comfortably in the hand, a rubberized coating on the grip makes it easy to grasp and hold onto. The button which controls the intake and outtake of the retractable leash is perfectly position and works smoothly. It’s easy to “brake” or let the leash fly loose with a press of the button.The leash itself is flat and bright yellow, which helps with visibility for night walking.ALWAYS A CONCERN:I have found out the hard way that these leashes can be dangerous – if you have a strong dog, the leash can give you a screamingly-bad abrasion burn if you happen to grab onto it with your bare hands when your dog, say, sees a squirrel, and lunges for it.That’s less of a problem with this leash because it is flat (not like a round rope which can give rope burns). However, getting an abrasion burn is still a distinct possibility even with this design. That’s just something anyone using this kind of leash really needs to be aware of.Also, never get any part of this leash wrapped around your body – especially a finger!IMPORTANT:!!!!  Definitely do not let children, especially young children, use this with your dog, or even play with it without a dog! It can cause serious injury in a worse-case scenario. !!!!TO BE HONEST:To be honest, I prefer to use these kind of leashes with smaller to medium-sized dogs. The bigger the dog, the harder they are on these kinds of devices, no matter how well built. A big dog can break the internal spring mechanism, or even break the rope, etc.For smaller and medium dogs, this is one of the best pet inventions of all time!Yes, you can use it with bigger dogs effectively – I’m just saying you’ll run into more problems with larger dogs, both with damage to the unit, and potential danger to yourself.NOTE: THIS UNIT IS DESIGNED FOR MEDIUM SIZED DOGS.THE BOTTOM LINEIf you are going to buy any retractable leash, I cannot think of a better model than this one. Again, I have tried perhaps 15 to 20 different brands and models, and this is easily the best I’ve ever used.As long as you use good common sense and take basic precautions against rope burns and getting your fingers, hands or wrists wrapped around the leash, this is the very best way to walk and control your dog.Please note: I received this retractable dog leash free in exchange for my honest and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4CTJBOZO6VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKV27H8#wasThisHelpful","R3U4CTJBOZO6VZ","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love devices that are extremely simple to use – while working perfectly.Just give me an “On” switch and an “Off” switch, and get the job done. Period!That’s what this nifty little device does. It looks like, acts like and is a normal USB flash drive, but its main function is serving as an excellent voice and sound recorder.I plugged this into my computer to charge it up. Then I flicked the “On” switch and recorded my wife and I having a normal conversation in our living room. The device was across the room from us about 12 feet away. It picked up every word clearly and distinctly.It does not have its own speaker, and so you can only play back recordings on your computer. It’s simple to do. When plugged in, a window should pop up showing you the folder of the device, and any recordings you have made.If the window does not pop up automatically (which it always should) just go to your “devices and drives” (I’m using Windows 8) and the recorder will appear as “Removable Disk D:” Click on this icon and your recorded file will appear.I chose to open the recorded item using Windows Media Player. The window popped up and my recording was right there ready to play. Easy as pie.Again, you can also use this device like a normal flash drive to store other files, such as texts or pictures, etc.The range is not super great – for example – if you want to record a lecture in a classroom, you best be seated near the front of the class. However, if you want to record any normal conversation or sound in any normal sized room, such as your office, at a meeting in a conference room, or your living room – this will work in terrific fashion.I’m a journalist so I often interview people face to face. For this, it’s absolutely excellent. In fact, I love it for this task. For covering meetings, such as a City Council meeting or School Board – it will work if you place the device up close to where the board members are seated – but don’t expect it to catch everything from the back of the room, especially when there is a lot of ambient noise also present.To start recording, you just flip the “On” switch. To stop recording – well, go right ahead and flip it back to “Off.” You’re done! Files saved!Will last 4 to 5 hours on a charge.Love it. Absolutely great product. Simple, powerful and it works.Please note, I received this item free in exchange for an unbiased, honest and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NG8D1LD60IDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XABKZCY#wasThisHelpful","R1NG8D1LD60IDW","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I say anything else, I must echo what other reviewers have said about the leaky bottle problem. This bottle arrived with traces of oil outside the bottle and inside the package. I immediately detract one star because the seller must solve this problem and find a better way to contain and ship this product; several others have rightfully complained of the same issue.Beyond that, I find this product, by all outward appearances, to be a high quality product – but I have several qualifications about this statement. Please read the entirety of my comments to follow:First, I will say this oil has a 100% neutral taste – not sweet, nor bitter – and it feels wonderfully pleasant on your tongue if you care to try a tablespoon straight up.I was highly skeptical of the suggestion to dose my morning cup of coffee with this oil – GAK! Oil in coffee? – but I was amazed at how well it just blended in, did not affect the taste, and yes, I think it gave me an energy boost … well, I think … maybe.Was my energy boost all in my head, as in, the placebo effect?My wife has also been using this oil in a variety of ways, mostly in smoothies, and she reports no noticeable energy boost.Personally, I don’t think the science itself is complete or accurate enough for the manufacturer to make the claim that this product can give you a feeling of boosted energy – but maybe it does. I just don’t know.If the other claims about its benefits are true – help with weight management, aiding digestion, enhanced athletic performance – then it might be a marvelous product indeed.However – and I must emphasize this – my understanding of the science is that the data is simply not complete or accurate enough to truly verify any of these claims. I know lot of individual people claim they get these benefits from MCT oil – but that is anecdotal evidence, not rigorous scientific data.I know I’m being something of a stickler, but so much of nutritional science is junk science. Consider the recent revelation that everything we thought we knew about cholesterol for the past 40 years is wrong.Consider this quote from the June 24, 2015, issue of Time Magazine:“The war against fat was started by one man: Much of what we think we know about the supposed dangers of high fat intake comes from a single research project by a charismatic Minnesota pathologist named Ancel Keys. His Seven Countries Study compared the health and diet of nearly 13,000 middle-aged men in the U.S., Japan and Europe, and ostensibly found that populations that consumed large amounts of saturated fats in meat and dairy had high levels of heart disease, while those who eat more grains, fish, nuts and vegetables did not. The influential Keys relentlessly advocated the theory that fat caused heart disease, persuading the AHA in 1961 to issue the country’s first-ever guidelines targeting saturated fat—and he wasn’t shy about shouting down any researcher who questioned his data.Yet it turns out there was a lot to question. Keys chose the countries most likely to confirm his hypothesis, while excluding nations like France—where the diet is rich in fat but heart disease is rare—that might have challenged it.""(End Time quote)For me – and I admit I’m no expert – everything we read, hear and think we know about nutritional science is questionable. That would have to include the claims for the benefits of this kind of MCT oil.While I don’t believe this oil can do you any harm if taken in very small amounts, I have no way of knowing if it can do you any good. Even our best science can’t answer that question at this time.Please note that I received this product free in exchange for my objective review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PNVYPJD0GQHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW5UVY#wasThisHelpful","R1PNVYPJD0GQHB","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There exists in America a special place where you'll find a transition zone between two distinct cultures.It's a mixture of the staid, straightforward practically of Midwesterners with the wild, mysterious blend of the Deep South as shaped by the edge of the Appalachian wilderness. That location is southeast Ohio.If a writer could capture the flavor of that unique mixture of Americana by telling the stories of ordinary people with a collection of short stories - anyone reading it would gain a certain deeper understanding of the American experience.It would also be incredibly entertaining!I'm delighted to report that Ohio author and film-maker STEVE ANDERSON has accomplished this subtle task with this collection of short stories titled: 1979.On the outside these tales would seem to be a series of coming of age ""booze and boobs"" vignettes featuring hormone-driven pre-adolescents and teenagers who are just waking up into a world where temptations abound - cheap wine, beer, sexy young girls, (and a few lusty older women), fast junky cars, cheap dope and the delicious discovery of that first kiss coupled with a daring grope of breast.However, by design or accident, these stories deliver more than just surface-level entertainment. Let's face it; each offering here is a little work of art. The writing often transcends the quality of being merely entertaining yarns to delivering that sense of:""There is something real here that strikes a chord. I'm not sure what it is, but I can feel it.""I can't decide if Steve Anderson is one of those natural writer who is able to make stories like these just flow off his fingertips, or if he is one of those dogged writers, rewriters and revisers - but who cares? He writes extremely well.Reader will quickly forget that some guy is trying to enthrall them with words because we're swept away by each of these stories right from the first sentences, and before you know it, the story is done. Then you realize you have just forgotten that you were sitting in an uncomfortable chair squinting at words on a page because you were magically transported 35 years into the past to a small town in Ohio- it's as if you lived a few visceral hours through the eyes and feelings of the characters.I like writers who understand that if you just tell a story, everything else will take care of itself - and also comprehend the importance of character. Anderson's characters pop off the page, alive, fresh and vivid, almost certainly because he based his creations on real people he knew while growing up in the 1970s.I don't want you to think what you're going to get here is a lot of bland ""Happy Days"" nostalgia ala an idealized version of what life might have been like in 70s-era small town America. Anderson shows that, like the mean streets of Detroit, the tough hoods of New York or the gang infested barrios of Los Angeles - small towns can incubate their own festering brand of mean street cruelty.With the cool gaze of an unflinching observer, Anderson regales us with sweat-inducing scenes, such as a man getting brutally whip-beaten with a metal car antenna; a tornado breaking the back of cow; wild-eyed southern boys pulling off the pants of a young boy in an alley and then meting out a tooth-knocking thrashing before they nearly cut off his testicles with a dirty pocket knife.Yes, you'll find sweetness and sentiment here, good times and laughs, but there's also loneliness and boredom, betrayal and alienation, lust and violence - all part of an unvarnished look at the basic reality of life -- delivered to your doorstep courtesy the pen of ... one ... savvy ... wordsmith!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28OGOTGVIS1NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511417803#wasThisHelpful","R28OGOTGVIS1NL","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in northern Minnesota where winters are long and frigid, sunlight is scant for months on end – and that means people living here may become Vitamin D deficient.In general, I have a dim view of taking any kind of supplement because I firmly believe eating a well-balanced diet (the way nature intended) will supply all the vitamin the human body needs to function normally.However, a good case can be made for using Vitamin D in supplement form.If I have to take any supplement. Vitamin D is found in only a few foods in small amounts – including herring, tuna, mackerel and sardines.But the bottom line is that you will never get enough Vitamin D from food.What you really need is adequate exposure to sunlight. This ignites a biochemical process in your body, causing it to manufacture its own Vitamin D.The problem: Getting enough sunlight is difficult in many northern parts of the world, and also, too much sunlight is damaging to the skin.Thus, taking a Vitamin D supplement is almost certainly an excellent idea. Again, this is the ONLY supplement I would ever take myself. Based on my understanding of the science, there is absolutely no proof that taking a multivitamin or any other kind of supplement will do anyone a lick of good – as long as you have a healthy well-balanced diet high in fruits and vegetables, with an absolute minimum of junk food, and stuff like white refined sugar, etc.So if I have to take a Vitamin D supplement, I trust this company, Viva Labs, to supply me with a high quality product. I say this based on my experience using a variety of other products from Viva Labs, from their Quinoa and raw chocolate, to their chia seeds and cacao powder. Everything I have purchased from them has been absolutely of superior quality.Please note that, in this case, I received this bottle of Vitamin D3 free in exchange for my honest and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZB5DR4TVKZSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQKI3W6#wasThisHelpful","RZB5DR4TVKZSK","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was first diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis about 25 years ago. Over the years my condition has smoldered and slowly grown worse -- although I have long since come to accept my condition as the ""New Normal.""Many times well-meaning friends and relatives have suggested I take this supplement, glucosamine chondroitin MSM, which is available in several brands.I have always resisted because:* My doctors put me on raft of prescription drugs to control my condition and relieve pain.* Over the years, these prescriptions have changed from one drug to another.* At any given time, I might be using two to four different prescriptions medications.Thus, I reasoned that taking adding glucosamine chondroitin on top of everything else I was taking just seemed like overkill, and also, I was uncertain about how it would interact with my other drugs.It's common for people with arthritis to take medicines that thin the blood, and according to Web MD, glucosamine chondroitin can also add to the blood-thinning effect, so it may not not a good idea to add this supplement to other blood thinners, in my opinion.However, now I take just one drug that controls all my symptoms beautifully -- an injectable ""biologic"" drug called Humira.I asked my doctor if I could take glucosamine chondroitin, with Humira, and he said ""Yes,"" but that he also doubted it would help.Thus, after receiving this bottle free from the seller in exchange for my objective review, I thought it was finally time to try this product after all these years.DID IT HELP?I really can't say. You must keep in mind that my arthritis has been progressing for 25 years -- that means a lot of irreversible damage done -- so it may be that any new treatment at this point might be difficult to notice at this stage in my life and condition.I have only used the product for a month, so my test period may not be long enough to notice a real effect.I should also note that I think this product is indicated to be more helpful with other types of conditions than the one I suffer from, such as osteoarthritis. I can't attest to the effectiveness of this product in the case of other conditions.I do know that this supplement did me no harm -- and that's the first rule of medicine. ""Do no harm.""The fact is, in terms of medical science, the jury is still out on the value of this supplement for people like me who endure arthritis and similar conditions. There's plenty of studies out there, but I don't think the mainstream scientific/medical community has ever given this product an official ""okay"" as an effective treatment.Thus, I give this product three stars -- this indicates that I simply can't say with authority -- both from my personal experience and based on my research of the science -- if this supplement truly provides the results which many sellers claim it does. I just don't know.I know that many people swear by it, and claim it had helped them a great deal. But this is what medical researchers call ""anecdotal evidence"" -- which is not the same as controlled scientific studies in double-blind protocol situations -- and only the latter is a true indication of the efficacy of any kind of treatment.It didn't help me or hurt me -- but your experience may be entirely different. Also keep in mind: Any of us can be swayed by the placebo effect -- but sometimes, the ""placebo treatment"" is the best treatment of all.I must add that I have sampled almost 10 other products of Viva Labs and I consider this company to be of extremely high value and trustworthiness -- so if you want to try this product -- I can't think of a better supplier to buy from than Viva Labs.

Let me tell you, when you have a big-ol’ chunk of meat you want to shred up fast, these meat claws are a tool that will get the job done for you – and fast!I’ve long known about meat claws, but I have never had a notion to buy a pair for myself. These were sent to be for free by the seller in exchange for my honest and objective review.I struggle with whether to give these tools a top 5-star mark, or detract a star. I settle on four because I must say, even though I got them free, I was hoping they would be made of metal – mostly for aesthetic reasons.After using these claws make of hardened plastic, I realize there are some advantages to plastic – they are lighter, they are probably just as sharp as metal, and they clean-up remarkably easy. They may even be easier to clean than metal tools.For me, they fit okay in my hands, but perhaps not perfectly. They felt just a tad clumsy or awkward in my hands as I grappled with a large roast. Part of reason is that I think you have to learn how to use them – getting that right motion down – which means holding down the meat with one hand while you do most of the shredding with your dominant hand, depending on whether you are left or right handed.The price is reasonable, they are a handy tool that deliver on what they promise to do – so I can recommend these claws. I would have preferred metal – just because I think that would have been cool and would have made me feel like Wolverine from the X-man – but the reality is that plastic is probably just as good or even better than metal.Do you really absolutely need these? Perhaps. I’ll let you decide. Your level of needs depends on how often you have large chunks of meat to shred up fast – it should be mentioned also that you can use these in other kitchen situations, such as grasping and holding watermelons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RLP2YMAEDQ8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W555MYM#wasThisHelpful","R3RLP2YMAEDQ8H","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ll be honest, this is probably the best cacao powder I have ever tried. It’s a bag of silky chocolate pleasure with a rich flavor that is quite unlike any other form of chocolate you can bake with, or with to make a cup of hot coco. Easily beats chocolate chips or various off-the-shelf store brand of coco powder sold by the major labels.My first recipe was a simple chocolate cake made from scratch. I have a recipe that calls for buttermilk, three eggs, some vanilla, walnuts etc. I added about a half-cup of this cacao powder and was rewarded with a rich, moist chocolate cake that is to die for.Since this is a raw, organic and unsweetened, you control the sugar or other sweetener amount you want to have in your food.  All this and it delivers high nutritional value, including high fiber content, magnesium, antioxidants and amino acids.The array of different chocolaty recipes you can make is limited only by how many volumes of cookbooks you own, or how many recipes you can find on the Internet. I would say this is a must-have product for any kitchen pantry.Please note I received this 1 lb bag free in exchange for my honest, objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4T7451A1OF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HES9CMS#wasThisHelpful","R2X4T7451A1OF5","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this wig free in exchange for my objective review just in time to give it to my niece for her 16th Birthday!Here is what my niece said when she opened the package and found this pink wig:“YEAAHH!  I LOVE IT!”As it happens, my niece and here parents were planning a trip to the Canadian city of Winnipeg for the next day, and my niece said:“I’M GOING TO WEAR THIS WIG ALL DAY WHILE HOBNOBBING AROUND WINNIPEG!”I asked my niece what she thought about the quality of the wig. She said:“I JUST LOVE IT! I THINK IT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. IT CAN GIVE YOU AND AMAZINGLY DIFFERENT LOOK. IT LOOKS BOTH REAL AND UNREAL AT THE SAME TIME.”I asked my niece if she was into cosplay role playing activities.“NO, NOBODY I KNOW AROUND HERE DOES THAT KIND OF THING. I GUESS WE LIVE IN A TOWN THAT IS TOO SMALL AND RURALI asked my niece: How else might you be using this wig? She said:“I THINK ONLY YOUR IMAGINATION CAN LIMIT YOU ON HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH THIS. IT WILL BE GREAT FOR HALLOWEEN, BUT ALSO, I DON’T THINK IT’S JUST A COSTUME. IF YOU WANT A RADICAL NEW LOOK ON ANY DAY, THIS IS TERRIFIC.”So there you go.I think for the price, the quality is adequate and for the joy it brings to young people, this item fulfills its function, and therefore, deserves my top 5-star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OTCF7IMJCSC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX9EN2G#wasThisHelpful","R3OTCF7IMJCSC9","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The goji berry – also known around the world as the “wolf berry” – is simply a fantastic nosh when eaten  as a dried fruit. Just slightly sweet, chewy, no added sugar needed, not bitter – it would be difficult to think of a better healthy, refined-sugar-free snack that one can enjoy without an ounce of guilt.I just eat them right out of the bag, but you can put them in tea, sprinkle them on salads, mix them with nuts and your other favorite snack-bowl items.This is a healthy snack that delivers phenomenal nutrition: A 1 oz serving has 140% of daily Vitamin A, 13% calcium, 8% Vitamin C and 3% calcium. Also has 2 grams of fiber and 8 grams of natural sugars. The supplier says they contain 20 trace minerals, including zinc and selenium.My wife and I both absolutely love these berries. A simple, healthy snack packed with nutrition – and they taste great. What’s not to love?I received a 1 lb bag free in exchange for my honest, objective review, and I am glad to recommend this product without reservation. It’s a no-brainer that this product deserves 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDZCQVHAJKCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWW3LQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1BDZCQVHAJKCN","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hey, if you are like me and love to cook – but also like to be adventurous and try all-new recipes to make unique culinary creations – these raw cacao nibs offer an opportunity to expand your tasty horizons.Yes, this is chocolate, but it’s raw and unsweetened. No, these don’t taste like your average chocolate chip. They have just a slight bitterness, the pleasant kind of bitterness that you like in black coffee, for example. Yes, the “chocolaty” flavor is present, but this is perhaps a different kind of chocolate vibe than most of us are accustomed to.The first thing I tried was to bake one of my favorite buttermilk, white-cake-from-scratch recipes – and I put in a cup of these raw nibs. I wanted to start out with one of my reliable recipes, and one I am well-familiar with, to see if the unique taste of this product could change things up in a significant way. I was pleasantly surprised.I really like the way the slight bitter-yet-chocolaty taste of these nibs enhances, complements and “plays off” the otherwise sweet flavor of the rest of my cake. I truly felt like I had transformed one of my oldest and most familiar recipes into something entirely new.And I think that’s the main benefit and appeal of this product for me – it gives me an opportunity to make “all that is old new again” – and in a simple way. A basic white cake now becomes an exotic, sort of foreign treat – it’s like you are visiting a country you have never been to before, and you are experiencing new flavors and sensations for the first time.Another terrific aspect of these raw cacao nibs is the vast array of possibilities – the number of different recipes, ways and the alternate-interpretation spins you can put on foods is all but endless. You can enhance both sweet and savory dishes – and you control the sweetness from the outside.Have you ever tried to enhance chili with chocolate? A bit of chocolate flavor in chili is actually an incredibly good twist for a hot and spicy recipe –these nibs don’t overpower a savory dish with sweetness while adding a hint of bitter chocolate taste that would be difficult to get otherwise.All this and you’re getting an excellent nutritional boost – these nibs are high in essential fatty acids, vitamins, deliver some iron and calcium to your diet, not to mention dietary fiber.It’s no wonder the ancient Maya and other civilization of Central and South America highly prized this product as a “Food of the Gods.” And what else can an ordinary mortal like me give the nosh of deities but a 5-star rating? I do!Please note: I received this 1-lb bag free in exchange for my honest and objective review. My honest opinion is that this is definitely a superior product which I am glad to recommend to all my readers here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG1XZSCTT0STM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW81YM#wasThisHelpful","RG1XZSCTT0STM","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think everyone who owns some kind of computer tablet has, at times, come up with creative ways to prop up their device in various situations. Sometimes you lean it against a book, roll up a towel or some piece of cloth - you just want to view comfortably while your hands are free.Well, wherever there is a problem - no matter how small or trivial - someone is striving to solve that problem and make a buck marketing a product.This item certainly does provide a solution - although perhaps not perfectly. For example, where I find myself wanting to prop up my Kindle Fire most is at the dinner table when I am at home alone having lunch. I usually lean my device against a cup, or put a cloth napkin underneath it so it tilts forward for easy viewing while I dine.For me, this 18-inch pillow is just a tad too big for use at my kitchen table, but it can suffice for that. There is just something about the kitchen table that makes me feel this item does not belong there, however.But in many other home venues - while reading or viewing in bed, sitting in the living room, lounging on the floor, or outside in our gazebo, this pillow with rubber iPad/Kindle holder is nice to have. It's a comfortable lap pillow, and I can rest my hands on either side while reading or watching, hands free.I don't travel much, but this cushion would probably be ideal for use on an airplane or while riding in a car. But then again, I'm not sure if you would want to carry this 18-inch long pillow around with you while traveling, and especially flying. It's light-weight and all - but it's still another thing to carry on a plane, and airlines are getting so restrictive about what you carry on.There is a small zippered pocket on the side opposite the holder. That, I assume, is for convenient storage of a cable for your device. The holder itself also has a hole at the bottom so that you can charge your device while you are using the pillow.You might get some extra use out of this nice soft cushion using it as a neck rest, or support for your lower back while sitting - again, that would be great in a cramped airline seat, or bus seat.It's filled with buckwheat hulls and microbeads, I guess, so it's a very cozy beanbag type of thingy.  It does feel pleasant and comfortable.It attracts pet hair like a powerful magnet! So watch out for that. (I have three cats).All in all, I have to give this at least 4 stars because this is a product that delivers on its primary promise. It's a comfortable way to prop up your iPad or Kindle while freeing your hands from holding it in a variety of situations. But do you really, really need it? I'll let you decide.Please note: I received this item free in exchange for my honest and objective review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZ5G418IJPE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9RNATK#wasThisHelpful","RHZ5G418IJPE5","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not so much a book using Minnesota as a backdrop, but a novel that creates a kind mythological Minnesota that does not exist in reality - unfortunately, the mythical Minnesota elements are largely gleaned from Hollywood movie clichés and bland, surface-level stereotypes.Yes, this is fiction so anything goes and I believe in granting any writer all the poetic license they want to  make up a story in an imaginary world - but for me, this novel comes off as a clumsy mish-mash of standard fictional props, well-worn plot gimmicks and jarring inconsistencies.The setting is present-day Minnesota where people carry smartphones, yet there are beads-and-sandals wearing hippies that seem to have time-traveled from 1960s California to reappear as ""tree huggers"" in the Boundary Waters; there's a Minnesota cop who is essentially a Clint Eastwood cowboy from a 1970s spaghetti western; there are Native Americans who are still using bows and arrows and painting their faces (that's right) and journalists, doctors, loggers and country attorneys who never seem to have progressed out of the 1940s.It's also breathtaking how much the author gets wrong about Minnesota - I kept asking myself throughout this book: ""Where was this guy's editor?""For example, take this sentence:""The ice melted and filled the thousand lakes of Minnesota and then the trees grew on top of the rock.""Say what? A thousand lakes? Or course, Minnesota is the ""Land of 10,000 Lakes."" It's on our license plates. Technically, Minnesota has 11,842 lakes if you want to Google it.Or this sentence:""Diane had the frankness that comes from watching a father die of black lung disease and going to work full time when she was just sixteen.""There is no black lung disease found in Minnesota miners. We have taconite mines and black lung disease is not associated with taconite mining, but rather, coal mining. Black lung disease is something you find in West Virginia or Kentucky - true, Minnesota miners have higher incidence of lung disease, but this is associated with asbestos and/or silica dust in mines. This produces a condition called mesothelioma, a disease of the outer lining of the lungs. To invoke black lung disease in a Minnesota story is simply culturally and scientifically ridiculous.Or this sentence:""Thought maybe it was the girl who was in the shed, but she didn't sound like she was from the lower forty-eight.""Again I have to ask in utter perplexity: Say what? I mean: ""The lower forty-eight""?What on earth is he talking about? Again and again, the characters use the term ""lower forty-eight"" to refer to anyone from outside of Minnesota - except that Minnesota IS ONE OF THE LOWER FORTY-EIGHT!No one that I know of here my home state of Minnesota refers to outsiders as being from the lower forty-eight, and why should we? We are among the lower forty-eight, we all know we are among the lower forty-eight, and so why refer to someone from, say, Illinois, as being from the lower forty-eight?It's just inexplicable! Again, where was this guy's editor?Speaking of bad editing, the books is loaded with clumsy sentences, downright grammatically incorrect constructions and confusing elements of time. As an example of a bad sentence, try this one:""Tom Jorde stabbed a computer resembling a large egg in a green T-shirt of white lettering--SAVE THE SPOTTED OWL FROM EXTINCTION.""Did the author really mean to suggest that an egg-shaped computer was wearing a t-shirt?Throughout reading this novel, I found myself literally gasping and searching with frustration for the best superlatives to describe what I was reading: absurd, ridiculous, painfully wrong ... even though this is merely fiction. But even when writing fiction, there should be some adherence to plausible reality unless you're writing out-and-out fantasy, not a mainstream novel.Much of my exasperation is with the way the author tries to handle ""Minnesota Speak,"" - his effort is clumsy and just beyond absurd (there's that word again.) I mean, whether the character is a doctor from Minneapolis, a lawyer, a redneck logger, a Native American or resort owner - they all talk like 100% Norsky-hillbilly hicks who just fell off the boat from Norway, smelling of pickled herring and lutefisk.Oh ya, you betcha, everyone talks like this here, you know ... ya, oh ya, fer sure, that's right there then what do yer think of that there here?Even Minnesota's Native Americans are portrayed to speak this way - and if you grew up with and have known Minnesota Natives for your entire life like I have - then you would understand how just exasperatingly ludicrous it is to make a Minnesota Indian sound like Sven Swenson from the old country, even in a work of fiction.Take it from me. I was born in Roseau, a small hockey-power town where the snowmobile was invented, and where the Polaris factory is still the primary employer. I also have worked as a newspaper reporter and Minnesota state government official - I have lived in a remote corner of Minnesota all my life -- but I have traveled all 87 counties of our state interviewing thousands of Minnesotans while writing about Main Street Minnesota over the past 30 years.So you can believe it when I say the only place in Minnesota where people speak like Ole and Lena is in Hollywood movies - such as Fargo -- and the occasional sketch on Minnesota icon Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion radio show.It's not that I am insulted by the way Mr. Hazelgrove or any fictional media like to play up the mythical Norsky-Hillbilly Minnesota speak - far from it - I think it's fun. I love it. I was delighted by the movie Fargo (one scene was filmed practically right in my back yard) - I loved police chief Marge Gunderson and auto dealer Jerry Lundegaard - and the way Frances McDormand and William H. Macy mastered and really nailed the faux-Minnesota accent - except this movie was CLEARLY PLAYING IT FOR LAUGHS.In JACK PINE, a serious murder mystery, we are expected to believe that regular, everyday Minnesotans from all professions and all walks of life, young and old, all talk like Ole Olson - he was a guy from my home town of Greenbush. Ole owned a Swedish potato sausage business in the 40s, 50s and 60s, died at the age of 97, born in 1905 - so yes, sure, he had that distinctive Scandinavian sing-song gate to his speech - but his generation are largely gone from our state and culture now.To be clear: My low rating of this novel goes well beyond my problems with the portrayal of the language - the writing is frequently muddy and unclear, the time sequencing of key events is confusing to say the least, the characters are cookie-cutter cliché props borrowed from Hollywood movies, the metaphors are strained, the descriptions of the Minnesota wilderness misfire ... and on and on.All this and I'm a big WILLIAM HAZELGROVE fan - this is the fourth of his novels I have read, and I have reviewed all here and given all my top rating. Hazelgrove is a fiercely talented novelist who is one our finest modern American novelists working today - but nobody is perfect - and Jack Pine is a certified bust.As penance for penning this disaster, I hereby sentence William Hazelgrove to read five JON HASSLER novels, two Sinclair Lewis novels, say three Hail Marys, strive to amend his life, and go in peace.IMPORTANT FINAL NOTE:Despite filling every page with characters aping the Hollywood faux-Minnesota Speak, the author fails to use even once the most genuine, ingrained and ubiquitous Minnesota idiom of them all, the one word that all Minnesotans actually and truly do use: UFF DA!That's right - not once! Minnesota! Home of the uff da taco! (A taco made with lefse for a wrap).Not one use of uff da! within a 300-page novel set in the culture of Minnesota.That is absolutely ridiculous.Please note: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest and objective review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRXDPJT5G5Y8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163393084X#wasThisHelpful","RRXDPJT5G5Y8F","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I did when I got this bag of chia seeds is whip up my favorite from-scratch buttermilk muffin recipe.I dumped in a half-cup of these chia seeds into my mixture and put them into the oven to bake. The result: Absolutely excellent muffins peppered with the wonderful look of these dark seeds throughout the yellow cake. They added just a tiny sense of crunch – they add no bitter taste or anything else unpleasant – just some extra good.Can you really taste chia seeds in bread and muffins? I don’t think so, but you can be certain that you are adding something important to these foods you will east anyway: protein, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants.One of my other favorite things to bake are Kaiser rolls. Before baking, you apply a brushing of egg wash on top the dough and then sprinkle with sesame seeds – but you can just as well sue these chia seeds. My Kaiser rolls turned out terrific.If you like a good, crunchy sesame seed roll, then you’ll love the same made with chia seeds.This is a remarkable food. Put a teaspoon in a smoothie, and you instantly supercharge your drink with loads of protein, fiber, omega-3 and antioxidants.If you let these seeds steep in some plain water for about 15-20 minutes, they turn into a gel. Here’s how to do it:Take about 2 tablespoons of chia seeds and put them in one cup of water. Whisk them around real good to make sure the seeds don’t clump up. Let it stand for about 15 minutes – and you have a very thick gel.There is all kinds of things you can do with chia-seed gel – such as eat it directly like a bowl of oatmeal or pudding. I like to put a little cream and brown sugar in it – and yum!  A super healthy, nutrition packed meal! And it’s extremely simple and idiot proof – thankfully for me.I received this 1-pound bag of chia seeds free from the supplier in exchange for my honest and objective review.This sample is as good or better than any brand of chia seeds I have used from other source – so it’s a no brainer to give this my top 5-Star review.

"I always like to convey my very first impression of a new product I am reviewing --- that means my immediate impression when taking the item out of the box - and so taking these Soundpeats A1 out of its shelf package made me think:""Ah, I like the look and feel of these headphones. At first glance they seem like a high quality product.""And after some days testing these headphones, I find that my first impression was mostly right once again.The short version of my review will tell you this: For the price, these are an above-average deal on a set of headphones that may not be ""high end,"" but they are definitely a big step up from any of those standard basic headphones we all tend to buy at Wal-Mart or Target for $10 to $15. At the same time, they may be just as good as perhaps $50 to $100 set.For a long time I have been getting by on the cheap with headphones and ear buds. The last set I bought were some of those regular kind of headphones with that black plasti-foam covering that do not cover the entire ear. I think I paid $8 for them, on sale.But using this A1 set from Soundpeat is a whole other experience. It makes a difference when you have headphones that cover the entire ear. It's been a long time since I had a set like this, and I forgot what I was missing. When you cover the entire ear, you not only focus all the sound inside and into your ear - but you block out unwanted sounds coming from outside.I was pleased that I could easily make these headphones pair with my Kindle Fire tablet. All I had to do was go in and turn on the Bluetooth button on the Kindle - and I was immediately getting sound into the earphone (this was after I charged them for about an hour using the provided UBS cable connected to my laptop).The sound quality itself it darned good - perhaps a perfect balance between bass tones and those higher tones that I like to be clear and distinct. I won't say the treble tones are especially high, scintillating and distinct as maybe I would like - but still, hard to complain.One of the primary things I use any set of headphones for is to listen to hemi-synch meditation tones - binaural beats consisting of alpha, theta or delta wave - and for that situation you want really good balance between right and left, and very clear sound transmission. For that purpose, these headphones perform extremely well.Positioned on the outside of the ear cups are variety of buttons, including volume control, power switch, ""previous"" and ""next"" buttons, a ""pause play"" button and jacks for both ""line in"" and USB port.These are difficult to find while you are wearing the headphones - until you get used to using them for a certain amount of time. You can ""teach your fingers"" where to reach the buttons easily after a bit of time and use.You get both a regular line-in jack for non-bluetooth direct usage with any device, a USB cable and a very nice soft black felt bag to carry everything in. Also - these headphones fold down flat, making them easy to fit in a suitcase or carrying bag.These headphones also have a built in microphone which makes it easy to use with your smartphone - the mic pics up your voice well - so you can enjoy hands free communication while using this product.The only slight drawback for me - both my wife and I find these headphones just a tad uncomfortable to wear, especially over long periods. They never seem to fit just quite right for my size and shape of head. You may have a different experience - I think it depends in your head/hat size and the shape for your head.The top headband is well-padded, but for me, still does not provide total comfort for where the top part touches the top of my head. I think people with more hair (yes, I'm rather thin on top) will not find this to be a problem.THE BOTTOM LINEFor the price, these are ALMOST a high-end class of headphones for a much lower price - great sound, very high quality construction, feel and function - I can recommend them without reservation. I detract one star only because the fit was not one of total comfort for me - but they be more comfortable for you.Please be aware that I received these headphones free in exchange for my honest, objective review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVOD381X6FKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STPHMI6#wasThisHelpful","R2AVOD381X6FKC","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a regular user of Quinoa (pronounced KEEN-WAH) for about two years. Back then I read about this Andean ""super grain"" in the food section of the Minneapolis StarTribune, jumped on the Quinoa bandwagon, and I have never gotten off since.That's because there is so much you can do with this incredibly versatile natural food.The first thing I did when I received this one-pound sample bag from Viva is dumb a cup of it into my Vita-Mix to grind it into a fine flour. It takes just about 90 seconds. I used this to bake bread using one of my favorite made-from-scratch recipes. I just add about a half cup of floured Quinoa to a one pound loaf mixture made from organic wheat berries, which I also grind to flour with my Vita-Mix.The result, of course, was a terrific, rich bread with just a hint of ""other"" flavor from the Quinoa - which I admit is difficult to describe. But I like adding Quinoa to a lot of my bread creations because I know I am getting a terrific nutrition boost, especially protein, iron, fiber - and also magnesium, folate B9 and B6.One of my favorite ways to use Quinoa is to prepare it as a breakfast cereal, similar to the way you would make milled or rolled oats.It's best to place Quinoa in a fine mesh and give it a rinse. Then just boil the grain for perhaps 20 minutes until soft. A little brown sugar and half-n-half or almond milk - just a fantastic, energizing breakfast.This Quinoa from Viva Labs is as good or better than any other I have purchased from other sources.  It is sourced directly from high plains regions of the Andes Mountains in Bolivia, so says the supplier. It's organically produced and they use a non-mechanical method to remove something called ""saponins"" from the grain - rather than removing this naturally bitter substance using a chemical process.I received this 1-pound bag of Quinoa free in exchange for my honest and objective review. I see no reason to give it anything other than my top 5-star rating because this is obviously a high quality product that's just as good, and probably better, than any other quinoa source. The grain is bright, clean, has very little dust or residue of any kind, tastes great and performs well in all my recipes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356C09NKIM4IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3EBI20#wasThisHelpful","R356C09NKIM4IU","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solidly-built, well designed clothing maintenance tool that fits well in the hand - the ergonomics are darned good. It's easy to grasp, point and move around as you steam wrinkles out of your clothing.So there is more than a little to like about this item -- but it will fall well short of my top recommendation for a number of reasons. But first a few more bright spots.WHAT'S GOODThe compact size of this steamer makes it good for traveling. At just 8 inches high and a maximum 5-inches wide it will fit well into a suitcase or traveling bag. It's light weight, about one pound. It has a generous 6-foot cord, and you want a long cord as you move around and steam articles of clothing.As I said, the handle is comfortable and the on-off switch is positioned just right to very conveniently click on or off.It heat up and starts producing steam amazingly fast. A jet of steam starts coming out strong in about 45 seconds; within 60 seconds, it's ready to go.WHERE I HAVE CONCERNSThe manufacturer says this hand-held steamer will get out ""even the toughest wrinkles."" I have my doubts about that statement after spending a lot of time steaming wrinkles on a variety of different shirts and slacks, made of a variety of materials, from 100% cotton to various synthetics and blends.It will definitely relax most of the wrinkles in most fabrics I found - but it has a tough time getting out ALL the wrinkles and some of the more pronounced ones. The instructions says that you have to steam BOTH THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE of the fabric to truly nail the wrinkles.  My experience is that this might be true - but I just don't think so for the ""wrinkliest"" wrinkles.A REAL POTENTIAL PROBLEM:As I was really getting into my steaming test, once or twice I waved the steamer around just a tad too vigorously - and some drops came splashing out the front spouts, getting wet spots on the clothing!If you splashed some of this water on your hands, you might get a burn. I'm not sure if this should be faulted to the manufacturer, or consider it a ""common sense"" issue - I mean, I suppose it should be obvious that one should take precaution when handling an item that is generating boiling hot water and steam.THE BOTTOM LINEIn my view, one should not expect a small unit like this to produce results that are similar to a professional dry cleaning service, wherein your clothing are made super wrinkle-free and perfect.This is more of a tool that you are using ""in a pinch"" while traveling on the road. It will allow you to make your clothing look better than it otherwise would have without having another, convenient way to iron out wrinkles. Most hotels and motels I know will lend you an iron if you ask for one at the desk - I don't think this steamer is an absolute substitute for an iron.For a guy like me who is not super fussy about eliminating every wrinkle, this steamer goes far enough to get my shirts into acceptably less wrinkled condition. It will get out most of your wrinkles - yes for sure. But in my view it doesn't produce professional results, or even match how good my mother was at getting our clothing wrinkle-free with her old-fashioned iron and ironing board.Please note that I received this item free in exchange for my honest and objective review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSTHCOK1V8UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWEO48U#wasThisHelpful","RLSTHCOK1V8UV","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If a pitcher or carafe is not made of glass or porcelain, it should be made with some kind of high quality material that is not “plastic-like.” The aesthetics and “quality feel” in a serving implement just makes it more pleasant for you and your guests.Thus, my first impression about the aesthetics of this infusion pitcher was a good one.  It’s made of a heavy, clear acrylic that gives the impression of a high quality product that is strong and functional, while looking good on your table. I think this item is especially nice for less formal gatherings, like outdoor picnics and barbecues. It sits pretty on a wooden picnic table, or your outdoor patio tables.The central idea behind the function of this item is also excellent: It’s healthy to drink a lot of fresh water every day, and if you can infuse that water with the flavor, vitamins and nutrients of fresh fruits – well, that’s simply a fantastic idea.As it happens, just as I took this pitcher out of its box, my wife came home from work, and she had stopped off to buy some lovely organic strawberries. We immediately washed the pitcher, sliced up some strawberries and filled the central tube with beautiful red berries and filled the jar with cold water from our 400-foot-deep Minnesota artesian well.Of course, common sense made me realize that the infusion process would not be immediate. After filling the tube with strawberries and cold water, we put the pitcher in the refrigerator to steep or “infuse” for a couple of hours. After about two hours, we could already taste just the very slightest hint of strawberry flavor.WIt was best, however, to let the pitcher infuse overnight. The next day, the result was absolutely excellent: We had cold water with a delicate, yet definite hint of strawberry flavor – not overpowering, no aftertaste – just fresh, light, delicate and delicious. Refreshing!No doubt the results vary much depending on what kind of fruit you choose to infuse. Lemons and limes offer a much more immediate effect because the juices of those fruits transfer much more readily into the water, and the “fruitiness” of the drink will be more powerful.At first I thought that the fruit might impart a certain cloudiness or bits of pulp or seed into the water, but I found this not to be the case. The water stays clear, while all aspects of the fruit remain inside the infusion tube, letting only flavor and juices through. This may vary with different kinds of fruits, however. For example, I wonder how watermelon would fair? I haven’t tried that one yet.Part of the fun of this product is experimenting with all the different kinds of fruits – maybe I’ll try some exotic fruits, such as starfruit.So far berries tend to be my favorite – raspberries are amazing and pomegranate is also pretty fabulous when infused using this set-up.As far as the functionality, I find little to complain about. The infusion tube twists on and off easily enough onto the underside of the cap. The top cap itself fits well, with an arrow on top that shows you where the cap should point and to stop tightening.  Everything fits snugly, with no rattling or looseness while the item is in use.Clean-up is easy enough. The only potential problem is getting some kind of build-up in the threads at the top of the infusion tube – but this simply has not been a problem for me.Note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and objective review. Whenever I get something free, I try extra hard to find something wrong with it – but in this case, all is well. The item deserves my 5-star rating. That’s my objective opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG7FZKZ4CYIW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6EFA2S#wasThisHelpful","RG7FZKZ4CYIW7","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is dandy little device that works like a charm.It’s simplicity itself. Just plug the unit into your car’s cigarette lighter and a pleasant blue LED light appears on the face of the item. Next, you plug in your device – tablet, Kindle, smartphone – and you get juice from your car to your power-hungry tool. (UBS cable not included).This makes it convenient and easy to bring your devices with you on your road trips, and you can be sure your gadgets will have a charge and power.The blue light means you won’t fumble around in the dark to find the ports.There are two different UBS jacks, so you can charge two devices at once. One of the slots is stamped 2.1A and the other is 1.0A. I assume this means that the higher number is a faster charger. Either way you get a charge, and you can’t run out of power on the road.This charger has a solid, well-constructed feel. It’s not “cheapy-plastic-like” because the finish is brushed aluminum that gives a slightly heavy-metal feel that I like in gadgets.There is a really nice gripping band etched into the metal on the outer rim that makes an already-easy-to-handle little plug a cinch to grasp and control with your fingertips.This is one of those “simple solution” items that solves a problem – power to your devices while on the road – and does it so easily you may almost take it for granted – but you’ll miss it if you don’t have it with you!I don't know if this matters, but, the box my unit was shipped in identifies this item as the ""SPEED BULLET"" (Premium Universal Car Charger).Finally, this item comes with a 12-year warranty, so I don’t see how you can go wrong. For the price, it’s something worth having. So small, it’s easy to slip into a pocket, purse or briefcase – or maybe just keep it in the cubbyhole.Please note I received this item free in exchange for my honest and objective review. I can find no fault with it; it’s all good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJF3Y96JJXO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFGDEG4#wasThisHelpful","R1UJF3Y96JJXO5","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own three dogs, but only one of them is the kind that needs a grooming ever so often – an energetic Border Collie/Australian Shepherd. He’s also inexplicably nervous about certain things, like strange noises.And so for me, this is a slight drawback to this otherwise solidly-built pet trimmer. That’s because when you click the power on it makes a surprisingly loud click, and then hums quite loudly as well as you operate it.However, there is way to reduce both the loud click-on noise and the ongoing buzz of the clipper: It comes with little tool that lets you turn a little embedded screw-type knob on the side. This will let you adjust the noise down – and it works well – but you sacrifice cutting power when you do that.In other words, the louder the buzz, the more power to the clipper blades, the quieter the less power you have. It all depends on how tough your pet’s hair is – all dogs are different.Another point: If you adjust the noise-level down, this may help your pet get accustomed to the trimmer. Once he or she realizes “it’s okay” you can probably turn it back up to full power – that’s the way it worked with my dog.  I Just want you to be aware of this noise factor. The noise suppression option is a solution – but perhaps won’t work for everyone.All in all, there is quite bit to like about this trimmer. Especially for the price, this might be a good choice for you. As I said, this clipper has a real “quality feel” in your hands – it’s heavy, has good power and is obviously a well-manufactured device.The blades are sharp and were able to adequately handle the hair of my border collie-shepherd. It comes with four interchangeable head guards that make it easy to cope with different lengths of hair. The head itself can also be adjusted up or down just slightly with a little black handle on the side.The cord is heavy duty and an excellent 6 feet and 5-inches long. With this kind of tool, you want a good long cord. High marks there.It also comes with a the fore mentioned sound-adjustment tool and a small brush for cleaning out between the blades after you’re done.I also like the very sturdy plastic carrying kit all of the above fits inside. It has a nice, easy-to-grip handle and shuts securely with some basic clips.As I said, when considering the low price, this is a surprisingly solid piece of equipment. I don’t give it 5-stars because I think the noise factor will be a problem for some – and there are obviously clippers that are more “high-end” on the market, if you are willing to pay a much higher price.But this unit is affordable, has a lot of little extras, and is definitely well built will gets the job done. It’s a 4-star for me – I suspect it will be a 3-star in the minds of some -- but also a 5-star in the minds of others.Please note that I received this item free in exchange for my honest and objective review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6HFA686Z50GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYE62YS#wasThisHelpful","R6HFA686Z50GY","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed after taking this lemon squeezer out of the box is its pleasant heavy and balanced feel. It’s of solid construction – an object of shiny, stainless steel beauty that rests smooth and cool in the hand.Expertly-machined, attractive, mirror finished and functional.So how does it work? It’s simple and terrific. Slice a fresh lemon, place it in the drainage bowl face down and press down with the handle. The juice flows right out, but pulp and seeds stay behind. You get pure fresh lemon juice or lime juice.This is light years better than any plastic lemon-lime squeezing device I have used. You'll never want to use one of those kind again, and this stainless steal model should last for years on end.The handles are thick offering good grip and leverage to apply pressure. I have a considerable case of arthritis, my hands and fingers are a bit gnarled, but I found this lemon squeezer comfortable to use.It’s easy to clean by hand wash or in your dish washer. Make sure you dry it well – I hand wash and use a soft dish towel to restore the polish of this attractive tool, which just looks good hanging on a hook in my kitchen. It’s a welcome part of the kitchen décor.I want you to know that I received this item free in exchange for my honest and objective review.Whenever I get a free item, I try extra hard to find something wrong with it, but this one is a no-brainer: It’s an elegant, simply, high quality tool, well made and works just as promised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEPIMSEP3ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIC4DF8#wasThisHelpful","RKEPIMSEP3ZR","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a high quality device that I am going to rate 5 out of 5 stars, with the understanding that, for some people, this may be a 4-star item. But I'm comfortable with giving it my top rating for the following reasons:HIGH QUALITY FEEL:When I first took this small recorder out of the box, I thought: ""That's more like it!"" I say that because it has that heavy, smooth, chrome-metallic feel that I like in a shiny electronic gadget.Just a few weeks ago I tested and reviewed a less expensive version - the iGearPro 8GB Digital Audio Voice Recorder - issued by the same company. But the less expensive recorder has a cheapy, plastic-like feel - and I did not like that.However, this device just feels metal-luxurious, like a slender silver ingot in your hand.RECORDING:The important thing to remember here is the primary function of this item. It's a DICTAPHONE. The dictionary definition of Dictaphone is: ""A small recorder used to record speech for transcription at a later time.""This means that this device is intended for close, upfront and personal recordings of voices - as in when you are making notes to yourself, dictating a letter, or just doing whatever personal recording you want to do. For this purpose, it's a perfect item because it performs flawlessly and easily. Just press the big red button on the front, and BOOM! You're recording.As a working journalist, I can also use this device to conduct interviews if I am face-to-face or standing next to my subject. It works great in that situation. But if I am covering a school board meeting, city council or county commissioners meeting - this item will not work very well to pick up all the voices in these kinds of large, public rooms. It's not intended to pick up voices from distances of more than, I suppose, eight to 10 feet.But always remember, this is a Dictaphone, and that means its primary function is to record your own voice up close and personal, or a person close to you. It does that well, so it delivers on what it promises.PLAYBACKThe playback speaker volume is adequate, but if you have dicey hearing like mine, you'll want to plug in the earbuds that come with this item, or use your own favorite set of earbuds or headphones. By Using earbuds you'll get superb playback sound that is as loud and clear as anyone needs, and the sound is high quality.EASE OF USEYes, it is easy to use - but there is a learning curve! You will need to read the instruction carefully and really twiddle around with all the functionalities before you get it down.Just as an example, adjusting the volume is not just a simple matter of pressing a button up or down. It's a multi-step task. To adjust volume, you ""short press"" the PLAY button, which causes the recording to go into ""pause mode."" Then you ""short press"" the ""V"" (Volume button) which causes the ""volume line"" to flash - and then to raise or lower the volume you press the ""Next"" button to raise the volume or the ""Previous"" button to lower the volume.See what I mean? You have to learn all these functional steps. It's perhaps easier than I make it sound here, but I just want you to know that learning the way all the functions work take time and patience, and reading the instructions carefully. Once you have it down, it's all super easy.FOR MUSIC OR MP3This device will definitely play MP3 files. You can also converted WAV files to MP3 using a software called Emicsoft Video Converter, which I'm fairly sure is a free download, but I'm not an expert.There is a USB cable that comes with this device that connects to your computer. The recorder will show as ""Removable Disk"" under devices - this is where you can transfer music files into the recorder.I'm not going to say much more about this because I am not an expert on music files, the different formats, etc. - I will say that I was able to download a song onto the device to test the quality, and the sound is absolutely terrific when you listen with high-quality ear buds or head phones.So if you want to listen to music on this - the sound is absolutely great with ear buds.SLIGHT DRAWBACKSI wish there was a way this device could be used to record telephone conversations more easily. It has no external mic jack, so you can't add an extra microphone of any kind, including one that will attach to a phone. I would love to be able to record telephone interviews using this - but I don't see how it can help in that situation.The great thing about this device is how small it is - and a drawback is - how small it is! If you have thicker ""man fingers"" like me, operating the little buttons is just a bit of a challenge.  The tiny screen is also challenging to view. I don't have perfect eyesight, but even with my prescription glasses and bifocal lenses, I still really have to squint to read the tiny symbols on the screen which is about 1-inch by 3/8 of an inch.I also wish there was some way to clip it to a pocket.BOTTOM LINEThis recorder is an item of very high quality construction, feel and performance. If you want a handy small personal recorder that can also play some music and transfer files (using it like a flashcard, sort of) this is an ideal item that delivers exactly what the manufacturer promises it will do. It's not an ""all purpose"" recording device - for example, it won't record public meetings or events in large rooms or outdoors very well - but that's not exactly what you would want this for ... it's your handy personal recorder.It will record up to a whopping 90 hours!So I give it five stars - and please note that I received this item free in exchange for my honest and objective review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C8YDVIBIXX9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW0VG2E#wasThisHelpful","R2C8YDVIBIXX9I","A1OICNXB30F29F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OICNXB30F29F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had heard lots about Shilajit back in India but frankly never really paid too much attention to look into it. This is mainly found in the Caucasus mountain areas and has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries & it is said to help a lot with various health issues. It took me awhile to try this out but after reading so much good about it I bit the bullet. At first I didn't know what to expect & what it would taste like. It actually looked like Tar & one day I finally did it. It tasted like crap as is & then I started mixing it in my tea & it was Fine, I wondered why I didn't do it (mix) in the first place. Once mixed in a beverage you don't really taste the Burnt Flavor of it. I have hypothyroid & have low energy to do things & decided to try it. It did help feeling energized. It was like a kick that I needed. I'm glad to have received this to test out in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.

"Very Impressed with this Vbiger Western Style Genuine Leather Belt! I wasn't really sure if hubby would like this or not. But I ordered it anyway & when it came, I was very happy with the quality & making of the belt. Hubby really like it too which is Great as it's tough to shop for him. It's a good quality, well made belt but a little big. Hubby is waist 34 & it was big for him, but luckily it comes with a hole punching tool so it was great & after we punched an extra hole it was perfect for him. I'm glad I received this discounted to test out in exchange for my honest unbiased review. First it came very packaged in a nice box, very impressive. Secondly it's a good quality & durable product.

"This Tackedoo Kids Scooter is a great for kids. My son Loves It & so do I for him. My son is 3.5 years old & this is his first scooter but he is able to easily maneuver it & is pretty comfortable & confident using it. It came very well packed in a box & was Super easy to put together. All that needed to be done was to insert the handle pole into the base of the scooter until you hear a click sound & it was secured & locked into place. that's it! And it was ready for kids to Enjoy it! This is a good durable quality product. I am glad I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Very Happy with it. It is lightweight compared to others I've seen. The handles on this are covered with a textured silicone/rubber for his little hands to keep a good tight grip. The deck platform is a good size width wise for little feet & has enough room. This seems to offer a smoother ride & is actually better than I had expected. My son is still a beginner/learner & seems to be doing pretty well with it. I am just happy that he is learning to ride a scooter.

"This is seemingly two different products rolled into one.  The first is that it is a bluetooth scale that you use your iphone/iPad to read the weight on.  This hooks up to the Drop app to let you see how much is being weighed let's you tare the scale, etc.  The second part is more the meat of the scale, this is a series of recipes that are setup by weights.  You add the item and then it instructs you to do the next item etc.  This allows you to basically make a series of recipes without measuring, just putting it in the bowl on your scale.  The good part is you can adjust the ratios as well, automatically shrinking/expanding the recipe.  The app includes quite a few recipes, and not just food for dinner, but also ways to make cocktails and drinks (which is great since it's quick and more precise).The biggest downside of this scale is that you there is no visible read out on the scale itself.  That means if you want to pull it out and weigh anything (say one ingredient) you have to open up the app, which makes it a huge pain.  Would love to have both functionalities.  Would also be nice to maybe see third party apps have access to an api, this would allow for a coffee pour-over scale, measuring brew ratios and blooms, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVF1ZXLHU5U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTY34KG#wasThisHelpful","R3QVF1ZXLHU5U3","AMS2CPERWN7JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMS2CPERWN7JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item at no cost in exchange for an honest review.I was pretty concerned about getting a third party band, since it seems a lot of them have issues.  I've wore this for the last week, and it's so far been great.  I haven't actually felt or seen the Apple official milanese loop bracelet, but this feels like other milanese loops I've had for other watches (albeit this one has magnetic clasp).  The lugs fit in smoothly, solid click when they were hooked in, and haven't had a single issue with them so far.  (one thing to note is that the doubled over loop should be on the side closest to you).So now the not so great.  There is a very large BRG logo on the clasp (you can see it in the photos).  Unfortunately it feels pretty solid, so I don't think you're going to be able to scrape it off or anything.  The only other issue I've had is that the magnetic clasp wants to hook on to everything, other parts of the band, and if you're not careful it will click on to the bottom of the optical sensor as well (since there is a magnet there to hold the charger), it didn't  cause any damage, but something you need to be careful with (not sure if the Apple one has the same problem).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GCYM19MLUTHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016MW43NO#wasThisHelpful","R2GCYM19MLUTHH","AMS2CPERWN7JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMS2CPERWN7JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Andrew Jones is back and is now working with ELAC.  I believe ELAC is new and this is their debut line of speakers.  This 10"" 400 watt sub is one piece, but they also offer floor standing, center  channel, rear/bookshelf speakers, along with a larger 12"" 1000 watt sub, and a smaller 10"" 200 watt sub.  I only have the sub so far, so this review will focus on that, but if the Pioneer Andrew Jones lined of products was any foreshadowing, all of these products are going to be fairy affordable while sounding great.This sub is unique in that you use your phone (iOS/Android) to setup and adjust the sub settings. Both this sub and the larger 12"" have a EQ functionality where you position your phone close to the sub, and then where you listen and it will automatically EQ the sub.  This process is very quick and so far has worked quite well for my room (the room and sub have a peak around 100z, and this automatically lowered it).  The sub itself sounds great, kicks out some impressive lows for a 10"" sub (The sub itself is down firing, the grill you see on the front is the passive radiator). The enclosure is quite small and compact, smaller than my old 10"" 150 JBL subwoofer, and by quite a bit.  It also sounds considerably better, tight responses, low frequencies, and because of the EQ you never hear the boom it just fills in the sound near perfect.The app is not all that pretty on iOS, but it works without crashing, works quickly and I had no problems with it.  You can use the app to adjust the EQ (manually if you want), do the automatic EQ, adjust the sub mode (normal, music, cinema, night), adjust the volume (0-100), change the crossover level, adjust the phase (and you an adjust it in degrees) along with other tuning.This sub is the best I've heard and used, I can't imagine what the 12"" can accomplish, maybe once I get the rest of the ELAC set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CHCI4ENQAGM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GSEVFQ#wasThisHelpful","R2CHCI4ENQAGM6","AMS2CPERWN7JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMS2CPERWN7JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a couple of different ways to get humidity into the air.  Vaporizer style (by heating), ultrasonic (essentially vibrates the water and makes the mist) and cool mist via evaporation/wicking.  This model is the evaporation/wicking style.  There are some differences, namely that the evaporation based ones use wicks/filters to more easily evaporate the water, which need to be replaced.  Since they are cold, they should also be disenfected/cleaned as well.  What I enjoy though is that you don't have to worry about humidity, just turn it on and as it runs it water will evaporate and you can't ever get too much in the room (although to be fair it sometimes can be hard to get enough in the room, getting closer to a specific amount).This specific model has two modes, high and low, he high is about equal to our (quiet) air purifier, and the low is a whisper, you can barely hear it (essentially this adjusts the fan inside, which is fairly large, hence the low noise).  The water tank isn't very large (.8 gallons), but lasts a few days for us, it's also a softer feeling plastic, which lends itself to be more break resistant (I have broke a couple of these on other machines..) There is a spot for Vicks vapor rub packets, which is nice, but probably won't ever use.  Overall it's very quiet and it is very simple to use.  Wish it had a slightly larger tank, but having to fill it every other day or so isn't bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LK9M5THOBIUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410YUH8#wasThisHelpful","R1LK9M5THOBIUU","AMS2CPERWN7JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMS2CPERWN7JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pot-Pourri, first of all a slightly off putting name, but also very great (at least the people who might turn up their nose at it will see a fancy flowery bottle and never read it).Have used a few different scents and while they all smell similar (the stand out is the Royal Flush one which is in the black bottle), they use essential oils to basically make a strong and mostly pleasant scent to cover up your business.  It does say that you should spray it into toilet BEFORE going, but I much prefer using it after.The bottle is nice as is the sprayer, and it also has an indicator on the side showing how much is left (via a transparent toilet paper mockup).  The only annoying part is the cap likes to fall off pretty easily, would be nicer without that I think (you can just throw it away though).Overall it works really well, makes the house smell good.

We use this with our kids and it gives a good flavor and some health to a smoothie with little fuss.

"We needed a humidifier for our kids room, we've been using a vaporizer, but it gets messy and a pain to fill each night.  This humidifier is cool mist and also is ultrasonic so it means it's going to keep putting humidity into the air (which is great to get the humidity up, but can be a pain if you turn it on too high and make a rainforest in your room).This Vicks humidifier is a lot like some of the other ultrasonic ones we've used in the past, but there are a couple of things I like about it.  One is that instead of low/medium/high it has an 'infinite' adjustment for the humidity.  It also has a slot so you can put the vicks medication in (and it comes with the vapo rub one).  We haven't used it yet, but liked the idea since that was one thing we thought we were giving up with getting rid of the vaporizer.The other really cool feature is there is an LED light on the back pointing up, it has three options (sea life, jungle animals and stars) after you select one the LED rotates through each one a few seconds at a time (3 options, each have 3 things it rotates through).  Our kids really like it, gives them a bit of extra light and a fun thing in their room.Nice small size, do not have to refill often, has a place for 'medication' and the LED's, really great for our kids rooms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQJYA2ARKJGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014P0LJSW#wasThisHelpful","R1JQJYA2ARKJGE","AMS2CPERWN7JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMS2CPERWN7JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This kit mixes it up a bit, instead of the blasters you get a crane that you can swing at the different structures.

You poor into the molds, which are essentially just thicker pieces of plastic, and after it's cooled you can pop them out easily and you have a fun looking soap.  There are gift boxes included that you need to pop out of the sheet and fold to assemble -- they are all pretty adorable (and my daughter was super excited to put the soap in them).There are more advanced things you can do, pour different colored soap into one part of the mold, let it cool slightly and then pour the other color in to get a a beehive with a different colored bee on it for instance.Super simple setup for trying out the basics of soap making, my five year old loved doing it and was excited to make soap for her grandmas.

"FLIR is known for their thermal imaging cameras, although more recently they have branching out to other products (consumer security cameras, etc).This camera is a combination of a few things, but designed to track moisture.  It includes a thermal imaging camera, but specifically tuned/colored to find slightly cool places that would show evaporation.  So you won't get the red/orange/blue highlighting like you expect on a thermal camera, just shades of blue here, along with the gray of other outlines.There are two additional moisture sensors, a pin-less one which requires you to touch the device to it, and then a standard pin style, which has two probes and connects to the bottom of the MR160.The camera is a good way to discover things that could be leaking, walked around our basement where we've been having some issues and it outlined the places where it was wet.  The pinless moisture sensor works pretty well, although just grabs the surface which might not always be as accurate as you need it to be, the pin probe works as expected.The device itself is rugged, padding to protect for drops, thick rubber buttons, it looks like the camera itself is waterproofed, although I can't find much about it.  You can take photos with it, and then connect it via usb to gather them off later (no removable memory card).  It has a built in rechargeable battery as well, not user replaceable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLABQ4EO9AYKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2PTJK6#wasThisHelpful","RLABQ4EO9AYKM","AMS2CPERWN7JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMS2CPERWN7JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this machine both incredibly frustration and also incredibly amazing.Never having used one before I found it a bit daunting.  The instruction manual is very poor, it gives some guidance but no specifics.  The software installs easily, but is highly complicated and not easy to get going.  No easy walkthrough or anything.  My biggest thing was trying to figure out how to emboss and cut with it, the blade/embosser would just go way above the material.  It wasn't until I figured out that you need to layer some of the other platforms below the one you are using to get it high enough, maybe I missed this, but I had no direction on how this was supposed to work.  (The software will give some direction on cutting depth after you select the material).Couple of things to note, it comes with a fine embosser, wide embosser and a adjustable depth cutting tool.  It comes with the 8.5"" x 6"" version of those mats as well.  There are a ton of additional tools, different cutters, stipling tips, pens, tools for etching, metal, etc.  You can also get larger 8x11 (I think) versions of the cutting/embossing mats for larger items.Embossing is interesting because you have to buy their specific paper as far as I understand, since the tool itself just doesn't have enough strength to emboss normal paper or things like card stock.  Which is a bit sad since this is one of the tools that is included.  Trying out the cutting tool once you get a pattern setup is pretty amazing, super fast and incredibly precise.I'd recommend watching some videos on youtube on how to use it, there are tutorials where people make entire cards that combine embossing, cutting, drawing, etc and show you how to do it fairly quickly with some pretty cool results.  I haven't done any mixed mode things like that yet, but great to know I can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365WNGLXUF8YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOU0W4K#wasThisHelpful","R365WNGLXUF8YF","AMS2CPERWN7JV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMS2CPERWN7JV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The launcher is a bit tricky for our 3 and 5 year old to figure out, they always wanted to launch them backwards, but they got it figured out.The only downside is that the wings are foam material, which makes them light, and it's fairly durable.

Our five year old could do it, but took her awhile to do each one.The arrows themselves are pretty nice, they each have led lights (and come with batteries in them, smaller hearing aid like batteries), you flick the switch and it lights up.

"I loved this book. It is a serious look at a serious problem facing the church overall. In the last few years some very destructive teachings blew through Christianity and now even denominations that stood firmly on sound conservative doctrines are falling for the most basic errors. The Bible itself is under attack from pulpits and seminaries.It feels like a gigantic bowling game in which lethal cannonballs are launched by the enemy every second, and churches fly in every direction like bowling pins. The church has always been under attack by the enemy down the centuries but this is suddenly expanding in frequency and intensity around the world.Sifting is a good word for what is happening. As the author explains this term is used as the process of separating good from bad, wheat from chaff. And as the author makes clear, this sifting is something God is doing to separate believers from unbelievers and to test and determine our loyalty to God and His Word.But it's not just churches, it is individual Christians, seminaries, so called Christian schools & universities. All who call themselves as Christian are being tested & sifted.This is a comforting & encouraging book to help Christians stay the course. As I've read it, I've been comforted by the fact it is happening to others—not just me, that God is in charge, and that this is something that God is allowing to refine my faith, to get me to straighten up in areas, to remain faithful in other areas. As I read the book I was challenged to be more consistent in my actions, I was happy to see the long view. And I’m encouraged to see how this fits into a prophetic profile that Jesus Himself foretold.In fact as the author explains, persecution for your beliefs means you are actually reflecting Christ to a fallen world. They hated Him, and if you are like Him, they’ll hate you too. It’s a badge of honour. And it’s a sign of His soon return!!!This book puts suffering and persecution in perspective from God’s long view, the big picture, and it’s helped me really rejoice in God’s hand working in things that really perplex me right now. Overseas the rise of Muslim terrorism is resulting in wholesale slaughter and persecution of Christians. Here in the west, there are the increasing attacks on Christians for holding the Biblical belief on marriage out in the workplace. It’s hard to be a baker, or a photographer or a florist or even a pizza place owner now for fear of what the militant arm of the politically correct movement will do if you don’t agree with them. The author helps us see why God allows this, and what it does for the church.For a start, you can now tell who believes the Bible enough to endure persecution. For years we have had comfortable pews in Christendom. If we haven’t lived in a Muslim country, if we grew up in the West built on the foundation of Judeo Christian principles--then it’s been comfortable to be a Christian. So comfortable it’s been easy to blend into the culture and have the culture blend into us.Within the church, there has been so much ""culture creep"" as the author calls it. Compromise positions!And now God is proposing a litmus test to see who the cultural “Christians” are versus the Bible Believing God Honouring Christians are.Turns out, they are the ones willing to put their lives on the line for the cause of truth. They are the ones speaking out against the erosion of freedom of speech and religion on the behalf of bakers, pizza makers and florists who have drawn a line they will not cross even under fierce pressure and the loss of their business and their life savings and their very homes! Horrifyingly in the Muslim world, Christian martyrs are dying daily for their faith in Christ.It's a time of testing over all the world and it's amazing and encouraging sometimes as we see these Christians take a stand for Christ.This same litmus test applies to our treatment of the Bible. Will we believe God, and His Word? Or will we water it down, cut bits out, make it comfortable and lose our Christian distinctiveness along with our way.We see the rise of the Seeker Friendly & Purpose Driven church structure which is more influenced by marketing methods than the Bible, and by its obsession on becoming relevant to the culture it is rapidly losing its biblical distinctive to be different, to be salt & light!!! We have the Emergent movement which likes to self identify as evangelical while attacking the foundational principles that evangelicals have clung to for generations.Gilley in This little church went to Market explains it this way; not many years after the liberals of the early 1900s ""won"" their war against the fundamentalists, their churches went into a decline from which they haven't yet recovered. If the church isn't offering anything significantly different from the world the church is unnecessary. The liberal church of that time marginalized itself by compromise with modernism.How is it different today?The emergent, seeker friendly, purpose driven churches are going lemming like over the same cliffs as the liberal denominations of the last century. Just with a little more panache from the cafe culture in the foyer. We now have Karl Barth version 2.0 with a latte and a side of jazz.What is going on? Christianity seems to be taking a suicidal leap into every possible error, many of which past generations recognized and combated by building solid doctrinal bulwarks to guard the flock. The biggest bulwark is the Word of God.The Bible itself is under attack. Genesis is chopped to bits by seminarians pontificating on the origin of man (was it God’s direct act or did He just set evolution in motion?). How about Noah’s flood that they call a local flood while Jesus and Peter refer to it as a total flood. The Rainbow Promise of God in Genesis becomes a lie if those liberal theologians are correct because God said He wouldn’t EVER send another world wide flood, and gave the rainbow as a sign of that promise. If the flood was local, then God lied, and we can stop right there. There have been many local floods since then. God didn’t lie, but the liberal theologians who chop the Bible into bits they like and bits they don’t want, THEY are the liars.Christians who take God’s Word seriously have no problem with God creating a single man and woman from whom we are all descended. Because if we weren’t all “in” that single male ancestor called Adam when he sinned then who sinned causing the fall of all mankind? If we didn’t all fall in Adam, then the Cross becomes meaningless. And just how big and powerful IS GOD anyway? Big enough to create a whole universe and then some, in a literal 6 day event or a somewhat powerful someone who has to use a little evolutionary help along the way. Think about it.  As Ken Ham so ably puts it, when we chop up Genesis and Revelation, the stuff in between loses all meaning and relevancy. The Bible is a whole message from God to us and we don’t get to pick and choose which verses to believe and which to ignore. They are all relevant.In the middle of all this sifting, we see different Christians being raised up with a public voice, often explaining why it is so important to follow God’s Word that they will lose their bakery, their home and their entire life savings. Preachers who are unafraid to preach a clear true message are raised up. Churches willing to stand on the Word of God are losing the compromised and gaining the believing who are ready to be part of a church that really believes the whole Bible.THE TRUTH gets preached.And the rest of us figure out where our allegiances lie!God is with us, no weapon formed against us will prosper. We are to go -- go into all the world, preach the Gospel, be salt, be light. Spread the Word. Be ready, with an explanation for the Hope that is within us.The battle is in our minds and hearts, we are literally casting down speculations and other high and lofty ideas that set themselves up against the knowledge of GOD.We do this by being in the Bible, reading it daily, meditating on it, praying daily. Abiding in the vine, means staying in relationship to our Lord. Conforming our actions and our beliefs to what the Bible says.We aren’t to save society, we are to confront people with their need for a Saviour, and when they believe, they change and society changes for the better as a consequence.When we get too modern and missional to preach the Word of God that makes people get mad or get saved then all is lost. We need to be missionaries who make people uncomfortable so that they are given a decision for or against God. The kind of evangelism that God commands is what transforms society around us. But we have to be ready to take a few knocks along the way.Mike Henderson takes a long view & sees an overall trend. This is a day of division, of sifting, of seeing who really is on the Lord’s side. And this is a very good book. I’m glad he wrote it, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWBN9WJM9XLJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W994F2O#wasThisHelpful","RWBN9WJM9XLJ9","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happily give this a 5 star rating. Many reasons.Ron writes in a kind and even handed fashion. Preface and Postscript he reminds the reader to debate, not divide, and to remain charitable throughout. He wants to help us understand the viewpoints of others within Christianity on these large debatable issues, so that we are not just setting up straw men in order to knock them over or yelling over each other’s heads.Unwilling to divide over non-essentials of the faith, he still understands the debates and is able to give a generous thumbnail sketch of each position. However if you need ammo for your next big round of the pre trib post trib rapture or the dispensational versus covenant wars, this is just a sketch to acquaint us with the landscape on which the battles are being fought.Ron gives us his position in each of the debates, but frames the arguments well enough that people from other positions will feel quite comfortable in his descriptions of their positions. He outlines strengths and weaknesses of each position including his own.Each section deals with one of these 8 debates, and includes chapters on major points within each debate.I won’t review each chapter but I’ll finish with a quick look at debates 1 and 2 as an example.Debate #1: Should Prophecy be interpreted literally or allegorically? In that section for example he has 2 sub chapters entitled 1. The Hermeneutics of Bible Prophecy: Literal or Allegorical and 2. Covenant Theology versus Dispensationalism.In that first chapter Ron looks at how the church began to move from a literal interpretation to an allegorical one and why. He points out that this makes a BIG HUGE difference to how we see things like the millennial reign of Christ or whether Israel was replaced by the church.In explaining the literal position he quickly removes a common straw man argument. He explains clearly that the literal method doesn’t eliminate figures of speech, the use of symbols and parables. He explains how this is determined within a literal understanding. So glad he covers this as it is one of the most annoying features in any debate between these systems and takes up a lot of time often obliterating the actual arguments pro and con. He does this sort of straw man clearing up throughout the book.The second chapter deals with Covenant theology versus Dispensational Theology. He gives a thumbnail sketch of both classical and modified covenantalism, along with traditional, revised and progressive dispensationalism. All 5 use a literal hermeneutic for the basics of the faith but begin to differ sharply when it comes to prophecy.I wish I’d had this years ago. I had a dear friend who was and is firmly amillennial. If I’d had more of an understanding of the Reformed Covenant Theology that she was coming from, maybe I could have explained things better. As it is, we have never argued about it, merely agreeing to disagree and laughing over the possibilities of meeting in the Rapture.Debate #2 Are Israel and the Church Distinct in Bible Prophecy gets right down to something sweeping thru the church and that is the theological underpinnings of replacement theology. Dr. Rhodes does a good job of that, For more on that Hal Lindsay wrote a really good book, long since out of print that I have and recommend called The Road to Holocaust. I just bought Dr Reagans newest book The Jewish People: Rejected or Beloved which I hope is along those lines, but I’ve not delved into it yet.Later in the book such popular topics as when the Ezekiel invasion occurs, how Daniel’s 70th week relates to Revelation and whether we CAN identify Babylon or not.Ron Rhodes is a gentleman and a scholar. More important he writes well, and is easily understood. This isn’t something only a person with a theology degree can plow thru, this is something for ordinary Christians to enjoy whether they know anything about prophecy or not. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UP3LCHD0DPTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFWFC1E#wasThisHelpful","R2UP3LCHD0DPTM","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brief 37 page booklet by a great mind of the past. Brings clarity to an often confusing subject as this author so often can. Well worth reading at any price. Very helpful that Ironside put full Bible quotations that he uses to make his points so that the modern reader doesn't have to go back and forth to prove whether these things be so, as HAI sticks it right in there. This man is one of the ones who can make complex ideas clear and easy to grasp. Glad I got it, it's one to read over and over as different points will come out each time.I'm a grandmother of 3 and my own dear grandfather used to read and love Ironside.

"Worth what it costs at 99 cents. This is a very short article focusing on the minimalist wardrobe often touted by magazines as quintessentially French.

"It's OK. I enjoyed the tongue in cheek humour which was the best part of this book.As for a sociological look at being Parisian, Oliver Magny wrote a more interesting and funny take on Parisian habits as did Ines de la Fressange. Mireille Guiliano's series based on French diet have more insight into what makes ""them"" tick if the ""them"" you wish to observe or emulate is the mythical French woman.Most of the ""outsider looking in"" at Paris genre of books are better if that is what you want. Perhaps because outsiders whether American (Entres Nous by Debra Ollivier or Jennifer Scott's Madame Chic books or Anne Barone's Chic and Slim series) or British (Helena Frith Powell in All You Need to be Impossibly French) do a far better job of nailing down the Paris way of living. Those who live the life don't always see the bits that make them different any more than a compatriot can spot someone with their own accent.That said, it's worth reading if only for the funny bits and the absurd lists.The reason I didn't give it higher marks is a certain distasteful treatment of men. How to upset them or make them think you are having an affair seems pointless. If you are a grown up, and you love someone you don't hurt them. If you don't love them, then why waste your time and theirs. Move on. Don't hurt someone for sport. If they hurt you, Move on! Life is too short to waste on petty nastiness or manufactured drama. Too much of the book dwells there and even though it is tongue in cheek, it has a certain pre feminist feel to it dating back to a time when we judged ourselves on the basis of whether we could attract lots of men and preferably ones with bigger bank balances. Pointless and stupid.However the genuine fun stuff does outweigh the distasteful comments and overall the book was fine. Probably better to get from the library first to see if you like it enough to buy it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C6KULNESU0IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWTSFYO#wasThisHelpful","R3C6KULNESU0IU","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really appreciate this book in it's thoughtful measured approach to dealing with the curve balls life throws at a woman after 50. From rosacea to hot flashes, picking out the dress to wear at your child's grad or their wedding day. How to camouflage bingo wings or a buddha belly and other difficulties that erupt.Kim is open and candid about her challenges from her weight gain around her belly, her new jowls along with the hazards of divorce, changing careers and dealing with a sharply reduced budget.Her closet has to change, but there are new realities that she never imagined as a fashion editor and co author of the chic simple book series (which I liked very much too).As she moves through her closet, aiming for comfortable chic clothing that makes her feel good and doesn't blow the budget she explains how to bend what you have to fit your new reality. This isn't a checklist of must have clothes for the chic over fifty woman. But she does explain the new realities so you can figure out what looks best on your, in your life, with your body.I got this in kindle and in hardcopy. I prefer to mark up my books, highlight bits, make notes in the margins and this is a very conversational book that almost begs you to do that.The only irritant for me wasn't the references to ""the alien"" which is her pet name for her new buddha belly but rather the constant ""grown up girl"" phrase. I'm a grown WOMAN, and girl sounds funny to my ears. I own my age--58, my wrinkles, my sunspots and changed shape. I AM a grandmother, a wife, a mother and an in law. What I am not, is a girl. I bumped into that phrase a lot in a few other books written by American women about aging successfully so it may be a cultural thing. Where I live that is almost a put down, a way of demeaning a woman calling her a girl or girly.As for the ""alien"" I saw it as a metaphor that encompassed her physical age changes but also the alien bits of her new life-- divorced, living on less money, changed career and all that entails. I actually found it endearing and made me understand the book and the author better because age is alien. When we were younger we felt sure we would age better somehow, do it with more panache. We wouldn't let ourselves slide. Now on the other side of the divide, I look at Catherine Deneuve and love that she put on some weight, looks happier and more grounded than ever, and is still a classic beauty but more of a queen than a princess. At no time does she lose her regal bearing. Aging is a process of dealing with stuff that happens unexpectedly, sometimes overnight. Divorce, or death change life drastically and for most women we outlive the men we marry if the divorce stats don't get us first. That alien she deals with is ours too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2ZS6IV564N8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00351DSGO#wasThisHelpful","RD2ZS6IV564N8","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best in it's class for learning about colours that flatter the individual, NOT just their ""season"". I remember the old version, this is new and even improved. I liked the older book, but this has a fuller more updated set of suggestions and guidelines.First off, the colour theory. She sensibly explains how that may not work if you fall in between. She is right, I've had consultants label me spring, winter and fall. Her suggestions on how to determine the tones and intensities of each colour help narrow down the range that will look best, not just OK. She explains how a high contrast person (pale skin, dark eyes and hair) looks better in high contrast colours and prints while a low contrast person (beige ivory skin and beigey blonde hair for example or pale milk chocolate skin and medium brown hair) looks best with low contrast softer prints and colour combos.Secondly her advice on the lines that will suit different figures are WELL illustrated, and come thru very clearly on my kindle version. If you are unsure of which wardrobe book will give you the best visual guide to the best lines for your shape, this is the best, even above the ""Does this make me look fat"" classic by Leah Feldon or ""How Not to Look Fat"" by Charla Krupp. And this book has way more good advice on other aspects of choosing a wardrobe that works for you.Another chapter worth the price of the book just on it's own is how to make minor adjustments either by tailoring or using sleeve rings (she explains those too) or just how you tuck things in to look your best. The models she uses are real life women not models, and they come with all their real life flaws and challenges. The before and after photos are VERY instructive. The tone is encouraging and inclusive. This is for women of all backgrounds, skin tones, finances and figures.Another section on home sewing which will help anyone planning to start sewing, or even taking clothes to the tailor.Third she includes a whole tutorial on scarf and pashmina tying. Again, very well illustrated on my Kindle.She also has sections on closet organizing, shopping, and care and maintenance of the clothing you have.Finally for the closet minimalists and Parisienne closet mavens (and you know who you are) she gives a quick tutorial on the capsule wardrobe concept, using the 12 piece model. She includes work, leisure and dress up capsules and explains how to think about your real life needs based on how much time you live in each category. The accessory capsules are another chapter I consider worth the price of the book just on their own.She finishes with a short section on travel which from my own experience is MUCH easier using the capsule concept. You truly can pack light but make multiple outfits out of a capsule wardrobe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUWJR9JOR7CKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6WPZ18#wasThisHelpful","RUWJR9JOR7CKW","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just read all the way thru. LOVE this. It is an extension of her first Madame Chic book, with more in depth lessons on moving through daily life in a graceful comfortable way. I'm a fan of her writing, having bought her first self published book (the first Madame Chic before it got redone by a publishing company) then buying the edited and slightly more finished version of that book. YES it's worth every penny.Now this one. Well worth the wait. I'm her mother's age group, my dd is a married mother of 3, the first 2 being similar ages to Jennifer's daughters. Some things sound like my daughter, coping with daily life caring for small people and a husband, dog, house and a writing career. Busy young mother.But it's also a compendium of things it took me YEARS, DECADES to learn. How to care for oneself in the midst of happy family chaos. Setting priorities. Dejunking. Enjoying where you are at NOW, not being so goal driven that you fail to appreciate the small moments of bliss in the present.Well done Jennifer!This book will appeal to the francophiles but I hope it will have a broader audience because what she is getting at is universal and it's a toolbox as she calls it. One that leads to a balanced and contented attitude in the middle of life being lived realistically.Yes it's written through a ~""French woman who has it all together"" ~ filter, but that is just the beginning. It's culturally applicable to most western lives, and it's speaking to the need for all women to attain balance between being caregivers and caring for themselves as well. Not being people pleasers but charting their own life path.There is a bit more California in this book, referring to positive affirmations (nothing wrong there) and Feng Shui but the French connection is woven across the entire book. One of the many things I enjoyed was her music recommendations in each chapter. So much fun mixed into the practical reality of organizing a coherent life.Love it, well worth getting, and I have the kindle version which I'm delighted to say has a great table of contents and a good easy layout with pleasant line art illustrating each chapter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJZN702FO9O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWTWIJW#wasThisHelpful","RMJZN702FO9O9","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Couldn't put it down! Sharp biting wit, intelligent observations on all kinds of topics. Funny, witty and well worth getting. I really enjoyed her little snippets about famous names like Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor and other people she has known over the years.Her comments on manners, compassion for others as well as common sense concerns about such things as flying and traveling safely nowadays are not at all politically correct or censored in any way, and in my opinion completely true.This is a keeper from someone with a biting wit and the ability to tell it as she sees it, no self censorship or pc babble allowed.I particularly enjoyed her comments on skin care and weight although she is very blunt particularly when it comes to weight which is actually helpful if you want to lose it and keep it off like people used to be able to do in the fifties. This is not sugar coated, and it may offend modern sensibilities. She doesn't see weight as a disability but as an end result in changes in the food supply along with changing attitudes to portion sizes. Couple that with bad dietary advice based on bad science promulgated by the likes of Ancel Keyes and you have a whole planet of people attempting to eat healthy and gaining weight, acquiring Type 2 diabetes and worse. Gary Taubes has written plenty on this subject if this idea is new to you but Joan's observations line up with the research done in the last few decades.She hit the nail on the head when talking about pregnancy;. She tells what a dietician told her to eat for a healthy pregnancy, and it mirrors what I was told. Whole grains up the wazoo, never mind the effect all those ""healthy"" carbs have on blood sugar, fat storage and so forth. Unlike her, I did what the dieticians of that era said, and gained over 60 lbs while eating as ordered. Needless to say I didn't lose all of it, and the next baby added on. I wish I'd had her common sense and courage to stick to her own usual food intake plus some vitamins and call it a day.I did not find her harsh on people with disabilities, as another review stated. She is big on personal responsibility for your own choices such as food, but she saves her real wrath for able bodied people who refuse to give up a seat on the bus for pregnant women or the elderly or infirm. She blasts those who ignore people who need help, and those whose selfishness puts others around them at risk.Some sharp and pithy observations on reality TV and it's effect on children and society at large round things out.Love the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U4LC7WO6EU7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IDJXZU#wasThisHelpful","R1U4LC7WO6EU7M","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovely book BUT the table of contents is badly flawed. Links don't work. However the content of the book is marvelous so dealing with some of the formatting within the kindle version is well worth any extra effort. Along with the link problem with the TOC, footnotes intrude inside the chapters rather than at the end of the chapter or at the end of the book making it difficult to read smoothly. Modern publishers should be able to create a kindle version of a book without a hitch so the publisher needs to fix this. Oddly enough the sample for the kindle had a fully functioning linked table of contents.The content is amazing. This is a person with something constructive to say about grief and loss. She experienced it in the loss of her beloved husband and out of that, built a road map for others to help them get through the pain.This is more than a book about loss, it's about adapting to change. Life is full of surprises, some are nice, many are not but living involves adapting to change. Rebuilding, renewing, recreating our lives when things unexpectedly happen.I want this in kindle and paper versions. It's that good.I loved her first book, and have it in paper and on my kindle as well. Dolce Vita is a terrific book on discovering the joy of living. This is the sequel, recovering the joy of living. Dr Mautner speaks from her own Italian background to help modern people reconnect with reality. Life isn't a series of facebook entries puinctuated with tweets and snapshots, it is something to be lived. Wealth isn't money, it's the life well lived and that is more about appreciation of the ordinary rather than being able to afford extraordinary things. Raeleen is able to explain the difference to over scheduled, stressed out readers and remind them of a simpler way of life.Highly recommend it, just consider buying it in the paper version first, then if you feel you want it with you while reading on the kindle as I do, get a kindle version but be aware the TOC is flawed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C99SN2SLOTJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPMTIBI#wasThisHelpful","R3C99SN2SLOTJA","A1SZRVFFDXY55C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SZRVFFDXY55C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wear computer glasses at work and distance glasses the rest of the time.  So I needed a glasses holder at work to keep whatever pair was not in use handy.  This Face Eyeglass Display is just darling.  I keep it on my desk right beside my computer screen.  I have had so many compliments on it.  Everybody notices it when they enter my office.The holder is well-made and heavy.  The glasses fit onto the holder by folding the sidepieces in, fitting them into the slot behind the nose and resting the eyeglasses' nosepiece on the figure's nose.  I have lots of sizes and shapes of glasses -- to me, since I discovered how to order my glasses inexpensively from the internet at sites like Zenni, glasses have become a real fashion accessory -- and every pair fits perfectly into this holder.If there is any drawback to this item, it's that the face and hand are very feminine-looking, so I don't know how much a man would like this holder.  But I think it's just great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HF28QNMHDK6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GG9I0O#wasThisHelpful","R1HF28QNMHDK6L","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are absolutely darling shoes.  Comfortable and stylish.  The chocolate brown comes with two sets of laces.  One set is cotton and matches the shoes.  The other set is a darling light pink velvet.  The soles are white.  The leather is not too soft, but it gives a little and was perfectly comfortable right out of the box.I do agree with another reviewer who said that the shoe is short in the toe box.  (Thank you, Varda.). When I read that, I ordered a half size up.  I usually wear an 8-1/2 medium width.  I ordered a 9 in the medium width and the shoes fit perfectly.  I wear them with a medium-weight cotton sock.  I matched the soles of this shoe with the soles of a pair of Sperry Topsider lace-up oxfords that fit me well.  They are size 8-1/2 medium.

"There is nothing wrong with Milo's Dog Treats.  They are good and my dogs love them.  But I am leaving this one-star review so that Amazon customers will be aware that some third-party sellers are ripping them off.Be sure you check the price per ounce you are receiving.  For instance, third-party seller Smile 'n Save sells this 2.7 oz. bag of dog treats for almost exactly the same amount of money that you pay for the 18 oz. bag of MIlo dog treats elsewhere on Amazon.  Plus, they charge half-again the price of the treats for shipping.  It's a total rip-off.  I also think it's deliberatly misleading.  Customers see two bags of dog treats -- the photos make the treats look like they are about the same size -- and the price is almost exactly the same.  But the flavor is different.  So they order both bags.  Only one bag is huge and the other is the size of a sandwich bag.Totally not cool.

"I love this writing set.  I have purchased several for gifts.  It contains a Moleskine ruled notebook (192 pages, 3-1/2 by 5-1/2 inches) and a black ink pen.  The box is totally cool.  It's lightweight, but sturdy.  It looks like it's just black, but the front is covered with embossed words related to writing and traveling like ""Write,"" Stories,"" ""Imagination,"" ""Lyrics,"" and ""dream.""  Inside the box is an expandable pocket. Both the box and the included notebook have elastic fasteners so that they will stay closed.The gift box with its little notebook and pen makes a really nice presentation.  But afterwards, the user can take out the black foam insert which holds the two included items in place, and then there is room in the box for more notebooks, pens, Post-Its, little souvenirs like stones or feathers or leaves, photographs -- and all in a very portable little box you can take anywhere.I have one of these sets I use myself and I have given them as gifts to friends who write or travel.

"This book is a bit difficult to learn to use correctly.  I was stymied when I first paged through it.  But I followed the directions set forth in the essay at the beginning, and am finding the book very useful.The book is organized by sound group.  So you don't use it as you would a thesaurus by just looking up which words rhyme with ""square"" or ""testify"".  You have to figure out where your word fits in the various sounds made by speaking the word aloud, and then go to the grouping and subgrouping which fits the sound.Do keep in mind that the rhyming sounds used are the British pronunciation.

"It's actually kind of funny, because the reason I ordered this particular set of miniature books was because of all the bad reviews.  One reviewer said that they were thin and flimsy.  One said that two would fit on her/his thumbnail.  That's what I wanted.  Something that looked like a book (kind of) but would fit through the mouth of a very small vial.Unfortunately, this set is really quite nice now if you are planning on using it for your dollhouse or need a real-looking little book that is on the one-inch scale.  They look exactly like the photograph, the titles are readable and the covers are bright and colorful.  The set has the titles on the front cover and on the spine. I've included a photograph of the set as I received it this morning.  As you can see, my thumb is in the photo, and one of the books would definitely be bigger than my thumb nail.Really disappointing for me (I needed those really cheap teeny-weeny ones), but good for truth in advertising and those who want this set for the traditional purposes.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39GWZ5XJW2U7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BQC10C#wasThisHelpful","R39GWZ5XJW2U7G","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adore iced tea, but dislike having to go to all the trouble of boiling water to steep it.  This is especially a problem at work.  I saw these cold-brewed teas, and since this particular brand had all the good reviews, decided to try it.  I was tickled when it arrived today.Yuk!  Tastes like Kool-Aid, without the sweetening.  It smells pretty good in the box, but once you ""brew"" it, following the directions on the box (1 -2 bags per 8 oz. of cool water -- I used two bags per 8 oz. because I like my iced tea strong -- and steep for ten minutes.)  After ten minutes I had a pitcher full of colored water with a weak slightly-bitter artificial peach taste.  Really gross.Guess I'm back to boiling water and making my pitcher of iced tea with a combination of black tea and Constant Comment -- yum!I definitely don't recommend this product.  Now I'm stuck with four big boxes of it. Maybe I can use it as sachet in my kids' sock drawers or in between sheets in the linen closet or something like that.

"I live in Sperry Top-Sider's.  I have the slip-ons in just about every color they make.  They are great in all seasons, and I wear them to work with dress pants almost every day.  They are practically indestructible.  You can wear them with socks or without.  Even with shorts or a skirt.  But they are a bit on the casual side.  So I needed a more dressy shoe to wear to the office on those days I might meet with my boss or make a presention.This Sperry Top-Sider Women's Bedford Oxford fills the bill perfectly.  The leather uppers with contrasting brown sole and stacked heel, and the fact that they are tie-up oxfords rather than slip-ons, makes the shoe a little more dressy.  The detailing is a modified wingtip pinpointing over the toe cap.  It's really cute.But the best part is that this pair of shoes definitely has the exact same Sperry style and comfort.  I wore them, straight out of the box, at an all-day meeting where I was on my feet the entire time.  They were just as comfy as my three-year old tan Sperry slip-ons.  I wear an 8-1/2 medium width, and that's what I ordered.  They fit true to size.I love these shoes.

"I purchased this pet bed in the ""Born to be Wild"" cover when it was on an Amazon Deal of the Day.  I thought that it would be nice for my 12-pound Bichon.  I ordered the small size.I was very disappointed in the product.  It is simply an overstuffed bed pillow with a washable cover.  (I don't know through personal experience that the cover is washable because I didn't keep it long enough to wash it, but it is described as washable.)It is so overstuffed that my Bichon could not stay on the pillow, despite her best efforts.  She kept sliding off.  Plus, the small was too small for her.  She's a twelve-pound dog!If all you want is a bed pillow and a washable cover, go to Walmarts or Kohl's or any place that sells bed pillows, buy one for under ten bucks and put an old pillow case or sham on it.

Like other timeless literary heroines who overcome great odds to achieve happiness (such as Anne of ""Anne of Green Gables"" and Jo of ""Little Women""), Elnora is eternally fiesty, admirable and loveable.When the novel opens, Elnora is determined to attend the high school in a nearby township.  Her neglectful, sometimes abusive mother, Katharine, is equally determined to discourage her and ruin her dreams.  Elnora and Katharine live in a cabin on the edge of the great Limberlost swamp, a place of wonder and danger, located three miles from the township where Elnora wants to go to school.  The hard, cold Katharine is haunted by the death of her husband on the very day Elnora was born.  She blames her only child for the death of her beloved husband because her birth kept Katharine from having the strength to aid her husband when he was drowning in the swamp.On the first day of high school, Elnora's tacky clothes and inability to fit in with the snooty mean girls, along with the fact that she learns she will needs an unexpected amount of money for books and tuition leads her to brief despair.  But her own ingenuity, along with the help of a loving neighbor couple, Margaret and Wesley Sinton, solve some of Elnora's problems.I love the many intricate details in this book about Elnora's life in a rural early twentieth century world.  For instance, the Sintons purchase clothing and accessories so that Elnora can fit in with her classmates.  One article is a wonderful leather lunchbox which contains lidded dishes to hold small sandwiches, salad, condiments, dessert, milk, utensils and a cloth napkin.  The descriptions of the different foods which are used to fill this lunchbox, and how Elnora's lunches eventually play a part in her meeting some destitute children whom she ultimately aides, are just fascinating.Elnora is able to earn her way through school by her mastery of the natural world around her.  She collects moths, butterflies, old Indian relics, bird's nests, specimens of tree leaves, flowers and grasses, and then either sells them or uses them to teach classes in natural history to grade school children.  Her forays into the Limberlost, and what she finds there are described in loving detail.The characters in the book are also memorable.  How Katharine Comstock comes to change her outlook on life, and learn some hard lessons about the importance of motherhood and the real character of her dead husband is told with great depth of feeling.  But this is not a cloying or overly sentimental book.  These characters are very real and hold up very well to a twenty-first century reader's more sophisticated tastes.Even the romance at the end of the novel, between Elnora and a handsome lawyer from Chicago, who are brought together by their love of the outdoors, is believable by today's standards.  A deliciously malevolent and spoiled ex-fiancee who seeks to ruin Elnora's chance at true love is introduced, but all ends happily for everyone.I recommend this novel highly.  Gene Stratton-Porter was an important, prolific writer, and if you like this book, you should seek some other titles, especially ""Freckles"".  ""Freckles"" is the prequel to ""A Girl of the Limberlost"" and is also a wonderful story about a young man overcoming adversity and finding love.This review is for the Kindle edition of the novel, which contains the complete text and is available free for download to your Kindle, as the novel has entered public domain.  The novel is also available in paperback and hardback editions, some of which contain copyrighted essays and criticism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AV7NIVVKN71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084B07Z0#wasThisHelpful","R1AV7NIVVKN71","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the plot sometimes gets lost in the wonderful characterizations, this book is well worth reading. The main character is bitter, intelligent and funny. She is visited by a priest from the Vatican whose job is it to determine if this young woman is a saint.  So she dictates her answers to the priest's questions, and in so doing relates the story of her Italian ancestry and her West Virginia roots. These wonderful stories all eventually relate to her journey through life as someone who bears the marks of geography on her body (she has a world map tattooed on her body from birth in port wine stains) and the fact that many say that she is capable of healing.The author weaves fantasy, myth and fantastic storytelling to tell the tale of a woman who rises above her birth to breach the echelons of power and become more than she is.The story is at once fantastical and realistic.  The characters are true and fascinating. This author relates a tale which will reach into a reader's heart, and which you will find yourself pondering long after you have finished it.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPU6S5EJ283XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544146247#wasThisHelpful","RPU6S5EJ283XR","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your high school or community theatre group is planning a murder mystery in its next season, check this one out.  It's audience interactive, really funny and clever, and has a nice age range mix for its characters.The advertisements for this play say it is one of the most successful of the interactive murder mysteries, and I can see why.  Our group put it on during a summer city-wide arts festival and we had to extend the run because of its popularity.There are songs, too, which adds to the enjoyment.  The story is a spoof of film noir-type stories like the Maltese Falcon.

"This iced tea brewer is easy to use. It makes one glass at a time.  You put bagged or loose tea into the filter and pour cold water into the compartment in the back.  It only holds about 8 ounces of water. There is no steeping. As soon as the unit heats the water (which takes a minute or so), the tea stars coming out into the glass you have set below the spigot.  The directions tell you to put a hot/cold unbreakable glass filled with ice to catch the tea.  But I just catch it in a plastic cup and add the ice later.Pros:  The water heats really fast.  The tea is tasty. The unit is easy to clean and is small and easy to store.  It turns off automatically when the water compartment is empty. You can reuse the tea once the water has run through it once.Cons:  The darned thing spits tea droplets everywhere as the tea is dripping out into your glass.  This is really annoying.  I have this unit at work, and we have a white Formica countertop.  I have to wipe up those tea spittles immediately or they stain the countertop.It doesn't come with a hot/cold unbreakable plastic cup to catch the tea, and one of those costs about ten bucks.  If you use a styrofoam cup, you have to brace it with something on either side (like the salt and pepper shakers) because the driving, splattering tea coming out of the spigot walks the cup right out from under the dripper.This purchase was an experiment for me. I was spending a dollar a day at McDonald's for a large unsweetened ice tea to last me the day.  Since I ordered this from the ""damaged"" list (something was supposed to be wrong with the packaging, but it was just fine), I only paid a little over $15 for it.  It has already paid for itself.  But I think I will try one of the units which makes a whole pitcher next time, and I hope it doesn't splatter all over the place during the brewing process.  It is a little tedious making just one glass at a time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BWD228UFS60N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJ7RPE6#wasThisHelpful","R2BWD228UFS60N","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in West Virginia, this novel sets up the intriguing premise of how the lives of three best friends, all beautiful struggling single moms, would change if they hit the largest lottery pay-off ever and ended up with $100 million each after taxes.  Much of the plot set-up rings true as each deals with vindictive ex-husbands and baby daddies; staying grounded; fighting off the intrusive media and indulging in fabulous luxury items such as homes, travel, clothes and cars for themselves and their loved ones.This book focuses on 39-year old Ava and her love affair with super-hot NHL star, Cian.  The meet-cute is well-done, as Ava, letting off a little steam in a local dive, picks up the younger Cian, not realizing he is her son's friend who has traveled to West Virginia to hide out from his crazy supermodel ex-girlfriend at her guesthouse.The main problem is that the book is desperately in need of editing for grammar, syntax and language choice.  Within the first twenty-five pages, Ava ""has went"" somewhere or other at least five times. Word choices are re-used, sometimes three or four times in the same paragraph. Characters constantly ""set"" instead of ""sit.""  The author's poor grasp of basic English distracts consistently from her storyline and her characters.Another problem with the novel is that it is derivative.  Many of the situations and characters in the book are partially cribbed from similar story lines in other romance novels.  That's really too bad, because the novel contains enough fresh ideas in the author's choice of heroine and location that one can easily see the bones of a truly different entry in the romance novel cadre.  I was genuinely interested in how sudden wealth might affect these working class women and their ability to find HEAs. Unfortunately, although that is the book this author sets up, that is not the book this author chose to write.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32KD07N7YYZS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3IRU9E#wasThisHelpful","R32KD07N7YYZS0","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit I chose this pocket filer because of the color.  I love pink.  It comes with a cardboard wrapper which advertises that the pink color is actually honoring breast cancer awareness, which is even better.The filer is made of sturdy plastic, scored with little raised lines and a handle on top, so it is easy to carry and feels nice in your hand.  The clasp does its job -- keep the filer closed.  Inside are seven clear plastic dividers, with tabs on top and a scored piece of paper to write topics so you can label the files.  The filer holds quite a bit of stuff -- I have been carrying not only files and papers in it, but notebooks and a daily planner.At first I did not like it that the top of the filer is permanently bent in a crook-shape so that it automatically folds over.  I thought it made the papers hard to get in and out of the filer.  But I found that the plastic is thick and sturdy enough so that I can bend the top back so that it lays flat while I sort through the files, taking out and putting in.  Then it goes back to its regular shape when you clasp it shut.I just don't see a downside to this nice filer.  It has no sharp edges and will certainly hold up better than cardboard or paper, especially if you have to carry it outside in inclement weather.  I suppose that the color may show the dirt, but it's plastic after all, so it should clean nicely with any all-purpose cleaner.  I'm going to order a couple more.  I hope there are more colors.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13K2I1AWH9OJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M838PC#wasThisHelpful","R13K2I1AWH9OJS","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These black Sperry Top-siders are really my go-to shoes with black slacks on days when I have to do a lot of walking (and running) for work.  Days when I teach classes.  Days when I travel.

I must have twelve pairs.  But these all-black ones are so great for work.  And you can never find this particular color in department stores.

"Keep your Raisinettes, Brach's has always made the best-tasting chocolate-covered raisins.  The raisins are plump and juicy, the chocolate is creamy and they taste just like they did when you were a kid and your mom bought them at the store.

"This clipper has saved me a bunch of money in the few months I have had it.  It is heavy-duty and does not heat up unduly during grooming.  I am really lucky that the DVD which accompanies the kit showcases a Bichon and a Poodle being clipped.  I own a Bichon and a Poodle.  The Poodle (who is a standard and weighs 75 pounds) was a little more skittish than the Bichon.  I finally took him to a local pet washing facility where they had a very short tie, and clipped him in there (cleaning the basin out with a towel afterwards.) That worked fine.There is definitely a learning curve, and I got better the more I used the clippers.  I agree with the other reviewers who say to always use one of the plastic blade guards when clipping your dog.

"For an author who is attempting to write a Bible-themed fanfic of ""Pride & Prejudice"" told from the point of view of a born-again modern Mr. Darcy, Ms.Helm certainly is not displaying much Christian charity to her readers.  This book is being marketed and sold as a ""trilogy.""  But a trilogy is a set of three books which, although they fit together, each volume stands on its own as a finished work.  This book is part of a serial, if the author finishes it.  It stops dead in the middle of the plot, practically in the middle of a scene, and leaves the reader hanging until Ms. Helm gets around to writing the next chapter.  Nice for her bottom line, but a pretty dirty trick to pull on her readers.Helm actually has some interesting ideas in this snippet of a novel.  A guy named Will Darcy from the 21st century magically changes places with the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy from the novel.  But interspersed is a bunch of witnessing and Bible thumping which is clumsily forced into the plot.  However I might have been able to stick with it if this book was a real book and not just the first third of a book.Shame on this author for tricking Austen fans into paying for three books when she is only writing one.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DPNTVBXQUW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTVRJN4#wasThisHelpful","R13DPNTVBXQUW2","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This the best of any of the P&P fan fiction I have read which is actually set in the period and retells Lizzy and Darcy's story.  (For fiction which concerns Austen, but is set in the present, my favorite is Shannon Hale's ""Austenland."").This story starts with the iconic proposal at the Collins parsonage in Kent, but in this version, Lizzy accepts Darcy's initial proposal.  The author has written a lively, interesting alternate-universe version of how the couple would have interacted, and how all the main characters would have reacted to Darcy's rash choice of wife.Since the reader is expected to know all of the history which has come beforehand (such as Darcy separating Jane and Bingley, Mr. Collins' proposal to Lizzy, and Lizzy's attraction to Wickham), it's rather fun to see how it all plays out to arrive at about the same conclusion.  The author has added some additional information about Mrs. Bennet, Wickham, and even Anne de Borgh, which is quite in keeping with what we already know, but is rather delicious, all the same.  I also liked seeing Mr. Darcy just a little more love-struck, although he is very much his reserved self.I applaud this author for keeping the language and customs in the proper period while giving Austenites a really nice alternative story to savor.  If you enjoy Austen alternative fan fiction, this is a wonderful read.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KATJY6T36X1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E25LA76#wasThisHelpful","R3KATJY6T36X1C","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have fine straight hair, but it's thick.  I wanted a product to give me body and make my stick-straight hair look full and lush.  I figured that a product called ""Plumping Whip"" would do that.  But no.  The only thing plump about this stuff is the price.This is not one of those really thick pastes or clays.  This jar contains a white product which is about the consistency of yogurt, maybe a little thinner.  The jar holds 2.82 ounces.I really gave this product a chance.  The directions say to apply a ""walnut-sized amount"" to the roots of towel-dried hair, and then heat style.  Walnut-sized?  Okay.  So a walnut like with its husk on, like in the bowl at Christmas time?  That would be about an ounce, right?  So that means that this little jar only holds about three applications? That didn't seem right, but I forged on.  So I applied that much to my freshly-shampooed hair and styled with a blow-dryer.  What I ended up with was a gooey, sticky mess.So I thought, it must mean a shucked walnut.  I shampooed again and tried about half the amount I tried before.  Again it took forever to dry, and my hair still felt sticky.  But the worst part was that even though it felt kind of gross, it wasn't even full-looking.  It was flat.I gave it one more try. Thinking I was still using too much product, I shampooed again.  This time I used a dollop about the size of a malted milk ball.  It didn't take as long to blow dry this time and the stickiness factor, while still a little bit of a presence, was not too bad.  But where is the plumping?  There's no plumping.  It's just flat, flatter, flattest.  I tried putting some volume into my hair with a curling iron, but the ""plumping whip"" had made my hair too slick to curl.  I had to add some mousse before the curls would take.So this little jar ended up right where it should be: in the trash can.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2TA9EJK8BA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EF1QRMU#wasThisHelpful","RC2TA9EJK8BA2","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although this memoir of life as a professional caddy at three or four of the larger golf courses/country clubs in the country is ostensibly about golf, there really is not enough written in depth about the game itself to satisfy a real golfer.  The author often strays at length into side issues with his girlfriends, even including some sex scenes which might turn off a person who has picked up this book to look closer at activity on the links, not activities in the sack.The book is just not written in enough detail for a real golfer, and so the real golfers in my family who read this book said that their interest lagged about a third of the way in, and they struggled to finish the book.The book is well-written and the author is an engaging personality, but a book about life as the companion and advisor of golfers may be expected by many readers to focus on that subject.

"My college-age daughter has dark brown hair which she has professionally dyed platinum blonde.  She wears it in a cute short spiked-type style which she achieves by blowing dry and straightening.  And as an active young woman, she sweats and washes her hair often, sometimes even twice a day.  So her hair goes through a lot.She has been using this deep conditioning mask for a month now.  She says it's the best product she has ever used to keep her hair soft and shiny, and to help protect against split ends and dry scalp.  She says that the mask is easy to use, and she likes that it has no scent.  She says that she likes wearing her perfumes, and doesn't like her hair products to interfere with their scent.  She uses the product just about every time she shampoos unless she is really pressed for time.  She says that her hair has never looked better.  She asked me to send her the Tresemme Renewal Shampoo and more of this conditioning mask before she runs out, so I know that she really likes it.

"This product works, and I really tested it before I wrote this review.I have tried skin “primers” before, most recently from Mary Kay and from Clinique.  The purpose of a makeup primer is to apply a kind of undercoating to the skin so that one’s makeup looks better, kind of like paint primer prepares a wall for the final color.  These makeup primers tend to be expensive, and I did not see any noticeable difference or improvement in my makeup after using the two brands I mentioned.  In point of fact, my makeup tended to fade and become “patchy” after about eight hours with the Mary Kay product.  However the theory behind these products appeals to me, so it was with extremely cautious optimism that I tried this “Water Canvas Base Primer” by Vincent Longo.I am a middle-aged professional woman who wears a full makeup to work every day.  I am a normal weight and have combination skin, tending toward dryness and flakiness.  In my youth I had very oily skin and acne.  I have no acne now, but I have large pores, especially around my nose and on my cheeks.  I am fair-skinned and, although an outdoorsy person, have been religious about sunblock.  So I have very little wrinkling, although I do have crow’s feet and fine lines around my eyes.  Without makeup, my skin is most dry on my forehead and chin, and a little mottled-looking with a few light age spots.My makeup routine is as follows:  Every morning I cleanse with Estee Lauder skin cleanser for older skin,  moisturize and then apply a medium-weight full coverage foundation.  I dab a concealer under my eyes.  Then I put on powder blush, and the usual eye makeup. I use a eye crayon for lining my eyes.Following the directions for this product, I first cleansed and moisturized with my regular products, then I put a “pearl-sized” drop (probably about the size of large pea) of the Water Canvas on my finger and dabbed it on my forehead, cheeks, chin and down my neck.  Then I used a light touch to spread the Water Canvas over my entire face, including under my eyes.  The product feels a little waxy, but spreads easily and is not heavy or greasy.  I did wait about a minute to let it “set” before I applied my foundation and the rest of my makeup. (The directions do not say you have to wait for the product to set, but other primers I have used have had this direction, so I figured it couldn’t hurt.)First day.  Before I removed my makeup off after about twelve hours of wear, I looked in a magnifying mirror.  My makeup looked very good.  It had not faded or settled into the lines around my eyes.  The eye crayon liner was a little smeared, but that’s normal for me.  My pores appeared smaller.  But I wanted to be sure.Second and Third days.  I applied my makeup the same as usual, but I used the Water Canvas only on one side of my face.  Second day, the right side; third day, the left side.  On the opposite side of my face, I used moisturizer and foundation only, no primer.  At the end of each day, I studied my face in a magnifying mirror.  On both days, on the side WITHOUT the Water Canvas, makeup had settled into my pores, making them seem larger.  The fine lines around my eyes were not as affected as my pores.  But my under-eye crayon liner and concealer stayed on a little better on the Water Canvas side, and there was no settling of concealer or powder into the fine lines.I am sold on this product.  It works.  It really does make my makeup look better, and stay fresher longer.  Most everyone's makeup looks fine when it's first applied.  The test is how it looks after eight hours at work, then grocery shopping, exercising the dogs and horses, cooking supper, and reading or watching television with my husband before bed.  At eleven o'clock at night, Water Canvas under my makeup makes it look pretty much as good as it did when I applied it in the morning.  I will be purchasing this product again.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WNARJN219XNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z61QR0#wasThisHelpful","R1WNARJN219XNI","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like your romance meandering and pretty much PG-rated, then Shannon Stacy's Kowalski Family and their lives, loves and minor tribulations may be for you.This entry is about Liz Kowalski, who has been living in New Mexico, mainly supporting her artist-wannabe loser boyfriend.  After kicking her nowhere relationship to the curb, Liz decides to move back home, to Whitford, Maine where she grew up in a large, loving family.  The family business is a lodge which caters to sportsmen, hunters and ATVers.  Liz takes a job at a diner owned by her sister-in-law, and rents a house from another family member.The hero of our tale is Drew Miller, Liz's older brother Mitch's best friend.  Liz and Drew grew up together, but beyond that, they share the guilty secret that they hooked up for a quickie at a family wedding eight months previously.  Drew is the chief of police in small Whitford, and is divorced from his high school sweetheart who lied to him about wanting kids.  Drew wants to be a father.  Liz isn't sure what she wants to be, but she is trying to find out.Slowly the hero and heroine are pushed together during family outings and they discover that they have a real connection beyond that one-time quickie.  But Liz is worried that all Drew really wants is a baby mama, and Drew is worried that Liz is too unstable to commit to being a wife and mother.This book is very slow-moving.  And it is quite repetitive.  In the first hundred pages, both Liz and Drew agonize about Liz's brother finding out about their sexual peccadillo at least twelve times apiece.  And really, what's the big deal?  Both are in their 30s, and it's none of Mitch's business if Liz and Drew want to have sex any time the opportunity presents itself.  The way Liz and Drew talk about Mitch finding out about that wedding quickie makes everyone involved sound like they are in high school.  It's a non-issue, or should be.The characters in the book are likeable, and the ending is predictable, but not very satisfying.  Nothing is really resolved in any interesting or clever way.  If you have been following this family, and like this kind of gooey-sweet romance, then this is the book for you.I will pass.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9086D62VKO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373002254#wasThisHelpful","R1L9086D62VKO8","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent tale about a half-breed Indian who was raised by a rich white ranching family, and is now running his own spread nearby, who tries to help a young woman escaping from a forced marriage to a disgusting older man. Ironically, she is caught at the hero's place, and a mob forces them to marry, and then attempts to kill the half-breed.  It's a horrendous scene, difficult to read.  But out of all this violence and heartbreak comes a really terrific love story about two people who decide to make a marriage work.One of the things I love best about the book is that the author obviously knows a lot about horses and horse training, so all of the details about the horse breeding and training operation the young couple is running is told with authenticity.  If you are a horse lover as well as a romance reader, this book is for you.I hope Ms. O'Connell continues to write such high-quality work.

"I have purchased all of the previous books in this series, and a couple are on my keeper shelf to be re-read.  I especially love the paranormal romance, ""Whispers in the Dark"" between the imprisoned, tortured Nathan and the telepath/empath, Shea.  Lovely story and lots of action.  So what happened here?  This is Donovan's story, and it should have been first-rate, but it's just awful.The premise is good.  Rusty, the former runaway teen adopted by Dad and Ma Kelly who has blossomed into a gorgeous college student is running the Kelly hardware store while on summer vacation.  She hires a 15-year old boy, Travis, who reminds her of herself at that age, and whom she figures is in some kind of trouble.  Turns out her instincts are correct, and Travis has a beautiful older sister, Eve, and a sweet baby sister, Cammie, who are on the run from something horrible and living hand-to-mouth in a broken down trailer outside town.  Cammie is sick, and Travis is trying to earn money for medicine and food while Eve stays home to nurse Cammie.  Soon hunky Kelly brother Donovan is on the case, and there is immediate attraction between he and Eve.  So far, so good.But the story goes downhill so fast.  After an exciting chapter about a tornado which allows the little trio-in-trouble to be moved into Donovan's house on the KGI compound, nothing really happens.  The book is endlessly repetitive, the sex is boring and both Eve and Donovan are sort of icky as the heroine in trouble and her savior.  There's a quasi-plot about an evil stepfather chasing Eve and her siblings, but it's sort of glossed over so that Banks can relate page after weary page of Donovan saying that he loves kids and wants a family.  And not just any family -- THIS family.  But why?  Who are these characters?  Who cares?I LOVE Maya Banks' books.  I have read not only this series, but most of her other work also, including the really erotic BDSM stuff.  She has never disappointed me before.  But this book is dreck after the first forty pages.  I gave it an extra star because I hope that this is an anomaly for Banks.  I really hope she takes a vacation or something and gets her mind back in the game.  Wherever her mind was when this was written, it wasn't on creating a credible book.  Really sad.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QEJ9MZIGE8NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263770#wasThisHelpful","R3QEJ9MZIGE8NM","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keep your Raisinettes, Brach's has always made the best-tasting chocolate-covered raisins.  The raisins are plump and juicy, the chocolate is creamy and they taste just like they did when you were a kid and your mom bought them at the store.  It's harder to find them at the store these days, but you can get them online.  I like to mix them with cashews, sunflower seeds, sesame sticks and a pinch of sea salt for a great gorp.  But they are wonderful just on their own. Sneak some into the movies next time you go.  You won't be sorry.All of the above still being true, be sure that you look for the best price for this candy on Amazon.  Just do a little calculation.  A 12-ounce package for around $9.00 is about 75 cents an ounce.  Twelve  6-ounce packages for around $28 is 38 cents an ounce.  When you can find this candy at a store, a 12-ounce package is four dollars or a little less.

"If you are a fan of Maya Banks' KGI series which features erotic romance, super hot alpha male military-type heroes and lots of fast-paced action, then it would seem that Laura Kaye's new ""Hard Ink"" series would be your cup of tea.  By its back cover blurb, it certainly seems as though that is the audience that Ms. Kaye is courting.  Unfortunately she has not hit upon the right mix of elements in her first entry of this series, ""Hard as it Gets.""  There's too much grit and crime investigation procedural and not enough romance and sex.Nick Rixey, a disgraced former Army Special Forces soldier, owns a tattoo shop (Hard Ink) with his brother, Jeremy, in Baltimore.  Rixey is one cranky dude because he was not only wounded in action, but he was betrayed by a trusted officer and forced out of the service with his Army record besmirched, along with four other survivors of a horrific ambush in Afghanistan.  So when beautiful nurse, Becca Merritt, walks into his shop asking for help in locating her brother who may have been kidnapped, Nick is less-than-welcoming.  Especially since Becca and her brother, Charlie, are the children of Rixey's ex-commander.  But Rixey's better nature prevails, and soon he, Becca and the four surviving members of Rixey's old outfit are up to their ears in some far-ranging conspiracy which seems to involve organized crime, drug dealing, the Army, the Baltimore police and maybe the US government.Ms. Kaye is a good writer, and this book moves along well.  But it is unclear just what audience she is writing for.  If she wants fans of Maya Banks, there's not enough romance and sex.  If she wants fans of Lee Child, there's too much female angst on the part of the heroine over her ""relationship"" with the damaged hero.I also have a problem with the way that the book ends.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the problem is that there really is no ending.  Even though each of the KGI books involves a romance and a fast-paced thriller plot with characters already established, each is a stand-alone book.  You don't have to read them in any certain order to understand them.  Same with Child's Jack Reacher books.  But this book just sort of piddles off at the end and sets you up for the next book in the series. The conspiracy it sets up is not solved.  I don't like that.  That just seems lazy and sort of greedy on the part of the author and her editors.  I can see love stories for all of the ""Hard Ink"" heroes who are introduced in this book, but they also need their own plot lines, not one plot line that all of them share.If you start the series and like it, you have to figure that you are in it for at least five more books in order to figure out the entire conspiracy/mystery plot started in this book.  The next one comes out in March, 2014.  I'm going to pass.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9KIDNS3UDIUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062267884#wasThisHelpful","R9KIDNS3UDIUL","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit that ""The Taming of the Shrew"" is my favorite guilty pleasure Shakespeare play.  It's so sexist, even abusive, by today's standards.  But the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton movie is one of my favorite movies, and the battle between the headstrong Kate and the overbearing Petruchio is deliciously gratifying.That being said, I adore John Cleese, a Monty Python alum who was just magnificent in ""A Fish Called Wanda.""  I have always found him sexy, and I thought I would love him in this role.  But no, something is just off in this undertaking of ""Shrew.""  Cleese comes across as mean and callous, not as a man who is secretly in love with Katherine (as I always want to believe.)  Perhaps the casting of Katherine undermined the production.  The actress who plays her has the acting chops, but is not particularly pretty or sexy.Anyway, this production did not gel for me, and with deepest regret, I cannot recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SBDKK4RNL3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MN068G#wasThisHelpful","R19SBDKK4RNL3A","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband drinks at least five pots of tea a day, so this cup was for him.  I like that it is a different design.  The design is attractive, and really does insulate so that you do not burn your fingers when you pour in the hot liquid.  It does do beautifully in the microwave, and it despite the fact that the design is made of some kind of fabric-like material, it also comes out of the dishwasher as good as new.The problem I see with it is that it takes some getting used to.  Most people expect a handle on a porcelain mug, and some who are experiencing this mug for the first time might feel as though it is not very secure in their hands.  But it is along the same lines as a cup of hot liquid you would get from Starbucks (no handle there either), so I would just warn people the first time you hand it to them to be careful.The mug is a bit on the expensive side, although on the webpage the different designs you can get on the entire sets of the dinner ware are intriguing.  A set of these might make an unusual wedding or shower gift.I liked the mug, and it is easier to store in the cupboard than the mugs with handles.

"I like Kristan Higgins' books, and have read quite a few of them in the past.  This is not one of her best.Honor Holland, who works at her family's winery in the Finger Lakes district in New York, is unlucky in love, to say the least.  She's 35 and when the book opens, she is being told by her doctor that her eggs are getting older and she should start thinking about having a baby if she is ever going to have one.  That sets up a funny bit all through the book where Holland's ""eggs"" send her hilarious chiding messages about choices she makes concerning men.  I liked that part of the book, and I liked Honor.  She a decent, self-deprecating, smart and sexy heroine.Honor has had an friends-with-benefits relationship with the love of her life, Brogan Cain, for seventeen years.  She decides to propose matrimony, and is rejected.  Two weeks later, Honor's supposed best friend, a really unlikeable character named Dana, is engaged to Brogan, and Honor is told in public about the engagement and ends up having a truly cringe-worthy catfight with Dana in their neighborhood pub.So Honor, desperate for a suitable baby daddy, meets the nephew of her grandmother's long-time friend, a Brit named Tom Barlow, who needs to marry in order to secure a green card. Tom wants to stay in the US because he is attached to his dead fiance's really horrendously unlikeable teenaged son, Charlie.The book is about the growing attraction between Tom and Honor, Tom's relationship with the sullen Charlie, and Dana and Brogan's weird romance.I think what turned me off about the book are the characters of Tom and Charlie.  Tom is just not that nice a person until the very end of the book.  He is supposed to have a sense of humor which manifests itself in teasing and smart remarks, but they come across as sort of mean.  I know that Charlie is probably a really true-to-life character in that he treats everyone so badly and makes every feel bad even when they are trying to help him, as disaffected fourteen-year old boys are wont to do.  But I don't read romance novels for their angst value (at least not in the secondary characters) and I found Charlie hard to swallow.The ending is a bit rushed, and I didn't really buy into Tom's falling madly in love with Honor.As always, Higgins' writing is good, and she makes her books interesting and detailed.  But this one just didn't do it for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVLNT0QWXG6HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778198#wasThisHelpful","RVLNT0QWXG6HR","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I especially identified with the author's descriptions of the long unpaved road (which runs through a creek) and makes accessing her property a true challenge in rain, snow or ice.  I have been on those kinds of roads, and they are quite memorable.The book takes the reader through the author's search for a farm with her boyfriend (who is older, and with whom she has a rather rocky relationship), her hardships and triumphs in such tasks as raising chickens, cows, sheep and a large garden, and her interactions with her sometimes odd neighbors.  The tone of the book is self-deprecating and irreverent.

"This foundation will change your mind about drug store makeup. I'm kind of a snob about foundation.  I can buy blush, eye shadow, mascara, even powder in the drug store, but I have never thought that drug store foundation was as good as the expensive stuff I purchase in the department store at the cosmetics counter.  But this is a really fabulous foundation.I ordered the Light Shade, and it goes on beautifully.  But most makeup does that.  It's what happens after eight hours that tells the tale.  This foundation holds up very well to my working day.  It doesn't fade or change color.  It isn't cake-y.  It takes blush and powder well.  I just really like it.I am a middle-aged woman with combination skin.  I still get a pimple or two once in awhile, but I also have dry patches.  This makeup covers, stays on for the long run and works well with my skin texture.  It doesn't settle into my crow's feet, and doesn't cake up around my mouth or neckline.I am very impressed, and would match this product against a department store foundation.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IQ6HUVS9WFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6EDGYE#wasThisHelpful","R13IQ6HUVS9WFV","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that since there are almost 2000 reviews of this book, adding my two cents is overkill.  But I just wanted to say that this is one of the most fascinating, original books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  The book is part-fantasy and part-time-travel and part-artistic wonderment.  It's like a sideshow attraction for intellectuals.I can only echo two things which other reviewers have noted:  Please do yourself a favor and purchase this book in hardcover.  The photographs and letters are an integral part of the story and will be best seen in the hardback version.  And please put your order in now for this wonderful author's sequel, due early in 2014.  I can't wait.Recommended without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158HM6WPRWQKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746036#wasThisHelpful","R158HM6WPRWQKW","A264UDLWWRJ7X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A264UDLWWRJ7X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always had weak nails. Every time they grow beyond the quick, they become weak and brittle. I have never had a nice set of nails unless I use acrylics and the minute they pop off, my nails split. This Probelle Nail Hardener, so far has made my nails feel stronger. I work in retail and spend the day at a cash register sliding items over a RF scanner and bagging them. Some, like gallons of milk and cases of beer are heavy and my nails break when I handle them. Since I have used this nail hardener this week, I have not had a nail break. I will have to see what happens when my nails actually grow longer, but so far so good. I love the way even when it is dry, the nail hardener makes my nails have that wet shiny look. Eventually I am going to also use it as a top coat over nail polish to make my nails shine more. I received this Probelle Nail Hardener at a greatly discounted price for my review, but all opinions are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXLS19XZITGZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FI1V3A2#wasThisHelpful","RXLS19XZITGZ0","A3TB4WX2TOREEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TB4WX2TOREEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This scarf is absolutely beautiful. I love the coloring of the yarn and how well made it is. It has all the appearances of being handmade. It is very soft and can be worn long in a single loop, or I can double it up so that it is shorter and warmer around my neck. The blue color looks great with my jean jacket or my black leather jacket. This scarf can be worn with blue jeans for every day or with a nice wool coat and hat for a night out.

" 5:08 MinsThis is a cute little coloring book that has many different goddesses. It has 30 different illustrations that have intricate designs in them. I love that each goddess is pictured and has her name and a bit of her history in the description below. There are goddesses that are familiar like Isis, Athena, Gaia, and Venus, but there are also lesser known ones like White Buffalo Woman and Mawu. Goddesses from different cultures like Inca and West Africa are depicted and teach about different culture's folklore.This book is a little smaller than I had anticipated, but for the price I paid, it is a good value.

" 7:18 Mins I am a huge nature lover and animal advocate. Each page of this book has an intricate nature inspired drawing to color and words of wisdom from great authors like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Ghandi on the opposite page. It is a great way to unwind from a hard day and release your inner Picasso. I can unplug from the internet and cell phone and tune in to my inner child. I put on some nice calming music, like the Miles Davis jazz in my video and lose myself in coloring these great illustrations. I also love that 10% of my purchase price will go to animal rights and other important causes. It is a total win win situation as far as I am concerned.

"I have never used contour make up before. I have always used just a single tone liquid foundation or a mineral powder. I really like how I can use the different shades to even my skin tone and accentuate my cheekbones, temples and chin area. I can use the different tones to hide a multitude of sins. Some of the darker colors are going to be too dark for my skin tone as I am Irish and very fair but others work perfectly. I love how smooth the foundations are and how easy they are to apply.They come in a very sturdy plastic case with a very large mirror so you can see what you are doing anywhere you go. You can keep them in your purse in case you need to reapply or touch up your face. I just used a sponge applicator and it worked very well.

" 6:39 MinsThis purse is absolutely stunning! I am sure my video doesn't do it justice. I love the retro look and feel of it. This purse takes me back to the 1930's when women dressed up for cocktail or dinner parties. It is something you see in old movies carried by legendary movie stars. The bead work and sequines are very well done and the handle is metal. It comes with a chain so you can also make it to be a shoulder bag instead of a handbag if you want to. I am going to keep it as a handbag though. I have a big retro black hat and some black gloves that this will go well with when I go to weddings or fancy parties. I also think this would be a great purse for prom. As you will see in my video, it has plenty of room to hold essentials and comes with a small bill fold to keep money, a drivers license or credit cards in while you are out. I have to say that I just love this purse and I can't wait to show it off.

" 4:44 MinsThis is a great flashlight to have in emergency situations. You don't have to worry about the batteries being weak because there aren't any. All you have to do is turn the crank for a bit and it is charged and working. I think I turned the crank for a minute or two and I had light for a couple of hours. Now the light isn't blinding but it is bright enough to keep you from injuring yourself in a dark situation. It has three light settings, 1 LED light, 3 LED lights and then a flashing 3 LED to call attention to  yourself. I tested it in my dark room and it lit it up enough that I could see everything clearly. It is good to have in the car, in the house, or out camping and hiking just in case.

"This is a very pretty crescent moon and crystal pendant. The moon is an 18 KT  gold plated metal with a delicate filigree design to it and the stone looks to be a pink quartz.

It is very well made and everything appears to be sturdy so it won't fall apart. I know it is listed as a men's leather wrist wrap but I cannot see why ladies couldn't wear it as well.

" 2:43 MinsThese are extremely sharp pruning shears. When they are closed the blades resemble a dagger, or at least that was my first thought when I saw them. The handles are comfortable and the spring that controls them is not too tight so they are easy to use.

" 4:02 MinsThis pendant is absolutely lovely! There is so much detail in the filigree across the front of the heart, and in the metal bracing around it. The back of the bracing even has some artistic touches to it. It is a natural stone that has dark and light purple hues with some white marbling in it as well. I noticed the back of the stone has minor inperfections, but that only adds to the beauty of it being natural. It doesn't come with a chain and I have decided the one I used in my video is not nice enough for this stone. I have to get a better chain for it but I am already in love with it. I have had it around my neck since I took it out of the box. It is worth every cent of the $12.99 that I paid for it.

" 2:53 MinsI love the stunning look of this bracelet. It features 16 10mm amethyst beads with silver spacers in between. The spacers are a pretty silver colored metal with small rhinestones around the edge to give it sparkle. They are threaded onto a very comfortable elastic cord and the entire bracelet appears to be very well made. The stones are a very dark purple and very uniform in shape. The elastic will expand to fit most wrists very comfortably and I don't feel any pinching from the beads on my arm. It fits well and doesn't slide around on my wrist while I am moving around doing things. I like that I can wear it many ways. It goes well with my jeans for every day, my work uniform, or dressed up for a night out. Amethyst is one of my most favorite stones so I will be wearing this bracelet a lot. I received this bracelet at no cost for my review, but all opinions stated here and in my video are entirely my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW15AFY0O38H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QTVACC#wasThisHelpful","RW15AFY0O38H5","A3TB4WX2TOREEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TB4WX2TOREEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:36 MinsThis is a handy set of charging cables to have around. I love that you get 5 cables in 3 different sizes in the pack. We have a lot of electronics to charge and I am always looking for a spare cord to use. This set has 1 1foot cord, one 6 foot cord, and 3 three feet cords so there are different size options to use. They have the standard USB port on one end and a micro USB on the other. The cords are made of a heavy duty plastic that covers the wires and should last a good amount of time under normal use.

"I usually do not buy oversized sunglasses so I was a little reticent in trying these out. I find them to be very pretty with the little accents on the stems that make them stylish. Now, I think they are too big on me as far as the lenses, but everyone I have shown them too say they look great on me. Maybe change is a good thing. I love that the lenses are dark and they block the glare of the sun very nicely. They are not polarized but they are 100% effective against harmful UV rays which is important to me. I do a lot of driving and when I head into direct sunlight the glare can be dangerous. I find with these glasses that they block the glare fairly well and I can drive safely. They are plastic and will scratch if you don't take care of them. They do come with a cloth drawstring holder to keep them in while not using them to help keep them protected. They are lightweight and fit well. I enjoy using them.

"I love the way these look on me. The tortoise shell coloring and the cat eye shape of the frames kind of give it a retro look. They are very comfortable when worn and I had no sliding issues with them. The smoke colored lenses block the light well when I drive which is an important thing for me. They are plastic except for the bridge which is metal, so you do have to exercise a bit of caution with them. If dropped they can scratch or even break so don't be rough on them. They are great for hanging out at the beach, or as I said, driving, or anywhere you enjoy the sun. I am kind of sad winter is coming cause I won't get to use them as much.

"I was a little leery at first because of the color of the lenses. I have never owned a pair of light purple sunglasses, I usually opt for dark gray or black lenses. These are actually very nice. They are not polarized but they still block the sunlight and the harmful UV rays of the sun. I used them while driving and found that they are not as dark as the black or smoke lenses but do a decent job of blocking the glare. The frames and lenses are plastic so they are very light weight. They fit my face perfectly and didn't slide down my nose at all. My eyeglasses don't even work this well. They come with a cloth holder so you can store them in your purse or glove box and not have to worry about scratching the lenses. These are plastic as I said so dropping them or handling them roughly can scratch the lenses, but if you take care of them, they should last a good amount of time.

"I like these emery boards for a few reasons. The first of course is the animal print graphic's on them. There are 4 different designs and you get 3 of each for a total of 12. My daughter is already bugging me for the multi colored cheetah patterned ones. I also like that they are larger than ordinary emery boards and thicker as well. I think being larger and thicker they will last longer. A regular sized thin emery board usually lasts me a couple of weeks at best. These will likely last twice as long, maybe even longer. They are patterned on both sides and they have the same grade of sanding on each side as well. I personally do not have long nails but I break or snag them all the time so having a good emery board around is important. With these I can keep one in my purse all the time in case emergencies come up while I am on the go. Each one comes in its own plastic holder so you can keep them clean and dry for when you use them.

"We have a small 1 quart crock-pot that is older than the hills. Because we have a big 6 quart roaster we have not been using the old crock pot at all. This 6 quart crock pot is such an upgrade. I love how the lid has a rubber gasket and actually locks down when cooking. This is also important when you are transporting it to either the table for serving or out of the home to family gatherings. The stoneware inside removes easily and is dishwasher safe as is the lid for easy cleaning. The stoneware is also microwaveable and can be used in the over but NOT the broiler. The lid cannot be used in the microwave or the oven so you need to be aware of that.I love the size of this crock-pot! We are a family of three but we love to make meals big enough to freeze a second potion. This crock-pot will make that easy to do. It is great for making spaghetti sauce, stews, chili's, braised short ribs, roasts, and all kinds of things. I am getting a slow cooker cook book and I can't wait to try new things in here.

"Do you know the difference between an herb and a spice? I knew they were different but before reading this book I had no idea what the difference was. I know now that both are from plants but that herbs are the leafy parts of the plant while spices come from seeds, bark, roots, twigs, berries, or flowers. That was only one thing reading this book taught me. I call myself the queen of quick and easy when it comes to cooking. I have always wanted to experiment with different flavors but have been afraid to try because I didn't want to butcher what I was cooking. This book really helps me to understand herbs and spices and how to pair them. It lists 50 different spices and herbs that I can use and what they pair well with. There is also a few recipes at the end of each for me to play with. I love the section that shows the best ones to keep in my spice rack, how to store them properly and what fresh herbs are easy to grow and pick.I feel like this book will help even a novice like me enhance my chicken and pork meals. It tells where each spice or herb is from, a brief history, health benefits from using it, and what foods pair well. It will also tell you what other spices or herbs will work with it to make my own spice combinations. I didn't know there are two types of cinnamon or that it comes from the bark of trees. I also didn't know it is the ceylon cinnamon that is the one that lowers blood sugars. I also learned that garlic can lower blood pressure and cholesterol. I only thought it was good for warding off vampires. Did you know cilantro leaves are healthier than the seeds? I didn't but I do now. There is just so much to learn from this book.This book is easy to understand and has photos of each herb or spice it is describing. I think it will be good for even chefs that know something about cooking. I believe this is a book that every one will benefit from by reading it. I can't wait to try making pumpkin pie from scratch using fresh allspice in the filling this Thanksgiving.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6ATF2TN3GAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623156289#wasThisHelpful","R3F6ATF2TN3GAA","A3TB4WX2TOREEV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TB4WX2TOREEV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have used other low cost batteries in the past and I seem to fly through them. Especially when I am doing video's on my camera. Those just seem to eat up battery power. I bought this 20 pack because it was the least expensive and after a week I am still on my original 4 that I put in my camera. I have done quite a few video's plus still photos and I have not gotten the battery low light on my camera yet.

Nonetheless, as soon as you begin to massage it into your scalp, it lathers extremely well. Not really a con, just a head's up, so to speak. :)I went through cancer, where I had a 20 % chance of survival. Having said that, my hair never grew back in as thick as it was prior to the cancer.

I decided to seek something that might save or repair whatever damage the chemo put my hair and scalp through.Does this product work? I cannot say, because I have only been using it a week, and I wash my hair about 3-4 times during a week.  I will say that it makes my hair easier to manage, where after styling with my flat iron, my hair stays nice and looks super healthy.

I recommend using some sort of swaddling blanket to protect your chest from getting to wet. ;) You can also place the bracelet on baby's wrist, so they can teeth easily that way.The necklace and bracelet are safe, soft, durable, and definitely soothe those sore gums that come from a new tooth coming in. They also come in a variety of colors and shapes, so you can pretty much choose which one works best for you.

"My best friend seems to end up with wax build up that sometimes gives her pain.  I decided to see if this ear wax removal system would work for her. So far, it has. The videos are very easy to follow and very thorough. There are just so many. Very time consuming, having to go through all of that. Regardless, the system does in fact work. You have to watch the entire video collection.  Just like the rinse videos out there, this works well, even better, offering a simpler way to remove ear wax build up.She has removed almost all her wax and will continue using this system. She probably could have gotten it all, but has ended up with a head cold and decided to wait to try to removed the last little bit of wax.

"This is an interesting little bottle of love. The scent is different on each individual, so that is amazing in itself. When the package arrived, I opened the bottle, loved the scent, and decided to give it a try.My first victim was the UPS guy (Go figure).  I read the back, where it stated to walk through the mist, but I think I sprayed too much,  because the UPS guy dropped the boxes and ran back to is truck, almost being hit by a moped that happened by. It could have been the rollers in my hair, but then again... eh, who knows.My second choice was my husband (yes, second choice) . I sprayed a bit in warm places as he was walking in the door from work. He mumbled something to me, took off his shoes, sat down on the sofa and began reading the paper. I sat next to him. began leaning toward him, and fell onto the floor. He asked me, ""What is wrong with you?"" I thought, ""What the heck?""  I smiled awkwardly and slipped away.Hmmm... better think of another strategy to test this spray out. The mailman? No way, he would need his OWN bottle before I could even think of getting to close to that guy Yuck! Besides, he smells like feet.As the day went by, I decided to take a walk along the beach. As I approached the area where I stretch, a cute dog came running up. I smiled and walked away. When I looked back, he was behind me. Odd, that dog followed me all along the beach, and even home! He is still out there by my front door! What the heck?To make a long story even shorter, I love this spray, not because of the dog, but because in all actuality, it is a premium spray that has gotten me compliments, does not irritate my skin, and leaves a refreshing scent. Does it attract men? Who knows.

" 2:12 Mins I love these multi-color solar lights, because I usually have a solid color, so these are definitely a welcome addition. I cannot wait to place them on my palm outside this holiday season.First, I love that they are solar and do not need electric at all. It is cost-effective and a great way to stay green. They are simple to set up -- simply place the solar panel in the direct sunlight for about 8 hours and you are good to go.

"This anti-cellulite massage set feels so nice on my skin, especially after a long day of work and walking.  Each one promotes blood circulation and soothes sore and tired muscles.

"This product takes digital thermometers to a whole new level. We were offered this item at a discount in exchange for our unbiased opinion, if you're serious about grilling or like to cook multiple items at once, there is a definite advantage to going with this model. First, you can track up to four items at once, perfect if you're cooking a variety of meats at the same time that need to hit different temperatures. And then there's the app, taking your smartphone and turning it into a bluetooth receiver that can ping and monitor you, while offering helpful hints and advice. Now, I'm less technically savvy than my husband, and part of me likes the old-school wireless receiver that serves one purpose, and won't interrupt my game of Angry Birds when I need to go check on the meat. Still, this has some neat, high-tech functionality. I hope this review helps you in your search for a wireless thermometer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140V1SVHKXQXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THCADP4#wasThisHelpful","R140V1SVHKXQXK","A33D9CLL0TZ1M3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33D9CLL0TZ1M3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An essential item for the home cook or the grilling enthusiast. This digital thermometer is easy to use, provides a quick read, and will help you monitor your meats to prevent overcooking.

" 2:29 Mins LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Ivation counter-top ice maker. We've wanted an ice maker in our master suite but didn't have any interest in plumbing any water lines in. When I heard about this Ivation ice maker, I read the reviews, and watched the videos of it in action. It promised to be simple and efficient. I received the ice maker well packaged, and protected, in perfect shape. We plugged it in and ran a couple batches of ice through it, and tossed them in a bowl. We did this on our own, just in case there was any manufacturing debris. We checked the water after the ice melted and it was clear without any debris.We have owned and used this ice maker for about a week and love it. It makes great ice cubes and is super convenient. We drink lots of water and love it iced, so we don't have to run downstairs anymore. The ice maker will keep running all day, without complaints, unless you run out of water or the ice bin fills up.I got one of these for our best friends and they were just bragging how much they love their ice maker as well. Ivation is making a well built product, at a great price and with excellent functionality. Highly recommended.

"I'm an IT manager, and work on computers, and stare at monitors all day. I recently started experiencing eye strain and learned about computer glasses and their benefits. I recently purchase a pair of Gunnar Wi-Five when they were on a lightning Gold Box sale. Unfortunately, they didn't fit my head and they had a bit of magnification that I didn't appreciate. I wasn't interested in trying a different pair of $100 Gunnars so I looked around Amazon for other computer glasses. I found Duco glasses and glad I'm did. I really like the style they offer, they had good reviews and I didn't see anyone mention anything about magnified lenses. I contacted Duco and asked if they would provide me a pair for testing and reviewing purposes in return for my honest review, good or bad. They obliged me and I ordered the Duco GX090 glasses for delivery the next day. I liked the way the GX090's look and fit my face perfectly. They have a nice tapered design on the arms that hold them securely but don't squeeze the sides of my head. The rimless design compliments my face as well.Today was my 4th day at work wearing them, I have noticed a decrease in eye-strain and reduction of eye fatigue. They are lightweight and I forget the are on until someone notices them for the first time and pays a compliment. They have a yellow tint, but is much lighter than hunting glasses, or the Gunnars. One other thing to compare to Gunnars...

"I'm an IT manager, and work on computers, and stare at monitors all day. I recently started experiencing eye strain and learned about computer glasses and their benefits. Gunnar's came highly rated so I snapped these up when they were on the Amazon gold box deal. I wore them for a day and noticed that they eased the strain from the light reflections. They also had an undesired effect with a slight magnification.  That being said, these Wi-Five Gunnars did not fit my head and the arms put too much pressure on the side of my face. The metal frames didn't really fit my round face either, but you can't blame the manufacturer for that.

"I know coconut oil is all the rage, but there's a good reason for it. It's a healthy alternative to traditional cooking oil, and can substitute for a number of personal care products, from moisturizers to eye makeup remover. I also use coconut oil as a carrier for other essential oils (i.e. mix a few drops of peppermint oil with a tablespoon of coconut oil and use that in lieu of a chemical chest rub decongestant).

"Great quality, small footprint, and once setup, is easy to use. The camera was set to record in HD, 1080p. It was a little challenging to setup the first time, but once that was done, it was plug and play in the vehicle. With the power adapter plugged in, it will turn on when the vehicle is started. It will also start recording, so it is hands-free, and I don't have to remember to hit the record button. I did notice that a 2GB memory card only records about 20 minutes, so you want to make sure you have a large card for longer record times in HD. Speaking of memory cards, I have a 64GB Sandisk MicroSD card that I use in my GoPro , but this dash cam wouldn't recognize it. Even after formatting it with the camera. The only things that I had trouble with was the setup, and the memory card, so it's getting a 4.5 rating.10/1/15 Update - Bumping this up to 5 stars. Yes, it was challenging for me to setup, but since working that out, it has been very easy to use, and to grab the card to upload the recordings. I love that I don't have to think about this, or remember to turn it on, or to set it to record. It is always recording when the vehicle is running, so should anything happen, I will have footage of it. The other thing I didn't realize is that the camera can be tilted up or down. When I first installed it, it was pointing a bit high, because of the angle of the windshield. When I realized you could tilt the camera lens, I pointed it down, and now it's perfect.

"""Five Portraits"" is number thirty-nine in the sequence of Piers Anthony's ""Xanth"" comic fantasy stories which began with ""A Spell for Chameleon"" in 1977, and is a sequel to the previous book,  ""Board Stiff (Xanth Novels)."" ""Five Portraits"" features the same cast of major characters and is mostly set after the conclusion of ""Board Stiff"" though it features a flashback early in the book which explains some of the backstory of certain characters, particularly Astrid the Basilisk. Two characters who often appeared in early books as a nuisance and a menace respectively - Demoness Mentia and  Com-Pewter - are playing on the good team in both ""Board Stiff"" and ""Five Portraits."" Although there is continuity between these two books, however, each is a stand-alone story and you do not have to read them together.The series was a huge hit with fans and publishers - Piers Anthony is supposed to have said that the reason he is still writing Xanth books is to keep his publishers happy as the series is the only thing they ever pestered him for. Xanth is still going strong thirty-eight years of Earth time, a slightly higher number of books, and millions of copies after the 1977 debut.""Five Portraits"" and all the other books in the series are mostly set in a magical land called Xanth, a peninsular which usually looks a bit like Florida but can sometimes appear like other peninsulars such as Italy or Korea. All human residents of Xanth have a magic talent, which may vary from trivial to immensely powerful and from extremely useful to being a downright liability. The fauna, flora and geography of the land are based on a combination of legends and puns.This story is told particularly from the viewpoint of Astrid the Basilisk, a member of the party which went on a quest in the previous book to prevent all the puns of Xanth from being wiped out by a pun-killer virus. Astrid can change between human and basilisk form, but in both forms her direct gaze can kill so she has to wear dark glasses or be careful not to look directly at someone to avoid killing them. And being a compassionate person she does not like killing. She also wants to help when she finds a group of five children who need to be rescued from a most unusual situation ...The series as published and planned in November 2015 is as follows:1  ""A Spell for Chameleon"" (1977), link A Spell for Chameleon2  ""The Source of Magic"" (1979), link Source of Magic: Xanth Series, Book 23  ""Castle Roogna"" (1979), link Castle Roogna4  ""Centaur Aisle"" (1982)5  ""Ogre, Ogre"" (1982)6  ""Night Mare"" (1983)7  ""Dragon on a Pedestal"" (1983)8  ""Crewel Lye"" (1984)9  ""Golem in the Gears""10 ""Vale of the Vole"" (1987)11 ""Heaven Cent"" (1988)12 ""Man from Mundania"" (1989)13 ""Isle of View"" (1990)14 ""Question Quest"" (1991)15 ""The Color of Her Panties"" (1992)16 ""Demons Don't Dream"" (1992)17 ""Harpy Thyme"" (1993)18 ""Geis of the Gargoyle"" (1994)19 ""Roc and a Hard Place"" (1995)20 ""Yon Ill Wind"" (1996)21 ""Faun & Games"" (1997)22 ""Zombie Lover"" (1998)23 ""Xone of Contention"" (1999)24 ""The Dastard"" (2000)25 ""Swell Foop"" (2001)26 ""Up In A Heaval"" (2002)27 ""Cube Route"" (2003)28 ""Currant Events"" (2004)29 ""Pet Peeve"" (2005)30 ""Stork Naked"" (2006)31 ""Air Apparent"" (2007)32 ""Two to the Fifth"" (2008)33 ""Jumper Cable"" (2009)34 ""Knot Gneiss"" (2010)35 ""Well-Tempered Clavicle"" (2011)36 ""Luck of the Draw"" (2012)37 ""Esrever Doom"" (2013)38 ""Board Stiff"" (2014)39 This Book, ""Five Portraits"" (2014)40 ""Isis Orb"" (forthcoming)41 ""Ghost Writer in the Sky"" (forthcoming)There is also a companion volume, ""Piers Anthony's Visual Guide to Xanth"" and the co-author of that book, Jody Lynn Nye, has written the adventure book ""Ghost of a Chance (Crossroads Adventure : in the World of Pier Anthony's Xanth).A major part of the plot of the sixteenth book, ""Demons don't dream"" relates to a computer game about Xanth, and Legend Entertainment were licenced to bring out a real computer game shortly afterwards which had the same plot as the game in the book and the same name, ""Companions of Xanth."" This game was designed to run under DOS and is no longer available at Amazon UK although it can still be ordered from Amazon.com or downloaded as abandonware if you have a working computer old enough or flexible enough to run games designed for the specs and operating systems in place twenty years ago.If you have the right sort of sense of humour, particularly a love of dreadful puns, this book and most of its' successors can be quite amusing. These books are not meant to be taken seriously.Be warned that if you did take some of the Xanth books too seriously, they can come over as rather sexist even by the standards of the seventies, let alone those of today. Certain characters in the stories have unfortunate attitudes, to put it mildly, and the series has evolved its' own rather unique set of conventions about when nudity is or acceptable and how male characters react to the sight of a woman's underwear which may appear somewhere between childish, sexist, or just plain odd.However, many of the accusations of sexism against Piers Anthony over the Xanth books are based on taking out of context, and assuming that the author is endorsing, views which in context are clearly presented for the specific purpose of disproving them. In many Xanth stories the bad guys make serious mistakes by underestimating the female characters and the heroines often find that they can achieve far more than their initial low expectations of themselves.In context many of the antedeluvian attitudes to women attributed to characters in the Xanth books contribute to the failures suffered by those characters or are a sign that they are on the wrong side, and similar sexist perspectives initially attributed to heroes and heroines are sometimes there so that the characters concerned can grow by learning better.As you work through the Xanth series new characters and themes are gradually introduced and old ones fade away, so it is not essential to read this series in sequence, though I personally prefer to do so. Often, as with Com-Pewter in this story, characters who have faded out come back or figures who have been in the background, often as nuisances or opponents, move centre stage and sometimes become heroes..Worth a try if you enjoy fantasy and puns, are reasonably broad-minded, and able to avoid taking things too seriously or literally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V3RA57W6CD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624672728#wasThisHelpful","R3V3RA57W6CD6","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Board Stiff"" is number thirty-eight in the sequence of Piers Anthony's ""Xanth"" comic fantasy stories which began with ""A Spell for Chameleon"" in 1977, and features a most unexpected quest around the magic land of Xanth, some excursions into different genres, and a role reversal both for the main theme of the book - for the aim of the quest is almost the opposite of the role of the ""Caprice Castle"" characters from recent stories - and for one of the main characters, because this time Com-Pewter who was a nuisance or a menace in most opf the previous books, has a turn playing on the goodies team.The series was a huge hit with fans and publishers - Piers Anthony is supposed to have said that the reason he is still writing Xanth books is to keep his publishers happy as the series is the only thing they ever pestered him for. Xanth is still going strong thirty-eight years of Earth time, a slightly higher number of books, and millions of copies after the 1977 debut.""Board Stiff"" and all the other books in the series are mostly set in a magical land called Xanth, a peninsular which usually looks a bit like Florida but can sometimes appear like other peninsulars such as Italy or Korea. All human residents of Xanth have a magic talent, which may vary from trivial to immensely powerful and from extremely useful to being a downright liability. The fauna, flora and geography of the land are based on a combination of legends and puns.The primary heroine of this book is lady called Candy, or to give her full name, Irrelevant Candy. When she goes by her full name nobody pays her any attention: in the first of many terrible puns in the story, when she shortens it to I. Candy she gets too much of the wrong sort of attention from men who think she is nice to look at but good for nothing else.So Candy goes to a wishing well and asks for Adventure, Excitement, and Romance - only to find herself transformed into a flat, stiff board with two knotholes for eyes. (This is not a spoiler as it is given on the book description on the back of the book and on the publisher's description on this and every other site.)But Candy soon finds herself with a group of companions, some of whom know she is more than just a wooden board and some of whom do not. Following the inevitable challenge to get in and see the good magician, the characters find themselves on a quest to stop Xanth from becoming a flat and boring place - with some unexpected allies and opponents ...The next book in the series, number 39 ""Five Portraits (Xanth),"" is to some extent a sequel to ""Board Stiff"" in that it has essentially the same cast of characters and carries on where this book finishes. However, each is a complete story and can be read on its' own if that is what you want to do.The series as published and planned in October 2015 is as follows:1  ""A Spell for Chameleon"" (1977), link A Spell for Chameleon2  ""The Source of Magic"" (1979), link Source of Magic: Xanth Series, Book 23  ""Castle Roogna"" (1979), link Castle Roogna4  ""Centaur Aisle"" (1982)5  ""Ogre, Ogre"" (1982)6  ""Night Mare"" (1983)7  ""Dragon on a Pedestal"" (1983)8  ""Crewel Lye"" (1984)9  ""Golem in the Gears""10 ""Vale of the Vole"" (1987)11 ""Heaven Cent"" (1988)12 ""Man from Mundania"" (1989)13 ""Isle of View"" (1990)14 ""Question Quest"" (1991)15 ""The Color of Her Panties"" (1992)16 ""Demons Don't Dream"" (1992)17 ""Harpy Thyme"" (1993)18 ""Geis of the Gargoyle"" (1994)19 ""Roc and a Hard Place"" (1995)20 ""Yon Ill Wind"" (1996)21 ""Faun & Games"" (1997)22 ""Zombie Lover"" (1998)23 ""Xone of Contention"" (1999)24 ""The Dastard"" (2000)25 ""Swell Foop"" (2001)26 ""Up In A Heaval"" (2002)27 ""Cube Route"" (2003)28 ""Currant Events"" (2004)29 ""Pet Peeve"" (2005)30 ""Stork Naked"" (2006)31 ""Air Apparent"" (2007)32 ""Two to the Fifth"" (2008)33 ""Jumper Cable"" (2009)34 ""Knot Gneiss"" (2010)35 ""Well-Tempered Clavicle"" (2011)36 ""Luck of the Draw"" (2012)37 ""Esrever Doom"" (2013)38 This book, ""Board Stiff"" (2014)39 ""Five Portraits"" (2014)40 ""Isis Orb"" (forthcoming)41 ""Ghost Writer in the Sky"" (forthcoming)There is also a companion volume, ""Piers Anthony's Visual Guide to Xanth"" and the co-author of that book, Jody Lynn Nye, has written the adventure book ""Ghost of a Chance (Crossroads Adventure : in the World of Pier Anthony's Xanth).A major part of the plot of the sixteenth book, ""Demons don't dream"" relates to a computer game about Xanth, and Legend Entertainment were licenced to bring out a real computer game shortly afterwards which had the same plot as the game in the book and the same name, ""Companions of Xanth."" This game was designed to run under DOS and is no longer available at Amazon UK although it can still be ordered from Amazon.com or downloaded as abandonware if you have a working computer old enough or flexible enough to run games designed for the specs and operating systems in place twenty years ago.If you have the right sort of sense of humour, particularly a love of dreadful puns, this book and most of its' successors can be quite amusing. These books are not meant to be taken seriously.Be warned that if you did take some of the Xanth books too seriously, they can come over as rather sexist even by the standards of the seventies, let alone those of today. Certain characters in the stories have unfortunate attitudes, to put it mildly, and the series has evolved its' own rather unique set of conventions about when nudity is or acceptable and how male characters react to the sight of a woman's underwear which may appear somewhere between childish, sexist, or just plain odd.However, many of the accusations of sexism against Piers Anthony over the Xanth books are based on taking out of context, and assuming that the author is endorsing, views which in context are clearly presented for the specific purpose of disproving them. In many Xanth stories the bad guys make serious mistakes by underestimating the female characters and the heroines often find that they can achieve far more than their initial low expectations of themselves.In context many of the antedeluvian attitudes to women attributed to characters in the Xanth books contribute to the failures suffered by those characters or are a sign that they are on the wrong side, and similar sexist perspectives initially attributed to heroes and heroines are sometimes there so that the characters concerned can grow by learning better.As you work through the Xanth series new characters and themes are gradually introduced and old ones fade away, so it is not essential to read this series in sequence, though I personally prefer to do so. Often, as with Com-Pewter in this story, characters who have faded out come back or figures who have been in the background, often as nuisances or opponents, move centre stage and sometimes become heroes..Worth a try if you enjoy fantasy and puns, are reasonably broad-minded, and able to avoid taking things too seriously or literally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I81BJUDFH8SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624670865#wasThisHelpful","R2I81BJUDFH8SV","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Great War Syndicate by Frank R Stockton (1834-1902) is a science fiction novella by an American writer and humourist, best known for a series of fairy stories for children, innovative for the time, which were very popular in the latter decades of the 19th century, and for his short stories such as ""The Lady, or the Tiger?.This story was written and is set towards the end of the 19th century at a time of increasing tension between the United States of America and the British Empire. When the tensions threaten to spill over into an actual conflict and the American public are demanding that their leaders declare a war which the United States is not well equipped to fight, a syndicate offer the US government a novel way to deal with the problem ...This is a comparatively short book - a novella rather than a novel, with the story taking up no more than 64 pages. It is a story of its' time, with the 2007 edition including the warning that it ""does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today. Parents might wish to discuss with their children how views on race have changed before allowing them to read this classic work.""To try to describe the story without giving too much away, there are some clever ideas in the story, but many of them are a sort of fusion of Jules Verne and a Marvel comic strip - but without the heroes or human interest - with a strong dash of W Heath Robinson thrown in. With two very minor exceptions, none of the people in the story is given a name, all of them being referred to only by the position they hold in the syndicate or the armed forces or government of Britain or America. I ticked ""one dimensional"" as a description of the characters - if anything this overstates how developed they are, the book barely has characters at all.Stockton's skill in describing his proposed machines and making them credible is not in the same league as Jules Verne, and a few pages into this book I very nearly abandoned it on the basis that the author appeared to be projecting victory for his country by simply ascribing to the engineers of his ""syndicate"" the ability to construct whatever they wanted without needing to worry about whether the laws of physics would give any possibility of such equipment being built even with the technology of the 21st century, never mind the 19th. A bit like the sort of ""and next our brilliant inventors will build suits of lightweight and totally bulletproof body armour and issue them to all our people"" rubbish you expect to see in children's comics.There are however two things which lift this novella above the that. The first is that it is refreshingly free of Xenophobia or jingoism, with the sympathetic characters both American and British being concerned to minimise unnecessary bloodshed on both sides and the people who from the storyteller's view are the enemy being described as showing courage, skill, wisdom and common sense. The other is the whimsical sense of humour which comes through at several points of the story and once or twice made me laugh out loud.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JWL95XX9GDQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604591226#wasThisHelpful","R2JWL95XX9GDQB","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of David Weber's work is military SF, but he has branched out into the swords and sorcery genre with his series about Bahzell Bahnakson which as of October 2015 consists of the following five books:1) ""Oath of Swords (War God)""2) ""The War God's Own""3) ""Wind Rider's Oath (The Bahzell)""4) This book, ""War Maid's Choice""5) The Sword of the South (Baen)I don't usually have much time for ""Conan"" style books even when they're written by authors of the calibre of Roland Green or Harry Turtledove, but this series is something else.Some of the particular strengths of the Bahzell Bahnakson series are things which are carried over from Weber's other work - good use of humour, brave but believable heroes and heroines, characters who have to overcome their own prejudices and mostly do so.One thing which I appreciate about David Weber as an author is that he does not find it necessary to insert a gratuitous love story into every book, even in this genre. Not that his characters are sexless or incapable of love, and without wanting to spoil things this series is not entirely lacking in romance, but Weber's characters fall in love when it fits the bigger story canvass and not for the sake of including a romance in every volume in some formulaic pattern.Perhaps the best feature of this book, like the earlier ones in the series, is that it is not entirely predictable and first impressions are not always right. For example, when one of the central characters meets someone who initially appears to be a bigoted blockhead, there is a roughly 25% chance that he or she really will turn out to be a hopeless case or a bad guy, and a 75% chance that he or she will actually be an honest person who is at least sometimes capable of doing the right thing. Equally some of those who appear at first to be good guys (or girls) turn out to be in the wrong, or even working for the dark Gods.The storyline is strong, if a little complicated. It is much easier to keep track of what is going on if you had previously read the first three books in the series.There are some irritating minor issues in the presentation of the book. It contains one map, of a scale such as to be fairly useeless.. There is a list of mortal characters at the back of the book with a list of Gods (good and evil) at the back. One or two key characters from previous books who are repeatedly referred to are missing from that list, such as Wencit of Rum, (Former leader and last survivor of the Wizard's council and very approximately the equivalent of Gandalf or Belgarath).Some excellent humour - for example, at one stage the line ""You look like you've seen a ghost"" is spoken by - a ghost.Bottom line: if you liked any of David Weber's other books, and provided it wasn't specifically for space battles, read the Bahzell Bahnakson books and you are unlikely to be disappointed. If you like the swords and sorcery genre generally, it is also very likely that you will like these five books. But if you do read any of these, make sure to read them in the right order.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OKSH2LIDTYA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451639015#wasThisHelpful","R2OKSH2LIDTYA2","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Project Fear"" by Joe Pike is about a referendum campaign which went wrong and should be required reading for anyone planning to take part on either side in the forthcoming campaigns for and against British membership of the EU - if only as a terrible warning of the mistakes to avoid.I knew before I read this book that both sides had messed up during the Scottish Referendum battle but until I read this book I did not realise how badly.What ""Project Fear"" is:* a fascinating inside account of the ""Better Together/No Thanks"" campaign in the Scottish independence referendum, which continues to the 2015 general election and describes how the referendum result turned into a phyrric victory for most of the actors on the winning site as they suffered electoral annihilation the following year.* extremely interesting and entertaining* impossible to put down for anyone interested in politics* A ""how not to do it"" manual for anyone planning a referendum campaign (Vote Leave, Leave.EU, and ""Britain stronger in Europe"" please note)What ""Project Fear"" is not:* Strong on analysis* Entirely impartial - the author has obviously spoken to many people from both campaigns and clearly made a genuine attempt to fairly give both sides of the story but it is patently evident that he is much more closely connected to ""Better Together"" and Scottish Labour in particular than to the SNP or ""Yes Scotland"" and most, though not all, of the interesting insights in the book are on the ""Better together"" side.Ironically we find out in the early pages of the book where the expression ""Project Fear"" came from. It was coined within ""Better together"" not as a description of the campaign they wanted to fight but as how they thought the ""Yes"" campaign would try to paint them. The irony is that the term leaked and of course the SNP were delighted at the chance to do exactly that.The first thing which horrified me about this book was how the divisive nature of the campaign, the untrue statements put about by the Nationalists and over-concentration on negative arguments by the unionists, have left a legacy of distrust and anger which will scar Scotland for years.  Hence my comment about the referendum campaign having gone wrong, whichever result you would have liked to see.The second thing which horrified me on reading this book was the dawning realisation of how easy it would be for each side in the forthcoming European referendum to repeat the mistakes of one or both sides. The epilogue to this book notes that ""The dynamics of the EU and SCottish referendums are eerily similar. It also notes that there have already been attempts to draw lessons that people involved in the one campaign can learn from the other, though the consensus view was that the main lessons to learn were the mistakes to avoid.And what mistakes!One side failed to do the heavy lifting of working out exactly how an Independent Scotland would work - the SNP's 650 page manifesto for a Scottish nation contained just one page of costings and their proposal that an Independent Scotland could keep the pound was, as Labour's Scottish leader rightly described it, like someone initiating a divorce but wanting to keep the joint bank account.The other side failed - until, arguably,  shortly before the end of the campaign - to come up with a compelling positive vision for Scotland within Britain and made far too much use of negative warnings about what could go wrong with Independence - many of which were in my humble opinion, entirely justified but some were silly and even certain of the valid points could be (and were) easily made by the SNP to look extremely petty.The book brings out the way the referendum campaign was also disfigured by highly abusive campaigning from some quarters: there were people on both sides who rose above this but others on both sides who did not. The manner in which the worst offenders on both sides, particularly some ""Cybernats,"" went out of their way to make life hell for those they disagreed with and regarded as traitors was incredibly harmful and counterproductive: had they succeeded the new nation they created would have come into being in an atmosphere of intolerance and hate.The book also describes how that anger continued up to the General election. It has continued since then, as well, and one issue the book does not cover is that some of that anger and bitterness extends into the rest of the UK as well. Many English voters - and please, note, on this occasion when I say English I really mean English, not British - were thoroughly irritated by having to listen to months of hearing their part of Britain regularly blamed for all the ills of Scotland by the more extreme supporters of the Yes campaign in a manner which sometimes verged on anti-English racism. One of the reasons for the surprise Conservative victory in the 2015 general election was the reluctance of many English voters to risk the possibility that a Labour government might have to rely on SNP support.This book is mostly narrative, without very much in the way of analysis, but the narrative is a gripping one - even if it is a bit like a modern political version of a cross between a Greek tragedy and ""Macbeth.""Some people reading this review might ask, since ""Better together"" won the campaign, why I have praised this book as an account of a referendum went wrong. My answer would be that nobody can have been happy with the overall outcome. The Yes campaign didn't get independence: the parties who worked together in the ""No campaign"" won in 2014 but were slaughtered in the following year's general election; andIf I had bought this book believing that I was buying a comprehensive and balanced academic assessment or history of the campaign, I would have been disappointed and given it at most three stars, But ""Project Fear"" was presented as an inside account of the story of the campaign, and how an unlikely alliance left a Kingdom united but a country divided, and that it delivers in spades. It is on that basis that I have given it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K1H5NLEUCAQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849549311#wasThisHelpful","R3K1H5NLEUCAQ5","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" by Ridley Scott is certainly a dramatic and entertaining re-envisaging of the story of Moses, and Christian Bale does a reasonable job playing Moses as a man of action  - a prince and general turned rebel leader rather than an elderly patriarch. If you want to watch a modern Hollywood version of the Book of Exodus, purely for entertainment value, you will probably like this.The action is well paced and exciting, the visual depiction of the magnificence of ancient Egypt is sumptuous. The battle and action scenes are well drawn - the depiction of the battle of Kadesh in particular - and the special effects are magnificent. Most of the acting is very good though one or two of the accents used were surprising: for example the High Priestess of Egypt has a cut glass English accent (she's played by Indira Varma, who is English) and a character who appears in the cast list as ""expert"" (Ewen Bremner) has a Scottish one. And far too many characters in the story were given blatantly 21st century attitudes - for example the Scottish ""expert"" produces a very secular explanation for the plagues, which is very close to what some modern scientists who think this section of the bible might be based on a real event have theorised.If you were hoping to see either a film which reflects the viewpoint of a religious believer or that of of someone who is interested in a rationalist view of what might have actually happened with minimal supernatural involvement, you may feel that this film falls between those two stools. I also felt that the film was cut down a bit too much, apparently to fit into an arbitrary time limit, and some of the ""deleted scenes"" on the disc would have been better left in. If there is a slightly longer ""director's cut"" released in the future it may work better.My biggest problem with the film is something which may be very much a personal and minority view but here goes. It's the fact that ""Exodus: God's and Kings"" takes the traditional view that the Pharaoh of the exodus was Ramses or Ramesses II, known as Ramesses the Great, and that the Hebrews escaped from Egypt in the 13th century BC. The date when the film starts is given as 1300 BC.I see why that view might make sense to the ""Copenhagen School"" of biblical minimalist historians who regard the Torah (the Old Testament of the Bible) as a collection of nationalistically-slanted legends assembled between 100 BC and 500 BC and of which the earlier books are of little value as historical source documents. I can also see why someone who was only interesting in making a dramatic film of the Book of Exodus might want to pit Moses against Ramesses the Great who was possibly the most powerful ruler in the entire history of ancient Egypt.However, this film appears to be an attempt to tell a story like the one in the bible in a way which makes at least some attempt to link in with real Egyptian history. And if you do think that something like the disasters which struck Egypt in the book of Exodus actually had a basis in history, then that was not the most plausible century to set this story.It is less likely that such a catastrophic series of events would have occurred during the long, successful, and comparatively well documented reign of Ramesses II (1279-1213 BC) yet without any mention in surviving Egyptian records of that reign, than that it could have happened in one of the less stable periods of Egyptian history from which far fewer records have survived. This is particularly true because some of the few records which did survive from some of those earlier centuries  actually do suggest cataclysmic events which might match the biblical account.Those reputable historians and archaeologists who think there might be a historical basis for the Ten Plagues - and although they are not currently in the majority, there are some - usually place that sequence of events between two and four centuries prior to the reign of Ramesses the Great, perhaps during the Second Intermediate Period of Egyptian history. For example it is known that the massive volcanic eruption which destroyed the island of Santorini, (also known as the Thera event) caused massive environmental disruption over a huge area of the planet, and could well have sparked off a series of ecological catastrophes in Egypt similar to the biblical description of the plagues. There is much debate about exactly when that eruption occurred, with archaeological, carbon dating, and tree ring evidence suggesting different dates but it was probably between about 1628 BC and 1500 BC  with the earlier date, which comes from tree ring data, currently regarded as the most likely.Some historians such as David Rohl, author of ""A Test Of Time: Volume One-The Bible-From Myth to History"" have argued that it would be more plausible to identify the Pharaoh of the Exodus with a ruler some centuries prior to Ramesses II, such as Tutimaos, of whom the ancient Egyptian chronicler Manetho was to write centuries later, ""In his reign, for what cause I know not, a blast of God smote us.""To be fair, most historians do not agree. Some of them think the entire story of the Exodus is complete fiction and literally never happened at all, others think that a small group of slaves, too insignificant to be worth recording in Egyptian records, may have escaped from Egypt at around the time of the reign of Ramesses the Great, become part of the group of tribes who were to become the Hebrews, and given rise to the Exodus legend. Both these groups of historians think the early books of the Old Testament are a collection of myths assembled as Hebrew religious and nationalist propaganda a thousand years after the events they purport to describe, are completely unreliable, and in the words of one professor, any attempt to integrate the events of the bible into a historical narrative is, in the words of one Professor ""not only dubious but wholly ludicrous.""I don't have the expert knowledge to argue that this view is wrong, but there's no point whatsoever in making a film like ""Exodus: God's and Kings"" conform to it, because if it is right you have absolutely nothing to make such a film about!If you ARE going to make a film like this, and you're also going to make any attempt to integrate it into real Egyptian history, you might as well make it match the arguments of the current minority view among the experts who do think something like the events of ""Exodus"" (the bible book and this film) could really have happened. In which case you should probably set it before the reign of Ramesses the Great.A few more points on the actual history. Many aspects of this are quite good, but others are open to challenge.The caption at the start of the film gives the time and place as 1300BC in Memphis, capital of Egypt, but it begins during the reign of Seti the first. There is debate about exactly when Set I came to the throne, but it was probably a few years after 1300 BC. The main capital of Egypt in 1300BC was at Thebes. However, Seti I, the Pharaoh in the early part of the film, did reign mainly from Memphis. His son Ramesses II who is Pharaoh for most of the film built a new capital at Pi-Ramesses in the Nile Delta.The depiction of the battle of Kadesh is quite good and reasonably historically accurate except that it conflates two campaigns. In real history, the city of Kadesh was captured by the Egyptians from the Hittites in the reign of Seti I, and the future Ramses the Great, who was then crown prince, was present during that campaign. A few years later, four years after Ramesses II had become Pharaoh in his own right, there was another military action at Kadesh which was the largest chariot battle in known history and in which, at one point, Ramesses nearly got cut off from most of his army and killed.In the film, the battle of Kadesh takes place during the earlier campaign while Seti I is still Pharaoh and Ramesses still crown prince, but apart from this and from the fact that a role has been found for Moses, it takes place in the film very much as it did in real history. There is a subsequent scene when the wording of the official record of the battle to be carved onto monuments is being agreed, and in which Ramesses says that he was cut off from his troops and saved by divine intervention. The scriptwriters took the trouble to get this exactly right and the wording agreed in the film is word for word identical to the most common translation of that account as it survives on real monuments of the battle.After seeing lots of films in which Morgan Freeman plays the part of God, the manner in which this film treats Him is very different. I'm not going to describe it to avoid a spoiler, but it was at least original.One change from the biblical story which is perhaps representative of the way Moses is presented in this film is that he is given a sword at the beginning. The various actions which Moses or his brother Aaron carry out with their staffs in the bible are carried out with Moses's sword in this film.Overall this film has a lot of strengths if you are looking for entertainment, though I can't help thinking that if you are looking for accuracy or plausibility it could and should have been better. As with Darren Aronofsky's recent film version of ""Noah [DVD],"" Ridley Scott was depicting a story from the bible and had to decide whether to present it as an openly supernatural series of events or try to show how the events of the story could have happened in a natural manner. ""Noah"" went for the former route and was a better film for not trying to sit on the fence. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" seems a little uncomfortable with aspects of the bible story but unwilling to completely abandon them, and in consequence is not quite as convincing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NFZNMS2BL2U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIG11ZS#wasThisHelpful","R3NFZNMS2BL2U9","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The preface of this book begins as follows:""The economy of Greece is in shambles. Internal rebellions have engulfed Libya, Syria and Egypt, with outsiders and foreign warriors fanning the flames. Turkey fears it will become involved, as does Israel. Jordan is crowded with refugees. Iran is bellicose and threatening, while Iraq is in turmoil"" Sound like a description of the present situation?""Yes. But it was also the situation in 1177 BC, more than three thousand years ago, when the Bronze Age Mediterranean civilisations collapsed one after the other.""This is of course a bit of an oversimplification, but to be fair, the book itself does not oversimplify. It summarises in a readable and accessible way the evidence we have about how the civilisations of the late Bronze age in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East interacted and traded with each other, and how so many of them went down like dominoes early in the 12th century BC.I can recommend ""1177 BC, The Year Civilization Collapsed"" by Eric Cline as an interesting read in its' own right but also because the period described has so many parallels to our own age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI3GM2D7FLCDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXDXRRK#wasThisHelpful","RI3GM2D7FLCDX","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Admiral: Command and Conquer is the English Language release of a Dutch film about the great 17th Century Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter. With a prologue depicting a somewhat ahistorical version of the Battle of Scheveningen in 1653, the film depicts the de Ruyter's career, and Dutch politics, from the time he took over as Lieutenant-Admiral (which effectively meant commander) of the Dutch navy until his last battle in 1676.It's a dramatic and visually sumptuous film which is a must-see for fans of sailing navy action. Some aspects of the history are presented very well indeed, but be warned that other aspects of the history presented are so ridiculous that purists who like their historical fiction to bear some resemblance to actual history may find themselves reaching for something to throw at the screen. For example the very first words of the film are ‘The Seventeenth Century: the Netherlands is the only republic in the world.’DOH! What about Switzerland, Venice, and Genoa?The cover of the DVD box of ""Admiral"" gives the impression that Charles Dance is the central character: actually he plays Charles II of Britain, who is the villain. Of course, since this is a Dutch film about a Dutch national hero, and Britain and Holland were at war for almost all the timeframe of the film, making the king of an enemy nation the villain was not a controversial or surprising thing, but that DVD box is a bit misleading.British and Dutch historians who know much more about the 17th century and the navies of the time than I do have praised the depiction of 17th century ""fighting sail"" combat in this film. They had some fun teasing the film-makers about the fact that the Union Flag on British ships was shown in the wrong place (as an Ensign at the stern rather than a Jack at the masthead) though at least they did use a historically accurate version of the flag. The first Union flag created in 1606 following the Union of the English and Scottish crowns was a combination of the Cross of St George and the Saltire and this is correctly shown in the film. (The diagonal red bars of St Patrick's cross were not added until 1801.)The role of de Ruyter and ""Grand Pensionary"" Johan de Witt in reforming the Dutch navy (just as Samuel Pepys radically reformed Britain's Royal Navy at approximately the same time) is presented very quickly as if it was all done and dusted in one short meeting, but is broadly accurate. De Ruyter is indeed remembered as the founder of Holland's marine corps, though he was not the inventor of the concept (that goes back at least as far as the Romans!) De Witt is referred to in the film as ""Prime Minister"" which is probably the closest thing to an accurate modern equivalent of the title of ""Grand Pensionary.""Although the film covers a period of 23 years the viewer could be forgiven for assuming it was a much shorter period of time: De Ruyter's family do not age: for example, his son is presented as being a gangly adolescent throughout the film, which he was indeed at the time of Scheveningen, but he was a senior captain by the time of the Battle of Augusta. And as the time is rather shortened the enemy commanders are rolled together.The same actor plays the French admiral in command both at the battle of the Texel and at de Ruyter's last fight, the Battle of Augusta. That character is named in the cast list at the end of the film as Abraham Duquesne, which is the name of the Admiral in command at Augusta, one of the most successful French naval commanders of all time. Perhaps fortunately for the Dutch, Duquesne was not in command of the French fleet at the Texel: the French admiral at that battle was Jean D'Estrees. The film presents the French ships at the Texel as suffering a fate remarkably like what in real history happened to D'estrees' fleet five years later in the Caribbean.Similarly the British are shown as having the same command team, George Monck and Prince Rupert, at the Four Days battle in 1666 and the Texel in 1673. In reality Monck was the British Commander in Chief at the former battle, which Prince Rupert of the Rhine's squadron only joined on the last day. Prince Rupert then took over as commander of the British fleet. He still held that position six years later and was in overall command of the British and French combined fleet at the Texel.In the trailer the words ""I think it would be unwise to underestimate de Ruyter"" are taken from the film's depiction of a briefing of allied commanders before the Battle of the Texel. In the film they are spoken by George Monck: in real history he had died of natural causes three years before in 1670.Without wishing to spoil the ending of the film by explaining exactly what is wrong with it, the depiction of de Ruyter's final campaign in the Mediterranean in 1676 and of the battle of Augusta is a travesty of the truth. William the Third of England and the Netherlands and Second of Scotland was no saint, but the idea that he betrayed de Ruyter in the manner depicted in this film is risible. The iconic depiction near the end of the film of de Ruyter leading his fleet into battle against the French at Augusta is great as drama but utter nonsense as history.Having said all that, the depiction of 17th century naval warfare was both very dramatic and generally well done, and the presentation of the interaction between the fight to preserve Dutch independence and the power struggles within Dutch politics - between supporters of the Republic and of the House of Orange - was both clever and, I am told, accurate. It doesn't pull punches and the grisly fate of the Republican leaders Johan and Cornelis de Witt is presented in gory detail.All characters are shown speaking in the appropriate languages, with suitable subtitles for the relevant releases of the film: for example Charles II, Monck and other British characters speak English and in the UK version there are subtitles for the French and Dutch characters.It's an entertaining film and many parts of it are excellent. A pity that one or two others, particularly the depiction of de Ruyters' final mission, are so utterly inaccurate. But if you are interested in the age of fighting sail, you can no more miss this film than you could miss ""Master and Commander.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNVWMOEN4DEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUDIVVK#wasThisHelpful","R1DNVWMOEN4DEA","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Faun and Games"" is number twenty-one in the sequence of Piers Anthony's ""Xanth"" comic fantasy stories which began with ""A Spell for Chameleon"" in 1977, and features a trip to worlds within worlds where everything that could possibly exist in Xanth does - apparently including the most corny puns imaginable.The series was a huge hit with fans and publishers - Piers Anthony is supposed to have said that the reason he is still writing Xanth books is to keep his publishers happy as the series is the only thing they ever pestered him for. Xanth is still going strong thirty-eight years of Earth time, a similar number of books, and millions of copies after the 1977 debut.""Faun and Games"" and all the other books in the series are mostly set in a magical land called Xanth, a peninsular which usually looks a bit like Florida but can sometimes appear like other peninsulars such as Italy or Korea. All the human residents of Xanth have a magic talent, which may vary from trivial to immensely powerful and from extremely useful to being a downright liability. The fauna, flora and geography of the land are based on a combination of legends and puns.The hero of the book is a faun called Forrest Faun, who as many other central characters in the series have been, is teased at the beginning by an irritating demoness, in this case D. Mentia. But she soon leads him to the discovery that his friend branch faun, and a nymph have suffered a terrible calamity, leaving their trees with no spirit to look after them. He travels to see the Good Magician to ask how a spirit can be restored to these trees.Folliwing the invitable challenge to get in and see the good magician, one of the most loved characters if the series, Mare Imbri the former ight mare (now day mare) makes a return to guide Forrest to the tiny planet of Ptero where everything that could ever exist can be found - apparently including a lot of the most corny puns imaginable. To give an idea of how bad they are, some of the worst ones were created by Attila the Pun ...The series as published and planned in October 2015 is as follows:1  ""A Spell for Chameleon"" (1977), link A Spell for Chameleon2  ""The Source of Magic"" (1979), link Source of Magic: Xanth Series, Book 23  ""Castle Roogna"" (1979), link Castle Roogna4  ""Centaur Aisle"" (1982)5  ""Ogre, Ogre"" (1982)6  ""Night Mare"" (1983)7  ""Dragon on a Pedestal"" (1983)8  ""Crewel Lye"" (1984)9  ""Golem in the Gears""10 ""Vale of the Vole"" (1987)11 ""Heaven Cent"" (1988)12 ""Man from Mundania"" (1989)13 ""Isle of View"" (1990)14 ""Question Quest"" (1991)15 ""The Color of Her Panties"" (1992)16 ""Demons Don't Dream"" (1992)17 ""Harpy Thyme"" (1993)18 ""Geis of the Gargoyle"" (1994)19 ""Roc and a Hard Place"" (1995)20 ""Yon Ill Wind"" (1996)21 This book, ""Faun & Games"" (1997)22 ""Zombie Lover"" (1998)23 ""Xone of Contention"" (1999)24 ""The Dastard"" (2000)25 ""Swell Foop"" (2001)26 ""Up In A Heaval"" (2002)27 ""Cube Route"" (2003)28 ""Currant Events"" (2004)29 ""Pet Peeve"" (2005)30 ""Stork Naked"" (2006)31 ""Air Apparent"" (2007)32 ""Two to the Fifth"" (2008)33 ""Jumper Cable"" (2009)34 ""Knot Gneiss"" (2010)35 ""Well-Tempered Clavicle"" (2011)36 ""Luck of the Draw"" (2012)37 ""Esrever Doom"" (2013)38 ""Board Stiff"" (2014)39 ""Five Portals"" (2014)40 ""Isis Orb"" (forthcoming)41 ""Ghost Writer in the Sky"" (forthcoming)There is also a companion volume, ""Piers Anthony's Visual Guide to Xanth"" and the co-author of that book, Jody Lynn Nye, has written the adventure book ""Ghost of a Chance (Crossroads Adventure : in the World of Pier Anthony's Xanth).A major part of the plot of the sixteenth book, ""Demons don't dream"" relates to a computer game about Xanth, and Legend Entertainment were licenced to bring out a real computer game shortly afterwards which had the same plot as the game in the book and the same name, ""Companions of Xanth."" This game was designed to run under DOS and is no longer available at Amazon UK although it can still be ordered from Amazon.com or downloaded as abandonware if you have a working computer old enough or flexible enough to run games designed for the specs and operating systems in place twenty years ago.If you have the right sort of sense of humour, particularly a love of dreadful puns, this book and most of its' successors can be quite amusing. These books are not meant to be taken seriously.Be warned that if you did take some of the Xanth books too seriously, they can come over as rather sexist even by the standards of the nineties, let alone those of today.Some of the accusations of sexism against Piers Anthony over the Xanth books are based on taking out of context, and assuming that the author is endorsing, views which in context are clearly presented for the specific purpose of disproving them. In several Xanth stories the bad guys make bad mistakes by underestimating the female characters and the heroines often find that they can achieve far more than their initial low expectations of themselves.In context many of the antedeluvian attitudes to women attributed to characters in the Xanth books contribute to the failures suffered by those characters or are a sign that they are on the wrong side, and similar sexist perspectives initially attributed to heroes and heroines are sometimes there so that the characters concerned can grow by learning better.As you work through the Xanth series new characters and themes are gradually introduced and old ones fade away, so it it not essential to read this series in sequence, though I personally prefer to do so. Sometimes, as with Xanth in this story, characters who have faded out come back or figures who have been in the background move centre stage.Worth a try if you enjoy fantasy and puns, are reasonably broad-minded, and able to avoid taking things too seriously or literally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ORXUSCRS2A53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MZLHCM#wasThisHelpful","R2ORXUSCRS2A53","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a high level of historical period accuracy this film is not for you - Director Alan Rickman himself says on the extras that if you know a lot about this period of history you will know that some of the film is true and some of it is nonsense. But if you are looking for an entertaining romance with some excellent acting you cannot miss it, especially if you are a fan of Rickman or of Kate Winslet.The review is based on watching the film on DVD with my wife: I bought it because I could not resist seeing what Rickman, who in addition to directing plays the part of the Sun King Louis XIV of France, would do with that part. (The answer was, a great deal.)The film is a love story based around the construction of the Gardens at Louis XIV's palace at Versailles, and particularly about the creation of an outdoor ballroom which does actually exist and was built for real by André le Ntre, the hero of the film - although in real history he was pushing seventy years of age when that feature was built, about twice the age of Matthias Schoenaerts.This is the exact opposite of the casting inconsistency made in another 17th century period epic film which came out this year, the Dutch film ""Admiral: Command and Conquer [DVD]"" about the life of Admiral Michel De Ruyter in which King Charles II was played by Charles Dance who is twice the age King Charles was in the timeframe of the film. Perhaps Rickman and the creators of ""Admiral: Command and Conquer"" should have swapped Schoenaerts and Dance so they could each have an actor within three decades of the same age as the real historical character they were playing!The heroine of the story is Kate Winslet who plays a fictional character called Sabine de Barra, a lady landscape gardener who is hired by Andre le Notre to build a particular part of the gardens, the outdoor ballroom also called the Rocaille Grove, because of the millstones and the sea shells brought back from the coasts of Africa and Madagascar over which the water pours down in a cascade.This gives rise to a conflict between the visions of the two characters, Andre's passion for order and Sabine's love of landscape, a tension which was very much at the heart of real-life landscape gardening at the time. Their romance is played out against the background of the glittering, beautiful and poisonous intrigue of the Sun King's court, many - but not all - of the details of which are well captured.Visually this is a sumptuously beautiful film with the intricate glitter of a spectacular age being very well presented.Not a film for historical purists or indeed purists of any kind, but if you would enjoy watching some very talented actors give some of the best performances of their careers in an amusing, entertaining and sophisticated romantic romp, you will enjoy this DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QACMVCK9NSFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7R9FWQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QACMVCK9NSFI","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, ""A Call to Arms"" by David Weber, Timothy Zahn and Tom Pope, is the second in the ""Manticore Ascendant"" naval Science Fiction series which is set in the same Universe as the ""Honor Harrington"" books but nearly four centuries earlier. It follows on from A Call to Duty (Manticore Ascendant).NB This is the full-length version of the previously published novella with the same name. The original and shorter, novella length version of this story is included in the anthology ""Beginnings: Worlds of Honor Book 6 (Honor Harrington).""Although I had already read the previous novella version, I personally don't regret reading this book - in fact, I couldn't put it down - because it fleshes out the stories of both the central character, Travis Long, and a number of the supporting characters, and explains more about how the circumstances leading to the first battle of Manticore came about.Although even those who have not read the previous version know the Royal Manticoran Navy will defeat both the internal political opponents who want to close it down and the external bad guys who from the start of the book are planning an invasion - because the RMN is still around for Honor Harrington to serve in several centuries later - what you don't know is which of the supporting characters will survive so there is still plenty of tension. But if you have already read ""Worlds of Honor 6"" then it will fairly rapidly become obvious that you already know, at least from the main hero's perspective, on how the principal plotline will turn out. That may be a particular problem for those fans of David Weber who read him mainly for the space battles, although this book does give you more perspectives on the principal battle in the book from the viewpoint of characters other than Travis Long.The Honor Harrington Books are set about two thousand years in the future, this series begins in 3532 AD, or 1529 ""Post Diaspora"" in the Honorverse calendar. That puts this story in the same century as the trilogy featuring Honor Harrington's ancestor Stephanie, which begins with ""A Beautiful Friendship (Star Kingdom (Quality))"" and starts in 3521 AD/CE by our calendar. To date there has been no overlap between the two trilogies.The primary hero of the new series, Travis Long, was put onto the track for promotion to be an officer at the end of the first book: at the start of this one, about five years later, he is a Lieutenant (Junior Grade). Meanwhile his half brother is still allied to the idiotic politicians who are trying to shut down the navy in the mistaken belief that nobody is going to attack Manticore, and two of his old friends are about to go to the planet Casca on what had been expected to be a harmless ""showing the flag"" exercise but turns out to be a little more exciting than anyone expected ...This series fills in a lot of the backstory for the Honor Harrington Universe. At this time the Haven system has not yet become the ""People's Republic of Haven"" and they are still friends with Manticore. Gustav Anderman, the half-mad military genius who founded the Anderman Empire, has just begun his career of conquest. And although anyone who has read the ""Honor Harrington"" books knows that the Manticore system contains a wormhole junction of immense strategic and commercial value, at the time of the first two books in this series, that wormhole network has not yet been discovered and nobody on Manticore suspects it might be there. Which is why they don't realise they have anything which might make it worth anyone's while to invade them. But at the end of the book before this one, a scientist working for a very powerful, wealthy and greedy corporation called Axelrod had worked out that there might be one or more wormhole termini in the Manticore system ...I love the first two sentences on the dust jacket description of this book: ""Lieutenant Travis Long of the Royal Manticoran Navy is the sort of person who likes an orderly universe. One where people follow the rules. Unfortunately he lives in the real universe.""Most of us have met somebody of very high integrity and zero flexibility who is an absolute pain in the neck because they will not adjust to the real world. Most of us have also met people of equally high integrity and a bit more flexibility who are more likeable because they are open minded enough to make some attempt to allow for the needs and failings of other human beings, but who still attract trouble like a lightning rod because their constant attempts to do the right thing often cause more problems than they solve. Travis in the first two books of this trilogy is somewhere between those two positions. Consequently he has a bit of a gift for making enemies (this is not a spoiler as it is stated on the dust jacket.)This is not a good time to have such a gift because the story is set at a time when the human colony of Manticore, which is many light years from Earth in the back of beyond, has been at peace for a century and is facing arguments about whether it still needs a navy to defend itself. There are political factions which would dearly like to abolish the Royal Manticoran Navy, either to transfer its' resources to use on other priorities or to support their own power bases. They think that there are no threats against whom such a navy might be needed.Other people in Manticore think the last thing Manticore needs is politicians who think ""the Universe is a safe and cozy place,"" as one of them ironically put it in the previous book.Readers of other books in the series such as ""House of Steel (Honor Harrington)"" will know that those who think the Universe is dangerous are absolutely right. They also know that the men and women of the Royal Manticoran Navy will not just be needed, but will find out just how dangerous the Universe really is, far sooner than anyone thinks. Spacers like Travis Long who want to make sure that ships and weapons actually work properly may soon be in desperately short supply ...I enjoyed both the first two books in this trilogy. I think Zahn and Pope have brought some good ideas and storytelling ability to the Honorverse and am very much looking forward to reading the final book in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJ0GCFA6DYTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I89BRW#wasThisHelpful","REJ0GCFA6DYTB","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Soldiers out of Time"" is the fifth in a highly entertaining series of novels about time travel which so far consists of:1) ""Blood Of The Heroes""2) ""Sunset of the Gods""3) ""Pirates of the Timestream (Jason Thanou)""""4) ""Ghosts of Time (Jason Thanou)5) This book,""Soldiers Out of Time""I would recommend you read them in that order.The stories begin in - that is, as this is a time travel series, the ""linear present"" for the main characters, the time they come from, is -  the 24th century AD/CE. At that time mankind will, in the story, have colonised a number of nearby planets, discovered time travel and learned the hard way not to try to use it to change history. They found that if you try to cause a ""grandfather paradox"" e.g. change something you know happened, some ""accident"" and quite possibly a fatal one, stops you doing it.Up to the first book in the series time travel had only been used, under strict precautions, for approved historical research.Some time before the 24th century start point for the first book - probably around the 23rd century AD/CE - mankind had successfully overthrown a group known as the ""Transhuman"" movement who wanted to use genetic and cybernetic engineering to ""improve"" the human race but had both insufficient scruples about how to do it and questionable ideas about what kind of Master Race they were trying to create. If you are a science fiction fan, imagine a group with some of the worst ideas of the ""Augments"" and ""Borg"" from the Star Trek universe combined with the Mesan alignment from the Honor Harrington Universe created by Steve White's old partner and co-author David Weber.Or at least, it appeared until midway through the second book that mankind had successfully defeated the Transhumanists, in a revolution which had been messy and unpleasant the overthrow of the Transhumanist regime had been on both sides.In the first book the hero, Commander Jason Thanou (pronounced ""Thane-oh"" not ""Than-ooh"") of the Temporal Regulatory Agency, led what was intended as an academic study to 1628 BC to study the historical impact of the volcanic eruption which destroyed the island of Santorini in that year - described in the novel as the biggest natural disaster of which human history provides direct evidence. (Scientists have argued for decades over conflicting evidence about exactly when the Santorini eruption was and how powerful, but it was certainly one of the most powerful, and possibly the most powerful, in recorded history. Tree ring evidence from both sides of the Atlantic suggests there was a huge eruption somewhere in about 1628 BC, the Santorini eruption is probably the most likely candidate and is currently estimated to have been three or four times worse than Krakatoa's 1883 eruption). When Jason and his two academic companions arrived back in 1628 BC, they discovered that the classical legends of Gods and Heroes had far more truth in them than anyone had imagined.The Titan and Olympian pantheons of Greek and Roman legend were actually alien invaders: members of a space travelling species called the Teloi who had come to Earth many thousands of years before and used high technology to set themselves up as Gods. But although the Teloi had dominated Earth for millennia, history suggested that something was about to curtail their ability to play their sick games with humanity - and Jason thought he could see how to make sure this happened ...The second book ""Sunset of the Gods"" began, in linear time, shortly after Jason returned to his own time and recovered from injuries sustained during the mission to 1628 BC. The Temporal Regulatory Agency wanted to establish whether and over what periods of history the Teloi pose a remaining threat, so they sent Jason and a small team to carefully investigate the Battle of Marathon, 1138 years after his previous visit, which is the last event where there is any allegation in the historical record of any of the Greek Gods interfering in human affairs.When Jason and his team arrived in 490BC to observe the battle of Marathon they find that there was indeed still an alien presence - but they also find a new threat which is even more dangerous to all humanity throughout history than the Teloi ever were. The Transhumanists had discovered time travel - indeed they had better time travel equipment than the Temporal Regulatory Agency. And time-travelling Transhumanists, allied to the remaining Teloi, were trying to create a situation where they could return to power in the future.The danger was all the greater because it was insidious: the Transhumanists knew better than to try to directly change major events in recorded history but were plotting to subtly use them: planting agents and supporters in various periods of time where and when their actions could make possible a future Transhumanist coup.In the third book, Jason Thanou and another team are sent back to investigate whether the Transhumanist time-travellers are active in the Caribbean during the seventeenth century. The wreckage of a modern craft has been found after having apparently crashed in the 17th century.Pretty soon Jason and his team infiltrated the Brethren of the Coast under Captain Henry Morgan and sure enough, one of his most remarkable captains appeared to have some very interesting enemies. The most interesting and entertaining feature of the book is the depiction of Henry Morgan - a real life ""Pirate of the Caribbean"" whose adventures made those of ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" look almost ordinary by comparison ...The fourth book featured a trip back to the period of the American Civil war to try to frustrate very deep laid Transhumanist plans for a fresh coup in what, in the ""linear present"" 24th century time that Jason and his friends and colleagues come from, is the near future.This fifth book, ""Soldiers Out of Time"" is a very wide-ranging novel which also features a trip to the 19th century, painting a fascinating and sometimes very highly amusing picture of the extraordinary world of the North West frontier of the British Raj at the end of that century. It features a cameo for the young Winston Churchill, and a tribute to Kipling.But it starts with a visit to a star called Zirankhu, about fifty light years from Earth, which is home to one of the few non-human civilisations mankind has discovered and where there is evidence that the Transhumanists are up to something ...A number of other Sci-Fi authors have written similar novels including Simon Hawke's amusing ""Time Wars"" series which begins with ""The Ivanhoe Gambit: 1 (TIMEWARS),"" Fritz Leiber's book ""Changewar"" and Poul Anderson's ""Time Patrol"" stories such as ""Guardians of Time."" IMHO if you enjoyed those stories you are quite likely to enjoy the ""Jason Thanou"" novels and vice versa.Each of these authors brought different strengths to the genre: in my opinion what marks out this series is the way Steve White brings alive some fascinating periods of real history through the eyes of his modern time travellers and incorporates some of the most remarkable people and events into his stories.This story and the rest of the series is imaginative, entertaining, and clever. I can recommend ""Blood of the Heroes"" and all four sequels published as of September 2015.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3295Z5P4Z01XC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476780722#wasThisHelpful","R3295Z5P4Z01XC","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boris Vallejo has been publishing beautiful fantasy art calendars for several decades: I've bought one each year for the last twenty years (starting in 1995) and I believe he published several as far back as the eighties. Often there is a unifying theme or narrative to the collections in a calendar, sometimes with accompanying text from a master of written fantasy such as Philip Jose Farmer (1995) or C.J. Henderson (2002).For the past decade and a half these calendars have been joint productions between Boris and his present wife, Julie Bell. Indeed, they are often family productions: Julie's son Anthony Palombo is one of the authors of the story text linking the paintings in a previous calendar, and the last few calendars including this 2016 one have had protrait photgraphs on the back cover of artists Boris and Julie taken by Boris's daughter Maya Vallejo who is a professional photographer.This 2016 calendar contains thirteen exceptionally lovely images (one for each month and a double spread between June and July) with the following titles:January: ""The Firethorn"" (a beautiful woman with butterfly wings facing a dragon, sword in hand)February: ""Intertwined"" (a couple asleep)March: ""The Offering""April: ""Firestorm"" (A man and woman on a ship passing through dangerous waters)May (and cover): ""Escape""June: ""The Messenger"" (A centaur, a bear, and a tiny dragon)Centre spread: ""Discovery""July: ""The Transformation""August: ""Fighting back""September: ""Searching""October: ""On Dragon's Wings""Noveber: ""The Final Battle""December: ""Soaring Higher.""This year's pictures are in roughly equal proportions a tribute to the male and female human form, but often also include those of real or fantasy animals, or most often a mixture.Many of these illustrations display a wry humour. For example one of this year's pictures looks at first like it could have come straight out of a Tarzan illustration, until you realise that the otherwise perfect idealised human male form of the man in the picture has a monster's face. Is it a mask or is he - as the text hints may be the case - turning into a monster? And at the same time the gorilla towards whom the largely human form is swinging has an almost human expression on his face ...If you liked any of the previous Boris and Julie calendars, or if you like fantasy art in general, you will very probably like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCFDDOTNA2V01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761182012#wasThisHelpful","RCFDDOTNA2V01","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Joe Steele"" is the English language equivalent of ""Joseph Stalin.""This disturbing alternative history novel takes as its' starting point what might have happened if the family of Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili had emigrated to the US shortly before he was born, instead of staying in Georgia. (That's the Georgia which was then part of Russia.)In this novel, instead of changing his name to Josef Stalin and becoming General Secretary of the Communist Party in Russia, he changes it to the English equivalent and stands to be President of the United States.The story is seen from the viewpoint of two brothers, Charlie and Mike Sullivan, both journalists. One of the brothers tries to tell what he believes to be the truth about Joe Steele while the other tries to reach an accommodation with the Joe Steele juggernaut: each finds that both courses of action carry a very high price.I describe the book as disturbing because most of us would like to believe that a mature democracy such at the USA could not fall under the sway of a man like Stalin.

"The film ""Star Wreck"" is a low-budget parody of ""Star Trek"" in Finnish but with English subtitles available, put together by the painstaking work of a group of very dedicated fans.If you are both a keen Star Trek fan and have a certain type of sense of humour, you may find this very entertaining. If you don't have the right sense of humour, or if you watch it expecting the sort of production values in the official Star Trek TV shows or films or of higher budget parodies such as ""Galaxy Quest [DVD] [2000]"" you are likely to be fairly disappointed. (Actually, Galaxy Quest itself does not survive unspoofed here. Blink and you'll miss it, but one of the key catchphrases from that film is spoofed in this one.)The story begins as a starship's company from a future time have been stranded on 21st century Earth. The Star Trek characters they parody are a mix of ""Original Series"" and ""Next Generation"" characters: they are led by a ""Captain Pirk"" whose senior officers include an android called Commander ""Info"" and a weapons officer from an alien species with pronounced ridges on his forehead, inaptly named Commander ""Dwarf."" Obviously the latter characters are parodies of Data and Worf: one might assume from the name that ""Captain Pirk"" would be a mix of Picard and Kirk but he came over to me like a cross between Jim Kirk and Homer Simpson.A running joke throughout the film is to take the mickey out of Science Fiction terms which will be familiar to Star Trek fans by rendering them as near-synonyms of the original expressions but using instead word which do not have the same science fiction connotations.Hence photon torpedoes become ""light balls"" while ""Warp Drive"" becomes ""Twist Drive;""  ""Impulse Power"" becomes ""shove power"" while ""worm holes"" become ""maggot holes.""Pirk and his crew soon realise that history has accidentally been changed and unless they do something about it there will be no future Starfleet to defend the world against a future invasion from hostile aliens called the ""Korg"" who are due to attack in their own future time. So Pirk decides that they must bring their own navy into existence - and to do this he puts together a cunning plan to make himself Emperor ...Considering the sort of budget they had I thought the special effects in this film were surprisingly strong and one or two of the actors had great comic talent. Others did not. Some of the jokes were quite funny but personally I found certain of the other jokes to be at best  pedestrian and sometimes puerile.Three stars for an awful lot of hard work, a storyline which does manage to keep going and stagger to a conclusion, and a certain amount of entertainment value for hardcore Star Trek fans, particularly if you also watch a certain other TV science fiction show which I will not name to avoid a spoiler. There will be a target market segment who love this.

"""The Truth about love"" is a 19th century romance and detective story in the author's ""Bar Cynster"" series, and first introduces as a supporting character the gentleman detective Barnaby Adair who goes on to have a sub-series of his own. The hero is commissioned to paint a portrait of the heroine but soon finds that, with Barnaby Adair's help, his real task is to prove her innocent of two murders.There is a combined family tree and list of novels in the series at the front of most of the books, which lists this one as number 12 in the main Cynster series.If you add the prequel novel The Promise in a Kiss (Bar Cynster) which is set a generation before, this would be the thirteenth Cynster novel. However, if you list the whole lot in chronological order this would be number sixteen, because ""The Truth about love"" is set in 1831 and the three books of the ""Cynster Sisters trilogy"" which on the author's own list are numbers 16 to 18, are set in 1829, some two years before this one.The hero of this story is Gerrard Debbington, brother of Patience who was the heroine of the second Cynster novel, ""A Rake's Vow: Number 2 in series (Bar Cynster). An member of the aristocracy by birth he is an artist by choice, this being one of comparatively few occupations which gentlemen were permitted at the time, provided they wre not doing anything so vulgar as using it as the main means to actually earn a living.Gerrard's main interest is painting landscapes, but he has also painted a few portraits of family and friends, and these were sufficiently popular to make him very sought after as a portrait painter to the ""ton"" as high society was known.At the start of this book, Gerrard is approached by agents acting for Lord Tregonning who wants him to paint a portrait of his only child, his daughter Jacqueline. Ordinarily he would refuse a commission to paint someone other than a friend or family member, but in this case there is a very powerful lure - the opportunity to also paint the gardens, whose beauty is legendary, of Lord Tregonning's seat at Hellebore Hall near Falmouth.Fortunately the terms of the commission allow Garrard the opportunity to bring a friend, and even more fortunately, the friend he brings is an amateur detective, the Hon. Barnaby Adair. Because soon after they arrive in Cornwall it becomes apparent that something is seriously amiss at Hellebore Hall ...I liked the main characters in this book, the ongoing romantic tension building between them, and the fact that much of the story is told with a great deal of dry wit and humour which was more than a little amusing. The detective story is interesting and the mix of romance and thriller is well managed.There are, however, some glaring differences between the way characters in the novel behave and speak and the historical period in which the story is set.Well-brought up young ladies of the ton, as high society was called in the early nineteenth century, did not generally behave the way that many of those in this series and most of Stephanie Laurens' other recent books do. In particular they rarely abandoned their virginity before marriage as readily as these characters do, not least because an unmarried young lady of the early nineteenth century who enthusiastically jumped into the hero's bed would have no reliable means of avoiding pregnancy. If they did, and their fathers or brothers realised what was going on, the most likely outcomes would be a very hasty wedding or a duel.But overall I enjoyed this book, and most of those who gained pleasure from the author's other books will like this one.For reference, the Cynster series to date consists of1) Devil's Bride (Bar Cynster) (Devil and Honoria)2) A Rake's Vow: Cynster Family Series, Book 2 (Cynster Novels) (Vane and Patience, sister of the hero of this book)3) ""Scandal's Bride"" (Richard/Scandal and Catriona)4) ""A Rogue's proposal"" (Harry/Demon and Felicity)5) ""A Secret Love"" (Rupert/Gabriel and Alathea)6) ""All about Love"" (Alistair/Lucifer and Phyllida)7) ""All About Passion"" (Lord Chillingworth gets Rachel for Leah)8) ""On a wild night"" (Amanda Cynster and Martin)9) ""On a wicked dawn"" (Amelia Cynster and Luc)10) ""The Perfect Lover"" (Simon Cynster and Porchia)11) ""The Ideal Bride"" (Martin and Caro)12) This book, ""The Truth about love"" (Gerrard and Jacqueline)13) ""What price love?""

"""A Call to Duty"" is the first in the ""Manticore Ascendant"" naval SF series which is set in the same Universe as the ""Honor Harrington"" books but nearly four centuries earlier, The Honor Harrington Books are set about 2,000 years in the future, this series begins in 3532 AD/CE, or 1529 ""post Diaspora"" in the Honorverse calendar. That actually puts this story in the same century as the trilogy featuring Honor Harrington's ancestor Stephanie, which begins with ""A Beautiful Friendship (Star Kingdom (Quality))"" and starts in 3521 AD/CE by our calendar.""A call to duty"" only has two names on the cover but in fact is a collaboration between three authors - David Weber who originally created the Honor Harrington universe, Timothy Zahn whose substantial output includes some of the best ""Star Wars"" novels and ""The Cobra Trilogy (Baen Books Megabooks)"" and successors, and Thomas Pope. There is an author's note in which Weber and Zahn explain the contribution of Thomas Pope, who is one of the ""BuNine"" Honorverse fan club.The hero of the new series is Travis Long, who previously appeared in the novella ""A Call to Arms"" by Timothy Zahn, which appeared in the anthology ""Beginnings: Worlds of Honor Book 6 (Honor Harrington)."" That story is set later in his career: in this book Travis joins the Royal Manticoran Navy as a seventeen-year-old recruit.Most of us have met somebody of very high integrity and zero flexibility who is an absolute pain in the neck because they just will not adjust to the real world: most of us have also met people of equally high integrity and a bit more flexibility who are also more likeable because they are open minded enough to make some attempt to allow for the needs and failings of other human beings, but who still attract trouble like a lightning rod because their constant attempt to do the right thing often cause more problems than it solves.Travis in this story is somewhere between these two positions.The story is set at a time when the human colony of Manticore, which is many light years from Earth in the back of beyond, has been at peace for a century and is facing arguments about whether it still needs a navy to defend itself. There are political factions which would dearly like to abolish the Royal Manticoran Navy, either to transfer its' resources to use on other priorities or to support their own power bases. They think that there are no threats against whom such a navy might be needed.Other people in Manticore think the last thing Manticore needs is politicians who think ""the Universe is a safe and cozy place,"" as one of them ironically puts it. Readers of other books in the series such as ""House of Steel (Honor Harrington)"" will know that those who think the Universe is dangerous are absolutely right. They also know that the men and women of the Royal Manticoran Navy will not just be needed, but find out just how dangerous the Universe really is, far sooner than anyone thinks. Spacers like Travis Long who want to make sure that ships and weapons actually work properly may soon be desperately needed ...If you are planning to read both I would recommend tackling this book before ""A Call to Arms""I thought this was a well written and entertaining story. I think Zahn and Pope have brought some good ideas and storytelling ability to the Honorverse and am very much looking forward to reading the rest of this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FLK16W7VQP4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476736847#wasThisHelpful","R3FLK16W7VQP4S","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The wicked baron"" by Sarah Mallory is a reasonably well written novel which collects most of the cliches in the regency canon. There is the spirited heroine, who despite a secret which she fears could ruin her in the eyes of society is nevertheless prepared to defy society's rules. There are the heroine's overprotective noble female relatives.There is the darkly handsome but threatening hero, who has the reputation of being a rake but the reader knows is not as bad as he is panted, and who exercises a fascination for the herone even though they get on so badly that the reader knows they are bound to end up together. And there is the wicked villain, whose identity is not at first obvious, plotting kidnap, murder or ruin against the hero, heroine, or one of their friends or family.One aspect of this novel which is a little bit different from the general run of Regency Romances is the story elements about painting. The author explains in a foreword to the book that a few years before writing it she visited the former home of Sir Francis Dashwood, leading light of the Hellfire Club and inspiration for many rakish Regency heroes, and saw some magnificent frescoes and paintings there. This gave her the idea for a regency heroine who might have been involved in painting such artwork and became the inspiration for this book. There are some clever details about the world of 18th and 19th century paintings in this novel, which bear more than a passing resemblance to the practices of some real artists of the time.Carlotta, the heroine, is the grand-daughter of an earl and niece of the present holder of the title. But her mother ran away to marry an Italian artist. Carlotta's father is far too talented and successful to be exactly penniless, but he does have to work for a living and would not be regarded by High Society as a suitable match for the daughter of an earl.Nevertheless Carlotta's uncle, the present holder of the earldom, wants to heal the breach in the family which his sister's elopement and her being disinherited by his father had caused. So he offers to present his niece in society, suggesting that she adopts his family surname of Rivington and offering to settle on her  the marriage portion which should have been her mothers'.Unfortunately being launched into society brings Carlotta Rivington into the presence of a certain nobleman who has by chance discovered the ""secret"" of her identity - a man known to society as ""The Wicked Baron"" ...A mentioned this story is very forumulaic in places, and a little implausible in others, but it is well written, and quite amusing. The painting elements of the story, and the way they are integrated into the mystery element, raises it a bit above the general run of Mills & Boon regencies and justifies the fourth star. It isn't Georgette Heyer, let alone Jane Austen - what is? - but if you're looking for an entertaining light regency romance you may well enjoy this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210O7QOEX3A2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RI9UA4#wasThisHelpful","R210O7QOEX3A2H","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third part of a sailing navy series featuring Charles Hayden, As a book it rates four stars: the first two volumes in the series were excellent, and some parts of this book are up to the same standard but others were not and I found it rather a curate's egg. I also think that the publishers deserve to be keelhauled for republishing it in the USA under the title ""Take, Burn and Destroy"" without making it sufficiently clear that this is the same book previously published as ""A Ship of War.""The series to date consists of:1) Under Enemy Colours2) A Battle Won3) This book, which as mentioned has been published as ""A Ship of War"" and as ""Take, Burn or Destroy.""4) ""Until the Sea Shall Give Up Her Dead (Charles Hayden 4).""In the wake of the huge fleet of ""fighting sail"" novels, which brought to life such fictional sailors as Horatio Hornblower, Jack Aubrey, Richard Delancey, Nicholas Ramage, Richard Bolitho, Nathaniel Drinkwater, Thomas Kydd, William Rennie, and Kit Killigrew - not to mention the real historical officer Michael Fitton, whose remarkable career was novelised by Showell Styles - yet another hero of the age of fighting sail took to the quarterdeck in Sean Thomas Russell's first book, ""Under Enemy Colours.""In the sequel ""A Battle Won"" and at the start of this book, Mr Russell put his half-English, half-French hero Charles Hayden, who has now been promoted to the rank of Commander, back in charge of the frigate H.M.S. Themis. Frigates were usually commanded by an officer of the rank of Captain (Post captain in the nautical language of the time) but it was not unknown for an officer with the rank of Commander to be given a temporary appointment as commanding officer of a frigate in circumstances such as were described in the books.At the start of this volume the hero is given two missions which may well prove incompatible, but this is only the start of his problems. Hayden and the crew of HMS Themis have to deal with spies, a French squadron, the challenge of escaping from the French in terrible weather which creates a serious risk for British and French sailors alike of being driven ashore and wrecked, and the possibility of capture - which for the half-French Hayden might mean the danger of being sent to the guillotine either as a traitor to France or as a British spy.By the time this book concludes, our heroes have taken part in a major naval battle - the ""Glorious First of June"" - which occurs much as it did in real history, and Russell has fitted into the three books of this series just about everything which could happen to sailors in the 18th century navy, from battles at sea to battles on land in support of the army, from espionage on enemy soil to exchange of prisoners, from court-martials to cutting-out expeditions, from mutiny to murder, and from storm to shipwreck.Meanwhile on land Henrietta, the lady whom Hayden had hoped to marry but who had been given reason to think (wrongly) that he has betrayed her, is being courted by a rival suitor. Large chunks of this book comprise a sub-plot about whether Henrietta will marry Charles or his rival.Following in the footsteps of writers of the calibre of C.S. Forester, Patrick O'Brien, Dudley Pope and C. Northcote Parkinson is challenging. To make a new naval hero stand out from the mass of ""fighting sail"" books as Sean Thomas Russell did with the first two books in this series, was no mean feat.Like some of the best works of Forester, Pope, and O'Brien, the second book in this series, ""A battle won,"" was not so much fiction as novelised history in which the characters the author created were seamlessly inserted into a dramatised account of real historical events.The same applies to the best part of this book, the depiction of the ""Glorious First of June"" from Charles Hayden's perspective, which vividly recreates what the battle must have appeared like from the viewpoint of those who took part in it. Some of the other scenes at sea also skillfully blended drama and history.For example, a passage involving Sir Edward Pellew's real historical command HMS ""Indefatigable"" (on which, of course, C.S. Forester's hero Mr Midshipman Hornblower also served early in his career), explained with historical accuracy, and with considerably more period detail than Forester gave, that the Indefatigable was a ""razee"" e.g. a former battleship with her original upper deck cut away to make a particularly powerful frigate. Russell describes clearly and elegantly what advantages that gave her.Those were the good parts of this book, and for me it was worth reading for them. But unfortunately large chunks of the rest of this book did not work as well for me as the first two.For example, though I cannot describe in full my concerns about an extended sea chase in the English Channel which appeared to have been inspired by a similar chase in C.S. Forester's novel Hornblower and the Hotspur for fear of giving too much of the story away, I had difficulty with the credibility of the situation described.It isn't impossible that storm conditions in the English Channel could include the wind blowing for a lengthy period in the direction and force required to create the navigational problems which HMS Themis faces in this book. However, it would be rare. The prevailing wind in the English Channel blows from the West or South-West: the situation faced by Hayden in this book would require a northerly wind to blow constantly for several days. If the weather conditions described in this book did occur, opposing forces would not be in a good position to chase or fire at one another as they'd have quite enough of a challenge avoiding being wrecked or capsizing, and because opening the gunports or firing broadsides would be dangerous and difficult.Another problem I have with this book is a large amount of misleading commentary about 64-gun ships of the line. One of the warships described in this book is of this type, which in the 1790s was the smallest class of ship considered able to take her place in the line of battle. There were three classes or ""rate"" of ship of the line at this time.""First rates"" had three gun decks and mounted a hundred or more heavy cannon: they usually served as fleet flagships. ""Second rate"" ships also had three decks of guns but were slightly smaller than first rates and usually had ninety to 98 cannons. ""Third rates"" which formed most of the line of battle in all navies had two decks of guns and mounted a minimum of 64 cannon. By the 1790s the major navies were using 74-gun third rates to form the majority of their line of battle, but there were still a significant minority of 64 gun ships in service, including Nelson's first battleship command, HMS Agamemnon.Obviously, 64-gun ships were slightly less powerful than 74-gun ships, and significantly less powerful than first and second rates with three decks of guns, though they made up for this to some extent by being significantly faster and more nimble.The narrative of this book repeatedly states that the characters regard 64-gun ships as greatly inferior in battle to other ships of the line, to a far greater degree than their historical deployment by Royal Navy captains and admirals suggests was believed by those officers at the time.For example, Russell has both Hayden and Admiral Lord Howe, the British Commander in Chief at the ""Glorious First of June,"" act as though a Royal Navy 64-gun ship could not face a French 74-gun ship on equal terms. If Royal Navy commanders had really been that cautious, the Napoleonic wars would probably have had a very different outcome! Russell also puts into the mouths or thoughts of his characters in more than one passage of this book the suggestion that a single broadside from a 100+ gun first rate could knock a 64-gun ship out of a battle.While it was not entirely unknown for one particularly effective broadside to cripple an enemy ship, this was unusual. It usually took quite a few broadsides to knock out any ship of the line, including the smaller ones.In reality, Royal Navy 64-gun ships not only took their place in the line of battle during the Napoleonic wars, but often acquitted themselves well against much larger enemy vessels. For example, at the battle of Trafalgar, the 64 gun HMS Agamemnon of which Nelson had once been captain, not only exchanged broadsides with the largest warship in the world at that time, the Spanish four-decker Santimissa Trinidad, but brought down some of the giant Spanish battleship's masts and thus played a major role in her capture.Moving on from the sea battles, I also felt that the actions of some of the characters in this book did not seem plausible. In particular, the extended scenes with Henrietta and her family and suitors, which seemed to have been lifted from a poor quality Regency Romance, didn't work for me. Mr Russell seems to be better at channelling C.S. Forester than he is at channelling Jane Austen!I really enjoyed both the first two books in this trilogy and can recommend them: overall I don't regret reading ""A ship of war"" because it continued the story and it had certain passages which were excellent. At the time of updating this review I am about to read the fourth book in the series: I hope Mr Russell's future books are closer to ""A Battle Won"" in quality than to this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GSZJVQFDTPF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425268535#wasThisHelpful","R1GSZJVQFDTPF9","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boris Vallejo has been publishing beautiful fantasy art calendars for several decades. You can judge the popularity of this 1995 issue, and the series to which it belongs, from the fact that he has produced one every year since and for some years before, latterly jointly with his wife Julie Bell, and they have now sold over 2.6 million copies. I think this was the first one I bought - certainly it is the oldest I now have - and I have bought one of these calendars each year for the invervening twenty years.There is often a unifying theme or narrative to the collections in a Boris Vallejo calendar, sometimes with accompanying text from a master of written fantasy, and in the case of this 1995 calendar the text was provided by Philip Jose Farmer, author of the ""World of Tiers"" and ""RIverworld"" series.This 1995 wall calendar contains thirteen exceptionally lovely images (one for each month and a double spread between June and July) with the following titles:January: ""Acceptance"" (a beautiful woman riding three dangerous monsters, Sadness, Anger, and Despair)February: ""Islet, Eyelet""March: ""The greatest weapon: Experience""April and front cover (above left): ""The Hieroglyphic Egg of Life""May: ""The Sleeper""June: ""Dinosaurs love the unseeing""Centre spread: ""The Dancer"" (repeated and with explanatory text by Philip Jose farmer on back cover)July: ""Why Time is a Dream""August: ""The Flowering Nest""September: ""The End of the Restless Sleep""October: ""That Which Must Be Done""November: ""The Upward Spiral of Evolution""December: ""The Wings that Cut.""Most of the pictures are a tribute to the female human form, to those of real or fantasy animals, or most often a mixture.Some of these illustrations display wry humour. For example the painting ""Dinosaurs Love the Unseeing"" shows a beautiful woman in a bikini sleepwalking among hungry, but apparently astonished, dinosaurs.""If you liked any of the other Boris Vallejo, or Boris & Julie calendars, or if you like fantasy art in general, you will very probably like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NU269141F2Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1563055694#wasThisHelpful","R2NU269141F2Y2","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the sixth book in a series which speculates about what might have happened if World War II had started in 1938 after a different outcome to the Munich peace talks. Like the previous books in the series this is very much a ""marmite"" book which some people will like and others hate.The books in the series to date and planned are:1) ""Hitler's War""2) ""West and East (War That Came Early)""3) ""The Big Switch: The War That Came Early""4) ""Coup D'Etat (War That Came Early (Del Rey Paperback))""5) ""Two Fronts (The War That Came Early, Book Five)""6) This book, ""Last Orders: The War That Came Early.""This book reads like the conclusion to this particular group of novels in that it reaches a possible finishing point for most, though not quite all, of the plotlines affecting the viewpoint characters. It also gives a pretty clear idea of how the world of this group of novels would be left at the end of a series of wars between 1938 and 1944 which were similar in many ways to the historical World War II but quite different in others.After apparently completing a series of books, Harry Turtledove has frequently come back and written a further book or series about what happened next. I assume from the fact that there is a gigantic loose end at the close of this book, and a surprise twist in the last few pages, that he is leaving open the option of a ""what happened next"" story here too.""The War that came early"" is yet another alternative version of World War II from Harry Turtledove. It is quite astonishing that he can still find new perspectives from which to write about that war, but he does.Nothing in this review is a spoiler for ""Last Orders"" but it is difficult to describe this sixth and apparently final book in the series without major spoilers for the third, fourth and fifth books in the middle. I shall try to avoid completely giving away the major plotlines for ""The Big Switch"" and ""Coup D'Etat"" here but if you have not read the third and fourth books, might wish to do so and you don't want to know what happens in them, I recommend that you don't read further here or any other reviews or descriptions of the fourth and subsequent books. There is also a minor spoiler for the fifth book a few paragraphs down.In the opening of the first book Turtledove made two changes in real history, and the first two volumes in the series work from there. First, in 1936 General Jose Sanjuro wasn't killed in a plane crash and consequently Sanjuro rather than Franco becomes leader of the Nationalist side in the Spanish civil war. Secondly, during the Munich negotiations, Henlein (leader of the Sudeten Germans) was assassinated, giving Hitler an excuse to press for even more punitive terms against Czechoslovakia.In this history Chamberlain and Daladier finally recognised that Hitler was determined on war, and suspected that he had actually ordered Henlein's murder himself. They found the spine to tell Hitler that if he invaded Czechoslovakia Britain and France would honour their obligations to the Czechs. Hitler did order the invasion of Czechoslovakia on the spot, and the war started a year earlier than in real history.There was (and is) a commonly held view, at the time of Munich and subsequently, that the democracies were not ready for war in 1938 while Germany was. Many years ago my late father summarised this view in seven words when I asked him why Chamberlain failed to stand up to Hitler at Munich: he answered ""We would have lost the war then."" My dad was ten at the time of Munich and his view reflected that of his elders, but he was faithfully repeating a very common view among my grandfather's generation.This series is entertainment rather than a serious academic study, but the first two books tried to address the question of whether that view is right, by projecting through what might have happened, taking account of the fact that the lineup of countries on each side would not have been identical, of the state of preparedness of various nations, and of the military and naval kit which would have been available to the combatants in a war which began in 1938.Both Britain and Germany would have been forced to make more use of armoured vehicles armed only with machine guns (Bren carriers and the Panzer I), or very light tanks such as the Panzer II: biplane fighters and bombers would have been used much more by all sides.In real history, German war plans in 1938 for war against France were based on a slightly updated version of the Schlieffen plan which had been tried and failed in 1914. However, at the start of the war a copy of those plans fell into British hands. Knowing this, the Germans changed their strategy to the ""Manstein Plan"" for a punch through the Ardennes, a strategy which succeeded brilliantly and knocked France out of the war in 1940. In ""Hitler's war"" the Schlieffen plan is tried again with pretty much the results which most military historians think would have resulted if the Germans had been daft enough to stick with it.By the start of the third book the Germans had clearly failed to secure the rapid victory against France which they actually achieved in 1940, and are slowly and painfully being driven back, though their armies are well inside French territory: in the East the Germans and Poles are gradually driving the Russians back.At this point Turtledove posits a further ""What if"" change in events from the real World War II - what if there were a change around in the pattern of alliances? Hence the title of the third book.Now if asked whether such an event would have been remotely likely I'd say definately not. Particularly in the timeline proposed in this series, because some of the same people who showed more spine in the first book ""Hitler's War"" than they did in reality, and were actually more willing to stand up to the evils of Nazism in 1938, diverge from historical events in precisely the opposite direction in the third book. Furthermore, some of the events in real history which reinforced Western hatred of Soviet communism and nearly did lead to British and Soviet troops fighting one another - such as Stalin's invasion of Finland - were in this timeline forestalled by the earlier start to the war against Germany.Having said that, there was an element within Britain and France, small minority though they were, who hated communism more than nazism and argued for a course of action similar to the way in which the third book diverges from real history. Which makes it a legitimate ""what if"" to ask provided you don't pretend it is a likely one.Turtledove went out of his way to recognise that there would also have been many people in Britain and France who strongly opposed any rapprochement with Hitler, and indeed, by the start of the fifth book, the pattern of alliances had switched back to something similar to that in real history.Two final major differences between this series and real history is that in the latter Pearl Harbour came at a moment when Hitler thought he was winning the war and was overconfident enough to declare war on the United States. I'm not going to give the details, let's just say that in this history the timing is rather different. And finally, the Manhattan project was canned in a previous book, so the reader who has read up to the start of this one knows that however the war ends, it's not going to be terminated by a US nuclear attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki or anywhere else.If there are any exact dates given in the fifth or sixth book I didn't spot them, but ""Two Fronts"" included a US mid-term election which has to be that of 1942, and in this book there are references to the series of wars which Hitler began in 1938 having dragged on for nearly six years, so the year must be 1944.Different aspects of the harm done by various regimes in this history, particularly Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Imperial Japan, are sometimes even worse, sometimes slightly less so than in real history. In particular, although Hitler's regime in the books is absolutely abominable to Jewish people throughout the area it controls, the Nazis do not appear to have made any attempt to implement complete genocide in the way that the ""Final Solution"" was attempted in real history.This is presumably because, in one of the greatest ironies of the series, Poland has remained allied to Hitler in all six books since he came to their aid against a Soviet attack. About half the Jews who were murdered in the real Holocaust were citizens of Poland. In this story the Nazis are not in a position to take millions of citizens of one of their few important allies to death camps and kill them, so the idea of wiping out the entire Jewish population of Europe is not just mad and evil but so obviously impossible that even Hitler and Himmler do not attempt it.In most respects other than this, however, the war is developing in a way which is as brutal and destructive as the real one if not even more so: The Germans cause havoc everywhere they go, the RAF knocks hell out of German cities, and the Japanese army, who in real history were outclassed in barbarism and murder only by the Holocaust, manage to do even more damage than they did in real history including a campaign of bacteriologial warfare.As usual for a Harry Turtledove book, the war is seen through the eyes of a large number of fictional viewpoint characters, one or more from each of the countries involved. These include an American woman caught in Prague by the outbreak of war who finally got home in the third book, a Jewish family in Munster, a German panzer wireless operator, infantryman, stuka pilot, and U-Boat skipper, French, British and Japanese infantrymen, a Czech corporal who found himself fighting in the Spanish civil war when the free Czech forces in France were allowed to escape there when France changed sides, two Russian Air Force pilots one of whom is now leading troops on the ground, and an American Marine.The brother of the Jewish girl viewpoint character is hiding from the Nazis by having enlisted in the Wehrmacht under a false name. Turtledove kept us guessing for a while about this, but it was clear by book five that he is the driver of the Panzer in which a Wehrmacht viewpoint character is radio operator. In most of the books including this one major historical figures like Hitler, Hess, Churchill  Roosevelt and Donitz appear very occasionally as they impact on the lives of the viewpoint characters or vice versa. But for most of the books the story is told from the viewpoint of ordinary people and their main interaction with major historical figures is when they experience the results of what those people have done, or when they hear them on the radio.Turtledove's homework on the tactical capabilities of equipment available to the armed forces of all sides between 1938 and 1944 is mostly pretty good. Having previously depicted the problems the germans had in dealing with soviet tank designs, such as the T34 and KV1, which reflected the problems those machines actually caused the Germans during the first year of Operation Barbarossa, Turtledove depicts in the fifth book how Germany hit back with machines like the later Panzer IV variants and the Tiger. In this one the Allied and Russian characters are working out how to deal with the Tiger and not enjoying it any more than they did in real life, thought they have a few nasty surprises of their own for the Germans.Wanting to see what will happen to the viewpoint characters is one of the things which holds my interest in this series: killing the occasional viewpoint character is one of the ways Turtledove brings home the cost of war, especially how an action which is the work of seconds and then forgotten for one person can be a complete change or the end of everything for another. There was a particularly poignant example in the fourth book when Turtledove described in a couple of sentences how one viewpoint character, noting someone doing an effective job for the other side, quickly and effectively gunned him down as one might swat an insect. At the start of the next paragraph Turtledove introduced a character by his full name who had previously been described only by his ranks and surname. The individual concerned had been the comrade and boss of a previous viewpoint character throughout the four books up to this point, but that viewpoint character turns out to have been the man who the soldier on the other side shot and killed in the previous paragraph.There is a similar instances in both ""Two Fronts"" and ""Last Orders.""This is the fifth alternative version of World War II which Turtledove has written. He has previously done a series with aliens from Tau Ceti invading in 1942 (the ""Worldwar"" series which starts with Worldwar: In the Balance (New English library)). He's also done a parallel history following pretty much the real track, in a world where technology uses magic rather than engineering (known variously as the Darkness, Derlavi, or 'World at War' series) which starts with Into the Darkness. There is an alternative World War II in his massive ten volume history of a Confederate States of America which survives for nearly a century following a Rebel victory in the US Civil War, and in which the same roles as in the historical WWII are carried out by different people - this is the ""Settling Accounts"" quartet. Finally there is a pair of novels, ""Days of Infamy"" and ""End of the Beginning"" which explore the possibility that Japan might have followed up the Pearl Harbour attack with an invasion of Hawaii.Turtledove has a few annoying weaknesses, particularly his bad habit of repeating the same information time after time, and there is some of that in this series, such as instances of him repeatedly introducing characters and reminding the reader who they are with details about their past history which anyone with an attention span longer than a gnat's will already remember. To be fair, there was not nearly as much of that in ""Last Orders"" as in some of the preceding books. Overall the writing and characterisation in this series is good.Overall I have enjoyed enjoyed reading all six books in this series and I think many Turtledove fans will likewise enjoy them, though there will undoubtedly be some who do not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EU87ZY6JG0M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXYKYZW#wasThisHelpful","R3EU87ZY6JG0M3","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ghosts of TIme"" is the fourth in a highly entertaining series of novels about time travel which so far consists of:1) ""Blood Of The Heroes""2) ""Sunset of the Gods""3) ""Pirates of the Timestream (Jason Thanou)""4) This book, ""Ghosts of Time""I strongly recommend you read them in that order.The stories begin in the 24th century AD/CE, which is the time the main fictional characters come from and known to them as the ""Linear Present."" At that time mankind will, in the story, have colonised a number of nearby planets, discovered time travel and learned the hard way not to try to use it to change history.Other time-travel writers, particularly those who like this one have been writing about people who are trying to stop the bad guys changing the past, have used the expression ""grandfather paradox"" to describe the situation where someone tries to change something they know happened by, for example, killing your grandfather so you won't be born. In this series it has been found the hard way that if you try to do anything like that, some ""accident,"" quite possibly a fatal one, stops you doing it. They call this the ""Observer Effect.""Up to the first book in the series time travel had only been used, under strict precautions, for approved historical research.About a century prior to the 24th century start point for the first book - probably around the 23rd century AD/CE - mankind had  overthrown a tyrannical regime known as the ""Transhuman Dispensation"" with a great deal of bloodshed on both sides. The Transhumanists wanted to use genetic and cybernetic engineering to ""improve"" the human race but had both insufficient scruples about how to do it and questionable ideas about what kind of Master Race they were trying to create. If you are a science fiction fan, imagine a group with some of the worst ideas of the ""Augments"" and ""Borg"" from the Star Trek universe combined with the Mesan alignment from the Honor Harrington Universe created by Steve White's old partner and co-author David Weber.But although the Transhumanists appeared to have been defeated, it later tranpired that some of their agents had survived and were now working to plant various traps and conspiracies in various corners of history which will make it possibe for them to return to power in the future.In the first book the hero, Commander Jason Thanou (pronounced ""Thane-oh"" not ""Than-ooh"") of the Temporal Regulatory Agency, led what was intended as an academic study to 1628 BC to study the historical impact of the volcanic eruption which destroyed the island of Santorini in that year - the biggest natural disaster of which human history provides direct evidence (it is thought to have released three times as much energy as Krakatoa's 1883 eruption). When Jason and his two academic companions arrived back in 1628 BC, they discovered that the classical legends of Gods and Heroes had far more truth in them than anyone had imagined.The Titan and Olympian pantheons of Greek and Roman legend were actually alien invaders: members of a space travelling species called the Teloi who had come to Earth many thousands of years before and used high technology to set themselves up as Gods. But although the Teloi had dominated Earth for millennia, history suggested that something was about to curtail their ability to play their sick games with humanity - and Jason thought he could see how to make sure this happened ...The second book ""Sunset of the Gods"" began, in linear time, shortly after Jason returned to his own time and recovered from injuries sustained during the mission to 1628 BC. The Temporal Regulatory Agency wanted to establish whether and over what periods of history the Teloi pose a remaining threat, so they sent Jason and a small team to carefully investigate the Battle of Marathon, 1138 years after his previous visit, which is the last event where there is any allegation in the historical record of any of the Greek Gods interfering in human affairs.When Jason and his team arrived in 490BC to observe the battle of Marathon they find that there was indeed still an alien presence - and the threat they found this time is far more dangerous to all humanity throughout history than the Teloi ever were. The Transhumanists had discovered time travel - indeed they had better time travel equipment than the Temporal Regulatory Agency. And time-travelling Transumanists, allied to the remaining Teloi, were trying to create a situation where they could return to power in the future.The danger was all the greater because it was insidious: the Transhumanists knew better than to try to directly change major events in recorded history but were plotting to subtly use them: planting agents and supporters in various periods of time where and when their actions could make possible a future Transhumanist coup.In the third book, Jason Thanou and another team are sent back to investigate whether the Transhumanist time-travellers are active in the Caribbean during the seventeenth century. Jason and his team have infiltrated the Brethren of the Coast under Captain Henry Morgan and one of his captains, Zenobia, turned out to be a disillusioned former Transhumanist who was now working against her old side. They also found that the Teloi are not entirely extinct. Another Teloi faction, a military caste who regard those of their race who themselves set up as ""Gods"" on Earth in classical times as soggy liberals, are still flying battlestations round the galaxy.In this book Jason and his team have to go back to the closing days of the American Civil War to destroy a Transhumanist cache of delayed action nano-weapons which have been planted in that era but are intended to go off with devastating consequences hundreds of years later. Of course things do no go smoothly and a number of side trips are called for ...The word ""Ghosts"" in the title refers particularly to the ""Gray Ghost"" as Union soldiers called Colonel Mosby, commander of the Condeferate's  Partisan Rangers. Colonel Mosby is one of a number of very remarkable historical characters, on both sides of the war, represented in this book much as they lived in history.A number of other Sci-Fi authors have written similar novels including Simon Hawke's amusing ""Time Wars"" series which begins with ""The Ivanhoe Gambit: 1 (TIMEWARS),"" Fritz Leiber's book ""Changewar"" and Poul Anderson's ""Time Patrol"" stories such as ""Guardians of Time."" IMHO if you enjoyed those stories you are quite likely to enjoy the ""Jason Thanou"" novels and vice versa.Each of these authors brought different strengths to the genre: in my opinion what marks out this series is the way Steve White brings alive some fascinating periods of real history through the eyes of his modern time travellers and incorporates some of the most remarkable people and events into his stories.This story and the rest of the series is imaginative, entertaining, and clever. I can recommend ""Blood of the Heroes"" and all the sequels published to date including this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32LL8BQY1HVSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L17ZE8Y#wasThisHelpful","R32LL8BQY1HVSE","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""No Place for an Angel"" by Gail Whitiker is the third in a set of three books with similar titles by the same author and about the early 19th century stage.The three books which the author calls her ""Gryphon Theatre"" trilogy are1) ""No Occupation for a Lady (Mills & Boon Historical)""2) ""No Role for a Gentleman (Mills & Boon Historical),"" and3) This book, ""No Place for an Angel.""The first two books listed above are quite closely linked, and tell the stories respectively of a lady who wrote plays and then the subsequent impact on her brother's life of the measures he took to protect her.However, this book, about the story of an opera singer, an aristocrat, and the conflict between their personal desires and the needs of their children, is rather darker in tone. It does not feature in a significant way any of the main characters of ""No occupation for a Lady"" or ""No Role for a Gentleman"" although the heroine and hero of this book, the singer Catherine Jones and Lord Valbourg, eldest son of a Marquis, were briefly introduced in the first book, as was the Gryphon Theatre on whose stage the heroine of this book made her name.The title of the first book could be read in two ways, and the less obvious and more restrictive is a better description of the attitude of high society in Georgian times. It would not just have been a problem with the idea of a lady having a job which was anything to do with the theatre - though that was certainly the case - as with her having a job at all. Not so much that treading the boards or any other job connected with the theatre was ""no occupation for a lady"" as that there WAS no occupation for a lady. Which is why even the mighty Jane Austen had to publish her works at first under a male psuedonym.In regency times, while both high and low society loved the theatre and opera, careers in it were not particularly respectable - although it might be possible to be received in society or to be engaged to perform at high society soirees or house parties if, like some of the characters in these three books, you either owned the theatre or were currently wildly popular, especially if you were also rich.The heroine of this book, Catherine Jones, has an exceptionally beautiful voice and has been nicknamed the ""Angel of London."" Despite being besieged with offers from rich and powerful men to act as her ""protector"" (eg who want her to be their mistress) she refuses to accept any of them. To live with a man outside wedlock might jeopardise her hopes of regaining the most precious and important thing in her life - custody of her young son.Lord Valbourg had a dissolute past until the tragic day in 1826, two years before the start of this book, when his younger sister and her husband died suddenly, leaving him guardian of their son Sebastian, who is now six at the start of this book. For Valbourg too, the child he cares for has become the most important thing in his life, and living only for pleasure as he had in the past, which might enable his other sister to claim custody of the boy, has become unthinkable.Then chance throws the reformed aristocratic rake and the ""Angel of London"" into contact and both begin to experience a forbidden passion for each other - a passion which neither of them dares to do anything about for fear of losing the most precious thing in their lives - their childrenThus begins another entertaining regency romance story ...Very entertaining, the characters were enjoyable to read about although in places the language and some of the attitudes were more 20th or 21st century than regency. Worth a read if you enjoy Regency romances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PG45OJPAEAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0A52TK#wasThisHelpful","R3PG45OJPAEAV","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Escape Plan"" is an amusing, exciting modern fantasy about an escape from the most impregnable prison ever constructed, starring the two great rival all-action stars Arnold Schwartzenegger and Silvester ""Sly"" Stallone.If you stop to think about whether any of it actually makes sense you will be in trouble, but the action and plot carries you along so convincingly that it's quite easy to suspend disbelief. Both the main stars have sometimes been accused of wooden performances, partly because both have an impassive style, but I felt that each of them showed in this film that they have become better actors over time, and both were superb in this. No film pleases everyone but I think this was one of the best performances each of the main leads has ever given, and most people who liked the films either has made before will like this.Several of the supporting stars, particularly Sam Neill as the prison doctor, Jim Caviezel as the sinister warden, Hobbes, and Vinnie Jones as a hard man guard, also gave strong performances.Sly Stallone plays Ray Breslin, an expert on discovering and fixing flaws in maximum security prisons. After demonstrating the weaknesses in yet another state penitentiary, he is approached by the CIA who want him to check if there are any flaws in the place they keep their most dangerous prisoners. I don't want to say too much more about the plot to avoid spoilers, but Breslin and a character called Rottmayer played by Arnold Schwartzenegger have to team up to escape from the most secure prison ever created ...Lots of suspense, lots of plot twists some of which most viewers will seecoming a mile off and some which most people won't. Plenty of gallows humour and a few characters face moral dilemmas. Although there is a lot of action and some aspects of the plot don't make much sense, this is a more intelligent film than is common for the genre as Sly and Arnie have to use their wits as well as muscles to defeat the undefeatable barriers put in their way.OK, obviously it's not ""Citizen Kane"" nor does it try to be, but this film is entertaining and exciting nonsense rather than just nonsense. If you like action films and generally enjoyed Arnie and Sly's previous output you will probably enjoy this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV4E9RQ9XNTRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H1RMOI6#wasThisHelpful","RV4E9RQ9XNTRB","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Marriage Game"" by Tudor historian Alison Weir is a clever and entertaining romance about the love life of Queen Elizabeth the First of England.If you have read more than a few romances you will almost certainly have encountered some in which an infuriating heroine who cannot make up her mind leads the hero and often a host of other suitors a merry and highly frustrating dance. Both in real history and in this book, ""Good Queen Bess"" absolutely was that girl. Because the book makes the characters real enough that you identify with them, the reader often empathises with the feelings of frustration this must have inspired in both Queen ELizabeth's suiters in general, and Robert Dudley (later Earl of Leicester) in particular, and with Cecil and her other ministers. But there were good reasons why the queen acted as she did, and this book helps you get inside her thoughts enough to understand what it must have felt like from her perspective.When she came to the throne Queen Elizabeth already had good reason to be fearful and cautious about the dangers of love. She had been two years old when her father had her mother beheaded. A year after that the Queen for whom Henry VII disposed of Elizabeth's mother, Jane Seymour, died in childbed. When she was fourteen her last stepmother, Catherine Parr, also died in childbed. And shortly after that her stepfather Thomas Seymour who had married Henry VIII's widow Catherine Parr, was beheaded for High Treason on a number of grounds, one of which was that he behaved with improper familiarity towards Princess Elizabeth. This may have been part of a treasonous plot to marry her and gain the throne. Whether or not that was the case, the Regency council headed by Seymour's own brother were sufficiently convinced of it to have him executed.Having seen so many of those who were close to her die in such circumstances, Elizabeth had every reason to know that love could be dangerous. So she was determined to let no man be her master and never lose control of her feelings. However, the possibliity of marrying her was one of the strongest cards in her diplomatic hand, and she used it ruthlessly and repeatedly, dangling the prospect of marriage in front of all the eligible batchelors and many of the widowers in her court, and almost every unmarried prince in Europe. In an age of powerful dynastic rulers, the prospect of a matrimonial alliance was deployed time and time again as a carrot for heads of state whose friendship England needed.This alternated with Elizabeth describing herself as a virgin queen who was married to her country and would never take a husband.Had this been a work of pure fiction nobody could take seriously the elaborate game which Elizabeth played with all her suitors, domestic and on the foriegn stage, as described in this book. However, much of ""The marriage game"" is novelised fact, though it retreats into speculation about what the true relationship had been between the teenage princess and Thomas Seymour, and about what really happened between Elizabeth and her favourite Robert Dudley, later Earl of Leicester.A glittering and fascinating novel of a glitttering and dangerous era.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DI2H64WN0CKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IN87YLE#wasThisHelpful","R2DI2H64WN0CKK","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This excellent collection of essays by the author of ""The Law"" (Work expands to fill the time available for it's completion) were all topical in 1972 when the book came out but most of them have aged very well.I'm posting this review in July 2014, having been inspired to find and read the copy of this book which my father bought forty years ago by an article in this week's issue of the UK current affairs magazine ""The Spectator"" (""Killing Jokes"" by Melissa Kite) about how political correctness and our eagerness to take offence is making humour almost impossible. I thought to myself ""Didn't Parkinson write a comprehensive assessment of this problem many years ago"" and sure enough he did - in the chapter on humour in this book, written before the phrase ""political correctness"" had even been coined but in which he predicted exactly the sort of problem which Melissa Kite's article was discussing.The essays in this book, mostly written in a humorous manner but making serious points, cover an astonishingly wide range of issues and all except one are as apposite in 2014 as they were in 1972. All are very accessible and easy to read - I wasn't even in my teens when I first read this but I enjoyed it and understood enough to recall the book forty years later.The title essay is a thoughtful critique of some of the long-term problems which might accompany the creation of a welfare state. Whether or not you agree with the present government's programme of welfare reform, I think most people who read this book would recognise some of the thoughts in that essay as predicting some of the issues which ministers from Frank Field to IDS in successive British governments have tried to address.Other issues discussed include ""Revolting Youth"" about student rebellion, a very thought-provoking analysis on genius (""A genius stands on the shoulders of other men"")  and, in one of the few essays which has dated a bit unless you remember Laurence J Peter's book ""The Peter Principle"" Parkinson takes issue with the idea that ""In a hierarchy every employee will tend to rise to his level of incompetence.""I can strongly recommend this little gem, as I can almost everythin else that Parkinson wrote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDG6IDJ1XMPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0900537051#wasThisHelpful","R2GDG6IDJ1XMPS","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Cauldron of Ghosts"" is the nineteenth full length novel in the ""Honorverse"" group of novels set some 2,000 years in the future. It is the third novel, after ""Crown of Slaves (Honorverse)"" and ""Torch of Freedom"" in a sub-series about how two super-spies from star nations which were originally at war fought to help free ""genetic slaves"" and the ""seccie"" descendants of slaves from the tyranny of the government of the planet Mesa and the corrupt companies which run the planet.The particular enemy in this sub-series, though in all the ""Honorverse"" books set later it becomes clear that they are the ultimate bad guys, is a company called ""Manpower"" which is a front for a vast conspiracy known to its inner core as the ""Mesan Alignment."" Everyone assumes that Manpower is simply a rich and corrupt company out to make money by genetically crafting people who can be sold as perfect slaves. Unfortunately for the galaxy they are much, much more than that ...In the previous book in this sub-series two unlikely allies, Manticoran super-spy Anton Zilwicki and Havenite super-spy Victor Cachat went undercover on Mesa and discovered an outline of what the Mesan Alignment is really up to. They then returned to their home nations and explained what they had found.In this book Anton, Victor and some of their friends return to Mesa, hoping to get more information. Instead they arrive on Mesa as the planet is on the verge of disaster. In response to Anton and Victor's revelations the Mesan alignment has activated a ruthless continency plan called ""Houdini,"" which they had ready to deal with the possibility that the rest of the galaxy gets an inkling of how big a threat the Mesans are.""Houdini"" was mentioned in both ""A Rising Thunder"" and ""Shadow of Freedom"" so anyone who has read either of those books will have some idea what it entails, but I don't want to say too much about it to avoid a spoiler. But it won't come as a surprise or a spoiler to say that when Anton and Victor return to Mesa, as a consequence of ""Houdini,"" the planet has been brought to the brink of a civil war. The ""seccies,"" nominally free but effectively second class citizens descended from slaves, are about to be made scapegoats and victims for atrocities which the reader knows were actually perpetrated by the Mesan Alignment. If Anton and Victor do nothing, millions of seccies and slaves will be murdered. But they're not going to let that happen without a fight ...If you have not read any of the ""Honorverse"" books and are interested in doing so, do not start with this one: I would recommend starting with the first book in the main Honor Harrington sequence which is ""On Basilisk Station (Honorverse).""The first eleven Honorverse novels, despite being Space Opera stories set in the far future, had strong parallels with the story of Nelson's navy up to 1805. The central character of most of these books, Honor Harrington, is a bit like a female mix of Horatio Nelson and Horatio Hornblower. Assumed technology in the first group of stories imposes constraints on space navy officers quite similar to those which the technology of fighting sail imposed on wet navy officers two hundred years ago.Similarly, the galactic situation in the novels up to the battle of Manticore at the end of ""At All Costs (Honorverse)"" (which corresponds to Trafalgar) had marked similarities to the strategic and political situation in Europe at the time of the French revolutionary wars.However, having finished the interesting parts of the battles at sea between the Royal Navy and the French Navy, the story is turning into something completely different. In ""Torch of Freedom"" and ""Storm from the Shadows (Honorverse)"" (SFTS) the reader learned that the genetic slaver company called ""Manpower"" is merely a front for something far more powerful and dangerous, known to its inner circle as ""The Mesan Alignment"" who are planning to remake the galaxy in pursuit of their idea of a genetically purified paradise - and they don't care how many hundreds of billions of human beings and other sentient life-forms will die in the process.Albrecht Detweiler, head of the Mesan Alignment and the new primary ""baddie"" introduced in ""Torch of Freedom"" is an interesting and complex person for the reader to love to hate, combining as he does some of the characteristics of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (without the cat), Dr Soong from Star Trek Enterprise (without the scruples), and the Emperor of Cetaganda from the Miles Vorkosigan Universe (without the humour.)Interestingly, ""Cauldron of Ghosts"" reveals how much more dangerous the Mesans are than the good guys originally asssumed ""Manpower"" to be, when in this book for the first time one of their operatives proves that there are people who are willing to die for the Mesan cause. And when I write ""willing to die"" I do not mean just take risks, and I'm not talking about people who were programmed against their will to carry out suicidal commands by what the good guys call ""assassination nanotech."" I'm talking about people who care enough about the Mesan cause to willingly undertake suicide missions.The Galaxy's original view of Manpower, perfectly articulated by Honor Harrington's uncle Jacques at the end of the novella ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the collection ""Beginnings: Worlds of Honor Book 6 (Honor Harrington), was that they were a bunch of crooks who were just in it for money, and although some of their people might be willing to risk death in a battle they expected to win, nobody on Mesa's side would willingly give their life for it.Up until ""Cauldron of Ghosts"" all the people who have done suicidal things at Mesa's behest were unwilling victims under the contol of tailored ""assassination nanotech"" which can be used to make them carry out very simple but lethal commands such as to grab a gun and start shooting people, hit the panic button that fires all a fleet's missiles, crash an aircar, or shoot themselves in the head.But one of the Mesan security enforcers in this book, a member of an elite security force nicknamed the ""Gauls,"" demonstrates that the ""good guys"" in the story do not have a total monopoly of people prepared to die for their side.Let me give a contemporary if perhaps controversial example. In the real history of the 20th and 21st century most human beings would violently disagree with, say, the Waffen SS, or with Al Queda suicide bombers, but although most of the rest of humanity would regard them as sick and depraved both thought they were or are serving a higher cause and are willing to die for it.In this book it becomes clear for the first time that the Mesan Alignment appears to have people in the same category working for them. Although the Mesan alignment appears utterly evil to the heroes and heroines of these books and hopefully to the reader, they do have an ideology which some of their people are willing to die for.A ""Gaul"" enforcer in this novel, who cannot possibly have been under the control of ""assassination nanotech"" because his actions are too complex, and are clearly a deliberate and carefully executed use of his initiative in response to a situation which his superiors may have foreseen but could not possibly have predicted in sufficient detail to programme a course of action into him against his will, carries out his mission ruthlessly and effectivlely even when his own death is an inevitable consequence. (Can't give more detail without a spoiler.)This novel is the first time we have seen the Gauls, and I will be interested to see if there is more detail about them, and about why they are willing to die for the Mesan cause, in future books.LIST OF HONORVERSE BOOKSAs hinted at above, the Honor Harrington series (sometimes nicknamed the ""Honorverse"") has developed two spin-off storylines. Stories set in this Universe fall into three series set 2,000 years from now amd two prequel series set 1,500 years from now, although they link together in a reasonably consistent manner.There is the main sequence, currently of 13 novels, which follow the career of Honor Harrington herself. This main sequence is:1) On Basilisk Station2) Honor of the Queen (Honorverse)3) The Short Victorious War (Honor Harrington)4) Field of Dishonour5) Flag in Exile6) Honor among Enemies7) In Enemy Hands8) Echoes of Honor9) Ashes of Victory10) War of Honor11) At All Costs12) Mission Of Honor13) A Rising ThunderThere are currently six collections in the ""Worlds of Honor"" series of short stories by Weber and co-authors set in the same universe, and featuring a range of characters, some from the main series of books, others new.Some of these are espionage stories and the ""Crown of Slaves"" sub-series co-written with Eric Flint, in which this book is the third volume, brings together several of the most prominent spies from the novels and short stories. As explained above this series comprises ""Crown of Slaves,"" ""Torch of Freedom"" and ""Cauldron of Ghosts.""And then there the ""Shadow"" series, dealing mostly with events in the Talbott Cluster and the relationship between Manticore and the Solarian Republic based on Old Earth. This sequence starts with ""The Shadow of Saganami"" and follows on with ""Storm from the Shadows"" and most recently ""Shadow of Freedom"".PREQUEL SERIESThere are two series set five hundred years before. The ""Star Kingdom"" series, currently a trilogy consisting of ""A beautiful friendship,"" ""Fire Season"" and ""Treecat Wars,"" tells the story of how Honor's ancestor Stephanie Harrington became the first human to form a telempathic ""adoption"" bond with a Sphinx treecat. Weber is also about to bring out the first of a new ""Manticore Ascendant"" trilogy about the early days of the Royal Manticoran Navy, set in the same century (it starts 11 years after the prologue of ""A Beautiful Friendship""). This first book, which is co-authored by Timothy Zahn, will be called ""A Call to Duty"" and is due for publication on 7th October 2014.OVERLAPSCauldron of Ghosts is set at almost exactly the same time as ""A Rising Thunder"" and ""Shadow of Freedom."" But in my opinion this book is easier to follow if you have read those books first.At one point early in this book Admiral Honor Harrington excuses herself for leaving a meeting to make sure her fleet is ready to deal with an imminent event which those who have read ""A Rising Thunder"" will recognise as having taken place in that book. The Mesan Alignment are implementing throughout ""Cauldron of Ghosts,"" in response to the revelations made by Anton Zilwicki and Victor Chachat, a pre-prepared contingency plan discussed by Albrecht Detweiler and his son in a conversation which appears in both ""A Rising Thunder"" and ""Shadow of Freedom.""And - apologies if this sounds Delphic, I am trying to avoid a spoiler - the final pages of this book are very closely linked to the final pages of ""Shadow of Freedom"" in a manner which IMHO makes the ending of this book easier to follow if you have read that book first.I found ""Cauldron of Ghosts"" to be interesting and entertaining and recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNQMPOZJ1F9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1HNK3W#wasThisHelpful","R3CNQMPOZJ1F9Q","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Transformation of Miss Ashworth"" is described by the author as one of a pair of Regency Romance novels with a ""linking theme"" but in fact this story is so thoroughly intertwined with that of ""The Viscount's Scandalous Return (Mills & Boon Historical)"" that it does not entirely work as a standalone novel.However in my opinion it does work as part of a double bill.The idea for the two novels, both set in 1814 when the Napoleonic wars first appeared to be over, is supposed to be that the heroine of this book and the hero of the other have returned to England after spending several years with Wellington's army, and ""both have been changed by their experiences.""This book is the story of Miss Bethany Ashworth, daughter of a colonel in Wellington's army and in her youth an arch tomboy who had tried to be the son Colonel Ashworth never had, who had gone out to the Peninsular with her father some six years before. The story begins as she is returning to her family home, The Grange near Stavely Court in the West country. Colonel Ashworth had died towards the end of the campaign and Bethany is now the owner of the property. She soon renews her acquaintance with her childhood friend, Sir Philip Stavely, who had broken her heart when he got proposed to her cousin instead of Bethany herself six years before.However, as usual with the Regency romance genre, the course of true love does not necessarily run smooth. And both Bethany and Philip are caught up in the affairs of an individual known to Bethany as ""Major Darcy Wood"" who had gone out to the Peninsular, serving under a false name after being wrongly accused of a double murder. Now that the war is over he wants to clear his name. This is the story which is completed in ""The Viscount's Scandalous return.""The two books are best read consecutively, this one first, as a double bill, and on that basis they are reasonably well-crafted and enjoyable. As with so many romances the story does sometimes overplay the theme of two people who are obviously in love but for some reason cannot see or accept that their feelings are mutual.Worth a try if you enjoy historical romances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BVRAA1OZBD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373305621#wasThisHelpful","R27BVRAA1OZBD6","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicholas Monsarrat is of course best known for his tales of the sea: his first written works were mostly about World War II, particularly his autobiographical accounts of convoy escort duty aboard the various anti-submarine vessels he commanded during the Battle of the Atlantic such as ""Three Corvettes."" He will always be remembered for his iconic depiction of that campaign, the classic novel ""The Cruel Sea"" which is undoubtedly one of the great war stories of all time.However, Monsarrat's skill with the pen was far broader than just the ability to write about war and the sea, he also wrote some very different books, such as The White Rajah"" and this is another book which is very different from his nautical offerings.""The Pillow fight"" is the story of a marriage which begins against the background of injustice in South Africa under the apartheid regime.At the start of the story Kate Marais is a a successful and cynical career girl from Johannesburg, and Jonathan Steele is a passionate idealistic young writer preparing a book about Africa. Despite the huge gulf between their ideas, backgrounds and values, they fall in love and eventually marry.The twist to the story is that in the second half of the book their values switch in opposite directions: Kate has become more idealistic and ethical while Jonathon has tasted ""the corrupting fruits of success"" and become far more cynical. As Jonathon becomes a globe-trotter enjoying fame and wealth while seeking more of the same. Much of the second half of the book is set in Barbados and New York. Meanwhile, Kate comes to care about the people of Africa in the way the man she had married once did, and putting ever more strain on their relationship ...This is a well written and entertaining story and those who like romance and relationship stories with a harder edge will probably enjoy it. Just don't expect it to be anything like ""The Master Mariner"" or ""The Cruel Sea!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VFCK72QP0HK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1842321536#wasThisHelpful","R1VFCK72QP0HK8","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susan Travers's autobiography ""Tomorrow to be Brave"" is a true story of events which no fiction writer would have dared to use in a novel.Susan Travers is unique in at least two respects - she and her father were, to the best of her knowledge probably the only father and daughter, and certainly the only English father and daughter, to both be awarded the Legion d'honneur by France, and she was also the only woman to serve in the French Foreign legion.This autobiography was published in 2000, when she was a widow in her nineties: she did not feel able to tell her story in full before her husband's death in 1995.The official announcement of her award of the Legion d'honneur in the Foreign Legion newspaper read as follows:""The Kepi Blanc is pleased to inform you of the nomination to the grade of Knight of the Legion of Honour for Chef-adjudant Susan Travers, married name Schlegelmilch, the only woman to be part of the history of the Foreign Legion (regimental roll number 22166). She served during the second world war as the driver of General Koenig and as a nurse in the Far East and North Africa.""That gives only the faintest hint of Susan Travers' extraordinary story but I quote it because otherwise I would have had difficulty believing that this tale could be true. Truth really is sometimes stranger than fiction.The author tells the story of her life in a very engaging way, making no attempt to gloss over aspects of her story which might have been embarrassing to herself or anyone else, and with a most entertaining dry sense of humour. To give a couple of examples of her wit, she says of the pet dog she had as a child,""our black labrador, Duchess ... was bought as a gun dog for Father but turned out to be terrified of loud bangs and was thereafter confined to the nursery in disgrace.""Of World War one, in which her father, a former naval officer who came out of retirement and volunteered for war service, earned his own Legion d'honneur while acting as a liason between Britain and France, she writes of her grandmother""My grandmother refused to allow anything as inconsequencial as the First World War to interfere with her social life ...Whether my grandmother deliberately flouted government calls on the weathy to be frugal and live simpler lives I don't know. I imagine she simply thought that they couldn't possibly be referring to her.""This is a fantastic, frank, very entertaining and exciting autobiography of an extraordinary woman living in extraordinary times, and I strongly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I4ZLV3V4919C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090U1Q5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2I4ZLV3V4919C","A3ONTLXQ85EE4G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONTLXQ85EE4G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ripped bag that drips. The collapsed cord tie. The glass jar that punches a whole straight through. The imbalanced bag. The bag swallowed whole  when  the first item goes in.Ask yourself this: is 6 extra cents a  bag (in comparison to the standard equivalents at Walmart) worth never having to deal with these problems? Is a dripping, dribbling mess worth $3 saved? What about the hassle of replacing shoddy ones with poor seals?I would offer a resounding 'yes,' noting that these are literally designed to be thrown away. Hefty Ultimate Flex Tall Kitchen Bags are seemingly 4-5 thicker than average bags. They literally snap on...and around...a tall garbage can with ease. The strings are of higher quality. The woven style provides needed stretch when the big is inevitably unevenly weighted. The odor control? Not as good as advertised.I think of these akin to buying cheap batteries. Sure, if you need the battery to run a clock and/or lower powered/end device, no problem. The same for bathroom/vanity wastebaskets. Any bag can do there. But for higher end/usage needs, cutting corners is simply not worth the hassle.These bags definitely made me rethink the garbage bag concept. Spend more, get more. I'm also confident that - due to  their durability - they don't need to be swapped out as often as cheaper counterparts. Thus, 6 cents becomes 4 cents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R101VD2L6ZYW6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBGVQE8#wasThisHelpful","R101VD2L6ZYW6Z","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Believe the hype.Needing an upgrade over older Harbinger (beaten to death and now peeling) and BNooch (Velcro keeps falling aparty gloves, terrific reviews led me to purchase a pair of these bad boys.For my purposes, I want/ed a glove for lifting, one that can take the grind of pushups/mountain climbers on concrete/turf, sled pushes/rope swings, barbell/kettle bell lifts, etc. Also not get disgusting from heavy sweating (it is W FL, after all).

"I've got several backup chargers out there...the credit card kind, the cylinder shaped, and the larger capacity brick. All perform as promised (noting I only buy higher end ones to avoid charging mishaps). They all, however, also have a knack for running out of juice when I need them the most. As a light/moderate user, these supplementary power sources barely get any TLC...until it's too late. Hindsight as 20/20 = a common theme for my outdated iPhone 4S.When Stunning Gadgets offered me the opportunity to review their SG Sport Solar Panel Charger, I welcomed an alternate way to manage a backup power source. I confess: I was skeptical...but ultimately quite pleased.To explain, the Sport Solar Panel Charger embraces the light handshake of both outdoor and - most importantly - indoor lighting, meaning, if you keep it exposed (via handy and included carabiner clip) to even an overhead flourescent....you don't have to think, period, about charging capacity. I turn my kitchen lights on, the little guy charges. I put it on a window sill, you betcha. For the road warrior, attaching the Sport Solar Panel Charger to a backpack means always having a backup power source on hand without any thought included. Included additional flashlight is a welcome feature.With this being said, you can manually charge the Sport Solar Panel Charger via a USB outlet/power source. Stunning Gadgets are thankfully intuitive enough to include TWO USB charge ports for manual charging, meaning you can use it...and charge...simultaneously. None of my other chargers can accomplish this feat.Duly note, however, that the Sport Solar Panel Charger only comes with one cable: USB to MicroUSB. Thus, for Lightning chargers, older Apple chargers, etc., you'll want to buy another cable. You've been warned.Related, Stunning Gadgets claims this bad boy near weatherproof. Not sure I want to test that claim. It's shell resembles what one would find on an OtterBox, with dual rubberized enclosures protecting ports. Would I risk drenching this? Probably not. I do, however, feel pretty safe letting it take mother nature's light rain if ports don't get over-exposed.I also found one of the charge meter lights inconsistent in brightness to others on the left. Not a big deal, but a minor QC mater.Finally - and for any review product - I always put customer service to the test. Many small businesses want Amazon reviews...but don't seem to know/care about their products. Stunning Gadgets is thankfully neither, a fairly responsive company that follows-up quickly and intelligently. Thus, I'm cautiously optimistic warranty claims will be met with professionalism and quick turnaround.All in all, the Stunning Gadgets Sport Solar Panel Charger is a surprisingly practical and energy hip device that does what it promises. I dig the prospect of not having to think ahead with a supplemental charger, also one that can take a bit of a knock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IRGAX77VWWPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSSA4KU#wasThisHelpful","R1IRGAX77VWWPA","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The guys at Glasstic offered me a chance to review the Tribal pattern of this bottle in return for an unbiased review. Unbeknownst to them, I take my water bottles very seriously. I literally have over a dozen - in different shapes, sizes and materials - as them faithful allies everywhere I go (being a fitness junkie in sweltering West Florida). Thus, Glasstic: you are brave souls.I admit, I expected very little from this bottle...likely another small business custom making products with glaring loose ends. What I discovered, was anything but.To explain, this bottle oozes class. I dig the Tribal pattern, one that doesn't look pasted/stickered on. Related, the glass-inside-plastic enclosure is simply brilliant. My formerly favorite glass bottle - Contigo Purity Glass Water Bottle, 20-Ounce, Greyed Jade is glass throughout. Even with a rubber exterior, I'm always fearful my beloved Purity bottle is going to shatter and/or glass top crack with use. With Glasstic's plastic shell, I feel a bit more at ease by an obviously lighter and seemingly safer bottle. (I'm yet to throw it against a wall or drop it on rocks as I don't want a crime scene on my hands.) They also warranty the glass interior. If I need to use said warranty, something very wrong likely happened. (Eek!)Another smart aspect of the Glasstic bottle is the ability to completely remove/replace the top AND bottom components. Far too many of my bottle favorites end up moldy - even with dishwasher rinse - as I could never fully clean them. With everything coming apart, however, I was worried about seal. I shook the darn thing to oblivion, expected a shower...but got none. I would expect this seal to lessen after repeated dishwasher use (it's only  logical)...thus will stick to manual cleaning except once in a while.How does it drink? The sipping opening is admittedly a bit different, more of the pouring versus sports bottle (longer tube) variety. The lid and accompanying hook both bend back in a controlled fashion, making this a truly one-handed bottle. I admit it took me a bit of finagling to realize how the lid rests over the hook. I dig the lock latch, in tandem. It really does shut and seal.Perhaps the most useful part of this review is a reminder to fill out the post purchase email. You do this, and Glasstic sends a perfectly sized bottle brush...likewise a second set of different colored (mine were grey) top/bottom parts. This second set had a pouring top, one common to camping style bottles. They said they're working on including these with original purchase, going forward.If there's a criticism, it's recognition that the bottle is slightly smaller than competitors, 16oz versus 20oz. This makes it useful for one handed drinking, just not too far away from a water source. I would consider this a great gym/home bottle, but not ideal for long camping excursions.Once you factor in the freebies, this bottle is an arguable steal for $20. I peppered the heck out of Glasstic reps with questions, and they humored this water bottle fanatic. Hopefully they get the shipping bit figured out...also introduce bigger bottles down the line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YVF3UGQGE7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG36X2C#wasThisHelpful","R2YVF3UGQGE7N","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's nothing not to like about Food Should Taste Good Multigrain Bean Chips.They are light to digest, have a wonderfully simplistic (in a good way) bean taste/texture them, and are one of the few snack food items that don't hit you over the head with hidden dairy (my arch nemesis) and/or salt/sugars.

"As an experienced Muay Thai practitoner also group fitness (kick/boxing) fan, I can't even begin to count the number of times tortured souls came to me asking what gloves to buy. Every single one of them was holding a lowest end Everlast or Title pair of vinyl gloves...and complained of horrific wrist and knuckle pain, occasional finger bleeding/blisters, and even headaches from the impact.They may chalk it up to being a beginner, and adjusting. Yes, there's some of that...but that tells a very small part of the story. I tried on these gloves and attempted to use them. I cried on the insane, giant crocodile tears.Cheap gloves have almost zero padding and/or wrist support. They get moldy faster. The vinyl cracks. They're not weighted evenly (leading to poor technique). Far too many people fall prey to Walmart Everlast availability and/or the pair the gym sells you. They're both awful. As are most of the handwraps (you'll want ones with elastic to provide a better fit/support). Ask yourself this simple question: what's cheaper...caring for broken bones or a pair of decent gloves (that can last 2+ years, minimum)As 99% of glove purchasers are doing so for fitness purposes, a quick, affordable fix are Twins Special, Fairtex or Venum Challenger gloves. (Knockoffs like RDX/Pro Impact are also decent being real leather.) All are fantastic mid level, durable leather mitts...ones that will last you a long time with proper care (use a sports spray/disinfectant after each use, let them AIR OUT). All are available on Amazon. Yes, they'll cost you $30 more...but see note above on injuries. Glove dogs are also nice to have around. 12oz at most for heavy bag. 10oz is fine for smaller women. Heck...order 2 or 3...send the ones you don't like back. Gloves are a personal thing, re: feel.Wraps? Skip Everlast and Meister. Go for - at minimum - wider Title or Ringside (my personal favorite based on price). Remember NOT to roll them up when wet or they'll get moldy. Let them sit on the shower floor while showering, step on 'em, easy washing fix in between heavier washes.While $75 seems a lot to invest in a sport/hobby you're not certain about...do it safely.

"Suffering from Clone Wars withdrawal is a terrible thing...so says the Savage Opress statue sitting in our living room.Yup, I'm a fan. The characters in this terrific animated series arguably possess deeper personalities than many of their movie counterparts, notably the varied spectrums of good versus evil.Without providing spoilers, Christie Golden successfully brings to print what the Clone Wars did to screen, and with it a terrific deeper dive into the already fantastic Quinlan Vos and Asajj Ventress characters. Specifically, the very fine line which separates the force from the dark side. Golden does a very good job in leaving interpretations of this line up to the reader, allowing Clone Wars fans to revisit earlier perceptions/conclusions about key characters (ie the Nightsisters) while doing so.Others have commented on the romance part; you've been warned. This aspect is weaved into a very easy read tale, one full of fun Star Wars tropes and references. In short, this is a book any Clone Wars fan is going to enjoy.All in all, Dark Disciple stands as one of the better tales in the Star Wars universe, featuring consistent writing quality and nice character development. A solid book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVBMMTXP0VP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511530#wasThisHelpful","RXVBMMTXP0VP5","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been a big fan of GermGuardian's smaller units, capable odor fighters for active kitchens. If there was a criticism of this unit, it's the uneven weight balance, also vents that tend to get clogged. Thus, when Guardian Technologies offered a review opportunity for its new iteration of GG1100, I jumped at the chance.This was a much needed leap, as my small laundry room was stinking to high heaven. Plagued by the mold/damp odor of a High Efficiency washer in West Florida...combined with endlessly stinky compression clothes, post workout...we needed help. Airing out the washer, washer tablets, an accompanying washer fan, also Safe T's deodorizer all fell short of the stinky dragon.The GG1100 is the dragon slayer. After 1.5 days, the odor is gone. I can walk into the laundry room, breathe deeply, and no remnants of workouts past. Logically the smell will return if new stench is added to the mix, but - like clockwork - there it goes 1.5 days later. This thing is incredible. If they weren't $40/each, they'd be in all 3 bathrooms in my house.Size wise, I didn't find it as obtrusive as others...but it's also on the lower part of a laundry room wall. Perhaps I'd feel differently if allowed more visibility.Finally and for those wanting to multitask (desktop counters, I gather), there's an accompanying USB charge port on its side. A nice added bonus if your cell phone needs some love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DH35ZON2RCYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLBR0LG#wasThisHelpful","R3DH35ZON2RCYM","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bless you, chiropractor to the stars, a wise chap who told me my hyperextended/dislocated elbow from MMA was - in fact - golf elbow. As a guy who's never played a round of golf in my life, I thought he was nuts.The man, however, was right x1000. I wore the Bracoo Strap religiously for every workout over 3 months' time...and no increased pain. It's incredible how something so small, so simple can do so much.

So much so, I purchased them in almost every color I could find.To explain, they breathe like champs, even in highest intensity workout and on top of a compression sports bra. Racerback means no pull, excellent for workout requiring arm/shoulder flexibility. The Mrs. is also a very small person, (5'2'', 110#), and these are flattering while functional. They don't hang, nor look like poser clothing = too form fitting to be useful.Most importantly, they're durable and colorfast.

"I feel like an idiot.I've wasted far too much money on fragile Twins, Title, and other supposed gear bags, only too watch them deteriorate from moisture and/or zippers fall off in just under 6 months. To this day, I don't know why the heck it's so hard to design a bag that can hold fighting equipment, likewise transport their sweaty counterparts back home (until cleaning/drying).Goodbye peeling plastic from compression clothing. Sayonara snapped, cheap plastic zippers. Take a hike stupid hard plastic bottom inserts that don't maintain shape. While Meister products are very much hit or miss (their wraps and ankle braces are an abomination), this X-Large gear bag is a stud.

If you have any hope of hoping shin pads, gloves, wraps, headgear, a towel, and change of clothes...the XL is where to be.

"The Pridebit Julienne & Vegetable Peeler/Cutter/Slicer is one of those kitchen items you probably didn't think you needed...until you have it. Truth be told, I never would've thought to even attempt Julienne peeling unless Pridebit offered me a review copy at a discounted price.At $11, this is a surprising rock star at both traditional and Julienne peeling/slicing, a durable and evenly weighted device that punches well beyond its weight. The included pipe cleaner-esque brush helps keep the Julienne side clean. Speaking of Julienne peeling/slicing, this was our maiden voyage for this slicing type. Thanks to Pridebit, our stir frys now pack a chef like panache.The guinea pig was a willing cucumber, with smooth and even peeling to its external skin. Internal elements easily sliced into nice looking Julienne strands. The peeler/slicer never slipped from hands at both stags; it is properly weighted to not give in to wetter surfaces and occasional slip.All in all, I'm very impressed by the Pridebit Julienne & Vegetable Peeler/Cutter/Slicer. I've wasted oodles of money on similarly priced but poorer performing peelers/slicers.

"I admit it: I overtrain. My poor legs remind me of this daily, with endless spasms, aches, shin pains and the world's longest warmup period. While I'm a slave to compression shirts and shorts (cotton's sweaty embrace is deadly), I waited for too long to test compression calf sleeves.Placebo effect, be damned: the Shock Doctor SVR Recovery Compression Calf Sleeve is a rock star. Within literally 5 minutes of putting these on, my calves were already warmed up for light running. I put these bad boys to the test in 90+ degree Florida workout heat, specifically an hour of cross training where leg use was prominently featured.No cramps, no shin pain, no irritating 30 min before my legs woke up. Speaking of Florida heat, no disgusting trapped sweat either. I was shocked when they came off...they did so without a pool of sweat common to compression clothing. Thirty minutes later, my legs are not as tired as they typically are. These things really do work.Fit wise, the Large felt custom made for a 6'2'', 170 pound athlete. They literally fit exactly as they did in the picture. Easy to get on, only slightly harder (being wet) getting off. I did hear the usual fabric crunch at the bottom of the sleeve upon first use, one common to compression clothing (as they're breaking in). Still, no loose seams anywhere to give me cause for concern.All in all, the Shock Doctor SVR Recovery Compression Calf Sleeve far exceeded my expectations. I can only imagine how awesome these must be for runners in colder temps.

"The Amazon Collection is typically hit or miss, and - unfortunately - the 10k Yellow Gold Triangle Fashion Dangle is of the latter category.To explain - and while 10k gold - these earrings look and feel cheap. Engraving quality is inconsistent, with pattern depth noticeably non-uniform at places. Also, said engraving pattern is unimpressive for a $100 earring set. Note: these look much better in the close-up pictures than in hand.Related - and while 10k gold - these earrings have a weight and feel of much lesser metal. Meaning, unless someone knows this is 10k gold, they're likely to be very disappointed in how cheap these earrings feel. It doesn't help help they come packaged within a ziploc bag. Ouch.The one positive is that these earrings are extraordinarily lightweight. Thus - and while small-medium size - they are not bulky or heavy.

"What happens when you take a pretty standard product and give it the Paris treatment?That, my Amazon friends, is Pre de Provence Savon De Marseille's Liquid Soap (Lavender Sage). Everything about this soap oozes class: the lather quality, smooth texture, easy rinse-ability, moisturizing feel, and a terrific lavender (and barely sage) scent.The scent - per other reviewers - is a mixed bag. My wife and I absolutely adored it. Lavender is very hit or miss in this area, as the cheap stuff resembles the worst kind of bathroom spray. This is thankfully not of that variety. Now the scent - like top notch hand creme - is certainly noticeable...but loses potency within 5-10 minutes. It's no surprise this comes from the land of perfume. Pre de Provence got this right.If there's a criticism to be made, it's the Savon De Marseille's poor packaging and below average pump. Thankfully - unlike others - mine didn't come leaking and/or with the pump already engaged. Still, it's obvious this can happen (based on appearance), as the mechanism (and bottle) are not appropriate for something of this price point.Would I purchase this (as non-review product)? That depends on how long the bottle lasts. As typically hand soap containers - the $3-5 variety - last about a couple months, Pre de Provence Savon De Marseille Liquid Soap needs to double that to even warrant the leap. Fingers crossed, but ones smelling great and feeling moisturized while I wait.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPS8YUKKG0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I06ZXPS#wasThisHelpful","R3KPS8YUKKG0K","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, the sad tale of the dish towel. Forgotten afterthought of the kitchen, left to whatever remains on hand at Walmart or Target at discount prices. Ironic, as seemingly no other kitchen item receives equal daily use.Behold, the DII 100% Cotton 16 x 19 dish towel set. This four pack features nice sharp colors, with surprisingly good stitching and weight for the price. No loose threads, uneven color dye, ugly stitches so common in lower priced, bulk cloth sets.I haven't tested machine washing them as of yet, but they certainly look/feel as durable as any other dish towel (that seem destined to survive the washing apocalypse).My only criticism is a fairly significant one, however, in that I would consider these more of the bar versus kitchen towel variety. Meaning, they're useful to attack larger amounts of water/liquids...but they don't perfectly dry items akin to regular dish towels. Wipe all you want, but these towels are seemingly not designed to finish the deed, in entirety.Still, they get most of what's there, keep stone/granite counters relatively dry, look and feel solid.

"**UPDATE: For those using it on their face...and posting negative reviews and/or down-voting positive ones...these are NOT MEANT FOR THE FACIAL AREA. Also, these things worked SO well, I bought another batch.**Oh, body acne, the unfortunate bedfellow of a committed workout routine. Even more so with compression clothing, where moisture wicking tendsto trap oils/dirt beneath.After nearly a hundred wasted dollars on different butt/body acne products, Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads does what all others fail to do. Granted with a little sting.To explain, Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads are powerful allies in the fight against body acne. Boy, do they clean! Oils and dirt remnants appear on the pads post-use...accompanied by a noticeable zing after use. Also nice is the absence of a chemical smell. Finally, one pad goes a long way; there's a significant amount of cleaning agent on each.The next morning (as workouts are at night), applied areas feature slightly shrunken acne heads. (Rome wasn't built in a day, friends.)If there's a note of caution, those with very sensitive skin may find these too irritating. Second, be cognizant of wiping down sweat before application. More sweat...more sting. These work better on cleaner skin.All in all - and echoing other reviewers - Proactiv Clear Zone Body Pads are a terrific product for adult body acne sufferers...especially gym rats. As one pad does its thing and well, one can get ~2 months to tackle the formerly undefeated sweat beast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEQOL0JWIUKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY418J0#wasThisHelpful","R3EEQOL0JWIUKZ","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having taken the plunge on a natural - but very expensive - deodorant (via Vine review), I was amazed at the difference removing aluminum makes. I'm now convinced that my insatiable appetite to sweat less (via potent anti-perspirants) actually ended up clogging pores...leading to more sweat.While I liked the review product (My Goodness Natural Deodorant), the price point ($20 an oz) and application method (hand rubbing) didn't sit well. Thus, I took the plunge on the Tom's of Maine Lemongrass Natural Deodorant, I purchased one stick locally (~$6) in hopes of buying in bulk later via Amazon. Soon thereafter, the product was returned to CVS.I felt an obligation to write this review as I've never seen a new stick of deodorant act anything like this. It literally oozed liquid everywhere within my admittedly hot car, thankfully isolated to the bag I luckily didn't take it out off. It made a mess of everything beside it, with any/everything now smelling like Lemongrass. Which is not a bad thing. The pool of deodorant oils...a different story.A devil's advocate would point out that deodorant sticks do, in fact, crack at higher temps. My Speed Stick and Old Spice ones, for instance, are notorious for abandoning form when the stick drops to 1/3 capacity. Still, no deodorant ever left such an unsightly, oily mess as the Tom's of Maine Natural Deodorant Lemongrass Stick. If it can't maintain consistency sitting in a car, I wouldn't trust it absorbing odor/balancing moisture in armpits not much warmer. Let alone the disaster it could wreak in checked airplane luggage. Imagine an entire suitcase covered in deodorant stick oils...smelling like Lemongrass.If you live in higher temperature climates, I advise serious caution before purchasing and using this deodorant stick.

"First things first: I saw little difference between the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask and it's significantly less expensive counterparts. Thus, if this wasn't a review product, I would likely feel quite disappointed by the extra investment.To explain, I'm always on the lookout for skin care products capable of shrinking nasal pores, also remove dirt/oils from skin facial surface. Florida + very sweaty workouts can wreak havoc on skin tone and complexion.As someone with normal/dry skin, the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask unfortunately provided almost no noticeable benefit in exception to a surface cleaning. My wife - who has the opposite skin type (oily) likewise found little difference between this and Queen Helene offerings. In fact, she deemed the latter  arguably more effective. We both complained of extreme dryness and subtle redness after recommended ten minutes of drying (then removal) time.Using the Proactiv+ Skin Purifying Mask reminded me of another review product, that being the Bjore charcoal facial cleansing bar.

Likewise what was once a pretty firm rubber seal begin to get floppy. There's only so much a car can do with a sun not afraid to take prisoners.I applied the 303 Rubber Seal to a barely 2 year old VW SUV - wow, there's a lot of rubber seal on this thing! - in just under 15 min.

Akin to moisturizing leather, it's obvious when product and surface have a love fest. This is one of those instances.Application - as others noted - is a breeze. While it's near impossible to clean every surface of rubber pre-application (dirt is sneaky), 303's Rubber Seal Protectant application sponge fought capably through the messy stuff. A few strokes later, the brush head was clean again. No clogs, annoying drips either. Where some dirt was dragged, Meguilar's interior cleaner took care of that.One last thought: In applying this product, I was thinking how useful it would be to have in a wipes format.

"After the lid hinge snapped on my Rubbermaid kitchen wastebasket, I decided to take the plunge on something slightly better. This wastebasket demise also made me realize the value of a good lid and closure system. Whew; things get stinky fast with a funky lid.Unfortunately, not much to choose from in the low profile, 40L range for wastebaskets. And I sure as heck wasn't going to spend $100 for something fancier.The simplehuman Slim looks and feels better than Rubbermaid's equivalent, with a more polished look to its plastic, also better quality on its hinges and step. Lid assembly was surprisingly tricky...and took longer than it should. (Frustration tends to mount quickly when attempts to assemble a seemingly simple product doesn't go as intended. I'm talking to YOU Kohler toilet seat!)The lid closes nicely, locks out odors well. I like the fact the lid doesn't slam immediately shut when closing (meaning, it's not 100% contingent on the pedal for operation.) The additional latch seal is the wastebasket equivalent of Ft. Knox. Easily to close...but a fair bit of effort to re-open. Probably a good thing for those with pets/rugrats. Not so much for me wanting to keep out last night's fish stir fry remnants from surrounding nostrils.Some complained of this being easy tip. I didn't experience this...but also not two of the four sides sit adjacent to walls.All in all, a decent purchase in a limited product space.

"My armpits hurt. All the time. I also sweat...a LOT. Which makes little sense as I'm a very athletic guy, plus consume gallons of water day.I've tried extra strength anti perspire/deodorants, mainstream...also non mainstream products. I'm tired of the weird hard, chemical glob left on my undershirts, also the smell at the end of the day. I'm convinced the strong stuff is clogging my pores.My Goodness Deodorant is a nice change, albeit far from perfect. To begin, it stings upon initial use. Application is a tad nasty having to rub the product into your armpits. Even suggested dime size amount is awkward.Still...it works and well. The sting went away in about 30 min, and - after a full day of use, including an intense workout - My Goodness Deodorant holding fairly strong. Not 48 hour strong. Yes, a good bit was absorbed during said workout, but there's certainly no offensive stench. Also - and perhaps due to it not clogging pores - I sweated significantly less from my armpits. Dare I say less sweat than when using a supposed anti-perspirant. No glob on the undershirt, just normal moisture.I can't pinpoint what caused the initial sting, but perhaps I need to step down in My Goodness Deodorant strength. Being a Vine review, however, I can only review what I get. Hopefully they'll offer alternate strengths in review products. Either way, the sting sensation was significantly less on Day 2.I would also like an improvement on application method. As a dude, we're not fans of rubbing lotion onto armpit hair. While this product works well, I'd like a middle ground. Clearly lotion breaks down easier than roll on/powder. There's got to be something better than hand application, however.All in all, however, My Goodness Deodorant is a nice change of deodorant pace for an athletic dude. My armpits don't hurt for the first time in ages...no undershirt glob. I'm nearly a week into using the stuff, and I don't if I want to go back to traditional anti-perspirants/deodorants. I'm now convinced they made me sweat more by blocking the pores, also made my sweat smell a little funky. I have no idea what is symptom versus cure, but there's clearly something to be said about using a more natural deodorant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18GLTMW3XK0N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYT2WYM#wasThisHelpful","R18GLTMW3XK0N5","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earrings are fantastic.To explain: they're nicely weighted to not be flimsy or heavy, possess an outstanding and easy-to-use clasp, and possess a beautiful but still subtle filigree pattern that resembles traditional Celtic jewelry. Most importantly, they don't look or feel cheap (like the ones in a Target/Walmart at similar price point).Functionally and being sterling silver, these earrings are subtle yet classy. This makes them wearable for casual to office attire. Being textured, they look terrific with curly/wavy hair, especially darker colors where the silver can 'pop' a bit.All in all, a wonderful set of earrings at an equal price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BEJBX5P0LJ6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFSGAXO#wasThisHelpful","R3BEJBX5P0LJ6S","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rare is the sauce that is so flavorful it stands alone. Minor's Chile Garlic is that rarity.With a thick texture that blends seamlessly at high heat, Minor's Chile Garlic sauce is the seasoning you never knew you needed. Even more so for Asian wok/stir fry style cooking, as it has the substance that my beloved Sriracha lacks...also holds it flavor a bit better as well. Duly noted, of course, that Sriracha is more an after versus during cooking condiment. I still love you, great rooster!I would deem Minor's Chile Garlic as a sweet yet distinct seasoning, where the garlic adds a nice omnipresent kick. The chiles don't seem to provide much other than to bind; little heat to speak of.Also - and worth noting - is there's tons of this stuff...even more so as a little goes a long way. 77 oz is monster bottle at 2tbsp per serving. Don't forget to refrigerate after opening!If there's one criticism to be had, the sodium content is way too high for my liking. This ended in combining the sauce with turmeric for final finish, and with it cut down on the nearly 600 mg of sodium per serving also 7g of sugar. Also - and at 45 calories per serving - you want to be smart or waste calories in the wrong places.For restaurants and/or cooks making big Asian style dishes, Minor's Chile Garlic is a no-brainer. It's a terrific, hassle free base that makes proteins, rice and veggies shine. Those making smaller dishes, however, be wary of the bad stuff in here. Not enough to be dangerous...but note the contents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJAHKCI2W19Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFO7HM#wasThisHelpful","RVJAHKCI2W19Z","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Samsil's Pop n' Store Medium Square Box is one of those clever storage solutions that simply gets it. Small enough as to not be obtrusive, portable but not flimsy, and a nice firm lid (thanks to metal corners) that stays on tight. Very attractive in white, and seemingly more so in other color choices.If there's a criticism to be had, it's the cloth bottom (that the cardboard slides onto to form box bottom) vulnerable to tear. Should this tear, there goes box integrity. I also had some difficulty breaking it back down...but not enough to recommend against it. I see the latter as a positive, as it means the box holds its shape. Not sure how these two aspects would impact larger sizes of said box...but at medium, it's a winner.Functionally, Samsil's Pop n' Store Medium Square Box's primary purpose was to replace a shoebox holding keepsakes that's seen far too much duty. This box fits the bill perfectly. Deep storage for its size, easy to move, and walls that don't give in to an array of objects.Every now and then I'm offered a review product that truly surprises in its value.

"These bands - from thickness, to tension, also carrying case - reek of quality. They're not the flimsy plastic you see in lower grade handoffs at physical therapy places, and are equivalent to Thera Band (if not better). No odor, powdery residue, plastic shearing. Nice grip as well.In contrast to Thera Band, I trust B Nooch's  offering to hold up to some serious abuse. These are awesome for hip abductor/extensions, the dreaded duo that traditional exercise (non loop) bands struggle mightily with. I gave each of these bands a serious stretch and pull, and I would declare the clearly marked tension grades accurate. Stretching the darker color bad boys is certainly a workout.If there's a criticism, it's that they're very short. Which...isn't really a criticism, if you're looking to apply them to specific exercises. Aforementioned hip work, leg/calf extension, seated bicep curls, sumo squats (with spread), lateral triceps stretch, pelvic thrust...all well suited for these small bad boys.For a fitness customer: the B Nooch Workout Bands are wonderful supplements to an existing exercise routine...even more so if you're taking the show on the road. Everything fits easily and well in provided carry bag and therefore suitcase. Physical therapy customers will likely love these as well (as this primary audience).**Note: This product was provided by the manufacturer for review.

"When it comes to skin products, few do it better than AHAVA. Dead Sea Water, minimum ingredients, and emphasis on highest quality mean awesome results at a mid-upper price point. No wonder the name translates to love in its native Hebrew language.The Mineral Hand Cream is yet another AHAVA winner. It goes on seemingly like the 'WATER' described on product face. So little does so much, with skin lapping up the stuff (notably in between fingers and on cuticles). It also smells absolutely terrific.There's a surprising catch: wow, there's a whole lot of chemicals in here. Lines and lines of them, in fact...and oodles of alcohol. As someone who buys AHAVA products with the 'less is more' philosophy, I can't give their Mineral Hand Cream a clean bill of health in this area.

"When essie says 'tart,' they mean it. This nail polish is VERY bright...also a bit different in color than pictured (it has a bit more pink hue to it). Definitely a summer color...but not for the feint of color heart.As fair as nail polish goes (being the first foray into essie), I would compare this favorably to OPI. It applies evenly, takes a bit longer to dry (a sign of better quality), and no need for a second coat as the first did its job and well. It also bonds seamlessly with clear coat finish.It's also durable, staying strong after some rigorous exercise (sweat, pounding).All in all, a mid-upper tier summer color nail polish.

"What a difference a hundred dollars makes.Satisfied...but certainly not pleased...with my Homelegance Lift Top Storage Bench, I was curious to see quality control differences in Storage Ottomans for a little bit more cash. I don't even know where to begin.For starters, packaging is wonderful, weight balanced for dual lift (~50 pounds). No shenanigans with ripped liners and/or torn seating surfaces that plague Homelegance. Assembly literally took 60 seconds, as my wife and I easily screwed in the legs to Ottoman bottom. I'm guessing provided ring/washers are intended to protect/separate legs from the Ottoman based (as there's no mention of this in the instructions). Everything went together like a boss.Most importantly, quality control is exceptional. Bonded leather is very good, stitching looks like it can stand up to some good use (I inspected this quite closely). While CorLiving claims easy cleanup, I'm not sure I would use this color option as a footrest (being bright white). As a seating surface, however, it offers solid support (in comparison to the Homelegance model that feels flimsy), with nice firmness. I especially like the midrange quality controlled latches and pull tab, making storage use a breeze (as the bench stays open).Speaking of bright white - and for those trying to color coordinate - it's blends with standard latex flat white paint. Very similar colors, no wacky yellow tinge or pseudo ivory. Easy peasy there. Finally, note product dimensions. This is not a small bit of furniture, at nearly 4 feet across.In sum: If you're in the market for a storage ottoman via Amazon, I hope this review provides some pause in considering a slightly extra investment versus cheaper offerings. Quality differential between this and the very popular Homelegance model is night and day. I only wish I would've discovered CorLiving in the reverse order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NLKII8Z7QQNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKFQTHM#wasThisHelpful","R2NLKII8Z7QQNC","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's just say Downy Fresh Protect is certainly a unique product. It's an air freshener, of sorts, for your clothes, and does an admirable job on standard cotton/poly fabrics. Best use, however, is arguably with cotton towels, where perfume/floral scent is more appropriate than smelling like a walking dryer sheet.Personally, I requested the product to offset the dri-fit odor blues. The same blues that every sport detergent can't seem to shake within exercise clothing. Downy Fresh Protect does mask the odor...but is really window dressing (drowning one scent out with another...versus replacing it). In all fairness, not much Downy can do, as dri-fit fabrics simply hold odor based on design, it seems. There is yet to be a sport detergent that can slay this stinky dragon.Big ups to my reviewing compadre, who noted I first tested this incorrectly. For those with HE washers, don't be like me. READ the instructions. Add this to the tub versus detergent tray up top. This discrepancy makes a world of difference in outcome. There were some stray non-dissolved beads left behind (after the wash), but nothing troublesome and apt to be victims of next wash.All in all...Downy Fresh Protect does what it advertises. It provides a powerful, 'fresh' scent supplement to clothes...if you want that sort of thing. Linens and towels a nice addition, not so much on regular and dri-fit clothing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4G8H48CDJ44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMWO66#wasThisHelpful","R2F4G8H48CDJ44","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess: I'm a big Contigo fan. I've got countless numbers of their water bottles, as this a company with a healthy obsession for creating the perfect water bottle.Don't get me wrong: I love Contigo's Autoseal Fit Trainer. Its steel casing avoids the dense, cheap feel of counterparts, its weight more natural than very heavy Contigo glass counterparts. This bottle feels like I'm holding and drinking from an actual water bottle. The Autoseal Fit Trainer also features a terrific double seal, a wonderful way to ensure water doesn't leak from bumpy hikes and/or workout use. Finally - and a personal preference: steel tastes better than glass...let alone plastic Contigo PVC bottles. Steel is clearly the way to go.Where the Autoseal Fit Trainer hiccups is its seal. Specifically, its plastic top on steel bottom doesn't perfectly mesh. Threads don't line up well, with it my suspicion  this deadly duo a poor fit over time. Meaning, I would suspect the top seal to degrade over continuous use and washing machine clean. I'm hoping I'm wrong, or risk a very wet gym bag and boxing equipment.All in all, the Contigo Autoseal Fit Trainer tastes much better than PVC free plastic, slightly better than glass...at a significantly less weight. It traps water well, is clearly to quality. The only question mark resides in longer term seal properties. At $20, it's well worth the risk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8W43V6FOMZBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNXD1A#wasThisHelpful","R8W43V6FOMZBQ","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow; what a pleasant surprise! This Sterling Silver White Crescent Moon with Swarovski Elements Pendant Necklace is of surprisingly higher quality, sports a nice grade chain, good craftsmanship on the textured moon, and crystal placement that looks meticulous (versus the frequent Swarovksi 'shoved in there' look).For those considering gifting, this necklace is light but certainly not cheap weight, and small enough to be noticed...but not tacky. Related - and as with every Amazon Collection piece of jewelry - gift packaging is terrific in a double blue clam shell box. Thus, no need to pay extra for gift wrap option!I have to be honest: I didn't expect much of this necklace for less than $50...but it's an absolute winner.

"It's hard to truly critique something when there's no alternative.Akin to many fitness kickboxing gyms, mine sports wooden floors...making shoes a necessity. Even as a veteran Muay Thai kickboxer, my puppies can't take the pounding from the jumping these classes require.Nearly every athletic shoe on the market, however does not flex enough to allow posting on the ball of the foot and/or provide significant padding for poorly placed banana bags.The FightPro check both boxes...but at a literal and build quality cost. First things first: these are not cheap. But when there's nothing else out there...be grateful they exist. I almost want to buy 3 pairs to ensure Ringstar stays in business and/or prepare if they shut down.On fit: these are meant to be tight...and stretch after 2 weeks. Do NOT buy bigger sizes. It's dangerous when doing sparring and/or movements requiring good foot feel. I called the company - who was very responsive - and advised to wait it out. After 4 days of use, they fit like a glove. Speaking of said customer service, they remain awesome. Very responsive to emails...and stand by their products 100 percent.The padding at foot instep is OUTSTANDING, essential as this is where the majority of kicking injuries occur. Even after 6 months, the padding is holding up nicely.What is not holding up well are the ultra thin foam bottoms. I understand these meant for mats where friction isn't as prevalent. Wood, however, eats right through them. Almost immediately I required a pair of insoles to compensate for the reduced padding also complete absence of arch.After 6+ months of 3x a week use, these look like they've been through a war. Bottoms are thin and dirty, tongue area stripped away. Still, they do what they need to do...and keep your feet protected...and properly air out during and after use. I likewise bought a pair for the better half-slash-training partner for this reason, and will continue to do so when these eat away.Sure I wish Ringstar would improve its build quality, but I'm grateful these shoes exist. Just buy them noting limitations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FQVAN1A9WM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YC9GYU#wasThisHelpful","R30FQVAN1A9WM3","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Saturday morning I thought it a good idea to test my non existent Brazilian Jiu Jitsu skills via a robust MMA sparring session. One hyperextended elbow later, it was clear who won.This defeat became even more apparent as the elbow worsened, regularly keeping me up at night. Not one to stop exercising while it heals, that's when BracePal came to the party.In all fairness - and first things first - BracePal is darn affordable for a compression elbow sleeve. Almost half the price of brand name competitors. Thus, this review duly notes this fiscal reality.Performance-wise...pretty solid. Don't expect it to line up perfectly with your elbow (in the lighter area), and I would recommend the graphics side on forearm versus biceps or the decal will peel off. I expect these same letters - much like McDavid stuff - to disappear via repeated washes. Not a dealbreaker for me...but maybe for brand conscious.BracePal does not breathe that well...more on the retain heat versus pull moisture compression material type. Thus, while it will keeps the area warm and protected, it will stay sweaty after workout. Again, depends on what you're using the brace for = train through workouts versus recover AFTER them.In sum, I consider this a good brace at an equal price. I'm not certain what leaps in quality I'd get at higher price points...and I dig the low profile (meaning I can still train without bulk).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEK5HUIUP4DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROM6NZI#wasThisHelpful","R3PEK5HUIUP4DW","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With my existing living room ceiling fan doing its best Studio 54, strobe light impression when attempting to turn it off...it was time for an upgrade. Old blinky was a big box purchase, meaning it cheaper (said manufacturer) to swap out versus replace/repair a wonky LED and/or remote.I'm not the savviest of ceiling installers, so I left the swap out to a professional. I was amazed at how many pieces this fan has...specifically, that every part needed to be assembled on to one another. Every screw, bracket, housing, you name it. Occasionally dropped parts danced down the step up ladder like rhythmic raindrops. The one big bright side...is this longer assembly allows selection of blade color. The big downside? Forget adding a remote after assembly. That means disassembling almost the entire thing to make it happen. Ignorant on such things - and not reading the fine print - I had no idea my wall remote would now become useless.Once installed, however, this thing is a beaut'. Silent as all get up, outstanding air moving performance, good room filling light from two energy efficient bulbs. A couple of pull chain extensions...and no longer a need for a remote.Speaking of reading said fine print: this is ceiling flush...thus no room for manipulation. Caveat emptor for lower ceilings. I think I dodged a bullet as a few more feet and this in an instrument of terror.All in all, it's clear why this fan is so much more expensive than big box, pre-assembled cheapies. It looks, functions, and feels (down to the pull chains) better than cheaper counterparts.

"In all fairness to BrightHouse, they're not bankrupting me by any means at $4/month for existing cable modem. With this being said, I'm a big fan of less is more when it comes to renting equipment. Thus, took the plunge at the Gold Box price of $45.Modem arrived nicely packaged and looking quite new. It comes with an Ethernet cable should you need it (to connect to a device or wireless router).For customers experiencing connectivity issues...make sure to call your provider (with the device already hooked up) to 'provision your new modem' (swap out modems for your account). It took about 5-10 minutes to do so (via BrightHouse), and they were able to ping and test remotely. You will not get Internet access, period, until they do this. From that point forward, zero issues and I'm going on a week's use. Obviously mileage will differ based on provider.Also and while I'm no cable modem genius, I'm surprised that some couldn't get their modem properly provisioned due to being tethered to another user. This extreme anomaly means the modem originated literally in the old purchaser's exact market...and remained there for the new one...and the same provider.Also - and technically speaking - the cable provider should be able to re-provision any device, regardless of history, if DOCSIS compatible. Thus - and before you return it for wonky use - ask for a higher tier tech to provision the new modem to your account, remove the previous.Finally - and if you're a streaming king/queen - while DOCSIS 3.0...this model (SB6121) only allows for downloads speed up to 172mpbs. The supplied one via my cable company (SB6141) allows for twice that.

"First things first: if you're buying this for a Star Wars fan, s/he is sure to want this regardless of cost. For these folks, consider an extra star.With this being said, keep in mind you're paying about $15 extra (versus comparables in quality) for said license and not much else.Worth noting - and forgotten in the description - is that the comforter is reversible; a cool feature if you want to match different sheet colors.Artwork on both sides plus pillowcase, however, is no where near as sharp as it looks on  the product page. One reviewer described these designs as 'rushed'...and I would agree. They have a cheap, sloppy sketch look to them, one that detracts from the overall presentation. Jay Franco and Sons probably would've done better with going full cartoon look. The pillowcase, in particular (of an x-wing fighter) is sad, visually.Also, the product description declares this microfiber...but it certainly isn't. (Looks like they carried over the description from Classic to Comforter and Sham set.) This is the standard polyester blanket you'll see at a Target or Walmart.

"How I love Irish Spring soap bars. A terrific scent, strong but not harsh chemically, also an ability to withstand multiple uses without cracking apart.Perhaps knowing this, Irish Spring bars keep getting smaller over time to compensate for their value. Tsk tsk.Enter the Irish Spring Signature Hydrating Bar Soap. Yes, it's twice the price of traditional bars...but it's money well spent.Visually, each Signature bar is almost 4x the size of traditional ones, pack an equal winning scent, also a higher class bar texture well beyond its price point. I also dig the individual plastic wrapping for each bar to maintain shape. Classy!Functionally and thanks to shea butter, Irish Spring Signature Hydrating Bar Soap produces a thick and hydrating lather that gently emerges from said bar. (This is a long ways away from the soapy drip of traditional Irish Spring bar soap.) A more consistent lather equates to easier cleaning in crevices and feet.

"Apparently some things don't translate well...and such is the case for Fiber One cereal versus Streusel Bars. I had high hopes for these seemingly tasty and functional bars, only to find them falling woefully short versus much less expensive, generic counterparts.To explain, Fiber One Streusel parts don't taste very Streusel-like. They're far too firm for something designed to possess a cake texture. A similar faux pas to less than expected strawberry flavor. In comparison - and while the generics aren't winning food show awards - both the CVS and Walmart branded fiber fruit bars arguably taste better than Fiber One Streusel. Surprising, to say the least.Nutritionally speaking, Fiber One Streusel again falls short. To explain - and as a comparison point: there's more calories, significantly more saturated fat, and higher amounts of cholesterol in Fiber One Streusel than Walmart's Great Value Chewy Fiber offering. Most importantly, Fiber One Streusel Bars clock in an astonishingly low 20 versus 35 percent of daily fiber in comparison to Great Value. Let alone its absence of any nutritional value other than iron (which, again, Great Value equals).This is anything but an advertisement for Great Value, rather a warning to look beyond branding to side of a box. Save your money...and go for the generics instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12UZF5KIZYUA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRFKUYY#wasThisHelpful","R12UZF5KIZYUA1","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess: the back hair - while minimal - was getting to me. Tank tops became a no-no because of the constant fear of hair peeking out. Truth be told, I tried to address this issue with a regular razor (egads, the burns!!!) and an older Panasonic body trimmer (about 4 years ago, oodles of irritation).Begrdugingly, I purchase the Philips Norelco BG2038/41, and hoped for the best.Wow, this exceeded expectations. Build quality is exceptional (nice weight), also groove (that fits wonderfully in my hand). The charger station is effective without being obnoxiously large. Time to put it to use.Even with the included back extension, it was still a bit awkward to shave that area...especially lower back...and it was anything but a perfect shave. Still, it got what it needed to do, and left zero irritation. Note I did NOT use any of the three included filters. Tanks tops audibly celebrated their release from shackles.Feeling confident, I ventured on to the chest area. It was like shearing sheep...and within minutes, smooth as can be. Sensitive areas around chest center cleaned up easily. Again, no irritation to speak...also not perfect but darn close.Finally, I went for broke down 'there.' With careful strokes, everything cleaned up surprisingly easily, on par with using a blade...but oh-so-less scary. Hair around there - like chest and back - came off easily.Rinsing was easy, albeit drips a bit post rinse out of the blade area. Nothing too bad, however.The ultimate test: the better half - who thinks dudes should have hair, that it wasn't an issue - was impressed with the results. Especially chest and upper back where muscle definition is now visible.All in all, this is a great product that - even if for one area of shaving - is a solid purchase, one much safer than a standard blade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G412OM7TBQE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VB50LU#wasThisHelpful","R2G412OM7TBQE6","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there's a whole lot of terrific gloves out there, I doubt there many who care this much about their customers.To explain, I purchased two small size pairs (hey, I have little hands!) for my wife and I for sports performance cross-training. These gloves fit fantastic, and withstand kettle bells, pushups on turf and outside (on concrete), pull ups, squats w/ weights/bench press, etc. They breathe well, clean and dry easily.Still, one day the Velcro on my right hand glove started giving way. The seam attached to the glove started losing its string...a telltale sign of these becoming useless in a couple weeks once this inevitably spreads. Unfortunately, I was past the Amazon return date, and frustrated to know nearly $30 gloves were going to die a quick and painful Velcro death.As last ditch effort, I emailed the company (Brian), and conveyed my problem. I was ready to purchase another glove versus eat the $30. In less than 24 hours, I had a return phone call...and two emails...with an apology for my problems...an finally a tracking number for a free replacement pair. Two days later, it was sitting on my doorstep.Thus, if you're considering a good workout glove, B Nooch is a great choice for what happens AFTER purchase.

"As yet another reviewer with seborrheic dermatitis - the kind that leaves scalp red, semi-oily, sore - I'm constantly on  the lookout for products that can provide relief. Most provide a temporary fix, only to have the scalp return to its suffering state a couple hours later.Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care w/ Eucalyptus is yet another good...but not earth shattering product for seborrheic dermatitis sufferers. It cleans nicely, has a pleasant scent, and rinses easily. Still - and like competitors- it doesn't retain its effect for very long. By competitors, I'm referring to tea tree oil based, tar variety, zinc, etc.In all fairness, however, I can't gauge its benefit specifically for itchy scalp and/or excessive flaking.

"As someone with IBD...let alone lactase deficient...getting a proper daily, dairy free dose of vitamins and minerals is akin to climbing the powdered Everest.Vega One's All-in-One Nutritional Vanilla Chai Shake is my nutritional sherpa. The vanilla chai flavor blows away Vega One's chocolate protein  offering both in taste and ability to blend in almond milk or water. I actually enjoyed this shake's very pleasant aftertaste, and nary a disgusting powder clump left in consumption wake.Assuming your body properly absorbs the nutrients, this shake is nearly half a daily requirement of all the heavy vitamins/minerals hitters. Thus, Vega One's All-in-One Nutritional Vanilla Chai Shake is a rock star in being safe for the dairy sensitive while remaining nutritionally potent. Let alone the awesome protein and fiber, one-two punch!Unfortunately, however, this comes at a literal price. At nearly $3 a serving (for the small tub), this is a semi-shocking price point. I'm not saying it isn't worth the price of admission, but I would expect significant discounts at larger sizes. Which there isn't.Also, Vega One's claim of this being a meal replacement is a bit off. Unless you're packing 100-200 more calories via milk/ingredients to buoy the shake, 170 calories won't go very far. Thus, I would consider this a good morning or midday boost...but not breakfast/lunch, by any means.Still, this is a product I would watch very closely. If/when a price drop occurs, Vega One's All-in-One Nutritional Vanilla Chai Shake should be a daily nutrition staple for anyone looking for a top notch powder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12UEIE3P35BFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y13K0#wasThisHelpful","R12UEIE3P35BFX","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks, Hoover!; cutting the cord to floor cleaners is such a terrific and long overdue idea. I couldn't believe how such a simple but important feature makes cleaning THAT much easier. The FloorMate's easy-to-read charge indicator is an obvious reminder on when it's time to remove the battery to its base. Speaking of said lithium battery, it's surprisingly big (which is a good thing = long charge times), likewise a snap to insert into its compartment on both the FloorMate and charging station. Good stuff here. Additional lagniappe lies in discovering this battery universal across Hoover's rechargeable line of products.Similar kudos for an upright dirty water tank as easy to remove as its cleaner counterpart. In contrast to a very good Bissell carpet cleaner, the Hoover Floormate doesn't mandate manipulating the cleaner base for access to the dirty water tank. No more disgusting interactions with the scrub brushes, nor water drips from tank removal at unit base. Well done here.The most important part: I couldn't believe how much gunk came off of a professionally cleaned floor only 4 days after said cleaning. The FloorMate was an equal champ on both hardwoods and tiles, and covered a solid room and kitchen using only one capful of cleaner. Meaning, the FloorMate is thankfully efficient on the not-so-cheap cleaning solution (of which it comes with one, by the way). If there's a criticism to be made, there can be some occasional water pooling during use. Running the FloorMate backwards one more time over these offending areas (on 'wet and dry'), however, almost always remedied.Finally, assembly and build quality lead to me believe the FloorMate is in it for the long haul. It's easy to put together, move around (even for smaller peeps among us), and stores very well due to foldable handle. Gaskets (on tanks, attaching to the unit) appears up to the challenge of longer term use. For those with hardwoods, this truly is a wonderful all-around unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NF1L1AJAMFVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU3JG#wasThisHelpful","R1NF1L1AJAMFVL","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using a fairly reliable Panasonic Wet/Dry trimmer for years, I was curious what newer (non-cylinder) technology yields. Specifically, if it would cut down on tugging, plus offer better precision.All in all...almost no noticeable difference. It's a little more gentle than the cylinder version, but it comes at a functional price (of being less accurate). The eyebrow trim combs are a nice addition, and do an above average (but not great) job of evening eyebrows. Worth noting, however, I'm not a bushy eyebrow kinda' guy to begin with.The Philips Norelco NT3555/60 likewise struggled in trimming external, shorter ear hairs. I remain hopeful of an alternate to facial razors for these stubborn but small eyesores. Ear and nose trimmers - cylinder or not - don't seem up to the challenge.Finally, the twist on power is no doubt a product of wanting to seal from water (being washable). Still, this seems awkward (versus a normal power switch), and is apt for trouble if turned too far right (that opens up the battery compartment).In sum, it's hard to argue against the Philips Norelco NT3555/60. Good price, great warranty, and decent build quality. Albeit not much different than competing Panasonic products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R147E48UAD1K32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSK9E#wasThisHelpful","R147E48UAD1K32","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, it takes a mild sacrifice in power due to smaller footprint, but conquers everything in its path with little hiccup. Commercial, heavy duty staplers are far too big for limited home use.

"Simply put: there's a seemingly endless amounts of daily cleansers and exfoliators on the market. The Bjore Pore Penetrating Charcoal Bar is a welcome addition to this fray, albeit doesn't add anything you can't already find among competing products.To explain: Selecting a cleanser or exfoliator is normally a question of skin sensitivity and/or pH (dry versus oily), combined with amount of tolerance for chemical versus natural ingredients. The Bjore Penetrating Charcoal Bar is somewhere in the middle of the pack, in containing natural ingredients, and gentle enough not to irritate. It's scent is almost non-existent (a good thing), and lathers like a champ (meaning, longer life).Still - and while this bar does a good job cleaning facial oils and makeup - it doesn't provide promised exfoliation (among nasal and facial pores), and dries skin out considerably. It's that frustrating kind of dry, where minutes later oils rush back to compensate for excess dryness. Meaning, more harm than good.Thus, I would consider the Bjore Pore Penetrating Charcoal Bar a complimentary product to more aggressive exfoliators, and a good way to start a day and/or remove makeup at its conclusion. A good comparison would be Neutrogena's facial bar...with the Bjore version a bit harder working versus moisturizing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4J33MPZ17MT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6IHQOK#wasThisHelpful","R1I4J33MPZ17MT","A2JSKM60VTCNI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JSKM60VTCNI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is all personal experience.There are a few passages that aren't as relevant and several broken links to products/services that no longer exist, but that can be expected, and hopefully Chris will keep the book up to date with good information as time goes by.All in all, a solid reference for any aspiring author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q825EWZTH4V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8V17QA#wasThisHelpful","R2Q825EWZTH4V5","A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story starts present day and then gradually climbs its way to the future, and for a good chunk of the novel it is difficult to tell that it is meant to be science fiction. The characters are interesting, and we see a sort of blossoming romance caught up in the throes of youth, and it ends tragically, but this is actually before the real story takes place.I don't want to give anything away, but this is a very spiritual story with a deep rooted view of the galaxy and history that is very intriguing.  It has a powerful and meaningful ending that will leave the reader with a lot of personal questions, even if the story itself is coming to a close.Highly recommended for anyone interested in good science fiction with a spiritual message.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBMDPSQ1LNTBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143CVMZC#wasThisHelpful","RBMDPSQ1LNTBS","A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story creates a future london that feels very similar to the present day world we all live in, but it has enough Novums to keep the flow moving forward and the story feeling unique and different.I'm a sucker for stories told from the perspective of journalists or news agents or anything of that sort, so this story really intrigued me in the ability to nail down a style.  The author says she drew heavily from referential material in creating this story and it shows because of how well developed the situations and storylines are.I like when stories can be sci fi and futuristic while still holding onto those aspects that make it human, and for that reason I would highly recommend this story to anyone interested in a great read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217VONVYNXS39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW8IQXG#wasThisHelpful","R217VONVYNXS39","A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This project was started as a black history workshop, and most of the voices contained herein are real, unpolished or practiced. That's what makes all of these poems so meaningful, because it feels like the words come from the heart rather than a script.Each of the students has a different and unique style. There are a few poems that really stand out, like It is Hard to Be, because of how well they handle repetition and the level of meaning they convey. When I am reading these poems I can truly feel the emotions being poured out, and it's as though I can hear the authors speaking directly.I think my only complaint with the project is the number, because there aren't that many poems, and different authors have different numbers of works enclosed. But, what it lacks in quantity it more than makes up for in quality.This is well worth a read by anyone interested in poetry, and since this is a first release by these students, we might see more from them, or the group from Kingston that put this book together, in the future.  I highly recommend checking it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENMCLYYTNJVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508793921#wasThisHelpful","R3ENMCLYYTNJVJ","A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a family dog named Arkantos who has been with us through many years.  He came with a fellow litter mate named Mephistopheles (who simply became Muffy-toes after a few months) who died from a spinal problem that paralyzed him.  After Muffy died, we got a few more puppies, but by then Arky was starting to get on in years.And, as time went on, he went from being a playful and exuberant dog to more tired and unhappy as his hips and bones started to hurt.  We tried a lot of different things to make him feel better, but nothing really worked.Until we tried this.  It worked really well after we started using it for a while, and I have to say I'm more than a little impressed by it.  He doesn't necessarily hate the taste, but he doesn't like it either, so we started mixing it into his food (which is what the company recommends anyway).  There wasn't a lot of improvement right away, but after a few days we started noticing it help.We also bought aspirin from this company, which worked very well for him.  The only family that doesn't like this is our new kitten, who is being chased and annoyed incessantly by our old dog now that he is feeling better!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IR1EN4M5GIGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBJIKCU#wasThisHelpful","R2IR1EN4M5GIGT","A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A debut novella from an up and coming author, the story contained in these pages is vivid and brilliant.  When it opens, we have no idea what to expect, and we are quickly thrust into a scenario revolving around first contact.But it isn't first contact the way we are used to. Instead, this is a much deeper and more human look about the possibility of beings living amongst us.  There are many twists along the way that draw us deeper into the story and ask more of us as readers.I don't want to spoil anything, but I can say that the tone of the novel, the plot twists, and the themes are all on point.  There is a love story hidden between the lines that will drag you in and refuse to let you leave.  At the end of the novel, you'll feel hopeful for a possible future of humanity that is brilliant and life-affirming.  Once you pick this book up, you won't be able to put it down until you finish, so hopefully there is more to the story coming in a later work.Keep an eye on this author as more works are released, because the depth and breadth of her work will surely astound and delight you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9JJD5U6MFUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRSDEE4#wasThisHelpful","R3C9JJD5U6MFUM","A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ISQ4BFCCGKVY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you know what to expect, then this is a decent product.  If you don't, then this will be a let down.It is mid-range quality production, fairly good acting, and a decent story.  If you come into this expecting a 'B' film, then you will be pleasantly surprised with how much effort and care went into creating this story.  If you come into it expecting to be blown away by amazing CGI then you're going to be disappointed.Here's the thing: if you are a halo fan who thinks Halo is the greatest story ever, go back and play the games.  I can guarantee you after the nostalgia wears off you won't be of the same opinion.  You'll still think it is amazing, especially for when it was released, but it won't knock your socks of.  For that matter, go watch Lord of the Rings again, and this time judge the pacing and story without the 'new movie' blinders.  The thing is, this story IS a halo story, and its a fairly good one all things considered. With what they had to work with, I'm impressed they were able to do this good of a job (compared to most internet movies right now).So give it a watch but keep in mind it's a solid 'B' movie.

But did it make me whole again? Eh. A bit.Louisa has spent the year since Will barely living. She's still sad, she's still not speaking to her mother, she's working the odd bartending job, and she hasn't put Will's money to use.Out of the blue Louisa gets a visitor and she feels like she has a purpose again. Most of the book is Louisa and this person's relationship. But it's got Louisa back in London, talking to the family, and going to group therapy.But what happens when that purpose is fulfilled? Louisa finally gets a perfect opportunity abroad but is she healed enough and brave enough to take it? It takes her awhile to get there and I thought her journey was realistic and in the end it made me smile. I also liked how we got a glimpse of how well everyone is moving on.

"**I received an ARC through Netgalley courtesy of the publisher in exchange for an honest review.**Bravo. What a great follow up to Virgin. I loved it even more. I have so many highlights from all the laughing I did. Here are some of my faves:I felt his p***s harden against my v****a. It rubbed against it and I moaned in pleasure. ""Ow,"" he cried out. ""What?"" I asked in surprise. ""Nothing, just a bit spiky,"" he said, and carried on kissing me. ""Sorry?"" I said in a strangled voice. He thought my pubes were spiky. They hurt his p***s. My mother****ing pubes were ruining my life yet again.It reminded me of the excruciating agony of getting a full Brazilian wax. Thank God I had eschewed those p*rn-originated pubic styles in favor of my trimmed, spiky little hedgehog. I gazed at it fondly and gave it a small stroke. Eight fifteen wasn't too late. I definitely had time for a quick wank.""Is it okay?"" I asked uncertainly. I was doing the Pilates table pose above him. My head was hovering by his p***s and my entire nether regions were inches away from his mouth - and his nose. Oh God, his nose. He would be able to smell everything and I'd pooed just before our date. I started to wonder if this was a good idea.It was kind of nice to be home alone. It was fun spending time with Nick, but I still didn't feel like I could a hundred percent be myself in front of him. I hadn't farted in days.Now that Ellie has lost her V card, she thought that would be just the beginning to having an enviable sex life. But she's still plagued with insecurities and men are not beating down her door. So she tries Internet dating sites and we're treated with the hilarity of those disasters.While Ellie and her girlfriends are out being fabulous, Ellie meets Nick. He's a fit banker and he's easy to talk to. But he's still kind of obsessed with his ex. Ellie doesn't make this a problem though, she sees Nick as the perfect guy to have casual sex with. She's sworn not to get attached too soon like she did with her first. Ellie and Nick's sex life is very ""real life."" That's what I loved so much about this book. All of Ellie's ramblings in her head have gone through ours as well at some point. Ellie makes her fair share of mistakes but I absolutely loved her transformation.This book is not about finding The One, it's about finding The O, loving yourself and all of your flaws, friendship, and empowerment.

"Breaking Him is a tale of childhood friendship that turns into teenaged lust then love that grows into something indescribable and permanent then some mysterious circumstance ruined everything and turned that love into bitter hatred. But that permanence is still there keeping the two entwined forever.Scarlett had a very sad beginning to her life. It continued through school, she was constantly bullied even by adults. The only good thing in her life was her friend Dante and his grandma. Even though he was wealthy he was sensitive. He didn't like the injustice. He always stood up for Scarlett even though she could hold her own. She was a scrapper, never afraid to defend herself.Now as an adult she's a flight attendant and a not-so-successful actress. I liked how Lilley brought us back to the sky. But Scarlett is a prickly b**ch. She doesn't have many friends, she doesn't trust easily since the only friend she had betrayed her. She's all attitude. And Dante loves to antagonize her. But this time he's come to bring bad news.This story alternates between the past and present leading us to the point where it all went wrong. Too Bad! You're not finding out in this book. By the end you'll have your theories but nothing is confirmed. A monster of a cliffhanger.This story was a bit hard to get into. Scarlett's bitterness was almost a turnoff but she finally started to soften a little and by then I couldn't put it down.Dante and Scarlett remind me a little of Caleb and Olivia from Tarryn Fisher's The Opportunist. Complete with all the angst. So if that's your thing you'll love this. I most certainly did. I'm looking forward to Breaking Her.

"**I received an ARC courtesy of the author in exchange for an honest review.**Wow. What an amazing read. What started out as pretty darn funny turned into a beautiful story with substance.Easie Reynolds is an out-of-work actress with a fiesty attitude.

It also didn't hurt that he was gorgeous and trying to be an actor himself.I liked the originality of this story. Easie and Anderson have an effortless chemistry. It was believable. I got it. They had great banter and they managed to make their ridiculous scenes smokin' hawt.But it turns out Anderson has some quirks of his own. And it really touched my heart.

He's a sure thing for the role of Damon in the highly anticipated book to movie adaptation of Sinners Like Us. Amelia is ready to shed her good girl image in the highly coveted role of Blair playing opposite Noah's Damon.After a very public and humiliating split years ago in their teens, Noah and Amelia are having a hard time letting go of their bitter hatred of one another, both for different reasons, in order to get along or at least fake it for the sake of the movie.Childstar 1 is the first of a three part serial.

The colleague also happens to be dating one of Lexa's bosses, Jameson. Jameson and Lexa get to know each other socially while commiserating over their shared betrayal.Since it's too late for Lexa to get any refunds for the wedding, she decides to still have it...without the groom. You go girl. And since her ex-fiancé threw it in her face that she's not adventurous in bed, she decides to spend her three week honeymoon in Jamaica with Jameson making all of her fantasies come true.But their intensity in the sheets turns into feelings that both of them are afraid to admit. How can things go back to normal?I also loved the side story involving Alex and how that played out. It was clever. My only complaint was it took to the sixty percent mark to get to the good stuff.

"Millie Cross met Logan ""High"" Judd when she was eighteen years old. It was love at first sight. They were gone for each other in a way the rest of us can only dream to be. They had three years of that before Millie broke it off out of the blue.Twenty years later, Millie has an awesome job, house, and wardrobe trying to find that perfection elsewhere because she'll never find it in another man. Hasn't even tried.From previous Chaos books we know High was the hardest brother to convince to go legit. After he lost Millie he liked living dangerously. And even though he later married, had two daughters, and got divorced he never filled that hole that Millie carved out in his heart.After a chance run-in, Millie is determined to get closure and explain to High what happened all those years ago and apologize once and for all. Here is where I was angry with High and disappointed in Chaos. I didn't understand all the hostility. The only thing Millie was guilty of was breaking up with her boyfriend...twenty years ago. High is still extremely bitter and his treatment of Millie was despicable. I also understand High's brothers having his back but they were one step away from offing the poor girl and that didn't feel like Chaos to me.BUT...I'm still giving five stars. KA put me through the ringer with this book. So many feels. Every other page had me crying. Especially when we found out the truth about the break up. And if a book can touch me in that way that's some excellent writing. Whether you like what the characters are doing or not.It's usually hard for me to buy when characters are still hung up on each other five, ten, twenty years later. I just can't wrap my head around how you couldn't move on. But KA did a great job making me feel High and Millie's once-in-a-lifetime connection and I was happy when they finally started to work it out. I also liked that KA didn't make it easy. Just because they were reunited didn't mean all the wounds were automatically healed.I liked getting more of the story of the early days of Chaos. And things are getting more and more heated with Valenzuela. I hope Hound gets his own book, lots of good stuff there I think. And as usual I love the inclusion of the previous couples and Elvira is a hoot.

"**I received an ARC courtesy of the author in exchange for an honest review.**It's no secret I wasn't a huge fan of Shrinking Violet but I got to know Navie enough that I knew I wanted to read her story. Love Hate Relationship wasn't overly original but it did have that certain Prince charm that keeps me reading her books.Navie is going on her first interview as an administrative assistant what she doesn't know is she's already been hired to be the personal assistant to author, Rowan Locklaine. He's demanding and grouchy and an arrogant philanderer. But Navie isn't a quitter and she gives as good as she gets.There's some serious tension and they both find the yelling and name-calling hot but there's also trust and friendship forming. And when the two finally get it on it's pretty explosive. But Rowan has unresolved issues with his brother and he's been hurt by a woman before.I love books with jealous exes and misunderstandings. I mostly loved how Prince made Rowan see what he was doing to his brother by Navie doing it to him. Prince even managed to pull a few tears from me near the end.

"**My review contains minor SPOILERS**Wow. First of all I have to say this sequel didn't go at all how I thought it would. Definitely a plus. It made the story unpredictable. Another surprise was Raze. Where did he come from?! He stole the show in my opinion. I don't know how Blake would have gotten out of her predicament without him and his story tugged on my heart strings.But, otherwise, I thought this follow-up was just okay. Blake and Madden had very little interaction. They were apart until the end. Which I didn't like at all. Transparent felt more like a second book than a final book. I'm a tad disappointed considering the long wait. *shrugs*","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38CYZXCCO8FI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VNYOQ6#wasThisHelpful","R38CYZXCCO8FI8","A31VVIXC2P84GG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31VVIXC2P84GG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Originally read December 2012**Reread October 2015*I am loving this series. The only thing that drives me nuts is that in this book and the 2nd book Evie doesn't give enough credit to the strength of the angels that love her. She's so hell bent on saving them that she goes off to fight on her own causing the angels to abandon a perfectly good plan and put themselves at even more risk to save her when she always ultimately gets captured.

"This book was completely unpredictable. Daisy and Ryke's story kept taking turns I didn't see coming. Some were pleasant surprises, some were meh.It's no secret Daisy isn't passionate about modeling anymore but she doesn't know how to stand up to her over-bearing mother. She's also having night terrors and as the youngest of the Calloway girls she's having trouble opening up to her sisters. One thing she can count on though is Ryke's unwavering friendship.I liked getting in Daisy's head. I felt for her because of all the pressure she was under, for feeling like the lesser sister, and for all of the bullying she put up with because of Lily's addiction. At times I thought she was a little too silly but I guess that comes with the age.Ryke has always been angry. Angry towards his father and now his mother. It was great finally getting his pov. He loves Daisy so much but he's fighting it for Lo's sake. He feels like the disposable one in the group, which broke my heart for him. I loved it when he and Lo finally cleared the air. It was hard to read but I think it was necessary. And when he finally claimed Daisy - Swoon!Lots of forward movement in the other couples stories as well. Some setbacks and some happy news. I still love the other couples more but this was another solid book from the Ritchies. Well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDI29P9C4W71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAXSEFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TDI29P9C4W71","A31VVIXC2P84GG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31VVIXC2P84GG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*2.5 stars****My review contains SPOILERS***Darn. Another overhyped book that I fell for. I was excited to read Lev but I was pretty disappointed.Mina has been homeless on the streets for seven years. On the brink of starvation, she enters a gentleman's club hoping to seduce a man out of some money. Instead she takes advantage of an opportunity to steal a wallet.Lev runs the club with his brother and catches Mina in the act. He takes pity on her and feeds her, lets her stay in his home, and gives her a job as a bartender. But don't go thinking he's completely altruistic - he wouldn't have done that if she were ugly.For the most part I liked Mina. She was grateful and upbeat. She was like a hurricane in Lev's life. She forced him out of his shell. I thought she was a little too bubbly, there were too many exclamation points when she spoke. She adapted too easily. And I was rolling my eyes when we learned why she was homeless. It was completely unnecessary.I liked Lev okay too. It's implied that he's autistic but it felt like he sometimes was and sometimes wasn't. Like Aurora never fully committed to giving him the characteristics. Sometimes he was a jealous, take-charge alpha male, sometimes he was a sweet boy that couldn't process his or others' feelings.There were A LOT of secondary characters. This book has been labeled a stand alone but it felt like I was missing something. Like I should have met these families before. And I didn't really like any of them. I know it sounds like I hated Lev but I didn't. It really was just okay. But I won't be continuing the series featuring the other characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G1FXSNCGQ0GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016GTW5M4#wasThisHelpful","R2G1FXSNCGQ0GJ","A31VVIXC2P84GG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31VVIXC2P84GG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ritchies knocked it out of the park with this one. Their best book so far hands down. I really love their writing style. The books are long but there aren't any boring parts. They give us lots of details and they take their time delivering the story.I've been dying to get to Kiss the Sky. I adore Rose and Connor and I was looking forward to getting in their heads. I love their smart banter and I liked the reality show plotline. Connor is so patient with Rose and his life is filled with pressures that he doesn't let his friends see. Rose is so hot-tempered and in control but she's finally able to let Connor see her vulnerability.There's some serious sexual tension in this book but once it happens it's explosive. It was completely satisfying.The ending had me in tears. I was a mess. Partly from Connor's emotional news and partly from his swoon-worthy gesture to Rose.Once again the Ritchies don't just give us the main couple, we get the whole family. Just fantastic story-telling. I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y4ISLKH6KTTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZVPHGE#wasThisHelpful","R2Y4ISLKH6KTTU","A31VVIXC2P84GG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31VVIXC2P84GG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He needs learn how to live his life as a sober person. One thing we never doubt is whether Lo and Lily would function and heal better without the other. Their co-dependency has morphed into healthy support. I love them as a couple.I also liked how much all of the other characters we love played a part. Rose, Connor, Ryke, and Daisy all have their stories unfolding as well and I'm looking forward to diving into their books.The drama surrounding Lo and Lily's mysterious text messages threatening to out Lily's addiction came to a surprising conclusion.

"*4.5 stars*Another winner by Yarros. My only complaint was I found this book a bit hard to get into but once I learned Grayson's secret I couldn't put it down. I had to buckle up and hold on for the ride. What a brilliant story.Grayson has always been wound tight. He's closed off and has a one track mind - flying Apache helicopters. Even his good friends/roommates, Josh and Jagger, don't know anything about where he sneaks off to on the weekends.Sam is friends with Ember, Josh, and Jagger from when they lived in Colorado. She had some trouble in college so she transferred to Alabama and moved in with the guys. Her presence is seriously affecting stone cold Grayson.Mistakes of their past are still affecting their present and the foreseeable future. I felt for Grayson, he really was stuck between a rock and a hard place but I also understood Sam's decisions. She really had no other choices.Just when you think all of the secrets are out they just keep coming.I loved it.

She also comes from a long line of mistresses so she desperately wants to buy the shop on her own.

I'm also wondering if Hennessy is the only cop in New Orleans because he seems to take the fact that these guys take the law into their own hands with a grain of salt. It was odd. Not sure if I want to read his book or not. And when we finally learn what, in fact, is beneath these scars it was more of a sizzle than a boom.

"Thank you. Finally. This is the first book I've read that doesn't romanticize sex addiction. So many authors' idea of a sex addict is really just a manwhore. When he is all of a sudden able to control himself when he meets The One and wait for her to be ready means he is NOT a sex addict. The Ritchies show us the ugly truth. And I think because the sex addict was a woman made it even more uncomfortable. There were plenty of times I was judgy, where I was tsking Lily for not having more respect for herself. But that's the reality. And that's what kept me engrossed in the story.Lily gets a high from orgasms. She has to have them when the mood strikes - sometimes alone, a lot of times with random men. And when she comes down it's the same as any other addiction - she feels shame, she's remorseful, she lies to her family, but then she's looking for her next fix. She also has an enabler. Lo has been her best friend for years. He helps Lily keep her secret and tries to keep her safe.But Lily also enables Lo with his alcoholism. She makes sure he doesn't drive and she sobers him up for family functions. They've relied on each other for so long things will only get better when they decide to take their relationship to the next level, right?I really enjoyed this story. I thought the ending was great.

"This book started out well enough. Iris packed up her life in Florida and moved in with her older half-brother, Sonny. He also got her a job at a tattoo shop owned by Dex Locke. Dex is hot, of course, but he's an A-hole. Iris starts to get on with her life but her and Sonny's father gets into trouble that also affects their life. That's pretty much the whole story but stretched out over many, many pages.It wasn't all boring though. The sexual tension kept me turning the page and when it finally happened it was pretty hot.

"Grayson and Kira had similar upbringings - they were both raised in a life of privilege. Kira was a pawn for her political father and Grayson, the product of an affair, was ignored and made to feel worthless. Their differences, however, is their outlook on life. Kira is upbeat and quirky with a generous heart but Grayson is angry and mistrustful.I liked the plot. As soon as Kira made her proposition I knew this was going to be good. Sheridan excels at writing a sweet, tortured man - Grayson was just slower to show us sweet. I thought the dragon and witch endearments were a little much but overall Grayson's Vow was another winner. It made me tear up as much as it made me smile.

"*2.5 stars*I liked the idea of a female bounty hunter but Grace drove me nuts. It's like she was guilty of doing everything a man would tick off as reasons a woman shouldn't be in the business.After five years of proving herself, Grace is finally given a big case - bringing in Raide Knox. He's wanted for his sister's murder and he's skipped bail. But he's returned to his hometown to try and prove his innocence.Grace is going to get close to Raide by trying to seduce him. He's too big to try to overpower but she's stubborn and refuses help, help even male bounty hunters would ask for. And, of course, she has multiple chances to bring him in but she catches feelings.There are a lot of technical inaccuracies that were very distracting. I kept shouting, ""That wouldn't happen!"" But, like always, Jewel has that certain something that glues me to the pages and keeps me as a reader.

"I'm usually a fan of YA. Most YA authors do a great job building worlds and creating complex characters and storylines. But Until Friday Night was complete fluff. It felt like something a nine year old girl would describe as swoony and romantic. If I was the intended teenage audience I would be insulted. And this book was too short and too expensive for it to be anything but fantastic.I'm going to say it - I thought West was a p**sy. The way he dealt with his dad's situation was cowardly. He kept it from his friends like it was something to be ashamed of and he treated women like tissues to ease his pain. Oh brother.Maggie doesn't speak. She witnessed something horrific and she's now living with her aunt and uncle and cousin Brady. She's smitten with West immediately and I was rolling my eyes at her West-can-do-no-wrong worship. But West begins to confide in her and she has chosen him as the one she's ready to speak to.The only good thing I can say is I liked that Maggie was the reasonable one in the end and that she didn't end up knocked up like all of Glines' heroines do.If you're interested in reading something similar with more depth try The Sea of Tranquility by Katja Millay.

"This story started out great. Felicity's friends talk her into going to a Sugar Baby party. That's where wealthy men and women meet no-so-wealthy beautiful people and exchange companionship for gifts. But when Felicity gets there she's not into it and starts exploring the house. She meets Theo Darcy, owner of the house and CEO and owner of Darcy Entertainment Company. However, the party is hosted by his brother. Theo is smitten and so the chase begins.Now we enter Cheeseball City. Population two. There was nothing Felicity couldn't do. She could play the piano, compose music, dance ballet (and clog), act, show up bratty teenage girls, and chew out famous people. And every one of those scenes proving her talent was c.h.e.e.s.y.

It's been awhile since a book has made me laugh so hard - like the spit my drink out, tears in my eyes, I can't breathe kind of laughing. I loved everything about it.Sydney Porter has a huge chip on her shoulder but she gets to work out a lot of her frustration as Sunday Lane - gossiping, people bashing, radio personality and as DJ Sinister - DJ extraordinaire.Two years ago Sydney and Gray Peters - football QB and hot man on campus had one incredible night together but a misunderstanding makes them mortal enemies. Now that Sydney's little brother, Jack, is on the football team, Sydney is having more run ins with Gray. Let the games begin!The pranks were funny until they weren't. Germaine was excellent with the timing. She knew when we'd have enough and were ready for feelings to come into play. The characters were amazing. Even all of the secondary ones.

"I was excited we were getting a Shepley and America novella and it did not disappoint.We get to see how they first met but the majority of the story is present day. America definitely wears the pants in the relationship but she's starting to feel like a tyrant and Shepley feels like a doormat. They're both working on it but Shepley is also desperate to marry America and she's in no hurry. This is putting a strain on the relationship, especially since Travis and Abby are flaunting their wedded bliss. I loved how much Travis and Abby were in this novella.

Felicity had quite a few TSTL moments, she just wanted to bury her head in the sand. Aspen confounded me, I didn't know which way was up with her.

"If Thicker Than Blood hadn't ended the way it did I might have liked this story better. We learn all of E's background, who he lost and how. But it never really endeared me to him. He's still just an angry bully throughout this book. He only cared about what he wanted - to hell with everyone else. Some may say Autumn healed him but she was just something else he wanted to keep for himself and would do anything to make it so. He just happened to treat her with more tenderness than anyone else.*** SPOILERS! *** SPOILERS! *** SPOILERS! ***I really hate that E never paid for what he did to Evelyn and Alex.

"At first I was skeptical about reading Sydney's story. I stuck him in the friend zone of book boyfriends so I wasn't sure if reading his sex scenes was going to be like reading your little brother's. Awkward.But no. I thought Reyes did a great job balancing ""nice guy"" Sydney that we all know and love with ""grown up"" Sydney - a confident, successful man that knows what he wants.The story begins with twenty-nine year old Sydney attending the wake of a good friend (not a major character) and here, after an embarrassing first meeting, runs into twenty year old Emilia, Olivia's sister. The two have an obvious attraction but Sydney is leery of the age difference but that doesn't stop them from being friends. They talk, they hang out, Emi cooks for him, and they see other people. Just when you think you're going to die from the jealousies and sexual tension, Reyes puts you out of your misery. Squee! But it doesn't last.I can't tell you how much I love  misunderstandings such as these. They're so delicious. But not only was Emi left in the dark, so were we. I couldn't put it down. I had to find out what was really going on. This book had all the feels - laughter, giddiness, anger, tears, and back again to happiness.I have to say job well done to Ms. Reyes for keeping these stories fresh a hundred books in.

There were a few scenes with the Hangmen, there was some external drama, and there was just enough setup for Cain's story but mainly this book just featured Maddie and Flame and how they healed each other.I liked the pacing. Maddie and Flame had a long road ahead of them before they were able to make love. Cole took her time getting them there.  She made me squee like a schoolgirl at the simple act of hand holding. It was very romantic.""So you may think you cannot be loved. But in my heart, in my healing soul, I am begging the question, how can you not? Because for me, you are truth. My truth. My heart, is all you.""Like the other books, there were some scenes that were hard to read. We learn everything we wanted to know about Flame's background. All of our questions were answered. We were even introduced to a new character. He made me smile. Also, as Flame's two closest brothers, we got to know AK and Viking better. Love them.My only criticism is that I thought Flame growled and roared a little too much. Ky is still my favorite Hangman!

"**My review contains mild spoilers**Not as much drama in Flame as there was in Spark. But I think that's because of Dakota. She's a cool girl. A laid back, go with the flow kind of girl. She's on a break from college, ready to hook up with her regular sex buddy, Rory.  Which she does.  She's a young girl looking for a good time, not ready to settle down yet.But she gets knocked on her a** when she meets hunky James Levi, Motocross champion, who's in Breckinridge for his cousin/best friend's wedding. Dakota is old friends with the bride so she and Levi get to know each other over the weekend.Levi isn't ready for it to end so he invites Dakota to join them on the bus for two weeks on their way to New Orleans. Dakota, being the spontaneous girl she is, agrees.They have a wild couple of weeks together where they become closer but what I loved most is that Dakota stuck to her guns. She wasn't willing to sacrifice her plans and dreams to follow Levi across the world. She was a great heroine.I wish there were more scenes with the Shevell family. I fell in love with them in Spark but don't worry Grams is still entertaining. Also, it felt like Gunner an Emilia already had this back story that I missed out on. Did I? If not, I hope Noelle writes a novella about them, especially featuring the you-know-what. *waggles eyebrows*I loved the epilogue. I'm looking forward to Denali's story.

"*3.5 stars*Lots of characters. Even more drama. It took me a bit to figure out who was who and what their story was so it was hard to get into. But once I got the names straight the story was actually pretty fascinating.Lane has come home after two years to divorce his manipulative, gold-digging wife and to win back the love of his life, Lizzie, the family's gardener. But he gets more than he bargained for when he also realizes the family's bourbon business is in trouble.The book also features povs from Lane's brother, Edward, and his sister, Ginny, who have equally tragic love lives.It read like a soap opera where even the ""good guys"" had their despicable moments. The Bradfords are one messed up family.

"I thought this was just going to be a simple male pov novella. I should have known better.This story is told from Jake's pov, yes, but it takes place a year after the epilogue from The Dark Light of Day. Jake's deeds from the epilogue have caught up with him and this is where we meet King. Jake reminisces certain scenes from the book but the one thing I really wanted to know during Jake and Abby's sharing game was who he was spending time with while they were apart. Especially since he insisted on knowing who she's been with.But in the grand scheme it didn't really matter. Kudos to Frazier for the creative way she put this novella together. Well done!**Dark Needs was loaned to me.**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RGXHBD85F1MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE2QQI0#wasThisHelpful","R2RGXHBD85F1MP","A31VVIXC2P84GG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31VVIXC2P84GG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received and email that was sent to me by mistake and when I contacted the sender he asked if I wanted to review this organic coconut oil in exchange for my review and I accepted. And I have to say that I do not like coconut but I love how coconut smells. So I kept some for myself to use and gave the rest to my Mom. She has been using it in just about everything from baking to adding a few drops to her favorite moisturizer. This is not a jar that I received, it was a 54 ounce jug and will last a long time.

"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads, so here is my review. This book started off HOT from the very first page and only got hotter from there and I though my kindle might catch fire. Heath Wild is not looking for a relationship. He doesn't have time for a clingy girlfriend. So when he was at a medical conference, he saw this girl and they seemed to want the same thing. And spending one night together was all each of them was after. Until he touched her. He could not get enough. But for Dr. Heath Wild, he didn't know what to do with the feelings, so he asked to she her for a second night. And when the weekend was over he had her phone number. Ally didn't do relationships either thanks to cheating boyfriends. But their was something about Heath and it scared her. She didn't think she could trust her feelings or maybe she couldn't trust him. What happens when they find out they live in the same city? Will they give the feelings they share a chance? I loved Logan's story but I have to say that I loved Heath even more. I wonder if each brother will make me love them more. At least there are only two more brothers to go. If you love a story that will have you laughing and crying, then you need to read this series because these Wild brothers will definitely have your heart racing.**Wicked Reads Review Team**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIXDQ658TRAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YLDEXO#wasThisHelpful","R1TIXDQ658TRAH","A1FJ6YD0TL90GN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FJ6YD0TL90GN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads, so here is my review. Paranormal stories are not my usual go to read but I do love a good Angel/Demon story. When this one came up on the list to read and I am so glad I read it. I loved everything about it. With Willa and Rax being from different realms and fighting each other, I hoped they would work things out to be together and that is what happened. They were drawn to each other and it is a great thing that they were. With Willa learning new things about herself and he future, can she trust Rax to be by her side through it all? Rax and Willa are to be mated and when that happened things will change for them both. Can you trust that D.H. Sidebottom will take you into the other realm as if you were there? YES she can. This is a first for me from D.H., not to say that I don't have other books from her, because I do and I need to read them too. I can't wait to see what she has in store for the rest of this series. So if you love a great paranormal story then you should grab this one and hang on, it is worth the ride into another world.**Wicked Reads Review Team**","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17COMSX4DTW6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OVNV8C#wasThisHelpful","R17COMSX4DTW6W","A1FJ6YD0TL90GN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FJ6YD0TL90GN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Rory Kavanagh is a retired MMA fighter, he was forced to retire after a really bad accident during a match. A year later the only thing helping with the pain in his leg is booze and pills.

"This is not your everyday tire gauge. It is not flimsy or cheaply made. It is sturdy, heavy-duty and fits nicely in my hand. It had a rubber cover that makes it comfortable while using it. The head will turn 360 degrees so you can use it in any position. There is a reset button on the neck of the gauge that will hold the last pressure you took or to rest it altogether. The dial is easy to read and goes up to 60 PSI, so if your tires are of a higher PSI then this one will not work for you. I have a digital gauge that I compared this one too and this one is easier to handle and read because if I am checking pressure in the sun, I can not read the digital one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REM0YM7ZP2IMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010A6B6KG#wasThisHelpful","REM0YM7ZP2IMG","A1FJ6YD0TL90GN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FJ6YD0TL90GN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But with her by his side for the last three years, Gideon has come to realize that he has fallen in love with her. Back in October when he mentioned them being more than friends, she ran and after a month she came back with the intention of leaving and doing her own thing. Which is being a fashion designer, something she has been working on lately. Gideon doesn't mention more with her for fear of he leaving him for good. Which he would not survive. So now they are in Vegas for Gideon to film a movie while she keeps him on track. When things get a little off track with the help of Gabe Harrison, Gideon's co-star, can Gideon make Red see the truth? And one wild night will lead to something Gideon wants more than anything but will Red feel the same way? And will per hast come back to haunt her? I have loved each of the brothers in this series and I hate to see it end. Maybe there will be one with all of the brothers to see what everyone is doing a few years down the road. And with Mrs. Kelly, mama bear of the Kelly brothers, it would be another great story from Crista McHugh.**Copy provided by the author in exchange for my honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R263T3ABH7J0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLNDHAC#wasThisHelpful","R263T3ABH7J0K","A1FJ6YD0TL90GN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FJ6YD0TL90GN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the way book two ended, I wondered how Rebel and Joe could ever be together, with others interfering and trying to keep them apart. I felt for Joe and wanted her to show her independence and that she would not be controlled all the time. Rebel was possessive and controlling and he needed Joe to help him change. Turns out they needed each other to make the relationship work. With Joe going to work for the company that Rebel works at, she wanted to show him she was moving on after she received those photos of him and Florence. You can try and guess who sent them but you might be wrong. Ransom wants to be friends with Joe but does he have other ideas? What will Florence do to try and win Rebel back? Will she finally understand that he never loved her and now he is with Joe? Will Joe finally realize that the feelings she has for Rebel is actually love? Can Rebel admit that he loves her too? This is an awesome story and I would recommend it to anyone. I hope you give it a change and love it as much as I do.**Copy provided by the author in exchange for my honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NRUDNN5TGFQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100RC2QC#wasThisHelpful","R3NRUDNN5TGFQE","A1FJ6YD0TL90GN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FJ6YD0TL90GN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title is a perfect description of this story, it is Dirty, Bad and Wrong. Please heed the warning if you are not sure you would like this story. There was one part of this story that I didn't like but that is my opinion and you should not let it change yours if you want to read it.**Warning - this novel contains graphic sex, and hardcore elements of BDSM. There are scenes of violence (consensual) as well as sexual practices some readers may find offensive. If you aren't turned on by dirty bad wrong sex then please walk on by. Thank you.***Now for my review: Lydia Has left her relationship with Stuart because he got drunk and slept with a co-worker that is now pregnant. Stuart can't believe he has done this and thinks the child may not be his. After that admission, why would Lydia stay with him. Turns out that the relationship has been on a downward spiral for a while now. Lydia realizes after she has left that she wants a change. She goes to work with her suitcase and she is early. While in the break-room, James Clarke CTO of the company, walks in and sees her crying. Funny that seeing a woman cry does things to him. After spending time on a friends couch, James suggest that Lydia move in with his friend Rebecca. While Rebecca in bi, this doesn't bother Lydia. When Rebecca takes Lydia to a BDSM club, Lydia sees Masque and wants him to hurt her. Will Rebecca give in and introduce her to Masque? Can Lydia really take the pain that Masque will put her through? Will James see that having a relationship with Lydia will not break him but loosing her will? This story may be hard to read at times but I couldn't put it down and I didn't want it to end. This is a first for me from Jade West and I will be reading more from her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12NAOJ2O3FCWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP41PFG#wasThisHelpful","R12NAOJ2O3FCWQ","A1FJ6YD0TL90GN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FJ6YD0TL90GN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This type of mobile inverter is perfect for traveling and is a must for everyone. I have used it to charge my phone and my kindle and have had no issues with it. All you have to do is place it in the cup holder, which it fits nicely, and plug the charger into the cigarette lighter and it is ready to charge any device. It is well made and sturdy so it will not fall over or pull out while things are plugged in.  It has multiply places to plug in different device, --One 110V AC outlet, USB power port offers 2A max power for laptops, smartphones such as iPhone, Samsung, HTC, LG, and Nokia, portable DVD players, etc. So if you are looking for a mobile inverter, than this is a great one to have.

"I found Oswalt neither funny nor perceptive and his weirdness merely weird. The short pieces on his jobs, before and after he became a comedian, would be of interest to his acolytes but aren't unusual enough or funny enough to have been of interest to me. His thesis of his generation based upon the classifying of Zombie, Spaceship, and Wasteland was mildly interesting or else I'd give the book one star.I've liked him from the little I've seen of him, mostly in guest spots but the more I learn of him the less interesting he becomes. His recommendation of ""The Horizontal Man"", as one example, furthers my confusion about him. I'm a huge fan of mysteries from Poe, to S.S. Van Dine, through Rex Stout to today but that one, Yech.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5JRE7YU33VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VPWXOM#wasThisHelpful","R2K5JRE7YU33VW","AQ55H30MZSV0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ55H30MZSV0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm afraid one has to compare this book to Tony Hillerman's The comparison does not come off well for Chapell. The mystery plot really makes little sense, the archaeological ""secret"" is not that secret for the time and place and certainly not important enough to cause the action that takes place. The characters aren't well-defined, the three Navajo males are interchangeable. None of the protagonists act very intelligently or with any common sense given the threat they face. The other characters are all one dimensional. Even the archaeological information is poorly done and ""the theory"" not currently given much credence from my online research after reading the book. The clincher at the end, similarly makes no sense.Also, unlike Hillerman, the author really does not evoke much sense of the place.I haven't read Hillerman for quite a while but just started reading ""The Great Taos Bank Robbery, and other true stories"" and learned more about the Navajo/Ute/Zuni/Anasazi excavations from one story than from this book, and the writing was a joy to read.I had no interest in reading more of the author until I read some reviews here that believe this is one of his worst books.

"Bostich and Stanley are the same company and this looks identical to the Stanley TR150 which gets excellent reviews on Amazon. I bought it to use as a stapler and it has been OK for that.Pros: Comfortable ergonomics, Easy to squeeze,  Hard and soft setting for punching power, Easy to insert staples.Con: Staples don't penetrate evenly, one side is almost always not flush with the surface of the item stapled so I had to use a tack hammer to get the staples flush.I've just spent three days trying to staple fabric onto outdoor furniture seat cushions. I started with a 50 year old Duo-fast which jammed constantly, requiring it to be disassembled frequently, but eventually did a good job with even penetration. I then tried a heavy duty Swingline stapler but the staples were too long and neither Home Depot or Lowes carry the staples which are NOT interchangeable with Arrow, Bostich, and Stanley staples.

"Not bad but four issues. I got the ""Tan"" and the light color is a pink flesh color, just different enough from the photo to be dissatisfying to me. I'd go with Brown, instead. They are a slight bit wide in the medium size and slightly short in the thumb. The most annoying thing is that when I take them off the inside sheds and little flecks of leather stick to my hands and then transfer to the car surfaces. There are tiny specks all over the cockpit. I don't know if this is normal for any deerskin gloves but it's annoying. The Velcro is annoying, too hard to put the gloves on quickly. You have to first pull the Velcro apart. They'd be too loose around the wrist if the straps were removed.Seem to be well constructed. Can't beat the price, though.4/19: Well, I've had to downgrade my rating. The gloves continually shed. I turned them inside out, wore them and rubbed my hands together for an hour. There was still loose flecks. I tried sandpapering them with different grades of sandpaper but they still continue to shed. I think that they always will and that is unsatisfactory to me.

"Another great book in the series that is set in WW1 but from the unfamiliar perspective of an Officer in the Austrian-Hungarian ""Empire"". The great irony of WW1 is that it was started by the least competent of the Great Powers which was completely destroyed by the war. The series describes the familiar armaments of WW1, submarines and aircraft, but of the little studied Austrian varieties. A well-drawn and interesting main character suffers from dealing with the ultra-conservative and hidebound Dual Monarchy bureaucracy. I highly recommend the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8AAJ3TNUKA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312147511#wasThisHelpful","R3N8AAJ3TNUKA4","AQ55H30MZSV0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ55H30MZSV0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a big fan of Phillip Kerr's character Bernard Gunther, the Berlin Detective whose life we follow from pre-WW2 through post-WW2. I was hoping for something of the same caliber. Well, Connell is no Kerr. The book isn't bad but it shows how hard it is to rise above mediocre. The main character is not very engaging, the supporting characters, as well as the villain of the piece, are cut out cliches, the plot, O.K., somewhat formulaic, but the story could have taken place anywhere and any time. The only advantage of the immediate post-Nazi era setting is that we are made aware of the magnitude of the Nazi experimentation and vivisection of human victims which give us a wide range of suspects. I'm a child of WW2 with a lifelong interest in it and was well aware of the horrors of the Nazi Concentration Camps and the inhuman experiment the Nazis performed but I had no idea of how wide spread they were, assuming that Connell's book is based on fact.I had a very hard time keeping interest in the book and only continued reading it because I agreed to review it for Vine.

"I found this book referenced on the SLK Forum website that Id used when I was researching information on the SLK prior to buying one. Unfortunately I found this AFTER I'd already purchased the car. I bought the Kindle version but if one is interested in buying a SLK I'd recommend getting the hard copy as the tables and information are more readily accessible. My one complaint is that the Author is a bit too pro-Mercedes. The 280 engine had a serious manufacturing defect which caused very expensive engine repairs (a fact I'd learned independently and which caused me to avoid buying a car with that engine). While discussing the defect the Author refers to it dismissively. Later on, however, while discussing how to buy a SLK he states that he wouldn't buy one with that engine.

"These stories are moderately interesting to a car guy, really only so if you know the author. Anyone with any involvement in cars has their own stories that are as, or more, interesting, than these. I have the Kindle version and there are countless errors. The book really needed a good proofreader for the frequent typos, omissions, and duplicate insertions, and a good editor to rearrange the stories so that, at least, they are in chronological order. Clearly they were published separately and later compiled, although I can't imagine what commercial publication would have carried them other than a small town newspaper looking to fill space.As a Car Guy, my conclusion is that the ideal reader for this book is not a car guy, but someone who wants to get involved in a personal relationship with a car guy.

"Wow, I've been mulling over this review for weeks since I finished the book. I'm a huge Levy fan. I bought two of his ""The Last Open Road"", one for myself, one to loan out. I gave away other copies to relatives and friends. I bought his tee-shirts and bumper stickers. About twenty friends read the book and car lovers and non-car lovers alike loved it. The sequels, while not as good, in descending order, were still great fun. So, twenty years later a new Levy book? It must be terrific, right? Well... being a Levy optimist I kept shoveling hoping to find a good book under all the dross. Eventually I found half a good book but had to dig through too many unnecessary extensive descriptions. Of the ""Ford"" (under a pseudonym) offices, ""Mrs Ford's"" decorating skills and her house, for examples, and the repetitious musings of the main character as to how difficult it is to write, how inexperienced he is with women, and other cries of the heart. Levy's cutsie-pie style of writing with sentences containing almost endless strings of nouns, gerunds, or adjectives got very tiring after awhile.The basic concept is a great one. The original series was about sports car racing in North America. This is an expansion: Ford's foray into international motorsports as well as its introduction of the Mustang, with extensive asides into international motorsport events. Levy crams all the details he can into each event. Again, repetitively. We read about the list of cars and drivers at Sebring at least three times, yeah we got it.While Buddy was interesting as a breathless young mechanic diving into the wrenching of exotic foreign motorcars in the original series, the hero, herein, as a knowledgeable writer for ""Car and Driver/Road and Track"", is really unsympathetic. He's amazingly naf given the understanding of motorsports politics that he's shown to have.The Kindle Edition is the only way to go for two reasons. Tapping the page to skip though the extensive padding is a delight, and the book and read is not worth $35.00.The book was truly in need of a ruthless editor and should have been a combination of the two, I assume, books in the series. As it stands now I have absolutely no interest in wading through the second book, despite knowing that, historically, it should contain the more interesting bits of Ford's involvement.Given the 18 years he's had since the end of the last series, Levy had more than enough time to develop the story and revise and polish it to produce a real gem. Instead he's given readers a reason to think he's called ""B.S."" for a reason.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E778EQOX66WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV9EWIM#wasThisHelpful","R1E778EQOX66WE","AQ55H30MZSV0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ55H30MZSV0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Maybe you have to be Australian to like this book. I'm not, I didn't. I bought it because it IS Australian and I thought that'd be a nice change and because of the good reviews here.The lifestyle and former occupation of the heroine are certainly different. They didn't put me off. What did was the extensive padding and extraneous details provided and the fact that the heroine wasn't clever, rather she's fairly stupid and very lucky. The way she puts herself in mortal danger you'd think she'd train in Martial Arts rather than in running and drinking Champagne.

"Loaned to be by General Eaker's nephew, I found this book to fill in the gaps about my knowledge of the U.S.' Daylight Bombing Campaign against the Germans. I'd always believed that it was only marginally successful, and a flawed concept, as the British believed, but learned that it was effective. Eaker's interview with Speer after the war confirmed that, and that the concept was sound, it just required more heavy bombers to make it more effective. Unfortunately the Eighth Air Force's need was rivaled by that of the anti-submarine campaign (see:""Black May"" about the anti-U-Boat campaign) which drew off a significant, and necessary, number of Bombers. The U.S. could only produce so many.Since it's written by one of his aides, the plus is that there is much accurate detailed information about Eaker. The minus is it's a bit hero worshipping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YD6MMFR1LUZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0917561155#wasThisHelpful","R2YD6MMFR1LUZS","AQ55H30MZSV0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ55H30MZSV0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a child of WW2 with an interest in it from the earliest age. I always believed that U-Boats were highly effective as a weapon. This book reveals the truth. Once the Allies got their act together the U-Boats weren't, and as counter measures improved the U-boats cost the Germans more than they were worth. An excellent book with comprehensive details about the anti-sub campaign. Well written and a good read.

"I started this series because of my interest in WW1 and the unusual perspective the author provides of the war from that of the Hapsburg Empire, the dysfunctional Dual Monarchy. I only read this book because it was the last one of the series left to me and I thought I'd be bored because it takes place before the war begins. How wrong I was. A terrific piece of writing, it is difficult to believe that this is not autobiographical and that the author did not experience first hand what he wrote about.I've always had an interest in sailing and have read a significant number of works that describe sailing in a square-rigger but I learned so much more from this book.

"I have had a great interest in WW1 since the '60s, mainly the airplanes and air war but also the insane war itself. I've read most of the first hand accounts of the land and air war from British, Americans, French and Germans and many Histories and analyses of the war. I bought this because of the subject matter and because of the uniform terrific reviews. After starting the book I went back and looked, again, at the reviews as I could not understand how people opinions could differ so radically from mine. At first I thought that the reviews must be from friends and relatives of the Author but, checking, the posters' review histories that did not seem to be true. One poster clearly had not previously read anything about the war which could explain his enthusiasm but another had read substantially. There is no accounting for taste, or, as my Grandmother used to say: ""Everybody has their own taste said the Old Lady as she kissed the cow.""I have had three retired friends who decided to write novels which were mediocre, at best, and this could have been one of them. The author has some familiarity with the period and the War, it appears that he has done his research, and he's ticked all the boxes but his characters are all the same and one dimensional. There is no real sense of the settings, either, despite the author's long-winded efforts. I found myself skimming the first half which describes the protagonist's childhood and relationship with his Father and Girlfriend. Nothing unusual or interesting. Yes, Dad beats him but in no way more than in many boy's lives in that period, and for that matter, today. Dad did not come across as the Ogre that the Author seemed to wish to portray.The protagonist was not particularly interesting, engaging or sympathetic. The dialogue was not of the period but contemporary. The descriptions of his service from training through combat are repetitive in showing he was cold, tired, and hungry but are done in a very pedestrian way. Similarly, I skimmed his life after his demobilization. His wartime service was only slightly more readable, again checking all the boxes as to how horrible combat in the front lines was. A slightly different perspective here as he served in the Artillery, not the Infantry, so did not have to leave the trenches and attack enemy positions.To me it was very poorly written, totally unengaging, and a complete waste of time and money. I only finished reading it in order to see if the ending justified all the great reviews.I'm certain that I'll be soundly lambasted for my negative review but wanted to make certain that anyone else looking to read this book be aware that there is an alternate opinion of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32O94H60S1VG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B0UZTW#wasThisHelpful","R32O94H60S1VG7","AQ55H30MZSV0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ55H30MZSV0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DeMuro starts off by telling us how his friends and family think he's insane for giving up a great job with Porsche to become a freelance writer. After reading this book I concur. He writes some clever similes and metaphors but he really is nowhere as clever as he thinks he is. He's also a slow learner. If there is one takeaway from this book it is: don't buy a car without getting a good mechanic to give it a thorough evaluation. DeMuro doesn't, continually buys cars with major problems and then gives them bad reviews, surprising, no?

I like that they are made in the USA and especially that they are cruelty free. For me personally I don't think they are suitable.  I have been having a lot of pain in my joints and muscles, the opposite of the benefits I was hoping for with my fibromyalgia. This herb is intended to improve the immune system, but I suspect it may be putting mine into overdrive, which causes my body to start hurting as if I'm fighting something off.  I dont know for sure if this is what's happening, just my best guess.  I also did not feel any benefits for anxiety or stress. Not every product works for every person, and Im reluctant to give the impression it does not work, it's just not a match for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HCTBHP61LQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD5G396#wasThisHelpful","R25HCTBHP61LQ3","AP8D74QD9LUUL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP8D74QD9LUUL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My liver enzymes are often elevated, but not to the level where the doctor feels more testing is necessary.  I asked him if taking Milk Thistle could help, and he said that although there's no definitive proof, taking a reasonable dose is probably a good idea.  Milk thistle is also purported to help with high cholesterol.  Again, it's not proven, but since I also have that issue, I have been taking it for a few years, with  occasional breaks.  I was offered this brand by the seller and asked to evaluate it and give my honest review.  I feel better using an organic product so I was happy to do so.  When I opened the bottle, I took a sniff and it smelled fresh. Capsules are medium sized, and contain 500 mg., a bigger dose than other brands I have used. I haven't used them long enough to say if my blood work shows any improvement, but in general both my liver enzymes and my cholesterol has gone down while taking this herb.

They like to play with the balls,  and being toddlers, this keeps them occupied for a while.  With balls coming out of top and bottom, there's a little sense of anticipation.  This toy gets repeat play, but only for a few minutes at a time.  It plays music but the girls don't seem interested in it, and it would probably be better if it didn't.  I'm really surprised this takes so many D batteries to operate. It's expensive for what it is already, and those batteries really raise the cost.

"I was prepared for the worst when I first tasted this Mushroom drink, but while delicious doesn't come to mind, it's not bad.  It's a bit gritty and it's hard to keep the powder from settling to the bottom.  When you think of the benefits of the ingredients though, you realize it's worth it to drink a glass.  You might try adding it to an ounce or two of pomegranate or cranberry juice, it adds nutrients and make it taste lots better. Not only is this a healthy drink, the fiber makes you feel full for a long time, and I try to drink it about an hour before dinner to curb my hearty appetite. I wish I could comment personally on the immune system boost that this product is supposed to provide, but research does indicate mushrooms have that quality, so I imagine it is dong my body good there too.

"This is a very nice product. We have been using it for my youngest child to take his lunch to school and it works great. It has allowed us to get away from the frozen squares or disc that we have stashed in the freezer taking up too much space. The description claims that it will keep items cold for up to 10 hours as external temperatures have an effect. We live in the Pacific Northwest and for us this lunch bag will keep items cold for a much longer time. It doesn't take up a lot of room in the freezer when storing as it is rather compact when folded. I would guess that the only drawback is that this is strictly for carrying cold items and keeping food/drink cold. We sometimes like to send our little one with a hot dish or soup in a small thermos.

"This all-in-one printer from Epson is great. I was replacing an older model Epson with this model. I was looking forward to using it based on the new style ink cartridges and filer method. With the way the ink is stored for this machine it makes it so much easier and less expensive to not only refill the ink but also allows for greater ink storage capacity and no changing out of ink cartridges. You are also able to monitor the amounts of ink remaining in the ink containers more easily. The set up of this machine was very quick, approximately 10 minutes. I was able to print documents from it right away and the copies looked great. I was able to get it to sync with my wireless internet and was ready to connect it to my desktop computers, laptop and was printing documents from my Android phone Epson iPrint app in no time at all. We use the copier, printer, scanner of our all-in ones at a fairly high volume for a normal household. So far this Epson Workforce ET-4550 is even better than I was expecting. The reason for the 4 stars is that I'm curious to see if the ink level will actually provide as many copies as indicated.

"My family and I have used Belkin products before mostly as covers for our Kindle Fire's and this seemed like a nice product to try as an addition to the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 that we have. I have been looking at possibly purchasing a new laptop or just getting a keyboard for my Galaxy. I decided to try this keyboard case in hopes of getting something that would keep me from shelling out big money for a new laptop and just see what I could accomplish with this keyboard case. Hopping that this would cure me of wanting a new laptop. I was pleased with the design of the case and the keyboard itself was very sturdy even though it didn't seem to add much additional weight to the overall product. In other words, it didn't seem overly bulky or cumbersome.One of the issues that I had was that it didn't seem to pair very well with my tablet and connection kept dropping. Even though it started out as something I was very interested in and wanted to really be happy with it ended up rather disappointing. It does have a QWERTY keyboard with the functions of most laptop keyboards and the case itself fit very well. I was happy with how the case set up in the open position but when I was just using my Galaxy for reading I would just take it out of the case. Ultimately, even with some nice features,  I found that it was something that I really don't see myself using very much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OKFQC8VY2KIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3DLTF0#wasThisHelpful","R1OKFQC8VY2KIK","A17V2N0N8CXSA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V2N0N8CXSA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great device with several use applications. I found it very easy to use both dry and in the shower when wet. It has 2 different head attachments that are easy to change out and are of different trimming lengths. I prefer to use it as a dry trimmer versus the wet or shower way. I'm really pleased that it is a battery powered device rather than a rechargeable one, i don't need or want another power/charge cord in the bathroom.

"I was really looking forward to using this grill and see if it was a viable alternative for a propane grill or counter-top grill. There are many pros for this particular grill which I really like. First this is that it was very easy to assemble and easily transitions from the kitchen counter-top to the backyard or tailgate. It gets to temperature quickly and I was surprised at how much food can be grilled at one time. We used it on our kitchen island counter-top and it was easy to use and cooked our burgers and skewers very well. It is also very easy to clean and showed no initial signs that the coating will burn off or easily damage. As a tailgating or camping grill it is a nice alternative to propane or charcoal and if you have access to outlets or a generator it is much more travel friendly and easier to cool down and clean up. Some of the cons of this grill is that it is rather large and is not something that you would be able to leave out on your counter when not in use. The stand for outdoor use is plastic and doesn't seem very durable. In fact if camping or tailgating I would probably just set it on a table for use. Even though I was surprised at the amount of food that you can put on it at one time I don't see this as a grill that could crank out a large volume of food for a big group. But, if you're just using it for a few people it would be more than suitable. I'm a fan of the George Foreman grill products and this is a good one for my family of 6.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUEW94F8PNZZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUXO#wasThisHelpful","RUEW94F8PNZZD","A17V2N0N8CXSA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V2N0N8CXSA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking to get a device like this for quite some time. When the opportunity presented itself, I jumped at the chance. As someone who is dealing with HBP this device makes it so easy. I couldn't be more pleased. It was easy to figure out and the smartphone app that pairs this device with my phone makes it so nice to be able to store and monitor my BP readings over a period of time for my physician to be able to see and for me to be able to monitor. Considering that it is a wrist device versus an upper arm device I was a little worried that I would be able to get true readings but it is a very accurate monitor and is so easy to use. Another good feature is that it comes in a small case that makes it easy to carry when and if I'm traveling.

I believe that the downvotes here are from people who look to connect with or even like characters in a novel, and this is not a pretty packaged read.

"I'm always looking for new coffees, I'm not the type of person that finds one kind and sticks with it all the time. So, I was very interested in trying this brand of coffee. For an everyday coffee I prefer a medium roast and was looking forward to trying this blend. One thing that I don't like and I guess it's more of a Keurig issue than an issue with this particular coffee is that this type of k-cup does not work with the Keurig 2.0. Nowhere on the box does it say that it doesn't work with the 2.0. It does say on the amazon product page that it doesn't work with the 2.0. I have a Keurig 2.0 at home and keep my single serve Keurig at my office. The Cafejo K-Cups are well package and I've had no problem with unusable cups. Cafejo makes and offers a French Press specifically for their K-Cups. It seems like a good idea but it's not something I'm interested in right now.The coffee itself is just ok. Rather mellow for a medium roast, It didn't blow me away or make me want to go out and buy it.

"First of all I have used several EAS products both in the past and currently so I trust them to make quality products. I'm not a competitive athlete anymore, those days are long since over, but I like a good protein shake to give me a little extra that I might otherwise be lacking in my overall diet. I like the consistency and taste of this protein. It gives me what I'm looking for in a relatively low calorie and complete protein supplement. The packaging of this is different than most huge tubes of protein and the "" scoop in lid"" does make it a bit easier to use. Either way what I'm really looking for is what the product has in it, does it mix and taste good enough that I'll want to keep using and buying it. With that in mind I really like this protein powder. It mixes easily and has a good taste. I usually have all of my proteins in a vanilla flavor so that I can flavor it myself with fruits in my smoothies or just a plain old vanilla and water protein drink. Overall, I like this product very much, it doesn't make me feel bloated or sluggish and as a kind of meal replacement or snack during the day I found that gives me a nice boost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J5WJS83OAR9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WE0ANTC#wasThisHelpful","R2J5WJS83OAR9C","A17V2N0N8CXSA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V2N0N8CXSA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Regularly need an extra bed for guests? Order the JAY-BE Kingston and you'll be set. This is a quality folding bed that is an investment that will last for years. It arrived in a box inside of a box, perfect condition and was set up in under 20 minutes. The only things that needed to be attached were the headboard (two screws and tool included) and four spinning wheels that attached to the bottom of bed when folded to allow for easy moving from place to place, small wrench is needed, (instructions called for a spanner which I assume is the British term for a wrench) however I just finger tightened the wheels for now and they work fine.The bed folds in on itself with the headboard at the top and two side clips to keep it from opening. It is fairly compact but not narrow enough to be stored behind a bedroom door. All you need to do to set it up is pop off the clips and lower each end to the ground - legs fold out automatically, nothing suddenly drops, all very controlled. The mattress is not your typical cheap mattress, it is very comfortable, meets high environmental standards, has zero smell/odor and can be cleaned with the wipe of a cloth. The slats on the bed give great support and again are at a level of quality that I am surprised to see in a foldaway. I like the headboard, it keeps the pillows in place and takes it up a notch for guests. Also when folded the headboard is an extra flat narrow table if something needs to be placed, such as blankets, toiletries etc. I recommend buying the cover for the bed when not in use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NWPIFV57OUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4SSFLM#wasThisHelpful","R9NWPIFV57OUC","A17V2N0N8CXSA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V2N0N8CXSA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using this case for about two weeks now and I like it. It is slimmer and less obtrusive than the other Otterbox cases I've used in the past, but it offers similar protection from drops. (At least I'm assuming that ... I've never had the guts to actually put any of the cases I've tested to an actual drop test since I don't want to find out they failed!) In the past, I've been frustrated by the Otterbox cases because -- although I want to protect my phone -- I feel like I lose all the lightweight slimness of the iPhone 6 design. (Honestly, there have been times I've removed my case and been shocked at just how thin and slim and light the iPhone 6 actually is.) But I recognize that I need a decent case to protect my phone. So far, this Otterbox has been the least obtrusive of their cases that I've tried.What I like:* Slim and lightweight design but with Otterbox protection* Clear in the back* Fits on iPhone 6 pretty seamlessly (camera and speakers aren't blocked; easy to access the ""ringer"" switch, headphone jack is open)* Easy to install and remove but snug on the phone itself* Bright color makes it easy to see* You can get a pretty good grip on it despite the fact that the sides are smooth and, at first glance, seemed like it would be ""slippy. (No accidental drops yet.)What I Don't Like:* Although the case is ""red,"" it feels like an orange red rather than a true red. I thought it would be more of a ""bolder"" red.* The case feels a little too much like ""plastic."" It doesn't have an ""upscale"" feel to it.Overall, I think it one of the most minimalistic Otterbox cases yet.

"Our family is a huge fan of the Blue Orange ""Spot It"" games so we were eager to try this game. Although everyone thought it was ""fun,"" we still prefer Spot It over Ring It! Part of the reason is that Spot It is more challenging so it ended up being more fun for us. However, if you are a family with younger children, this might be an easier game to play. However, it was a fun game that would probably be more fun in larger groups (we were playing with our family of three).A few observations:* My husband felt that someone could get hurt slapping down on the bell. (Note: My ultra-competitive husband was often the one slapping down on the bell very very hard so take that with a grain of salt. The bell is flat and plastic -- didn't seem like it could really hurt someone. The hurt would come from another ultra-competitive player slapping your hand in a race to ring the bell.)* If you have slow reflexes (like I do), you're going to be a serious disadvantage playing this game. I would often be getting ready to ""clap and ring"" and my husband or son was already done doing it. FRUSTRATING! (But all part of the fun.)* We played with a smaller group (3 players). We felt that smaller groups should deal out more cards than just 10 as the rounds went by too quickly.* We didn't play any of the suggested variations but I love how Blue Orange includes suggestions for other ways to play their games.Overall, a fun, fast-moving game that would be good for larger groups and parties. I would imagine you would have the best results if everyone is equal in the reflex department. ; )","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZEHPCKQUDK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TS6PXWM#wasThisHelpful","RGZEHPCKQUDK4","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to love this vacuum but I think it fell short in a few areas, which kept me from really loving it. While I think it vacuums OK, at this point I think I actually prefer my old Hoover upright (which came with a small canister vac) to this one. Here's a few comments on what I found while using this product.* The user manual could definitely be better. The images are a muddy gray, and there were a few times when I felt a ""close-up"" of the area in question would have been helpful. For example, when they are telling you where to store the tools on the vacuum, I could barely make out which tool went where. A bit of detail (a photo/drawing of the tool and then an arrow pointing to where it should be stored) would have fixed this. In addition, nowhere in the manual did it show a photo/drawing of the different tools and tell you when and how to use them. This seems like important information. Also, when I went to look at the online instructions, they didn't have them for this particular model. Now I'm not sure if this is because this was a review product and the final manual will be better and the online instructions for this model just weren't posted yet, but this was a problem for me.* Tool placement wasn't intuitive and I found the tools kept falling off as I tried to vacuum. Now this isn't just this model -- I have this problem with every vacuum I've ever had that has multiple tools and tried to store them on the vacuum itself. I'd love to see a vacuum company master the art of storing tools securely on the vacuum! (If Hoover can't do it, then who can?) I did what I always do -- I removed the tools and put them in my ""vacuum tool"" drawer (with the tools from my steam cleaner). Most likely, I will forget about the tools and never use them but that is partly my fault and partly the manufacturer's fault for not mastering tool storage.* The vacuum seems to do a good job vaccuming so that is good (since that is what it is made for). However, I did think the width was smaller and narrower than other vacuums I've had, which made me feel like I was having to vacuum more.* The part where you step on the vacuum to pull it down so you can vacuum seems awkwardly placed and I always had to try it a few times before it worked. This was annoying!! A simple push lever in the back like other vacuums would have been better.* I tried using the dusting tool to clean my ceiling fan and felt the results were middling. It wasn't all that easy to use and I won't use it for that again -- I'll just use my Swiffer duster.* The dirt cup is easy to remove and empty. I like that you don't have to buy bags. This is a definite plus and one of the primary reasons to get this vacuum (or one like it).* You can easily clean and reuse the filter -- another plus.* You can turn off the brushroll when vacuuming hard floors, which is a nice feature. (However, I sometimes had a difficult time telling if I was turning the brushroll off or on when I pressed the button.)* You can remove the canister part of the vacuum and leave the ""upright base"" behind to use it to clean stairs. This was OK but I still found it more awkward to hold and carry than an actual small canister vacuum that is made to be portable. (Like I said, the Hoover Upright I have comes with a small canister vacuum and I just LOVE both of them. By the way, I have the Hoover Platinum Collection Lightweight Bagged Upright with Canister, UH30010COM. You might want to consider this version if you're looking at this one. It requires bags however.)* I didn't think this vacuum was super lightweight. It wasn't super heavy but I didn't think it was incredibly light either.* The cord is very long and I appreciate that.* The vacuum did maneuver pretty well, and I liked that it was small enough to fit under the edges of my kitchen cabinets.Overall, I would would have to say that I wasn't a super big fan of this vacuum. True -- you don't have to buy bags for it and it can function as a canister and an upright but like I said, I don't think it did either one well. I actually prefer my previous Hoover over this one. But if bagless is important to you, then I guess you might want to consider this one. For all the reasons I mentioned above, I'm giving it three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGBVP7GEZCM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K1XICQ#wasThisHelpful","R1TGBVP7GEZCM5","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been through a few outside furniture covers and I have high hopes for this one. (However, only going through a full winter or two will really reveal how good it is. I will try to remember to come back and update my review after it has been in use for awhile.)What I Like:* Material is more of a heavy canvas versus the ""crinkly"" like material that we had on previous covers (and are often found on grill covers). My experience with the ""crinkly"" covers is that they don't stand up well for a long time -- they tend to crack apart and reveal the soft insides. I think this heavy canvas will hold up much better becuase it can't ""crack"" open.* There were two buckle straps that you can use to attach the canvas to the chairs/table legs. This seems much more secure than the velcro straps that we had on our previous covers. (Note: It would be nice to have four buckle straps instead of two but I'll trust the manufacturer knows that two is more than enough.)* There are two bungee-type cords that you can use to pull the cover closed more securely at the bottom. I'd never seen that in a cover before so I thought it was nice touch.* There are air vents (really vents built into pockets ... they aren't on the outside so water could come in) built into the cover. I'm assuming this is to allow better ventilation and circulation and I thought it was a nice feature.* There are at least two handles sewn into the cover to help you lift and manage placement of the cover.* I like the two-toned tan cover -- much more attractive than the black or gray covers we've used in the past.* The design seems to be for a longer rectangular table but I was able to place it around our large round table with five chairs with no problems.Overall, I think this is an attractive, well-made cover with a good material that will last us a long time. As I said, the true test is time so I'll try to come back and update you on the condition of the cover after it has been in use for a full winter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6ESG4LCECZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MU07FA#wasThisHelpful","RP6ESG4LCECZS","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My main issue with the Triple Treater Totter (great name  by the way!) is that you are very limited in the type of treats that you can put into it. For it to work, you can only put in small, hard treats -- basically something like kibble. My dogs don't view kibble as a treat -- they like softer things like chews or Beggin' Strips. (Note: I tried to rip up these types of treats and use them in the Treater Totter but it just didn't work well at all.) The design is for small hard treats so I would recommend thinking about what you're going to put in this dog treat toy before you purchase it as not any treat will work.Other notes:* It comes fully assembled.* My dog was able to ""master"" getting the treats (despite the fact that I didn't have the right kind of treat).My recommendation is that if your dogs are used to getting small kibble-like treats, then this might be a good puzzle treat game for them. However, I had better luck with the multiple compartment dog puzzle that permits you to use any type of treat and makes your dog open a flap and then turn the tray to get to them. Not only do I think that type of puzzle is more ""user-friendly"" as far as treat types that can be used, but I think it is also more challenging if your goal is to give your dog a bit of intellectual stimulation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVKSYVVSSXQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWDXO50#wasThisHelpful","R1JVKSYVVSSXQX","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: This review was written by my husband Scott, who handles the more ""technical"" reviews for me.The setup for the projector is pretty simple. I prefer using the included remote rather than the controls on the unit itself as they are more self-explanatory. This unit includes the VGA cord, but not an HDMI cable. There is also an extra little plastic piece that was in the package and was not listed on any contents or “what’s in the box” list. After skimming the manual, it turns out this is the holder for the optional wifi dongle that is not included. I am not sure why they include this and don’t mention it, it should just come with the optional dongle itself.I tried the computer output using both a Chromebook and an HDMI connection, and a Windows laptop with the standard VGA connection. Using the recommended 800 x 600 resolution, the picture and text look very good. It is sharp and bright, even in a lighted room. Once you begin increasing the resolution, the text quality begins to suffer. It is still readable, but I wouldn’t recommend using at more than the basic resolution, which should suffice for powerpoint presentations.I also tried the HDMI connection using an AppleTv. The text portions were not very clear, but the video picture was very good. This would be really good for watching movies or tv shows, and the sound came out of the unit itself. The sound was basic quality but good enough to watch a movie or show.I wouldn’t call this unit portable, but it is fairly light for its size. The instant off feature is good if you are constantly moving from location to location, although the side of the unit does get a little warm even with the fan running. The fan noise is not too loud.It comes with a quick setup guide which is enough to get you started. I did look the manual up online, but only to try and find out what that little plastic piece was. Other than that, there wasn’t a need for the full manual.This seems like a good entry level projector for business applications and also to be used watching movies or video.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFX6QUNHIMYDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYO74#wasThisHelpful","RFX6QUNHIMYDI","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shelving system was incredibly easy to put together. No tools are required and even someone like me (who struggles with Ikea furniture) could assemble it without reading a manual.The material is a metal mesh -- very similar to the desk organizer I have on my desk. The openings in the mesh are fairly small so you could put smaller items on the shelves without worrying about them getting caught or falling through.The unit is a decent size for a small bookcase. Be sure to read the dimensions to ensure it will fit into the space that you want it. It is fairly ""low"" once it is set up so I think it would be possible to place this on top of a table and use it there instead of keeping it on the floor.You can set-up the bottom shelf to have two sliding file cabinet drawers. I was able to put my hanging folders in there with no troubles. The drawers do fit into some simple tracks but you could easily pull them out and remove them if you wanted.There is no way to anchor this to a wall so I make sure to load this carefully and keep it from getting too top heavy or bottom heavy as this is a fairly llightweight unit.Overall, if you're like this type of look (open black mesh) and want easy set-up, this would be a good option to consider for a small shelving unit. I think the best use might be in a small or home office.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ODHWPJ8ZUK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K0X3L2#wasThisHelpful","R26ODHWPJ8ZUK1","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a basic surge protector that had a featuresI hadn't seen in our other surge protectors -- a cover that slides over to cover the outlet holes if you aren't using them.

"We use vinyl gloves in our house quite frequently -- for weeding in the garden, picking up dog poop, working with cleaners/chemicals, painting, etc. So we go through a fair amount of vinyl gloves in a year, I'm sad to say.These gloves serve our needs perfectly. The XL size fit both my hands and my husband's hands (though they are loose and not skin-tight ... but we're not looking for skin-tight). They are durable (I wore them when doing a lot of weeding and they didn't rip until about an hour in and that is probably not a fair use of these gloves since they aren't ""gardening gloves"" per se). They don't make my hands too hot or sweaty. Neither of us had any kind of reaction to the gloves.In short, I think these gloves are a good value for the price and would meet the needs that outlined above.

"The big thing about this printer is that it come with two years worth of ink. Now obviously I can't give an opinion on whether the ink really does last this long, but I will say that you get a TON of ink with the printer. So that is the headline .... now how does it work as a printer, scanner, copier, etc. Here is what I experienced during 24 days I've been testing and working on this review.SET-UP (** -- 2 stars): The actual physical set-up of the printer was easy and straightforward. The directions were easy to follow and I had no problem filling the ink tanks. Where we had problems was getting the printer (which is supposed to be able to print wirelessly) set-up on our home network. The big issue was that this printer requires a network that supports 2.4 GHz,. Now we have a dual band network that supports both 2.4 and 5.0 GHz. We even had them named as XXXFAMILY2.4 and XXXFAMILY.  However, this printer couldn't connect to the 2.4 GHz until we changed the SSID to be the same as the one for the 5.0 one (which seemed counterintuitive to me). This proved tricky to set-up, and I (as a layperson) couldn't make it happen. I had to have my husband (the computer expert in our family) step in and get involved because I don't know how to make changes to the router. (in fact, I hope I'm explaining this correctly from a technical standpoint.) Making this change to accommodate this printer then caused us to have to change other things that were already set-up. A real pain! It seemed to me like this printer should have been able to connect to the 2.4 GHz network that existed without us having to change the name. What was super annoying was that after we went to all this trouble, I discovered that this version of the printer doesn't offer Apple AirPrint like our other wireless printer.  (We're an Apple household with iPads and iMacs.) You have to use the Epson app, which just seemed to add another layer of difficulty to what should be easy to do. (And the app wasn't all that great.)  The fact that all the others printers in this Epson line do offer AirPrint seems ridiculous to me. Obviously Epson can do it so why withhold that aspect from this particular printer?SCANNING (*** -- 3 stars): I tested the scanner and it worked fairly easily but I don't think it is intuitive. To scan from the printer, you have to press the two copy buttons at the same time and it will automatically start scanning to your printer. (IF you don't scan often, I think it would be easy to forget this. There is a graphic that shows you on the printer but it would have been better to have the word SCAN as I didn't realize this was what the graphic meant at first.) However, the catch here is that it will only scan to a PDF file when you do this and you can't mess with the settings. You can scan using your computer's scanning software to get other formats. I wonder why it only scans to PDF? Lots of people scan photos and I think the option to get it as a JPG might actually be more useful to these people.COPYING (**** -- 4 stars): I tested copying and this part worked great. You can choose to scan in color or B&W. (At least here, the buttons were pretty intuitive -- the black and white copy button is in white and the color one is in green). I scanned a color document and it copied great in both modes and was fast.PRINTING (***- 3 stars): The printer prints fairly fast and the quality for regular printing (documents, etc.) was OK. We printed a few photos for test purposes and didn't think the Epson did as good a job as our Canon. We printed an 8x10 of a vacation photo and the one printed on the Epson had a ""pinkish"" hue to it (by this I mean the white clouds seemed a little pink when compared to the Canon-printed clouds). So, although the photos printed fairly well at first glance, when you compare the quality to another ink jet printer, the print quality seemed lacking.FINAL THOUGHTS: The big draw here is that you should potentially save LOTS of money on ink with this printer, which is a big deal. However, I think Epson could make some improvements to make the user experience better and should add the AirPrint capability to this printer too. Because we were given the ""baseline"" model to review for Vine, I'm wondering if it would be worth it to pay a bit more and get one of the higher end models (the ones that offer AirPrint and have more info on the printer itself) f you're going to order this printer for yourself. These printers might offer some of the capabilities that I feel were lacking on this printer. But as I only have this model to review, I would say that if saving money on printer ink is the primary issue for you, then consider this printer seriously. However, if other factors are more important (quality of photo printing, scanning, easy wireless printing from tablets/phones), then I might not go for this printer but consider a different one or a higher level one in this same line.After averaging all my stars out, I think this printer gets 3 stars but I would hope that the higher end ones might be worth 4 or even 5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3L8UBVRJLM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JHMG#wasThisHelpful","RY3L8UBVRJLM6","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw this product come up in my Amazon Vine queue, I knew I had to try it. Stinky poops are a major issue in our household, and this seemed like a godsend. When I told my husband about it, he said he'd heard about it on the Howard Stern show and they seemed to like the product. If you don't know, this is a spray that you spray into the toilet BEFORE you go. It then keeps the smell of your business from wafting out and disgusting others. A few sprays before you go is all you need.Well, Poo-Pourri definitely seems to work! We have some major stinkers in this household, and as we've been testing the product all week, we haven't smelled a single horrible foul smell after they've ""dropped kids at the pool."" All you smell is the Poo-Pourri.Which brings me to my next comment -- the smell of Poo-Pourri itself is kind of strong. (At least this particular scent -- Lavender Vanilla--is.) And the thing about this scent is that NONE of us particularly liked it all that much. My husband and I definitely preferred the scent over the scent of a foul-smelling crap, but my 11-year-old son actually said he would rather smell poop! To be honest, it is so strong and cloying in a way that it kind of turns me off.  he strong smell of Poo-Pourri itself also makes me wonder if you're totally advertising what you're doing in the bathroom anyway -- just with a different kind of almost unpleasant smell. So there is that to consider too.I decided that I liked the concept of the product enough to order another scent. Perhaps the Lavender Vanilla is just not a good fit for our family, and another Poo-Pourri scent will be more agreeable. If anyone reads this review and has a suggestion, please let me know if another Poo-Pourri scent was more palatable for you. I placed an order for the original scent, which I believe is more citrusy. I'm hoping it will be less cloying than the scent of vanilla mixed with lavender.UPDATE TO REVIEW: Since my initial review, I've tried three more Poo Pourri scents -- Rose Geranium (much lighter floral smell), Juniper Woods (attractive woodsy smell) and Original (citrusy). All three scents were MUCH better than the Lavender Vanilla and I think we shall stick with these in the future. Of the four scents we've tried, I would choose Juniper Woods as my favorite. Therefore, my recommendation would now be ""This Product Works But Find the Scent You LIke.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PADRU2GZC1IY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108Y8EHI#wasThisHelpful","R3PADRU2GZC1IY","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a testament to Sarah Vowell that she can keep me interested in reading a book about something I have little or no interest in -- in the case of this book, the Marquis de Lafayette and his contributions to the American Revolution.Vowell's snarky, fresh writing on what I would consider ""dry"" historical topics is what keeps me coming back to her books over and over. This was one of the first books where I read the  book instead of listened to it on audio, and I was concerned that I would miss her idiosyncratic voice. I'm glad to report that her voice comes through on the printed page. (But perhaps it helps to have ""heard"" her before.) I was happy to see her opinions, modern-day observations and wit intact. As they say ""a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down."" For me, history always needs a dose of sugar -- and writers like Vowell and Bill Bryson are my ""historians of choice.""What I got most from this book is a better sense of what the patriots that fought in the American Revolution were like and what they were up against. I felt like I was really taken ""inside"" these people's heads. George Washington became a real person for me when reading this book. Nothing like reading snippets of someone's letters to give you sense of their personality. And the hardships that the Continental Army faced became less abstract and more real. After all, Vowell's description of bloody footprints on snow provide you with a better sense of what the patriots at Valley Forge experienced versus a textbook saying ""It was cold and difficult for the troops that winter.""As my son gets older and begins to study U.S. history in greater detail, I plan to give him Vowell's books as a way to get history presented to him more in-depth and fascinating way.Bottom Line: If you'e a Vowell fan, you'll enjoy this. If you've never tried her before, give it a go. Not only will you truly get a glimpse at our country's history in a meaningful and interesting way, you'll be entertained too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Z75ZGMNQW3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631743#wasThisHelpful","R38Z75ZGMNQW3Q","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"INSTALLATION: Fairly easy overall. However, two problems. 1) One of the screws they provide to hang the rail was unusable (no head on it to screw in). 2) We hung the rail in our garage, which has studs that are 16"" apart. With the 32"" length of the rail, this made it difficult to center the rail on the studs. We wished the rail had been a little bit longer (maybe 34""?) to better center the rail on the studs.USE: The rail looks good when mounted and seemed quite sturdy. Using the starter package of hooks/bins, etc., we hung a stepladder, a level, a few tools, and a bin of light bulbs on the one railing. It seems like it would be fairly easy to install another rail and keep on going if we need more room in the future.OVERALL: This seems like a viable storage solution for garages or sheds. It would be easily customized to fit your needs. Though there were a few small hiccups, it seemed like a quality product.  As for the price,  it seems a bit high for only one rail. But if you need storage system that is flexible and can adapt to your needs, this seems like it would do the trick.

"This laminator is wonderful for someone who needs to laminate basic items that don't exceed 8.5"" x 11"". It doesn't take up much space (the cord tucks away under the unit when not in use), warms up quickly (it took mine 3 minute and 52 seconds to warm up), operates quietly and does a great job. I laminated several sets of maps (two 8.5 x 11 pages laminated back to back) for an upcoming trip and was able to get the laminator up and running within minutes. The laminator did a wonderful job -- the seal is tight and the job was done quickly. What more could you want? The laminator comes with two pouches, and we ordered a set of 50 more via Amazon for the low price of $9.99.

"This kit gives you everything you need to make 36 s'mores -- a bag of standard size marshmallows, four packs of graham crackers (9 crackers in each), and 18 full-size Hershey Bars. Now of course you can buy all this stuff individually (and most likely cheaper), but I like the convenience of getting this kit (I buy 2 or 3 every summer) and keeping it in the pantry until it is ""S'mores"" time and knowing that I have everything I need in the box. If you're like me and often forget what you have on hand, this kit ensures you have it all ready to go for whenever you need it. Like I said, I usually buy one at the start of the summer and then replace it about midway through. (We usually only do s'mores about 2 to 3 times in the summer/fall.) And we've never once felt like we didn't have enough stuff and ran out. 36 s'mores is more than enough for most families ... and if you need to make more, then just buy a few kits. Another plus is that if you are taking this camping, it all fits conveniently together and doesn't squash the crackers or the marshmallows.I usually buy this in my local store and this was my first time getting it from Amazon. I didn't have a problem with the chocolate bars melting but I could see that this might be an issue.Also, I didn't go and price out each component and compare if it is cheaper to buy everything individually (though I imagine it would be). Basically, you are buying convenience by getting this in ""box form."" It isn't something I buy often but I usually get a few each summer and keep them on hand for the inevitable s'mores request.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6OCHVR3W7BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZAWFK8#wasThisHelpful","R1U6OCHVR3W7BK","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow ... this is one small fan!! I thought it was going to be bigger and was suprised by how tiny it is. It isn't much taller than a coffee mug. And, with only one speed, it isn't super powerful. However, if you just plan on using it close by (like on your desk ... running off your USB slot on your computer), I can see it being effective. It gives off enough air to cool you down in the face/neck area if it is just a few inches away. It is also fairly quiet and can be adjusted easily. And it doesn't take up a lot of room.It runs off batteries or a USB (and it can be plugged into your own USB AC adaptor like the ones that come with Apple products). I didn't use the batteries but other reviews seem to indicate that the battery area isn't well constructed so if you plan on using it with batteries, read other reviews. I used it running via the USB and plugging it into the adapter I got with my Apple products.In short, if you need a small quiet fan to cool you off while working near your computer or workstation, this fan would probably do the trick. However, I don't see it effectively cooling off more than one person or your whole body (for example, I can't imagine it being powerful enough to cool me down while sleeping).","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1A2GP51EY5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YU0W3CY#wasThisHelpful","R1S1A2GP51EY5S","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a CLASSY looking phone case. You'd never guess it was an Otterbox by looking at it. The fit and finish of the case are very well done. It fits my iPhone 6 like a glove and all the controls are easily accessible. I like that it has a little card slot in the front folio. However, you really can't fit more than 2 cards in there and if you put more than one card in, it starts to get hard to close the case. The front of the case stays shut nicely with the magnetic latch. I think this is perfect when you just want to carry your phone and your ID and maybe a credit card. The color is a nice burgundy like reddish brown that I found very attractive. It does add weight to your phone (obviously) but most protective cases like Otterboxes do. My husband decided not to use it for that reason (he likes very slim, light cases) while I didn't mind it. I like that the front of the phone is protected but without having to put those annoying screen protectors on. However, it can be difficult to take a photo with one hand with the cover flap open -- another issue that my husband had. However, if you're looking for an attractive looking case that offer Otterbox protection, this would do the trick nicely.One note: I'm a little leery of keeping my credit card in the card slot with the magnetic latch. Would it mess with the information on the card? I'm assuming they tested that it wasn't a problem but it still gives me pause and I prefer to keep ""non-essential"" cards or ones with information on them in the case. That is really the only drawback that I found.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XK24TOR3CI9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJK41BC#wasThisHelpful","R2XK24TOR3CI9B","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I remember this program from AGES ago (perhaps back in the 1980s??). It was the program that taught my father to type ... and that is saying something as he was a hunt and peck typist for years and years before learning to type from this program. So when I realized that my 10-year-old son probably needed to learn how to type (I guess it isn't a high school skill anymore like it was when I was in school), I was thrilled to see that good old Mavis Beacon is still around to help him out too.The program has undergone some updates since my dad used it (as is to be expected), but I suspect that the basic method is still the same (although I can't say for sure since I don't have my dad's old copy of Mavis Beacon ... nor do I think we have a computer that could run it.) This version is very customizable (there are user settings up the wazoo that you can set to your liking) and it walks you thought the basics of learning how to type. The box says you can learn how to type in just 8 hours and I can't say I know this is true as my son hasn't had a chance to start using this program yet due to the large amounts of homework that 5th grade seems to require. However, once he has a chance to start using it and learning how to type, I will try to remember to come back and update my review and let you know how it goes.As it is, I tried out the program for myself so I could write this review. However, it is hard to assess a learn to type program when you already know how to type. It really needs to be done with a novice typist. What I did see was impressive though. There are videos you can play, audio prompts, screen shots that show you the keyboard and lots of other aids that make using this program seem very similar to being in a classroom environment. I liked that it covers posture as well as the basics of keyboarding. I like that you can customize the program to how you like to learn. For example, if you don't want the audio prompts, you can turn it off.Overall, I think this is  quality program that I know has been around for a long long time. One of the reasons it is still around is because it works. After all, if Mavis can teach my dad, she can teach anyone!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UY2Y1XUN79KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZJRS8E#wasThisHelpful","R2UY2Y1XUN79KQ","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kit was super well-organized.  Each project comes in its own little clear bag (except for the items that are too big to include and the tape), which makes it easy to find exactly what you need. There is even a little sticker of the finished product on the bag so you know exactly what project is inside.The instruction pamphlet is easy to follow -- large colorful pictures show you exactly what needs to be done. All supplies are included so you don't need to find anything else to make the crafts.There are 9 different projects included in the kit -- ranging from a banner to a crown to several animal crafts. My 10-year-old son made two of the proejcts himself--the Lion and the Lizard/Dino. He was able to follow the instructions on his own and make the crafts independently. They both came out wonderfully and looked very similar to the photos. He was quite pleased with himself that he could do these projects by himself and follow the instructions -- a big deal for him. Although the kit is geared to preschoolers, he quite enjoyed working on the projects so I think the kit could be used by any craft-minded child aged 10 or under.I thought this was a wonderful craft kit that was well-organized and put together.

"I've been searching for a shower caddy that has all the features I'm looking for, and although this one has many of the features I want, it still falls short. Here is a list of the pros and the cons:THE PROS* Lots of room to store multiple bottles of shampoo/conditioner, shaving cream, etc. This was always a problem with other caddies we've used as we couldn't fit my husband's stuff and my stuff in the same caddy.* Several hooks for hanging accessories -- like razors and loofahs. You can never have enough hooks. (Well, I like at least 2 to 4.)* Attractive finish (not cheap looking chrome ... as for resistance to rust, I would have to use it longer to determine this)* Includes a suction cup to help secure the caddy to the shower wall.THE CONS* No flat area to store your soap!! (This is a major problem for me ... it seems like a major oversight. They could have replaced the last set of bottle areas and made a flat shelf)* All the container areas are slanted to the side -- which works OK for ones you pour out but maybe not so well for ""pump-style"" shampoo bottles. Again, this would be solved by having a flat shelf on the top.The bottom line is that this caddy coud use some flat shelving in addition to the slanted slots used to store bottles.Basically, it is an attractive caddy that can store numerous","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R815YWP6OZPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUYN3EU#wasThisHelpful","R2R815YWP6OZPT","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because I am not a technical person, the following review was written by my husband:This review is for the TP-LINK AC1750 Model Archer C8. Opening the box, this router has a larger footprint and was about 3 times heavier than my current router (Linksys E2500). It is also designed to be upright with 3 antennas at the top, so it is more noticeable than the E2500 which is black and lies flat.The setup was very easy. I somewhat followed the quick installation guide, but the instructions didn’t quite match, where you had to change tabs for the quick setup, and they didn’t say that for those that are less technical.I checked for new firmware and updated to the latest version. It does says you may lose some configurations, but I didn’t realize I would lose all my settings for SSID, password, etc. I recommend upgrading the firmware prior to changing any of the default settings.This router has a guest network, which I like better than the one on the E2500. For this router you access the guest network just like any other wireless network, for the E2500, you needed to enter the password in an HTML screen which was a little confusing for some of my guests.Here are some unscientific performance information I gathered to compare this router to my E2500 using my MACs wireless diagnostics.

"Our first exposure to the Spot It! games was with the ""regular"" version that has pictures only (http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Orange-00411-Spot-It/dp/B0039S7NO6/ref=cm_cr-mr-title). I was curious to see how this ""word and pictures"" version varied. My verdict? It is MUCH HARDER!! Your brain has to work on two levels as the one match could be picture/picture, word/word, or word/picture. (It was surprising to see that this was rated for younger age by a year as this version is more challenging.)The game was still as much fun but definitely added another layer of challenge to the game. Do you need to know Disney Princesses to play the game? No ... but it sure helps as we all repeatedly found ourselves calling out ""That girl ... with the blond hair."" (And then the Disney Princes expert at the table would sigh in exasperation ""That is Rapunzel."")The Bottom Line:* Spot It is an awesome game and I highly recommend it -- tons of fun and flexible* This version of Spot It was more challenging because it includes words and pictures -- adding a new layer of challenge* It helps to know the Disney Princesses but isn't required to enjoy and play; however, this version would have more appeal to someone who IS interested or knowledgeable about Disney Princesses. There are more themed versions of Spot It so if the Disney Princesses aren't your thing, check out the other themes available.Final thought: It occurs to me that if you are playing with younger children/girls, this might give them a bit of an advantage over any non-Princessy adults, which might not be a bad thing to ""level"" the playing field for a family game with the a gap between different ages/genders.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6Y4NBQVEBAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0V11CQ#wasThisHelpful","RW6Y4NBQVEBAN","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we first got this game, I thought it was going to be too simple and easy and it seemed like a waste. Boy was I wrong!!! When we played it for the first time at a family gathering, we had SO MUCH FUN! At points, three of us were laughing so hard that we couldn't see. Then, as we read through the directions and saw different variations on how to play, I realized how the most simple games can be the most rewarding and fun.The concept is easy: You get a tin of 55 cards. Each card has about 8 pictures on it. Any card is ONE (and only one) match with any other card. The goal is simply to be the first to find the match between the two cards. Sounds simple, right? Almost too simple. Well, when put into action, the game becomes a ton of fun.When we played, it turned out my husband was some kind robot who could immediately find the match between his card and the others. The rest of us were screaming and trying to find a match -- often with hilarious results (witness my own attempt to get out ""little orange man"" that came out ""bibble man orange"" in a crazy voice or my son's brief but hilarious ""baby bottle"" run that netted him three cards in a row.) All the adults thought it would make a GREAT drinking game ... and we started coming up with our own rules. (If you call out something you don't have or is not on the card, you have to give back one of your cards, etc.)There are a few different ways to play:* flip over 2 cards at a time, whoever spots the match between them get the cards, most cards at end wins* everyone gets a card, one person flips over the rest of the cards one at a time, first person to spot the match between their card and the card in the middle get the card, most cards at end wins* deal out all the cards to whoever is playing and put one card in the middle. Players look at their cards one a time. First play who find the match between their card and the middle card puts their card in the middle and now that is the card you match. First player to get rid of their cards wins.I would highly recommend this for a party game. It is fun, changes with every play, and can be played by anyone. We played with a mixed group of kids and adults and the kids held their own and the adults found it more challenging than they thought. We  saw there are different versions of the game so look around to find the one that might fit your particular needs/interests. However, I don't think you could go wrong with this game.

"If you're not great with math (like me), you'll find the electronic scoring device to be very helpful and handy. However, it is the only thing that is ""improved"" or ""better"" about this version.First off, electronic scoring doesn't mean the board or tiles calculate your score automatically. (When I told my son I was trying Electronic Scrabble, he thought the board would be electronic and you would place your ""smart"" tiles on the board and it would calculate your score, etc. And, to be honest, I think this would be a TRUE version of electronic scrabble for people who still want to play the game as a ""board game"" but without all the pesky figuring out of scores.)  Electronic scoring for this game means a small handheld device (runs on two batteries) that allows you to keep scores for up to 4 players. The unit is easy to learn how to use and easy to set up. You simply indicate how many players and turn the wheel at the bottom to add or subtract points for a player. When you hit the check button, it adds or subtracts the score automatically. If you make a mistake (as we did during our test games), you can go back and fix it. (Though I think you could only go back to the previous player.) The device also includes a timer that allows you to keep the game moving by having a 60-second timer that starts to beep to keep game play moving along. (People taking FOREVER to play their tiles is a pet peeve of mine so I appreciated this feature -- which we only started using once game play started to slow down.) The device shows a star when someone has the highest word score so far in the game, and it shows who had the highest word score at the end of the game. I thought the device was nifty and handy but if you don't have a problem keeping score the ""old-fashioned"" way, there is no real reason to purchase this version of the game.Other than the handheld device, the only real changes were the color and feel of the letter tiles (red and plastic vs. brown and wood). Everyone who was playing the game with me preferred the ""old school"" wooden tiles and felt the plastic ones felt flimsy and insubstantial but it certainly didn't prevent us from playing the game and we all ""got used"" to them.However, my opinion is that this is only worth buying if you really hate to keep score during a Scrabble game and want an easier way to do it. Otherwise, there is no other substantial reason to purchase this version of the game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ODGVH763PLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFWSOZI#wasThisHelpful","R7ODGVH763PLZ","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often feel like I'm replacing batteries every few days -- either for the video game controllers, a wireless computer mouse or keyboard, a board game buzzer. Since I try to be environmentally-friendly and budget-conscious, I always feel a twinge of guilt for how fast we go through AA and AAA batteries. Although I tried rechargable batteries in the past, it felt like it wasn't good to keep them plugged in and ready to charge all the time. So when I saw this Intelligent Battery Charger, I knew I had to try it.The unit itself is quite compact and we keep it on our ""charging"" table (where we plug in all our phones/tablets to be charged). The unit fits right in there without taking up too much space. It can fit either AA or AAA batteries (which is what we use about 99.9% of the time --- although you can get an adaptor for C and D batteries if this is what you use the most). Basically, you put the batteries in and they charge and the display indicates when the batteries are full by saying ""FULL"" on the display screen. EASY! Best of all, the unit features technology to keep things from overheating so you can just leave the batteries in there full-time without worrying. I like that as there are always batteries ready to go. I used a cute little box to store the rechargeable batteries in and place it next to the charger so I know where all the batteries are. I keep uncharged ones in a baggie and charged ones loose in a box. (You do have to buy your own rechargeable batteries ... I picked up a pack of 10 AAs and 2 AAAs from Sam's Club for about $20.)The manual is not the most user-friendly but the unit is user-intuitive and even a non-technical person like myself could set things up easily and quickly. There is a diagram for optimum placement if you are only charging 2 batteries so I appreciated that.Bottom line is that if you want to start using rechargeable batteries, this intelligent charger does a nice job of providing a worry-free to keep them charged and ready to go at a moment's notice. If you can get a discounted rate (Amazon is currently listing it for $30.99 instead of the retail price of $50), I think this would be a no-brainer purchase. I'm thrilled with it and am glad to feel like I'm being more environmentally friendly with the use of this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W5HQRR9GVRB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUZHL4C#wasThisHelpful","R1W5HQRR9GVRB1","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We literally ""road-tested"" this item on a recent 1,200-mile road trip and it worked perfectly! On long road trips, there was always competition about who would get to charge their rapidly depleting device. With this charger, both my husband and I could conveniently charge our iPhones and/or iPads to keep the electronics working throughout the trip -- essential for providing entertainment options for everyone in the family (audiobooks for me, movies for my son/husband, and several travel game apps). We were able to charge both our iPhones 5 with the charger with no problem -- and it charged up my husband's iPad Air as well. Charging didn't seem slower because it was charging two iPhones at once either.The charger plugs into a cigarette lighter so make sure you have one available before purchasing. Also, the charger only comes with ONE charging cord (USB on one end and lightning connector on the other). You will have to use one of the USB connectors you got with your device to charge the second device. (I imagine this shouldn't be a problem for most people. Another option is to purchase a second connector if needed.)Before purchasing, be sure to verify that the charger is compatible with your specific devices.Because my husband was paranoid that the device might drain the battery if plugged in all the time, we removed the charger from the cigarette lighter at rest stops/meal breaks, etc.Overall, we found this a very helpful tool for keeping two devices charged up on a long car trip.

"Here is a list of observations gained while using this camera over the course of 2 to 3 weeks.* Camera unit was bigger than anticipated. I'd estimate the camera part is about the size of a softball (versus the size of baseball that I expected). (It might even be grapefruit size.)* The power cord is nice and long.* You can hang it on the wall but you would need to hang it pretty high as the camera only tilts down and not out.* It was easy to switch the camera ring to blue or pink depending on what you prefer.* You have to create a MyD-Link account to use the app but it was an easy process. In fact, the entire set-up was easy and painless.* It is somewhat difficult to use the focus wheel because you have to hold the camera to adjust it and it can difficult to see what is happening on the screen while working the camera.* The time on the camera view is five hours ahead even though we synced the camera multiple times and the setting time shows up correctly This is quite aggravating and makes it hard to figure out what the actual time is that something was filmed.* The picture is decent -- you can tell what is going on and it isn't fuzzy. If you require a super clear picture, then you'd probably want the HD versus the SD.* Night vision is in black and white -- not ""green.""* Motion sensing and sound sensing both worked fine.* Was able to record video on to an SD card when camera was activated by motion. However, due to problem with the time setting mentioned above, it was difficult to tell when something happened.* The lullaby and talking function worked fine -- with a lag time of about 25 to 30 seconds.* So far, we've always been able to view the ""live view"" of the camera using the app without any problems -- despite being far from home or in the car.Overall I would recommend this camera -- the only real problem was the time setting, which we found very frustrating that we were unable to fix. Should note that we use this to observe our dogs when we aren't home and not a baby. However, we don't see why it wouldn't work excellently as a baby monitor. Could also be used as a low level security camera in a house if you wanted.***** ADDENDUM TO REVIEW: A few months after writing this review, my husband stumbled on the reason why the time was 5 hours off.

"I'm always making my own homemade labels for my son's stuff (using regular labels and putting shipping tape on top)  so I was anxious to see if these work. So far, I've found that they do what they say they will do.

"What I Like:* Clear plastic lets you put important information under it so you can see it for easy reference without having it get in the way* Size is perfect for a regular desktop -- not too big and not too small.* Allows me to write on my desk without getting groove marks in the wood (a problem for me -- a ""heavy"" writer.)What I Don't Like:* It doesn't stay in place and easily moves all around.

"First of all, a disclaimer: I am not an expert in tee ball or baseball or anything. I'm just a mom whose son expressed an interest in baseball so I accepted this tee for review from Amazon Vine. So this review will be written from that point of view.First off, the tee didn't come with any instructions for set-up. Although it was relatively easy to set-up, there were a few things I was unclear about -- how to tighten the thing on the bottom that keeps the base attached to the tee and how to adjust the tee up and down so it doesn't slip. I went on the SKLZ web site and there were no instructions there either. You have to email customer service for it. I'm a big believer that all products should come with instructions regardless of how simple the product. Companies should assume the worst -- like a mom who has no inherent mechanical skill whatsover.As far as I could tell, the tee seems pretty sturdy and durable. It feels substantial. I do like that it comes with a compact little bag and can be easily folded away for storage or transport.As far as usage, I used the tee with 2 10-year-old boys and myself. We each hit about 40 balls off of the tee. It worked well for the most part, but near the end when it was being hit quite a few times, the tee part (the fabric part where the ball rests) kept flying off. It didn't seem to me like that was supposed to happen -- but like I said, I'm not an expert in tees so I wasn't sure if this was normal or not. Since the tee part just rests on top of the pole, it seems like this would happen quite often if you're hitting the tee and not the ball (as can happen with new hitters.)  The tee also got knocked down a few times but that is to be expected.Overall, it seems like a decent tee. However, I'm not sure whether it is worth the price and what other tees are like in comparison. It does seem like it would last for a long time but do expect that the top tee part to come off. Whether the fabric will unroll remains to be seen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29G25SM9TN1I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IH19WM6#wasThisHelpful","R29G25SM9TN1I0","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dry erase ""learn to write letters and numbers"" board is well designed, sturdy and very helpful. The size is large enough that beginning writers have enough space to write but isn't so large that it is too bulky. I like that there are a mix of ""learning"" pages (graphics on how to draw upper and lowercase letters and numbers with the diagrams and arrows found in instructional writing books) and ""open-ended"" pages (where children are asked to write a few sentences and draw). There is one page focused on simple addition, and a page devoted to drawing shapes. (The shape page has a neat little area where children are asked to make a fun picture with the shapes you just learned -- some examples are provided on the left to get them started.) This combination of creative and open-ended mixed with instruction makes this an interesting and versatile teaching tool. The board comes with a black dry erase marker, but I would recommend getting a few colors to make it more interesting for the children. Overall, a well-designed and constructed learning tool that would be wonderful for beginning writers and artists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQV341FH7P9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EWAA2S#wasThisHelpful","R1TQV341FH7P9E","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I married my husband, I didn't have any preference for dishwashing detergent -- I just bought whatever was on sale or smelled nice or hit my fancy at the time. My husband, however, grew up in a ""Dawn household"" and insisted that it was what we had to use. Not caring much one way or the other, I agreed. Since then, I have become a Dawn devotee as well. It cleans really well, doesn't hurt your hands, and comes in a variety of scents and colors with attractive bottles. Best of all, if I burn something or have a tough pan to clean, I know that I can just soak it in Dawn and it will come right off.

"Marisa de los Santos is one of my favorite writers, so I was excited to check out this collaboration with her husband. Lucas Biggs is a corrupt judge who has just sentenced Margaret O'Malley's father to death for a crime he didn't commit. His true crime? Daring to blow the whistle on the corrupt Victory Fuels Corporation, which runs the ""company town"" of Victory, Arizona. Determined to help save her father, Margaret decides to use her family's gift for time travel -- despite her vow of forswearing (a promise never to travel in time.) However, desperate times cause for desperate measures and Margaret takes a chance and travels back to 1938 Victory, Arizona in an attempt to stop the event that caused Lucas Biggs to start down his path to corruption.Each chapter takes place in a different time and has a different narrator -- Margaret and her friend Charlie in 2014 and Grandpa Joshua and Margaret in 1938. (Grandpa Joshua is Charlie's grandfather and a childhood friend of Lucas Biggs.) I enjoyed the flipping back and forth between times as both stories are developed slowly and reveal a bit more of the puzzle of what happened that turned Lucas Biggs into the person he became. Some parts were a bit choppy and confusing -- mostly in the 1938 sections narrated by Joshua. I felt a bit disoriented about his story sometimes so I suspect middle grade readers would as well. However, overall the positives outweigh the negatives and I think it is fine addition to the time travel genre.As for the time travel itself, I thought it was handled really well. The description of how time travel works and the effects it has on those who practice it are described creatively and wonderfully. Also, the fact that time travel has severe consequences was a good message. In fact, the repeated statement that ""history resists"" reminded me of Stephen King's excellent 11/22/63, which also dealt with time travel and is one of my favorite examples of the genre.If you're looking for a smart, well-written time travel book for your middle grade reader, I think this would be an excellent choice. I plan on giving it to my 9-year-old son to read and I'll have to come back and let you know what he thought of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C64JEKXCNBP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062274627#wasThisHelpful","R3C64JEKXCNBP8","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun book that is focused on inspiring girls to consider pursuing science -- though it is done in a very low-key and interesting way that won't necessarily make them realize they are being ""positively influenced."" My 9-year-old son read it with me and found it enjoyable -- though he thought a better title would have been ""My Teenage Grandpa."" That is because that is the fun ""hook"" of this book. Ellie is an 11-year-old girl who is having some difficulty adjusting to middle school life. Her best friend seems to have developed interests that don't include her and now her mother has brought home an annoying teenage boy to live with them. But something about this teenage boy is quite familiar -- and he doesn't necessarily ACT like a teenage boy. He acts, in fact, like her crotchety scientist grandfather.Told in the first-person, the book is a fun, easy read that kept my reluctant reader son interested. When I asked him what the best parts were, he said ""the parts about science."" Mission accomplished! I think this would be a worthwhile middle grade reader for boys and girls alike, but I think girls might get a bit more out of it than boys.A Note: Ellie's parents are divorced and both parents have creative careers in theater -- a pursuit holds little appeal to Ellie. The divorce is handled matter-of-factly and there is no real tension between Ellie's parents, who are quite friendly and amicable. This is in keeping with the light-hearted, slightly madcap aspect of the book (though there is an occasional focus on some deeper themes such as the ""circle of life"" and the importance of aging/grief).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB29HUPPNJ0VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375870644#wasThisHelpful","RB29HUPPNJ0VC","A1X1TY8AT7E03H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X1TY8AT7E03H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Back in the day, I read a few of Lisa Scottoline's novels and didn't fall in love so I never sought her books out again. Then I found her collection of humorous essays (Why My Third Husband Will Be A Dog) and decided to see what it was all about. I thoroughly enjoyed her voice and point-of-view. In addition, the short length (no essay is more than 3 to 4 pages) made the book perfect beach reading. Since then, I've read/listened to a few more of her essay collections -- both in print and on audio (my preferred method as it is just fun to hear Lisa and her daughter Francesca's own voices). ""Have A Nice Guilt Trip"" is another enjoyable visit with the ""Flying Scottolines"" -- and one of my favorite parts of the book are the photos that are interspersed throughout (they have some SUPER CUTE dogs). If you've never tried Lisa Scottoline's humorous essays, I'd recommend them as the perfect choice for summer reading.

With months to go on a shared lease, she turns to her best friends for support and works out a plan in her head for Winning Back Ryan, with the shared lease keeping them tied to an expensive apartment.The friends provide support with lots of drinking, keeping her safe when she spins out of control and giving her time to heal and come to grips with Ryan's betrayal that has been going on throughout most of their two year relationship. The guys, Brian, Ben, George and Max offer support and try to convince her she is better off without Ryan but deep down she finds if hard to give up the first guy she has been with that she planned to spend the rest of her life with.Ryan's behavior keeps getting uglier and uglier with public humiliation, calling her fat and blaming her for his behavior and finally an act of violence.I found the behavior of this group of young adults to be rather immature at times, sometimes funny but mostly they are one confused group of people about what is important in life, although they are figuring it out quickly when the need arrises.

"It works now that I fixed it.Many of the curved shelf pieces were manufactured with the incorrect curvature, resulting in the metal strips not being parallel at the attachment points.  This resulted in the bolt holes not aligning properly and quite a few of the screws breaking when attempting to put together.  The company did send replacement screws, but that took a little over a week, making several shelves unusable during the waiting period. About eight of the curved pieces needed manual bending in order to be able to put the whole thing together.  Now that that's done, it's great!  Would certainly recommend buying the other Enclume stand, the one that is already put together, so as to avoid this frustration.  Spend the extra $30 and purchase the one already assembled & welded.

Although we had it plowed, the combination of thawing and freezing left a thick layer of ice that nothing could get through but this.

"I purchased this duvet insert to use in the spring in the North East.  I already have a warmer weight winter comforter, but needed an all-seasons weight insert, and this certainly fits that bill.  As my husband needs more warmth and I like it cooler at night, this is a good midpoint for us.  It came a couple of days after I ordered it and arrived in a vacuum-sealed bag.  After opening it, it pouffed up nicely.Pro's:  light-medium weight insert, good price, all season use (depending on temperature you keep your home at night.  As another reviewer has said, this would work well in a 55-65 degree bedroom),  the light weight feels nearly weightless during use.Con's: noneUpdate:  we put our heat down to 56 degrees Fahrenheit at night.  This duvet insert keeps both my husband and I comfortable, using nothing more than a comforter cover and a cotton sheet.

"Pro's:  I started taking Seriphos a week ago at night for treatment of elevated cortisol levels during the night.  I am so pleased now that I can sleep through the night!!!  Seriously, this is life changing!!  It had been so long since I could sleep through the night without being awake for several hours and then finally being able to go to sleep when it was time to wake up.  Now I take Seriphos and sleep through with no AM sleepiness.I plan on taking this for a maximum of a couple of months to ""reset"" my circadian rhythm or internal clock so I can sleep at night instead of needing to during the day.  It has been a week and I am starting to feel like I am coming alive after a long time feeling sleepy, wired, and sub-par.  It feels so good to feel good again!Cons: none, except you may need to experiment a bit to find the correct dosage & timing that works optimally for you.Update: I have used this nightly for two weeks and the nights where I have forgotten to take it do not have that solid, sound, deep sleep that this product enables me to have when I take it at night.  It is now helpful to me to have set a recurring alarm to remember the nightly dose so it can re-set circadian rhythm.  I continue to be amazed at the effectiveness of this product in healing adrenal glands.  I am now feeling energetic, motivated, and healthy for the first time in a long time.

"I go through wood & bristle brushes rather quickly because I don't feel that they really get clean enough after use.  This silicone brush is a delight to use and cleans up beautifully.Pro's:  ever so useful in the kitchen, inexpensive, heat resistant, colorful, easy to cleanCons: none.  I don't use it outdoors on the grill, just in my kitchen.  It is better suited for non-grill use as the handle is average length and not long enough to use on a grill without excess heat exposure to your hand.  It is perfect, however, in the kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F5HXJH01EM2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RK5XY6#wasThisHelpful","R2F5HXJH01EM2W","A2DMMMPQILC1QQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DMMMPQILC1QQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this mattress pad due to the excellent reviews it had.  It has certainly earned 5 stars from me.Pro's:  fits on my mattress easily with no struggle, makes the bed feel sooooooo good, helps decrease tossing and turning during the night resulting in  better sleep quality (and a more alert & cheerful me in the morning!), is great for those with arthritis or fibromyalgia, bed just feels more comfortable and luxurious with this pad on, and it is ""down-alternative"" so no allergy issues.Con's:  absolutely none, except it sure is more tempting to linger in bed now ;-)Update: I have had this mattress pad for 8 months and it has not compacted down and is still just as comfortable as when it was purchased.  A recommended Amazon product.Thank you for taking the time to read this review.

"I purchased this and put it on, thinking that it was a lovely, yet light musk oil.  Five minutes later I thought it (the scent) was gone, but I was wrong.  I was out and about, doing errands and was told by a few people that I smelled great, and they inquired what scent it was.  Still, I could not smell a thing, but they could.  Evidently, I am anosmic (unable to smell it) to this musk.  This may be a large molecule musk and some people may not be able to rsmell it on themselves, hence the anosmia (inability to smell it), but others can.Regardless, I rarely get such compliments on any other fragrance, so even though I cannot smell it on myself, others do evidently enjoy it on me a lot, hence my 5-star rating.If this review has been helpful to you, please click ""yes"" below.

"Sebamed Clear Face Antibacterial Cleansing Foam is an effective cleanser for skin with active acne.  I have hormonal acne with very sensitive skin.  Some acne products, even those designed for adult acne, can irritate my sensitive skin and further inflame my skin, causing more breakouts.  This cleanser is a thin liquid in a foamer bottle.  I use one pump of cleanser on my skin in the morning, during my shower, and two at night.  In the morning, I leave it on while  washing my body, shaving, hair conditioning, etc. and rinse just prior to leaving the shower.  At night, I do an oil cleanse method with castor oil to remove makeup, apply a warm, moist face cloth and leave on just until it cools, then apply the Sebamed Foam Cleanser.  With the foam on, I then brush & floss my teeth (this takes 3 minutes).  As the suggested contact time on skin for this product is 3 minutes, I rinse my face just after doing my teeth, and therefore no time is wasted ""waiting around"" for the foam to be on my skin.  It takes no more time or effort than any other cleanser, but is so gentle and effective.  Sebamed products are all excellent, and this one is no exception.  I wish it were not  so expensive ($25/bottle), but it is effective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CL7TTFP1943N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015XGOYW#wasThisHelpful","R2CL7TTFP1943N","A2DMMMPQILC1QQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DMMMPQILC1QQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lerosett Clay mask is a great weapon in your acne treatment regimine.  It's used twice a day for two weeks straight.  At first I thought that there was no way I could possibly be compliant with these instructions, but when I realized that I could put some on upon arising in the morning and rinse it off in the shower, it was doable.  The tube makes it easy to use quickly as the product is already mixed and ready to use.  I knew that I'd want to skip using it if I had to mix a powder and water and then get lumps out.  The tube makes it fast and easy.  Also,  as it is quite transparent and not so noticable on, putting it on for 10 minutes in the evening at home was doable, too.  It leaves your face clean, soft, and glowing.  I applied Lerosett's Moisture Matte after washing it off.  There are minerals in the clay which help to decrease sebum output and calm inflammation, as well as the absorbtive power of the clay itself, making this an excellent anti-acne product.  My pores look smaller and my skin is quickly clearing.  I recommend this product highly for not only younger acne sufferers, but adult acne sufferers as well.Update:  Well, I used this as instructed and was pleased with the results for a couple of months.  Then life got a little hectic and a lot stressful.  I stopped using it.  Yes, my skin again became inflamed and had profuse breakouts.  So I got my jar out (I purchased the large professional size jar for cost savings after the tube was empty) and just put a thin layer on twice a day.  I left it on longer than 10 minutes because I just put it on while having breakfast in the morning and again when relaxing at night.  I also bought Gunilla of Sweden's oral skin supplement, ClearPoint, and added that to my treatment regime to help heal the acne and decrease sebum output. My skin calmed down again.  It works if I use it and it doesn't work if I don't.  That's how I know that the product line is effective for my skin.Acne has such deleterious effects on self-esteem.  I did this review and added the update so that others who have this condition might find healing from this skin disease.If this review has been helpful to you, please click ""yes"" below.

His compassion toward his clients and readers is also quite noticeable in his writing.  It's the best book of its' kind that I've found.

This is the first product I've ever written a review for.I purchased this from the company, did not receive it gratis.  I've been using this for two weeks and love it.

"The book is just a monologue of moves.  It is an opening manual of just the move in database in print form.  .since the book is from the 80s it sort of makes sense since computers and hence computer chess database programs where not rampant at the time.  Ok if you are looking to learn the b6 defense this is not the book for you.  If you are looking to learn theory on the defense this is not the book.  .there are no explanations of the moves.  All you get is a collection of candidate moves and replies.  Is this a bad book?  For many who grew up in the computer age you may not like studying the b6 defense in an old school fashion.  Having said that there is a unique use for the book.  .since there is not much written on the defense and not much in the way of modern databases on this defense, the you may want to add the book to your collection for this opening.  I play b6 about 90% of the time in rapid chess tournaments and have had great success with the defense since many are not booked up on it.  Since implay it a lot Also know not much is out there on the b6 so when i see something on the opening i get it.  .this book is not for learning the  defense, but i use to create my own opening book.  that is i look at the monologue and I enter the moves into my database, as I enter them I also have stockfish analyze the moves and make notes from it on my database program.  So used in conjuction with a modern database and chess engine you may find usefulness for this book.  .as a standalone for todays players may not be a great book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3REFDEML2FE1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0906042445#wasThisHelpful","R3REFDEML2FE1D","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New in Chess published an excellent book called Chess training for post begginers, which is an excellent book for those looking to start studying chess from a positional point of view.  What I found lacking in that book was the few excercises that came with it after each topic.  Well since it was overall a great book I decided to order this book.  What I noticed is that this books covers topics in the Chess Training book but builds on them as well as cover some other topics.  So its like a level two of the Chess Training for post begginers.  Overall this is a great book.  You will cover positional ideas in chess that come into play many times but often miss by players who only think tactically.  What I mean is lots of time people can calculate long force lines and find a good move, but when forced lines dont exist they feel stuck.  More advance players already know that if there are no readily available tactics, to look for positional moves, like restricting an enemy piece on one side of the board and then attacking on the otther wing.  .this book will cover ideas like that as well as other positional ideas like when to exchange a piece when not to, who to take advantage of colors (eg when the position dictactes a weakness on an opponents color) and many more topics.  .this is a great book for move advance players looking to get into positional understanding of chess.  If this is your first time diving into positional chess you may want to start with Chess training for Post beginners or My system before jumping into this book, as either  of those two books will give you a foundation and this book will build on it.  Again i see this book as a part two of the other book written by New in Chess.  So if you liked the other book you will like this one too, as it builds on the that books and adds a few more topics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDDRTT9D8PYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9056914340#wasThisHelpful","R3FDDRTT9D8PYM","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This reminds me of the book idiots guide to chess, but in a lecture format that covers a bit more topics.  This book is probably best suited for Chess coaches who teach at yhe scholastic level and want a guide.  .or a self learner who is learning about chess for the first time,  It will cover all essential knowldge begginers should know, like basic tactics, combinations, pawn structures, development.  The chapter has excercises at the end and also has move by move discussion of a game.  My only real issue with the book is the font.  The book I have is 2013 version but it uses a dot matrix font which makes its harders on the eyes, so i deducted a star for quality of the print.

"I have a few other Capa books, but I hate the otherw mainly because it is written in descriptive, so i end up putting those books down a lot.  This book uses Agebraic notation which is one big plus for modern day chess players.  The book is excellent and well written.  You will go through the games of .capablanca having the moves explain and why some other candidate moves fail.  The book is written is a style that makes its an enjoyable read, some people may not like this some will.  What mean is that unlike other books where it feels like your reading a computer printout of tons of lines, this one tries to keep you engaged on the game.  So if you want just give the answer and get to the point book, you may not like this book.  If you like to be entertained while learning this is a great book.  The book follows the move by move pattern which makes it an idea book for people trying to improve positional understanding in chess, and what better way to learn positional chess than to study the games of classical masters.  I personally find its easier to learn positional play from classical games rather than modern day champions because many relied on grey matter rather than computer  aided lines that todays master use.  Dont get me wrong there is a place for studying modernmasters, but if you are in the developing phase of positional play it will be a lot easier to start with classical games.  This book will help with that.  The other nice thing about the book is that it is also interactive, the author will ask you questions during critical phases in a of a position, a question and answer format.  i really like the question and answer format that are used because it another way the author keeps you engaged in the book.  Too often I have read other annnotated games only to find myself drifting bc the reading was dull.  So this is a great book, well written and very instructive.  For those looking to study games of masters this is a good book to stary with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYO8IJ4PGB00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857446984#wasThisHelpful","R2UYO8IJ4PGB00","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very good book.  But it is not one I would recommend to a beginer.  Mainly dues to large analysis lines the author gives.  This is a nice book for someone who has already gone theough My System, Art of Attack, and Chess Training for Post begginers.  If you already comfortable with the topics in any of those three books, this is a nice book to use next,  If you are new to positional Chess, I would stary with one of the other three books first.  Just this week we had a tournament in my town and walking around seeing others play I quickly notice that there are players who had a better position but gave it up, or failed to take advantage of it.  One person who was playing a higher rated opponent did not pick up the initive after the stronger player wasted two moves in the opening, instead he wasted two of his own.  Another match a person had a plan, and the opponent decided to counter attack, yet the guy with the plan failed to ignore the counter attack not realizing his attack was superior and decisive.  This person had a mate threat, or have his opponent lose a queen to stop the mate, yet he got fixated on the counter attack, and fixated on losing a pawn that he decided to postpone his attack and defend the pawn, i  doing so his opponent spotted the mate threat and moved away from it.  So this one person settled for a draw rather than a win.  My point is that many people seem to get fixated on an idea or two and forget about the big picture.  This book is rather refreshing in that it will illustrate the big picture, you will see games where you can ignore a person threat, when your threat is even bigger, it will show you why what looks like an obvious move to non masters, is often ignore by masters eg.  a master/grand master not taking a hanging piece and making some positional move instead.  The book will show you how you can maintain the iniative when you have it and discuss standard attack plans as well as understanding pawn structures.  the book is basically an attacking manual similar, but not the same as Art of Attack, this book is more advance.  I guess an analogy would be Art of Attack is to Pre-Calculus as Sacrifice and Initiative  in Chess is to Calculus.  Very good book, but not for a begginer,  or someone not yet comfortable with any of the three books I mentioned earlier.  The book can be used in several ways, the games are given to you from stary to the end, and then there will be a diagram with the key position.  Before I read the book, I just went to the diagram sort of like the puzzle and see if  I could figure out the move before reading the annotations, so my first week with the book I used it as a puzzle book,  I later went back read the book and the analysis and played the games out on my pc.  The analysis part is detailed and I recommend you use a computer or a chess board when looking at the alternatives lines discussed in the analysis section as well as the actual game.  Again Excellent book for more advance players that enjoy playing aggressive games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVGB80HEF1A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9056914316#wasThisHelpful","R2VVGB80HEF1A0","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terrible product.  Here is my experience.  First I got the device and when I first turn it on, it says must have power button on ON position.  I had it on the ON position and the screen never changed.  It was defective.  Well in the package there is a little card that says if you have issues with the device to call them and not return it.  I call the number and I am told I can Purchase some sort of warranty.  I told them it does not work out of the box.  So I decided to take it back to walmart for an exchange, thinking maybe it was just this device.  I got a second one and same issue the computer says there is something wrong with the device, and not even the two songs that came in the device can be played.  The other thing is they have a link to a website that has tutorials on how to use this device and when you go to the site, its not the same sitye and the device is not one of the listed devices.

"Excellent book.  I have many chess books and people in my town who play chess at different levels always ask me to borrow a book because of a certain need.  One common thing I get asked is how to formulate a plan, and its usally stronger beginners and intermediate level players (1700 and below) .  .what .i have notice is many seem to have a good understanding of tactics and calculating forced lines.  .the problem seems to be what to do when there are no good forced lines.  In this case you should be looking for a positional advantage, when no readily available tactic exist.  The problem is what to do.  There are two books I recomend for this and thats this book and Nimzovitch My System.  The feedback i get from many beginners regarding My System, is that is still a difficult book, to understand.  Intermediate level players love My System.  With This book I find that both beginners and intermediate level players really like this book.  The book is written in an easy to understand and follow manner.  It will teach you who to formulate a plan, and who to determine ""true"" value of a piece.  For example many see the value of a rook as 5, queen 9, pawn 1.  And while this rule work well in many situations, there are situations when say a rook is worth 3 points based on its position.  So lets say a rook is on one side of the board, and is in a spot where it cant get into play readily, the book will tell you to focus your attack on the opposite side of the board.  You will learn what to do when the king is stuck in the middle of the board.  How to spot weak square and weak pawns, and how to exploit them, and many other things to look for in a given position.  This is a great book for both strong beginners and intermediate players looking to learn the positional side of chess.  If you are looking to start studying chess from a positional perspective I recommend this book or My System (ideally you should study both at one point)  But if you are not certai  which to study first, .i would start with this book first.

By intermediate I mean puzzles that dont give you a clue, like clue you in on what to look for Mate in 3, find the pin, find the fork etc...  So if you already have an understanding of basic tactical motifs you will like this book.  If you are just starting off and dont have a grasp of basic tactics then you may not like this book at this stage.  What is really apealling about the puzzles is that you are not always going to get a mate or go up a big piece.  Many of the puzzles involve creating a threat and going up a pawn and a few puzzles you need to recognize the position is lost and go for a draw.  And in real play you will find one pawn can be the difference between a win and a loss.  When I was first working out the problems I was thinking They were using the same puzzles as the previous book, but I did not find a duplicate and realize that its my pattern recognition that has improved. The puzzles are from real games and if you are a clubhouse/coffee shop player your going to see these motifs appear a lot.  It is an excellent book, lots of puzzles and great practice.  like the first volume, this is a nice book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HI3SWZNZSXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857449851#wasThisHelpful","R21HI3SWZNZSXQ","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I play a lot of coffee shop chess and notice that many people rank in the 1200 to 1400 have days when they play real well and days when they just cant finish correctly.  And it seems like the issues is they are not sure on how to formulate a plan.  At the same time I find that many in the range of 1800 tend to use the attack methobs in this books.  So what i tell those that are lower rank is to study this book, especially for those that love to play 1e4.  The book is a tactical and strategical book in one, but not like a puzzle book.  You will be studying games and taken to a key position, where you can launch the attack.  The book will show you what the requirement are for an attack what weak squares to focus on and what your opponents most likely replies will be.  You will learn how to attack the king that has yet to castle, how to attack the castled king and even how to bust up the fianchetto.  This is basically an attacking manual.  What i have notice is people that were lower rank, tend to jump up in rating quickly, because they are learning how to formulate a plan, and since the illustrative  games are attacking games the games are not boring.  The nice thing also is that you are taking the first steps in positional play, and you are starting to study annotated games, so your killing several birds with one stone.  I recall when I first read this book, many years ago I was  only 1200 and my rating shot up to 1500, and I was giving 1800 a hard time getting the win because i starting to recognize the attack formations and waited to a critical moment to mess up their plan, while I was still losing to 1800 during this time it was not because they killed me in the middle game but because i lost in the endgame.  But I took it as a personal win because I was no longer getting crush in the middle game.  This is an excellent book and one that people showed read.  You will learn a lot from this book, you will take steps to become a positional player, and you will become better at formulating attacking plans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSNXX60J8ECY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857444000#wasThisHelpful","R1JSNXX60J8ECY","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent book.  There Arent  very many books on this opening so this fills in a nice void.  I play unorthodox openings in rapid chess and have had great success with it in rapid chess.  This book is well written and very easy to follow, it also has a question and answer format, where you are asked question regarding certain moves.  It covers areas to focus on, where weakeness exist, where traps exist within the game you are covering.  Like some of the other .excellent books from Cyrus Lakdawala, I would recommend this as your second book.  There is an older book written by andrew soltis, who wrote a small book on this opening, it covers than main candidate moves and most common repies with out deep analysis of multiple subvariations.  so andrew soltis book is a great book to start with, and its one that if you have the time you can finish in a week,  .once you have finished with that book this is where This books works nicely, it will give you the thoery behind the moves you learn, so once your opponent is out of book you know where to attack or concentrate your forces.  so these two books I feel work well together.  Once you are done with these two books you can build on your knowledge and learn subvariations then you can move one to play 1b3  a book written by new in chess, ilay odessky.  The third book is more complicated, and it will probably be easier to learn with the first two books I mentioned.  There is another  book on the opening called nimzo larsen attack from everyman chess.  The fourth book is horrible in my opinion, white does not win half of the illustration games in the book, so you wont  learn to win with that book (which is sad bc i suspect most that buy that book want to win).  Well back to this book.  Again this book is well written and simp,emto understand, you are given the theory of the move, what the players are trying to do and whether they missed a better opportunity, it is not bloated with subvariations whoch is good when you are first learning the opening, bc you can spend a long long time just studying one variation.  .the question  and answer  portion with have you actively involved in the game you are studying.  When you are done, you have have a good understanding of the position weaknesses, strength, and how to launch your attack and where your opponent may attempt a counter attack.  While this may not be the best opening at the grandmaster level, many of your non grandmaster opponents will not be booked up on it, will not have much memorized and will have to rely on their skill rather than memory.  Also if you play rapid chess, you may end up with a huge time advantage.  In Blitz matches I have been averaging about a two minute time advantage when using thisnopening as white bc by opponent pauses to think and all the time the clock keeps thinking.  So enjoy this book and enjoy the opening, and have fun racking up rate points.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EC0WABF3ED5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781941122#wasThisHelpful","R26EC0WABF3ED5","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this program at a office supply store for $10 so at that prize i was ok taking a chance.  I have a few chess programs already, hiarchs, shredder, and chessmaster 9000 and now fritz.  I will say out of all of them Chessmaster 9000 (I tried the newers CM versions and dont like them) is my favorite for ease of use and analysing my own tournament games.  The user interface is not great on fritz.  Its difficult to figure out, and it has very little features like chessmaster 9000. About the only things I like the program for is for its ability to read other Chess base cd.s  Chessbase the owners of Fritz sell a ton of cd's  add thatnwill work woth this,  for example, a chessbase cd on the sicilian opening will work with this program.  so if you are looking to get some of the other chessbase cd this may be a cheaper way of using them rather than buying the expensive chessabase and then the expensive add ons.  Other than that i am not impressed with this program, its ok.  I find the older chessmaster program a lot better and user friendly and better game analyser.  When I talk about analysing im talking about entering my game into the programs and having it annotate it for me telling me what opportunities i missed, what defense i missed etc, in a simple, easy to understand manner, chessmaster 9000 does this, if Fritz does it I havent figure its out.  Also by analysis im not talking about being given a ton of lines with different scores.  im talking about a simple what move did a miss analysis.  So if you can get it this program for under 10 like I did the  .i would say get it for its ability to run other chessbase add ons otherwise get the free stockfish instead of this, which will do more than this version of fritz and is just as strong as an engine.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8GDH49EU9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OVCWHK#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8GDH49EU9M","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few chess programs, this one, Fritz, Shredder, Hiarchs, stockfish.  Out of all of them this one is my favorite.  It is not the strongest chess engine but for me it works well.  It is the easiest of all the programs to use. the Main reason I like it, is for Analyzing my tournament games.  My other chess programs have their place, but it seems to fall short in analyzing my games in a SIMPLE manner.  When I try to analyze games on the other engines, It is just too deep, and gives too many sub variations so much so that i can spend days going over one game.  With Chessmaster it cuts to the chase.  It will annotate your game tell you if you miss an attack or left a piece hanging, simple.  It will tell you when you went out of book, in plain simple language and without a boat load of sub variations.  Lots of people prefer the other engines for deeper analysis, but again like I mentioned earlier, I just want a program that tells me what opportunities I missed, if l left something hanging simple stuff.  I guess the best way to describe it is Chessmaster is like Using an Apple device (intuitive) and the other programs is like using a Linux device(not intuitive), if that helps anyone.  Again there are benefits to all these programs but for analyzing my own games I like Chessmaster for its get to the point annotation of my game.  The program has a lot of other features, which you can read about in the products description section.  Initially I was not sure about how to rate this program.  The program itself is a 5.  I was not sure if I should lower it because its 2015 and I  read that some people had issues installing it on modern PC.  I had owned this program years ago and lost the disk but I liked its ability to Analyze my games and I still have a Windows XP desktop in my garage so worst case scenario for was that I get the xp out again.  Initially I installed the program under windows 8.1.  And its started to run and just stopped.  Then I saw the cd case say windows 98/ME so I changed compatibility mode on my windows 8.1 to windows ME... Well it ran but a minute later would crash all the time.  I almost gave up and was going to head to  the garage to get my XP out when I decided to run it in windows XP (service pack3 ) compatibility mode and it worked. So I decided to give it five stars, since it works on my window 8.1 desktop.  Another issue you may have during installation is that it may ask to insert disk one and it still wont work, so I put disk two and it worked.  If you have issues try running it compatibility mode for xp service pack 3.  I included a picture of a screen shot and you can see the analysis of a game.  I made random movesfor both sides and let Chessmaster analyze the game and in the picture you can see the analysis it gave for the fourth move for black.  So if you are looking for the strongest chess engine this is not for you.  If you are looking for a multitude of sub variations and scores for those sub variations, this program does it but the other ones like Fritz are stronger and deeper, so you may not like this compared to the other programs.  If you  are looking for a program that is strong yet simple to use this is a great program.  If you are looking for a program to analyze your games and give you a simple to understand analysis and what you missed, what a better move should have been this program is great.  It also has some tutorials in it, so if you are looking for that you will like this.  Great Program, great price...","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NK29C7ZBC959/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032TIXPU#wasThisHelpful","R3NK29C7ZBC959","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy playing tons of rapid chess and as a result I like to stay stay sharp.  This book is excellent lots of puzzles and like other reviews I agree that  its better than than first (which is also excellent).  The book is for intermediate level players, that is you are not given clues like in begginers tactic books where you are to, to find a fork, skewer etc.  No clues are given, and this is how chess works.  The puzzles are not from .grandmaster games same as the first book.  But, This is exactly what I wanted, Bc at the clubs and local tournaments where I live ratings range and I end up getting paired up with players with all sorts of ratings, and its nice to spot mistakes in their games and quickly take advantage of it.  This book has a ton of puzzles with all range of difficulties and since  they are not GMs many arouse from a bad move (not necessarily a blunder) and after a while you will spot mistakes, and this will carry over into your personal games.  In Rapid chess being able to spot mistakes quickly and take advantage of it can be crucial since Time plays a big role, being able to spot them quickly can give  you an advantage.  After working through this book you will see the rewards in your games especially if you like rapid chess like I do.  Like the first book, if you are looking for Puzzles from GM games this book may not be for you.  But if you are looking for a book where a bad move was made and you wanna spot the exploit quickly this book will be an asset.  .Again this is good for intermediate level players, but I should clarify, intermediate level players in the USCF range 1200 to 1400.  The book may not be great for advance players or intermediate level players approaching advance.  Having said that, I personally find this book to be very good for its intended audience, and I myself use the book to test how fast I can solve the puzzles. So there is a use for the book if you are advance and want to test how fast you can solve the answers.  I really enjoy this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1X32MBFRQ4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9056915371#wasThisHelpful","R2K1X32MBFRQ4S","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice book.  I have a ton of different chess books and this one i like a lot.  Lots of puzzles and I got at a good prize.  This puzzle book is excellent for intermediate level players.  people ask me what i mean by that and when I say intermediate I mean its puzzles that dont give clues as opposed to tactics books that clue you in on what to look for, eg chapter on forks.  This book assumes you already know basic tactical motifs and its your job to find it.  I dont call it advance because I personally classified advance puzzle books as those requiring prepatory moves and or have multiple subvariations (each several moves deep) that can work but has one best move relative to the other varitions.  Dont get wrong, this book has a nice portion of difficult puzzles.  The puzzles are also not grandmaster games, which is what i was looking for (some people prefer GM game puzzles so if you are looking for that this book may not be to your liking).  I play a lot of blitz  and rapid chess games and many times you will get positions from your opponent that are not perfect and its nice to spot it quickly and take advantage  of it.  Some of the postions in these puzzles may appear in one of you rapid chess games.  overall great book for those rated 1200 to 1400 who already have the concept of tactics, but want to practice spotting them with out clues.  Advance players and stronger intermediate may find the puzzles too easy, but thats should not be a reason to not get the book.  I personally use this book for pre blitz tournament practice.  I time myself to see if I can solve so many puzzles in a given amount of time (spped test) So it can be a useful too for advance players that like playing blitz tournaments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQHFPF8TGN9XF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9056914383#wasThisHelpful","RQHFPF8TGN9XF","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I play B6 a lot and have many books on this opening.  I enjoy it for its shock value, and for taking my opponent out of memorized lines.  I play this opening in rapid chess tournaments as my main defense against most of whites openings and I have had great success with it.  While 1...B6 is not considered a great defense at the grandmaster level, at lower levels many are not booked up on this opening and it ends up being a great defense.  This book is excellent for someone looking to take up the opening, I would recommend this as your second book and not your first book when first learning this opening.  The reason is the book winning with the english defese (the b6 defense) by Andrew Soltis is a good primer on the opening and once you have gone through that book, then this book should be next.  This book will discuss games that have been played and describe the reason for each move.  It will explain why a certain candidate move is bad, why another is better, where to focus your forces where to look out for counter attack, and what your position should look like.  The book is well written and has many question and answer format as well.  For example after 1e4  b6  2nc3 Bb7  the book will ask you a question on why the ""natural"" move Nc3 is bad.  As you read the answer you find out that the move allows black to set up a nasty pin and a potential trap.So as you play through the games you will learn a lot at each step of the opening.  This is an excellent book.  Again I would use this as my second book to study, if I was learning it for the first time. And the every man version as the third book to study.  The reason is Soltis book on the opening is a small book but gives you the main candidate replies and moves, you can finish the book in a week or less and have a good idea of the common replies.  Envetually you want to learn the reason for the moves and this is where this book works well, you will play through games have the moves explained.  Finally when you are done with this book I would  move on to everyman chess book on the opening, Play B6 (the one written by Christian Bauer) the last book has a great deal of subvariations that you want to learn after you have the core of the opening down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSSKT8PUXSTSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781942234#wasThisHelpful","RSSKT8PUXSTSA","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this book as an initial book to start studying endgames.  I have several endgames books some easier and some more difficult.  Pandolfinnis book so far is the easiest endgame book i have but it seems geared to children.  I wanted something about emdgame basics but not a book written for kids,  and this book works well.  The book actually starts off in the intro, and here it describes to you each piece and its strength and its weakness in an endgame.  for example a knight on B2 vs Rook is in big trouble...  So if you have the knight you want to avoid it and equivalent square, if you have the rook you want to force their knight to that square or an equivalent.  (if this doesnt make sense, then this is a good book to start with as it will all be explained).  I have attached a picture and if the picture does not make sense when you first see it then this book will help you a lot.  The book main focus is to get the basics down packed.  The chapters give you theory,  then examples, and then some challenges for you to try.  What I have noticed is that other endgame books have more in depth analysis and variations, but assume you already know the basics.  So if you dont understand the basics the more advance books may not make sense.  After reading a chapter in this book,  I like to set up the challenge position on my computer and play that position against the computer at maximum strength.  If you got the concept down, you should be able to defeat the computer at maximum ELO, with no problem. The other nice thing is that if you find yourself in a bad spot, it teaches you how to go for a draw as well.  Very nice book for someone looking to start studying endgames.  If you know what the picture is that I attached you may find is book to basic for you.  if you dont know what the picture is about then this is a good book to start with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQTXY58DWDPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9056912445#wasThisHelpful","R1NQTXY58DWDPN","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent book to start off with the English.  Other books are filled with so many subvariations that you can spend ages trying to learn just one line.

"I have always heard the best way to improve in chess is to study endgames.  this book has helped out a lot.  Initially I was playing very tactical games, which I enjoy, but I seemed to have plateaued.  I have noticed from my own games that I struggle in the end game and decided it time to strecthened this aspect of it and hence .i got this book.  The book is well written and described the ideas of the moves as well as give you a,ternatives moves and why they fail.  Intially the studying endgame was dull, since most of my chess studying has been based on attack techniques.  Since taking up this book, my methob of strategy has changed, I find my self trying to get to an endgame rather than playing in the middle game when I recognize the winning endgame position.  Also studying this book has had other benefits, I noticed I play closed games a lot better, and my depth of analysis has increased a lot as a result of studying endgames with this book.  .my only issue has been that its a slow process, for example I can finish a tactics puzzle book in one week. This book took me a lot lot longer since endgames require deeper thinking.  The book is excellent, well written and teaches you what is going on in the endgames played by GM.  .it explains why other moves where bad and is excellent when used in conjuction with a chess engine.  Imwould study one chapter in this book, when I felt confident about the chapter I would set up the position against shredder at maximum elo and try to beat it.  You will be suprise who much your game will improve when you are done with this book.  You may not see the benefits in the short term but in the long haul, it will pay a lot of dividends...,  Excellent book for those who want to take it up another level.I have the paperback version I dont have the kindle version but it says kindle format next to my review.

A text book is just too long for me to work with because of time constraints and since I had an idea of the topic i just needed to work out problems seeing the steps.

"I was initially intrigued by the price and it being a quad core tablet that runs windows.  One day one I noticed that it does not run like a quad core and lags a lot.  It felt like I was running an atom processor net book rather than a quad core.  Second thing I notice is that the keyboard that comes with it does not work well some letter did not work unless I pressed several times until the letter appeared.  The touchpad on the keyboard is also buggy, It turns on and switches other screens and features when all I want to do is scroll down a page.  My other issues is in desktop mode they inverted certain functions, stuff that was once right click is now left click and vice versa, really annoying switch.  The computer works in two mode in window mode and in a tablet mode.  I find out easier to work in the desktop mode as tablet mode is not very intuitive like on an android or ipad as well as being buggy especially when all you are trying to do is scroll down.  As a tablet I would say it sucks as a netbook it will work ok if you use a wireless mouse rather than the keypad.  If you are looking to run big application other than Office dont buy this.  Also the tablet has some quirky habits after a month, there are times when it just does not want to turn on or powerdown.  And random times the screen just goes black.  The built in camera is bad.

"Here is my story.  As I would drive i notice the the car appeared to suddenly shift.the shift wasnt hard, but enough to notice it, no check engne light was on.  About two months later i notice in the morning and at slower mph it started to shift harder.  Eventually the check engine light went on.  I decided to take the car to a shop and they told me they would have my car fixed in no more than two days.  Two weeks had gone by and I called to find out the status of the car.  I was given the run around.one guy told me that havent looked at it yet (after two weeks) and another told me they are waiting for a missing part.  Anyway i noticed at the shop that my car hadnt even been moved.  Because it had rain earlier and my car wheel left a dent in the dirt where i parked it.  That dent in the dirt by the wheel was still there after two weeks only the dirt was dry.  I decided to just take the car to a different shop.  The guy took the code reader to the car when I asked for it and then drove the car to me.  I noticed he deleted the check engine light.  I drove the car to a new shop and it started shift hard and accelerate the rpm with out increasing speed, but check engine light was still off.  The  new car shop said with out the code the price can range from any where from a few hundred to a few thousand, so to drive it until it turned on again.  The first shop somehow deleted the history too.  Well I had an issue in that I am leaving the country for two months and if the repair took more than three days i wasnt going to be in town.  the check engine light had  not gone on.  But it kept shifting hard I added lucas fix and in a few minutes the hard shifting stopped.  Months after the incident the issue has not return. Im sure the problem may still exist but with out the code its hard for the mechanics to know what the exact problem is.  So still driving it with  no issues.  lucas Trasmission fix seems to work well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TM2NTUUE8AIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ARTZPO#wasThisHelpful","R1TM2NTUUE8AIY","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"best phone ever.  i traveo between usa and canada a lot so dual sim is great.  one phone that has two Numbers one usa and one canadian.  the phone is fast and very responsive its like 3 iphones in one. the battery life it last a long time the perfect phone.  with this phonenu dont need a samsung or an iphone.  this phone is what the iphone 8 will be. way ahead of its timeUpdate Feb 3 2015.Originally I gave the phone 5 stars.  two months into having the phone there are some issues.  Biggest issue is the phone has done a few full resets on its own wiping out all data and apps.  At first I taught i may have pressed a wrong button, but after the phone reset set itself a few times On its own, its a glitch in the phone.  Second issue it the sleep button does not always work.  It is very random.  at times it works at times it does nothing.Third issue many times when the ohone goes to sleep it wont wake up and cant even be powered down so you have to wait for the phone to stop acting up which at times can be many minutes, so your  stuck with a phone you cant use.So be carefl with this phone and data you store on it.  The self resets can be brutal, especially when it deletes that that cant readily be backed up.  And it sucks losing all your apps and having to reinstall them all.  The other issues is there are times on a self reset where the phone freezes and is unresponsive text written in Chineese.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MDEV7NSVSVYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0DRLQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1MDEV7NSVSVYX","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"i got this jacket for work in Artic Bay Canada (polar Bear Country)  and as you can guess it gets cold.  i had applied for a job and I was hired, and only given two day notice to get to Canada. Living in AZ, Getting cold wear is impossible on short notice.  So I looked at this product and Canada goose.  Canada goose could not deliver over night which was important as i had to be in Canada i two days.  Refrigiware guaranteed delivery and came through.  Initially i was skeptical of the jacket working bc it appeared thin compared to canada goose.  But it worked very well, but you have to buy the cap seperate which could be a negative for most, but when you compare the price of this vs goose, you still save hundreds.  My first day in the artic I was not sure what to expect, so i layered a small fleese jackect and a small wind breaker under this coat.  As I walked five minutes to my work location, I noticed .i was sweating (so i was over heating)  since its only a few minutes no big deal.  But at -40celcius i did not need to layer two small jackets.  the avg temp while i was in artic bay was -40 celcius and the jacket with the cap sold seperately worked very well at keeping me warm.  A nice feature of this vs Canada goose (my colleague had a canada goose)  was the big pockets.  I had a bunch of stuff in them that my friend could not carry bc the goose pockets were small relative to refrigiwares jacket.  The thing to keep in mind is that the jackets acts like a thermos (keeps  warm warm, cold cold) so if you putiton indoors it retains that temp while if you put it on ina colder temp, its going to stay cooler longer.  My only con with this is the cap. Its sold seperate and not the greatest cap.Pros-  kept me warm at -40celcius average temp when i was there and even when the temp dropped to -50 celcius-  big pockets that come in handy.  I housed a ipad mini in it- can be layered easily.  (my friend who had the canada goose complained of cold and tried layering but then found movement restricted.  I had no issues with movement, if anything thing i was getting hot at -50 celcius when i layered so i over layered)- price vs the popular choicecons.-The cap is sold seperate (but even purchased seperate still hundred cheaper than the copetitor)-  the cap is not best design.  it worked for me.  I recommend using a neck warmer if you have a big skull like i do ( i have a large cranium so i always have issues with all types of hats hot fitting well) (my friend who wore the canada goose also had to use a neck warmer) but neck warmers are inexpesinve so not a deal breaker.Overall the jacket worked very well at keeping me warm in the artic. For the price its an excellent jacket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJPQ2JA487TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMUB32G#wasThisHelpful","R2FJPQ2JA487TQ","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in the United States and applied for a job in Nunavut Canada, Artic Bay.  I was suppose to start work in a few months, but had recieved a call from my employer if I could start in Two Days.  Well because of short notice I had and living in AZ this was the only glove I found in short notice.  The gloves are rated for -10 f or -23 celcius.  I had no issues in Artic Bay when the temp dropped to -50c which is about -58f.  The gloves kept my hands warm.  Initially they appear stiff, but once they break in they functioned well for me.  the only thing to be careful of, is that the gloves retain tempature well.  So if you put the gloves on in a nice warm room, it holds that temp well sort of acts like a thermos (keeps cold stuff cold warm stuff warm)  If you make the mistake I did of taking the gloves off outdoors to take pictures of the sceneary with bare hands and then put them back on into the gloves it can take a while for you hands to warm up.  so dont make that mistake with any gloves you get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJ59BRV04N2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2Y29BE#wasThisHelpful","R1WJ59BRV04N2I","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"was excited about receiving the cape, until I opened it.  Its not the Green and Yellow Packer Cape in the Picture.  Its Black and Yellow with no green... It looks  Likes Pitts cape except with a G... If you look at the picture it portrays a dark green cape...  .this is was balck and yellow cape.Update :  Nov 10 2014I contacted the makers of this and useless.  I was told that it is Green and Yellow i just have to put it in sunlight.  In sunlight its still black.  The Cape has two colors one side green and one side black but the logo is on the black side.  Im guessing this flag is intended for packer on one side and steelers on the other, but the producers forgot to flip the colors when printing.  I had ordered two from different seller and both the logos are printed with the wrong colors.  And again it is  not green in sunlight.  I know the producers realized they messed up and dont want to refund any money, so on their site it originally said the cape is done with the teams logo with the teams colors, I went back and noticed they removed the teams color description from the packers flag but left that part for all other teams.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LNHDIIVO4VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J508DJ6#wasThisHelpful","R22LNHDIIVO4VP","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nice textbook.  Intially I was not sure if i should give it a four or a five.  The reason is at times it can go off on a bit of a tanget by describing something in more detailed than is necessary for the class.  I then recall my time when I was in college and seeing a term and not knowing why its important or howit relates, so then i discovered the reason for the authors doing this. So for those who find it uncessary it may be because you already have knowledge of other science fields like biochemistry and it may seem like over kill, but if you have not been exposed to other advance clases than this will help explain why its an important piece of information.  So  i could not gove the boom four stars for having more info than necessary, more info is better than lack of info or incomplete information.  I remember when I took the course manynyears ago i got to the topic erythorcyte disorder, and the book gave examples of disorder, like sickle cell, polycythemia etc.  I recalll seeing polycythemia and wondering what is that?  But bc i had other classes all i did was memorize polycythemia is an example of erythrocyte disorder...

My plans allow me to receive call and send calls in either country, so if a Canadian calls my Canadian number it will ring in the US, if an American calls my US number while im in Canada, it will ring in Canada.  But I was carrying two seperate phones.  This phone made it easy to combime both phones into one.  I took the sims out of the other two phones and put it into this one.  Now  I only carry one phone, with two different phone numbers one Canadian, and one American.  I also like that it is slim and fits in my pocket.  a nice feature is that the quick on button is on the top rather than pressing any key which helps prevent pocket dailing.  as a smart phone I would not call it one.  Its got some features but water down, if your looking for apps and all that smartphone stuff this is not it.  If you are looking for a dual sim phone for mainly calling and texting this is an excellent phone.  The price was nice too.  The only drawback was the instruction were not English, but i found the phone easy to figure out.i was going to give it four stars bc of the instructions, but in my case i was looking for a good inexpensive dual sim phone and it hasnt let me down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVISDDBDEA7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XAVNNM#wasThisHelpful","R2MVISDDBDEA7E","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dont own any new cars.  All the cars I have have been what most would call clunkers.  I have a 1999 oldsmobile intrigue, when I first got it  I paid under a 1k for it and was told its sold for parts and i would be lucky if i got a 1000 miles on it.  At first the car was very loud, and burnt oil.  repairing would have cost more than the car and at the time i was down on my luck and really didnt have the money to do a complete fix of the car.  Well My retail store started selling this oil for the same price as the other synthethic  brands so i decided to use this brand instead.  Well the result was my car got quiter and bc the oil can handle higher temps, the burning was gone.  if I put conventional oil back in the burning return.  so I continued to use thisnbrand.  Long story short, when i got the car hoping to get at least 1000 miles on it the car had 120k miles.  Today its still running and I have over 300k on it.  And my dad has been using it as a daily driver to work.I have a 2002 caravan, when i got it had 90k on it, today its still running well with over 200k on it, and my mom uses this as her daily car.My hyundai had 80k and now has 150k and running strong, this is my daily driver.I havent done any major work on any of the card other than routine work like radioator flush, fluid changes thats it.  While I cant say definative that the  reason the cars are still running well is because of the oil.  I have to say i think its a major role. I live in AZ  and we hit 114f  here and i travel from phx to yuma frequently and i dont think many other oils will handle the long drive at those tempatures very long.  so i think this oil played a big role in keeping the cars running like when i first got them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC58RXUYNJNZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SKV4P2#wasThisHelpful","RC58RXUYNJNZ3","A2CPAL7DLKFLWM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CPAL7DLKFLWM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will start off with I am not much into cliffhangers when it comes to books. I need a complete book from beginning to end with some sort of resolve otherwise I feel short changed. Yes the author Tess Diamond did give you the kidnapper but I still feel like if she wanted to have a cliffhanger she could have given a little more meat to the story.The ending of the book was a nail biter but it felt more like an episode of 24 than a compete novel.Meggie our female lead was The best FBI hostage negotiator but when things go wrong on her last case Meggie leaves the FBI. Meggie former boss pulls her back in for one last case a Senator daughter has been kidnapped. While in search of the daughter former special forces security expert Jake O’Connor tries to push Meggie out of the way until they both realize they need each other to find the missing daughter. Yes sexual attention is in the air but they both know their job to find the missing girl. I enjoyed the gym scene it gave the book a little more light when Meggie suggested Jake was a meat head.With the book being a cliffhanger I needed more meat to Meggie background her kidnapping and why she joined the FBI. I personally felt it was skimmed over to quickly in this book.It is a quick paced story that keeps the reader hooked. Tess Diamond keeps a great pace so the book never has a dull or slow moment which will keep the reader hooked until the end.Tess writes like the style of Kendra Elliot but lacks the polish that will set this book apart from others in the same genre.Thank you to author for providing me the E-copy for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26H119UQZ8HP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017JSEGQO#wasThisHelpful","R26H119UQZ8HP8","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact I have about a dozen vintage hats from the 1930-1960's all different and all different quality. This hat while is beautiful doesn't even come close to the quality these hats are over 50 years later.  The glue used to hold the fathers on was caught all over the hat. One of the feathers already pulled away from the glue and I can't see the rest doing that as well.  The fabric used is really heavy making the hat look heavy.

I will be using this in my classroom so it will get a major workout in a few months - it will be interesting to see how it holds up to all the pencils the kids push in to sharpen.

"Here I go again provides a new twist on the time travel to fix your lifegenre.  Too often we see the protagonist recognize that somewhere along theway they really screwed up their life.  Than through some mystical meansthey are able to return to the days it all went wrong, make changes, andthen all is well.  Think Peggy Sue Got Married or even Back to the Future.Jen Lancaster’s twist is quite unique and well told.  The heroine, LissyRyder, is quite a self-centered, thoroughly distasteful individual; andeveryone at her 20th High School reunion has no problem sharing that withher.  Playing on the Whitesnake song name, she is able to return to herhigh school “glory” days and relive it one more time.  Hopefully a littlebetter this time.So we have the classic tale of repentance and redemption, but with a twist.The story explores how we are all interconnected with those we share thisplanet with, and how what is best for us isn’t necessarily best for all.Ultimately the message is we need to fix ourselves where we are, right now,and not waste our time looking for a shortcut.  It won’t be easy, but itwill be worth it.On the downside, it seems to me a lot of the book was a Hollywood infusedmasturbatory fantasy about what popular girls are really like; at least howthey think.  My experience is most super popular people (or aself-contained clique, like jocks for example) really do not think about,or care about those outside of their group.  Most of their teasing,bullying, and physicality is directed to within the group than without it.It is when someone on the outside tries to get to the inside and isrebuffed, they perpetuate the belief that the group is out to get them.  Bethat in thought or deed.  Thus all behavior exhibited by the group becomesa self-fulfilling prophecy to their belief it is all about them.  (Pleasenote there are always exceptions as the occasional sociopath can turn upanywhere).Side Note: I listen to this book on CD as I drove to and from work.  Theauthor decided to read the book herself (probably because most of herprevious work has been memoirs, so more appropriate), so good on her fortrying.  But unfortunately outside her own voice she was sorely lacking thevocal acting skills to pull off the various characters and accents.  Ittook me several discs to not be too bothered by it.  It would have helpedtremendously if she had hired this job out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQQ4ZOY65KAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451416856#wasThisHelpful","RHQQ4ZOY65KAW","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"he keystone to this book is being on the side of the anti-hero,Henry Hayden. Everything seems to be going his way until it suddenly isn’t;and instead of trying to repair any damage he decides to double down on hisbad behavior.As he keeps riding his bets, a wide path of lies and death is left in hiswake.  I like the portrait of a human unencumbered by any sense of moralsor general decency.  He is totally motivated about what is best for him inthe moment, nothing else. By all rights the reader should despise Henry,unless they are a sociopath themselves.I came away with ambivalent feelings about the hero.  I should have hatedhim for such violent hedonistic behavior but I didn’t.  I didn’t like himeither.  On the larger book I felt that way about all the characters,neither here or there on them.  They die or they live; things work out forthem or they don’t.  I just didn’t care. That said, it is a very talentedauthor that can get you to think nothing about Henry.This was a fairly short book that could have done with an extra 50 pages ofcharacter development.  A good story without any character I could rootfor. I believe the characters would play well on the screen, where thenonverbal communication would be screaming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8FJP6X80CFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147679555X#wasThisHelpful","R3N8FJP6X80CFB","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well if  you like Mary Higgins Clark you will enjoy this book of short stories - I found it easy to read and since the stories were short it was easy to put down and walk away after reading one and then coming back and reading another.The stories are old and some felt dated - but I love Victorian romance and that is dated- right?  Well they were all good - some better than others - the first story was a bit longer then I think was needed - but it had suspense.One story was sad and yet uplifting at the end - I read that one first off - I decided to skip around as I read this book and the airplane story is a good one and I hope I would be willing to risk everything to save a life if needed.I enjoy reading mystery authors and this one is good - I also really enjoy her series with Alafair Burke-  Short stories from an author you know and love -I received this item for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FN4KQ7214IZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501110993#wasThisHelpful","R2FN4KQ7214IZI","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A solid mystery with plenty of twists to keep the reader guessing.The crime is witnessed by a police officer and caught partially on videotape, but initially nobody is quite sure what has happened or who thevictim is.In true police procedural style, methodically following each small cluefrom insight to insight, the case opens up to encompass a much larger andsurprising conspiracy.  It also demonstrates the simple choices of regularpeople can lead to complex results.The B plot involves the protagonist’s recent transfer and subsequentblending issues with his new team.  As he deals with the inherent mistrustamong his new colleagues as the try to get along, he finds himself callingon his past friends for help.  It shows how prejudging others can reallyscrew things up; especially since history has taught us we are rarelycorrect in our assessments.  As a sometimes reader of this series, I didfind the B plot a little hard to follow because I am not up to date withthe multi-book character development.A good mystery best served when read in series with the other books by thisauthor.Sent for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JH3PYLDF5RIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006227161X#wasThisHelpful","R3JH3PYLDF5RIS","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The thing about a Murakami book is you can read it and spend tentimes as long thinking about it.  I have read all of his books andthoroughly enjoyed every one of them, but I would be hard pressed to tellyou exactly why I love them, or what it is that make them so compelling.They just are.Tsukuru is a quiet kid who is in a close knit group of friends in highschool, three boys and two girls. The other four have some sort of color intheir name (think Clue characters) while he is just colorless.  This quirkyfact colors his whole experience with life, pun fully intended.  Anyway,they all grow up and finish school, but Tsukuru is the only one who choosesto leave their town to attend university in the city.All is well until one weekend trip home none of his friends will talk tohim, until ultimately he is told we never want to see or talk with you everagain.  No explanation is ever given and none is ever sought. So Tsukuru’spilgrimage is one of loneliness and denial as he bravely tries to face theworld after this emotional devastation.After many years of trying to be okay it is the love of a woman that openshis eyes to the internal damage this event has done to him.  That he cannotmove on with life because he is forever stuck in this moment in time.  Hemust face his fears and know WHY.This book is compelling and will have you contemplating the minutia of yourlife and relationships.  Such is the greatness of Haruki Murakami.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XF24XQCMK7S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFD6UKO#wasThisHelpful","R1XF24XQCMK7S4","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here I go again provides a new twist on the time travel to fix your lifegenre.  Too often we see the protagonist recognize that somewhere along theway they really screwed up their life.  Than through some mystical meansthey are able to return to the days it all went wrong, make changes, andthen all is well.  Think Peggy Sue Got Married or even Back to the Future.Jen Lancaster’s twist is quite unique and well told.  The heroine, LissyRyder, is quite a self-centered, thoroughly distasteful individual; andeveryone at her 20th High School reunion has no problem sharing that withher.  Playing on the Whitesnake song name, she is able to return to herhigh school “glory” days and relive it one more time.  Hopefully a littlebetter this time.So we have the classic tale of repentance and redemption, but with a twist.The story explores how we are all interconnected with those we share thisplanet with, and how what is best for us isn’t necessarily best for all.Ultimately the message is we need to fix ourselves where we are, right now,and not waste our time looking for a shortcut.  It won’t be easy, but itwill be worth it.On the downside, it seems to me a lot of the book was a Hollywood infusedmasturbatory fantasy about what popular girls are really like; at least howthey think.  My experience is most super popular people (or aself-contained clique, like jocks for example) really do not think about,or care about those outside of their group.  Most of their teasing,bullying, and physicality is directed to within the group than without it.It is when someone on the outside tries to get to the inside and isrebuffed, they perpetuate the belief that the group is out to get them.  Bethat in thought or deed.  Thus all behavior exhibited by the group becomesa self-fulfilling prophecy to their belief it is all about them.  (Pleasenote there are always exceptions as the occasional sociopath can turn upanywhere).Side Note: I listen to this book on CD as I drove to and from work.  Theauthor decided to read the book herself (probably because most of herprevious work has been memoirs, so more appropriate), so good on her fortrying.  But unfortunately outside her own voice she was sorely lacking thevocal acting skills to pull off the various characters and accents.  Ittook me several discs to not be too bothered by it.  It would have helpedtremendously if she had hired this job out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GKKE78VPU3QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5TFH0U#wasThisHelpful","R2GKKE78VPU3QF","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you ever thought you might want to be an accountant this book isan absolute must read.  Even as a non-accountant involved in business thiswas an eye-opener.  All I can say about accountants after reading this bookis “Who Knew?”The author makes a very compelling case that there is a lot more to beingan accountant and accountancy than balancing your checkbook. They areheavily involved in all aspects of business, and this book was riveting.It also offers an inside look at the accounting scandal of Arthur Anderson,giving a side of the story never seen in the media at the time.This book is a requirement for all future accountants and I highlyrecommend it to anyone in business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE97XJKS6XN34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939758181#wasThisHelpful","RE97XJKS6XN34","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Billy Makes A New Friend is your typical teaching book for kids between the ages of 4-8. This book teaches about feelings a child might not understand when they refuse to share their toys or when they do share their toys. The book rhymes nicely so your kindergarten-3rd grader will be able to read it with ease. The illustrations flow nicely with the story and with simple drawings that tell the story as well as the words.I read this book to my 4 and 6 year old daughters who said the book was good but she shares her toys all the time with her friends. Than we talked about her sharing with her sister and maybe it would make her feel happier if she shared with her toys.  She nicely informed me that sharing with friends is totally different than sharing with your younger sister.The story does have an older brother who shares as well but that went over my daughter's head or she simply ignored that part of the story.The author writes in simple terms so your kindergarten would be able to read and follow along or your 3rd grader is able to read it to his younger or her younger siblings.A perfectly simple book for your children to understand the importance of sharing and you will be sharing the importance of reading with them.Currently on Kindle Unlimited.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FEHCVNBWBLNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q0J7OXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1FEHCVNBWBLNS","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is book one of five books about the small town of Crazy, Virginia. The Crazy Virginia town Sheriff is a single, 35 year old by the name of Littlepage Eller or Lil as she is referred to and she has a feral cat, Boris, which she adopted. The cat serves as her working partner and can be quite vicious when protecting her from harm. She is the offspring of a Littlepage and Eller union and as both families detest each other is shunned by both. The two families are very rich and the first two families in the area and constantly try to outdo each other.In the story a Littlepage daughter  is murdered and so the investigation begins. It is resolved after a fashion but not necessarily to everyone's satisfaction. I thought the Lil was a very believable character and one I could identify with. She recapped the life of a small town Sheriff very well. I enjoyed the book and would read the other four in the series.I picked up the book because it caught my interest for its location in small town Virginia in the Blue Ridge mountains.

The main character is a very independent and protective individual who promises two of the other ladies that she will protect their children should anything happen to them.

Although, to be fair, she appears to be a slice of ham short of a ham sandwich to start with, then in quick succession two of the other ladies are murdered.

" 0:50 MinsReview:  My children were not impressed - they did not like the smell of the glasses and they seemed to knock them over every time they used them.  The smell is better now that they have been washed many times.  They are soft and flexible - maybe a bit to flexible for some people.  The fuller they are the more then tip - I would say the pool yes as you are floating along sipping your drink - perfect - placing them in the cup holder - no risk of tipping there.My suggestion for these glasses is for around a pool - no one wants glass in their pool or on the pool deck - so these glasses would be great for the pool.  No worry about walking on broken glass with these glasses.  I think for taking them with you camping or the beach they are terrific - small - flexible and non breakable - great for use with kids - no need to worry about broken glass when they are dropped -These little glasses have a place in your life where they would be just what you need - for me that is not the kitchen - but the pool - or the camper - they would be at home where breakage of glasses would be an issue -I received this item free for an honest review.  4 stars for pool and outside use - 3 stars for inside kitchen/house use","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GNR2S44YYU9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGOC8Y8#wasThisHelpful","R2GNR2S44YYU9K","A1A8QJ282YIUQ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A8QJ282YIUQ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved the 1st book in this series and was looking forward to reading this book - here is my review of Shadow on the Crown -  Well this book did not disappoint - it is a good book that continues the story of Emma -Queen of England and her family - her children and the King's children as they grow and the country comes under fire from the Danes.I love her writing and the way she is bringing history to life - I read the disclaimer of sorts at the back of the book about what the author put in as her spin on things and what is actually known about that time in history.  Kings Queens Princes and Princesses - fighting for love- for honor - for life - for title and money - land and country- what a tale this author weaves for her readers - now I just have to wait for the final book to find out what happens - will it be happy?  I do not have a clue at this point.I say who cares what really happen when the author makes such a great story around these characters and their lives - I am rooting for Emma even if things are going to get worse before they get better.

"I have to say i am somewhat disappointed with this speaker. And that is a first from an aukey product.First let me say sound is surely subjective to a degree, i understand that and you should as well. What sounds good to me won't sound good to everyone. Now that being said, sound being subjective doesn't matter when something is missing bass as this speaker is. Further more, my taste for the rock and metal that i mainly listen to is highs.As i said  I like my crystal clear highs or (treble) And this speaker delivers Crystal clear highs at high volume with no real distortion to speak of. And this speaker also has respectable mids as well. but there is just a massive lack of bass that would be expected from a speaker of this size. We are not talking a little pocket speaker where you might expect to be lacking.The overall design of the speaker is nice, with a rubber / silicone like outer shell except metal speaker grill. The top features easy to follow red an blue led light, and four buttons, a phone button for answering or making calls, a play pause button for .... play and pause of course. And the multi function - and = button that control both volume and track.On the back you will find an on and off switch, micro usb charge and line in port for aux. This unit also features a line out port..... Not sure what one would use that for, unless possibly to also send sound to another speaker as well?And on the side you will find a plastic eyelet for attaching the metal carabiner. Im not sure as to how well the plastic would hold up to extreme use but should be fine just to carry it around clipped on a backpack or something.Before someone comments that i have expectations set to high. There is a speaker from another company, i won't mention, that still sets the bar for sound quality in speaker of this size and price point. And i use that speaker as a measuring stick. And even the previous aukey models of this size had better sound quality.Like i said the over all design is nice but as beautiful as the highs are on this and they are REALLY great, the missing bass is just bad.I had considered only knocking this one star, except for the fact that unless i got a broken unit (unlikely) i think that some of the other reviews may have been a little too nice for fear of no longer receiving product. so i'll help balance that out. Is what it is.I received this product for no charge, and promised to write an honest review. And that is obviously done.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HFMKHQGA74DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156KVXEK#wasThisHelpful","R2HFMKHQGA74DX","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this charger. It is compact and very small, unlike just a short time ago and even some still when they featured any kind of smart fast charge they seemed kinda bulk and would stick out obnoxiously far from the port. Which really could create problems depending upon the location of your ports.This charges a lot faster that some of the other chargers have and i fits in my tundra port very well almost un-noticeably. The ports being highlighted in orange helps if im plugging something in at quick glance perhaps while driving.Smart charging makes me feel safe if i need to leave something plugged into it for a little, it will sense the highest acceptable charge and provide it to the device and then shut off charge when the device is fully charged.

"I like these portable chargers, really starting to like them more and more. I have 2 children, each has a phone, a tablet, me and my wife each have our phones, one tablet at the moment, then multiple sets of  head phones and bluetooth speakers we use for our workdays. That is a lot to charge, and it seems like something is constantly needing to be plugged in to charge. With these battery packs, if provides you some flexibility to not be tied to the wall or moving couches to plug in the always too short cord.However the downside is it has been a trade off with most units, portability for loss of charge speed.Aukey has addressed this however with their quick charge line of portable power banks. This really does charge my s5 nearly as fast as actual wall charger does, which is absolutely awesome.It has a very nice silver matte finish and nice size considering the massive amount of battery it has. I can easily get 4 charges out of this before it needs to recharge. It is also very convenient for me as i work in construction, and sometimes, such as right now, i am working in a house without power at the moment. And the only thing worse than that is working with not power and therefor no music.This charges in a respectable 4ish hours from nearly dead to full charge, typically i just plug it in overnight. I also like that i don't have to baby sit my device, as with some of the cheaper inferior powe rbanks, that have no shut off or smart charge features that will overheat and can damage your devices.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is by far the best thermometer i have used. i have used quite a few in my quest to find a real instant read thermometer. Far too many of them say instant read and yet the temp. jumps around as the probe is staying still. I like that the probe folds out of the way in a switchblade fashion. The Lcd is large and easy to read.The include temp chart is nice to keep close to the grill, as i forget sometimes what i am shooting for. (hell getting old)And even better is right on the unit itself it has the temps to the most popular meats making it that much easier to get it right.Next to the lcd screen the unit features 2 buttons, on/off  and hold.I like the added magnet to this orange model. I keep it on the side of the fridge to grab before walking out to the grill. While the other red one sits in the drawer next to the stove for stove use. This model also features an easier to see and read meat temp chart.While i am a little confused that the title seems to imply that this will read out both Celsius and Fahrenheit, i see no button like on the previous red model as well as no mention of how to switch in the instructions. Perhaps they have a Celsius model that they send to those countries that woudl use that measurement?

"I have used a pair of automatic wire strippers in the past, way back when i did car audio installations, so at least 7 or 8 years I remember liking them however they were a novelty item picked up from a store of like harbor freight reject tools. So i remember they broke after 2 or 3 days. Since i had a pair of snap on strippers still working away, i never cared to look for another set to replace them.Now i am out of that field and do it only occasionally for friends. Now being in construction, im not an electrician, so i rarely need to use these in my daily life, however i am remodeling my 1950's home room by room that does include a complete rewire, so i can see these being handy.Honestly i've never had a problem with normal wire strippers. I have never looked at them and said... ""oh there has to be a better way"". Why i do like these however is that even my expensive snap on strippers, have a built in crimper for attaching terminal ends to wire. (this would mainly be for 12v wiring applications, like cars and such) however they are terrible on my other wire strippers. Often not getting a good crimp on either insulated or uninsulated terminals. This set however does a better job. Note i didn't say great job, if you were doing a bunch of terminals you would want a dedicated set of crimpers, but for just a couple ends at a time every once in awhile these do an ok job. I believe a big part of this is due to the placement of the crimpers being up a little higher and therefor you have a little better leverage when squeezing.Other than that, they do a nice job of auto adjusting to the size of your wire. allowing you to strip the ends of a wire or even in mid wire for attaching things to a wire such as an remote wire for an amp. The cutter works just as every other pair of strippers ive tried. They all seem to struggle getting a clean cut even on twisted strand wire. MY snap on's, Kleins, and these all cut equally poor on standed wire that has had the insulation already stripped. (multiple small wires combmined to make a big wire) leaving a few wires still hanging. I don't ding it a star because i figure if the big over-priced manufactures can't figure it out either.... I guess that kind of sets a standard. On non stranded wire these cut just fine.I also like that these are adjustable  so that over time, as things get knocked around or worn, you can re calibrate it to in theory return it to normal like new performance.As a tool in general, these feel solid in the hand, not cheap like the previous auto strippers i had. The weight is nicely balanced as well, not top heavy like i thought they might be.So all in all i give these 5 stars because they perform as advertised and work as well as my big over priced name brand strippers.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"Solar powered lights are really becoming one of my favorite categories, there are now so many different types and styles that you can do so much both inside and outside of your home, and because they are solar powered, you don't have massive power strips loaded full of plugs, or wires running all over the place. That's not even to mention the obvious green side of things.These lights are really cool. I expected them to be sort of hollow shells that could easily get messed up over time or crushed, however they are solid, with air bubbles inside that provide a very cool effect.The solar panel itself has an attachable stake included in the box that could be used to stake it into the ground, however if you were wanting to do a wreath on some other place, you could also just mount the solar panel with double sided tape on say a door or something.just under 20 ft long, you get about 15 ft of actual light, and then 5 feet of lead from the solar panel before the light globes start. This is great for not  drawing attention to the solar stake by having the lights start right away.Over all i was impressed with the light that these give off, certainly more than expected, not going to make say a porch look like daylight, but definitely provide some solid mood lighting. I really like these, and would recommend to anyone. This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"I am not a wine drinker, however my wife is, and rarely does she actually polish off the whole bottle in a single sitting. When she did, her somewhat slurred excuse was that it would go bad before she would finish it the next go round. While i'm under no illusion that this is not just an excuse lol she did state that the wine stored after using this pump, was still pretty good a whole week later.While others have said that the instructions were in Chinese, my package was entirely in english, with a sticker over what was probably chinese instructions on the back. While it featured no actual instructions,  i feel if you can't figure out how to use it, you certainly shouldn't be drinking in the first place. Place one of the 2 stoppers in the bottle, pump the air out. Done.The quality of the product feels above par for the price, and even if it saves you a total of 1 bottle of wine from going down the drain it has more than paid for itself, so really is a good buy.

"These bags are a nice thickness. Others have said that their bags contained almost like hole punches for breathing and i agree that those would totally defeat the purpose of these, however neither of the 2 i purchased had such holes. They were both solid the whole way through. I would recommend that you be careful how you grab the beds once they are inside so not to stretch and weaken the material. If at all possible, carry the items to or as close to the place they will be stored before putting them in these bags. The end is open, so you will need some kind of tape to seal them up. I used simply box tape.I like the size, there is ample room to fit a deluxe pillowtop queen mattress, with plenty left on the end to really wrap it tight, and get a good seal on the end before taping it.I am happy with this purchase, and relieved, that out of all the options when i searched for mattress bags, this one didn't leave me feeling like i chose poorly","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHB7EQ5KLXGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQWXTH8#wasThisHelpful","RWHB7EQ5KLXGZ","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really cool. With the great strides in cell phone camera quality anymore, most people don't own or use digital cameras anymore. This little clip on lenses allow you to continue with that but still have such a wide array of modes that you can still capture all the different effects you could need.This little kit is small enough to throw in a bag or pocket even, and clip on when desired and easily remove and store when done.While i personally am not a big fan of the fish eye effect, the lens in this kit does do a good job rendering that effect. The wide angle lens is really cool for fitting a large area into your shot such as a skyline for instance and i really like the macro lens that provides such great detail up close on small objects.This kit also comes with an 18 month warranty, so while the clip may be plastic Aukey is obviously sure that it will hold up. And i have come to trust the quality that Aukey puts in their products.I can and do recommend this to anyone looking for a small affordable kit to take their simple cell phone pictures to the next level.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is a similar item to another key finder i have tried from aweek, at this link http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Anti-lost-Anti-theft-Flashlight-receivers/dp/B00QNE6QWI/ref=sr_1_8?s=hi&srs=9030237011&ie=UTF8&qid=1446054228&sr=1-8 This one however features five vs the four finders that the other one has. But i will be comparing them to each other.They are pretty straight forward although this one requires an initial ""pair"", after that, you press the button that matches what you are trying to find. While this unit is definitely much quieter than the other unit, i was still able to hear it from 2 rooms away. It's not just the volume of the beeping but the high pitch in the beep that helps it carry and be heard. I like the slim cradle that this has to store the remote more than the docking station of the other.However if you don't need the 5th finder piece, i would recommend the other set because, it is louder, and i like the beefier key chain hook. While this set has not broke yet, it does seem like it would be a little more fragile and prone to breaking if your keys are just getting thrown in a pocket.Again not that this is a bad unit, but i am already hard of hearing,and the extra volume of the other unit required less concentration to hear from farther distances.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"With the high cost of phones, and the hassle of sending phones in and such under insurance plans, i was looking for a good case for my work phone. I am in construction, so though i try to be careful, my phone does get dropped, bumped, tools sat on it, etc. And thats not even counting the saw and drywall dust.I like the look of this with black and ""stainless steel"" look. And i like the all around solid protection, with flap like covers that cover all the buttons and ports, really helps to keep the dust and dirt out. I have seen no loss in image or video quality from either camera.However, i like others do find that occasionally its hard for the phone to recognize some touches on the edges in particular, on account of the screen protector not making perfect contact. Because this is a work phone it doesn't really bother me too much, i am not usually browsing the internet or playing games on it.So all in all i gave it 4 stars because i could see that touch screen hiccup really effecting someone that uses this for their daily driver phone.I would still recommend it to people who, either don't do a lot of games or browsing on their phone, or as an occasional case for say, hiking camping trips etc.Sample Provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLCW2XA63FHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQVLGYI#wasThisHelpful","R2CLCW2XA63FHW","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is awesome. I have tested a few of these now, and this is by far the nicest.Most feature just 3 or 4 led's that let you know the battery life status of the device, and that's it.This comes in a very nice padded box type case, for easy storage. Comes with a wall adapter for charging the unit, a car accessory plug for charging. A usb multi port adapter that features old generation iphone/ipod charger, lighting cable, a micro usb for androids, and mini usb for some older electronics. Of course you could still use your own usb cable too. Then of course you have the vehicle jumper cables to actually jump start your car.And for the main attraction we have the actual battery pack jump box itself. This is a nice aluminum heavy duty box, not some cheap plastic box. it measures about 3in x 5.5in, features one 5v2a usb output and takes an input of 15v 1 amp through barrel type connector. It also features a dual mode flashlight with a respectably bright on and attention grabbing strobe mode.And last but not least my favorite part is the LCD screen. This tells you all the info you might need to know. A battery icon with 5 bars to indicate remaining charge. also with a percentage number of the battery life. and an output gauge to shows you the level of power being output. Really cool information center.Hands down my favorite car jumper power bank.

"Surprised at the initial shave quality. I am not one for usually taking an off brand set of spinning blades to my throat, however i had to try to do the review, and i must say that i am quite impressed, it cut well, and did not once cut my neck skin. Of course i have some red bumps here and there, as i always do if i shave it clean with any electric shaver for the first few times as my skin isn't used to that. This goes away after a few shaves, as your skin gets used to the slight abrasion.The built in battery bank, while honestly it initially made me think why on earth anyone would want a battery bank, i then kinda realized that this would be great for those who travel, and maybe forget a charger or need the space. Essentially it doesn't hurt anything to have the capability, and in return provides for quite incredible battery life.How well and how long the shaver will hold up, only time will tell, and sure it doesn't compare to the $100 + shavers from the big names, but it does a good job so far, at a fraction of the cost, and surely has its own niche market at least. I had to knock it a star because it doesn't come with any kind of charging cable or plug.

"I often have need for head lamps however often, the batteries that run it are dead when i need them and i don't have them handy or have them charged.I love that this has a built in port for charging that in itself is great, HOWEVER you have to supply the rechargeable batteries for it to work. These are not just standard AA batteries, They are 18659 batteries, they are great batteries like a AA on steroids, however they for a descent set they run around 10 bucks a piece and you will need 2 of them. That brings the total cost of this lamp up there pretty high. however this is more of a pro grade light compared to say your $10 walmart specials.The light is very bright in a fixed beam pattern, and does tilt up and down 90 degree both directions. Why they chose the purple color for the lens ring is a little perplexing, though i don't really care, others cant see the color with the light shining in their eyes lol.I also like that the battery pack is located at the back of the head with amply padding to really help balance the weight of the unit.All in all a nice light. I have to knock it a star because the title and immediate description on amazon could lead people to believe that it is rechargeable right out of the box with batteries built in, and because it takes such expensive batteries.  But still a nice performer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPT1859P8P5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J20C87C#wasThisHelpful","R3CPT1859P8P5H","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good performing caliper. The digital screen takes the guess work out of it. Making it easy to measure precise measurements of things.At first i was a little confused at the point or logistics of having it be solar powered, but as i've used it, i realize that it stores up the energy, and its easy to set in a window and charge it up occasionally, so much better than trying to find batteries and never having the right ones.

"Very nice case, at a great price. Holds the tablet well, and does not feel loose.The suede like material inside prevents scratches to both the body and the scree. The Simulated leather outside, looks nice, and doesn't feel cheap. And i like that cover flap is held by a simple but effective magnet.I love that the cover over the screen can be bent to act as a stand when the tablet is open, making use of the tablet for watching shows, listening to music or typing on with a keyboard very convenient, almost allowing you to use your tablet as sort of a laptop.I have reviewed a few products from EasyAcc and so far at least they always impress me with quality, I would recommend to anyone without hesitation.

"While i love the idea of a shower speaker, And i know that typically Taotronics ALWAYS exceeds expectations, I did try out the suction cup on my travertine tile shower, and it sticks REALLY well. And i like the layout of the buttons, that is unfortunately where it stops.While this speaker is at a nice price, the speaker i received had a blown speaker and therfore poor sound quality. From working in the speaker and audio field for quite sometime, the speaker seems that it would have very nice sound quality, without a blown speakerThe other issue i had was that even though sitting right next to my cell phone bluetoothed in, it would get quiet, and fade in and out or sometimes stop making sound for a second all together. These were not, notifications or anything this was a speaker issue.Typically i Would recommend Taotronics, products to anyone, and i have no doubt that i simply received a faulty unit. I have an email out to Taotronics, and i will update my review should they choose to send me a new unit to review.I see that this has gotten many good reviews, and i can believe it but, i cant really rate it good how it stands.Sample provided for honest review. If i helped you please click the helpful button, it helps me out a lot. ThanksEDIT:Taotronics, sent me new speaker to see if that was an isolated incident, and indeed, it seems to have been. I am having none of the previous mentioned issues with this speaker and am thoroughly enjoying this in the shower.If it helps someone, i was impressed this is sticking to my sealed travertine tiles with no issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XML3JZKTO4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2K0ROI#wasThisHelpful","R34XML3JZKTO4R","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While i really like the light feature and the form factor and overall looks of this speaker, that is unfortunately where it stops.While this speaker is at the right price, the speaker i received had rather poor sound quality, with nearly non existent lows, and muddy mids. I tried rap, rock, jazz, metal, and acoustic music through it to get the overall performance grade, and all of them produced the same result. With Rap, and heavy metal being the worst.Typically i Would recommend Taotronics, products to anyone. I have tested many many bluetooth speakers, from both them and other companies, and typically Tao tronics delivers, better than what you would expect from a package.I have of course taken into account, its, specs, 3 watts, and as i stated previously, having sampled literally at least 20-25 different bluetooth speakers of all shapes and sizes, i had a very reasonable expectations for this speaker, and fir the first time Taotronics didn't deliver.Skimming the other reviews, i saw a lot of great reviews of the speaker, i typically, in general on amazon, figure that around half of all the sample for review 5 star reviews are done by people who just want free stuff, and then the other half are by people like me that give honest reviews, of how the products rate, and the reviews are what they are.Now that being said, Even ignoring half of the positive reviews, that still gives this speaker a great rating, so  it is very possible that i got a defective unit or it got broken in transport. I have an email out to Taotronics, to see if they want to send another, and if that happens, and the experience is different, i will surely update this review.As it stand however i would not recommend this unit to anyone. there is better to be had for the price from Taotronics.Sample provided for honest review. If i helped you please click the helpful button, it helps me out a lot. ThanksEDIT:Tao tronics, sent me another unit, and this one doe sound a lot better.

"Wow i feel like an idiot. I was getting ready to leave this a 1 star review, it was leaking all over, not something i want remotely near... well anything.Yea i had it upside down DUH!The little blue ring goes up. Just like its pictured. Once that was down, works really well. It is pouring out the mist as we speak.I like the blue glow too, i could see this being calming in an office cubical. I also like the other reviewers idea of adding scents. Im a bit more diabolical than lavender and would love to take it to my cubical with bacon smell. but i work construction so no go.I love that it comes with an extra absorbent tube for when the first one wears out. My only wish is that this used a standard micro usb so that if something happened to the cord you could use one of the 300 you have laying around.In all though, this works well as it says, and im happy to say that with the right orientation there is no leakage and no issues.

"This is a relatively nice option for those people that need a wireless doorbell.Ours didn't work when we bought our house 2 years ago and it will need replaced, however i am going to wait until we remodel the living room rather than tearing into the walls. This is a nice option.As it states pairing is required but is super simple. Activate the batteries and hit the pair button. Done.I like that it also has a blue led light for visual notification as well, as well as  3 volume levels. you can select just light, just tone, or both to fit your needs.Them main base has two hang ports to hang it inside. as well as the outside button part.I knocked it a star because the multi language on the cover looks relatively tacky. It is a simple fix, but i would have like to have seen it come with just the button with the alarm bell symbol or different inserts to apply your most relevant.The tones sound ok, and not full of children's  songs like twinkle twinkle and such. Also include multiple bells with chinese greeting as well as on english hello.Still this performs its job as it says, and i was able to move the base to the back of my 1100 sq ft house through aluminum siding, without issues of reception.so 4 starsThis was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"does exactly as it should. Connects to most z wave hubs and reports real time energy usage. This will work to cut power to anything, however if your wanting what is connected to actually turn back on by itself be sure it supports this feature, by simply turning it on (say an air conditioner) then , unplug it for a few seconds before plugging it back in. if it starts again your good to go.Most things that feature a manual control knob for instance, will work with this, but if it features buttons and a digital screen they are hit and miss, so be sure to test as mentioned above.If it helps someone, i can confirm this works fully with the almond + router/smart hub.If this review helped you or you found it informative please click on the helpful button below.

"This is a nice value priced radar detector. No this isn't going to perform as well as a $450 dollar unit and shouldn't be expected to.But this seems to do the job well enough.I recently used this on work trip, and for the first time in my life, i wanted to see a cop and despite the 150 miles one way trip THERE WAS 1 COP total there and back. lol. This did give me a warning, however, as with all radar detectors, the issue is, for me at least, i like to have my music, relatively loud,and therefor cannot hear any sort of radar detector. The normal solution to this is the light up display, however when i am on unfamiliar roads with people who apparently got their license back when they were just giving them away.... (Yea im talking about most of the people that drive the 495 beltway) The last thing i would do would be to look down frequently to check the radar detector.So in my 300 mile testing, i found that highway mode worked reasonably well, with the occasion ""false"" alarm. I say false in quotations because i fully believe it picked up some signal from the k band, it just wasn't a warning i cared about. Many programmable road signs, will send an alert for instance.Best i can tell this detects h,x,k,KA,Str La bands. What any of them are i have no clue though the road signs that triggered alerts were all on the K band.However in city mode i surprised that this did not go bananas as they used to when close to a stores theft detection tag sensors at the door.The unit comes with a clear gel grip pad to help hold the unit in place, a car adapter that features an on and off button, instructions in both russian and english, and of course the radar detector.It is nice and low profile so it wasnt so blatantly obvious it was there despite sitting in the middle of my dash. The unit features a nice small display that shows what band it is detecting as well as the signal strength to help you gauge distance.  and 3 touch buttons, 2 for volume up and down, and 1 to cycle between city modes and highway mode. ( i assume the different modes help to skip some false warnings.The speaking, if i caught it correctly said"" position ahead"" in an accented but clear English voice. By the point it had gone off i had decided music was more important, as i rarely excessively speed anyways (10 mph over on highway)I have only 3 slight reasons it loses a star. While it is at a great price, it is missing the detector-detector featured on the similar cost cobra unit, and the barrel power connector is almost 2x the length it needs to be, causing the silver barrel to stick out even when properly seated, messing up such a sleek appearance.  And lastly, the manual. I think that this manual is more of a generic manual that is sent with a few different models, and while not overly complicated to operate the manual almost makes it more confusing. I am fairly confident that the russian language manual is more detailed showing which bands are supported and what looks like what those bands would be.Still  dollar amount considered, i give this 4 stars.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is a nice solid performing power bank.I like the deep red accent band that helps it stand out a little from the normal all black or all white boring ones you find.I also like that the outputs are clearly labeled 1A,2.1A, and 2.4 so that you clearly know which port you are using as opposed to some that say, ipod, android, ipad. type.1 A is great for the little things, headphones, gps, mp3 players. 2.1 and 2.4 are great for fast charging even the most power hungry phones and tablets. And with the Auto IC it will help make sure your device is getting the right amount of power it needs to charge most efficiently. And the 3 ports can charge 3 devices at the same time, which is nice with the growing number of devices we use.This is a nice size back up as well. the 12000 MAH would allow you to charge your devices multiple times, without ever needing to recharge the power bank for instance:Galaxy S5 4.25 times full chargeGalaxy S6 just under 3.5 timesIphone 5S- just over 7.5 timesIphone 6  roughly 6 3/4 times.You can easily see what you can expect by typing in google your phone model battery size MAH then devide 12000 (mah of this power bank) by that number so... Using S5 for instance: Google (S5 battery size mah"" give the answer 2800 MAH then 12000 / 2800 4.29 rounding so just over 4 1/4 charge time.The built in flashlight, while certainly not a lets use this for camping or navigation by choice is certainly nice as a emergency light source. Tapping the only button on the unit once will light the 4 led lights to show how much charge is left in your power bank, double pressing the button will cycle between full brightness led light, half brightness, sos mode, and then light off.So this is a solid performer of a power bank and although the light leaves a lot to be desired, it is not its primary function, which it executes very well. So this still earns 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R165ODOJ8VRTJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZSA4SA#wasThisHelpful","R165ODOJ8VRTJD","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a versatile little clamp light. Though i find the title slightly misleading, the only way this is rechargeable is if you put rechargeable batteries (not included) in it. While it is extremely handy to not have to take the batteries out to charge them, i half expected that this was going to have a little self contained battery because of the title and other reviews. Someone please correct me if im wrong.However this remains a very cool little light. I like that each little antenna is bendable an able to be positioned exactly where you need it to be. Each of the ""bulb"" shaped ends features actually 2 leds for a total of 4 that can all be cycled on and off. So 1 led on one 2 on the other or 1 and 1, 2 and 2 etc. all controlled by 2 buttons (one on each bulb)The clamp has good spring action for nice clamping strength. and doesn't feel like it is going to break if you look at it. Also the bottom of the clamp army has a little swivel head with a pad on it to help grip whatever you need it to.I like this light and have already used it for my grilling since the back porch light never seems to hit where i need.

"A simple easy to use motion activated light. 3 triple A batteries allows you to use this anywhere it wont get wet.The slight twist of the back plate reveals that battery compartment, and also allows you to remove the plastic hanging eyelet seen in the picture if you wanted to hang this with double sided tape.The 5 led's are sufficiently bright enough to be used for path lighting in say a hallway at night.At just under 1 inch thick, this could also be stuck out of sight under cabinets.

While not something that you would hear across the house, it was sufficient enough that even i could hear it from the next room over, and i no longer hear the best thanks to a quality car audio system.All in all this item does what it says.

"Let me start by saying, I struggled where to rate these. As i write this i am still torn on 3 and 4 stars.While i wouldn't go so far as to say that im an audiophile. Having worked in a car audio installation garage for quite a few years, dealing with the tuning of systems and such, i like to think that i have a pretty good idea of what things should sound like. Now of course that is considering that sound is somewhat subjective.Im not sure if i have an over sized head or what, but these seem rather tight fitting. To the point of my now 15 minutes of testing on ear and they are beginning to really annoy me. And this smashing of my ears also seems to be a major part of the audio quality downfall.In fact when i hold them out ever so slightly and relieve the pressure a little bit they immediately go to a 5 star for the price rating. And even though they are clearly labeled r and l ears inside the headband. I find that if i reverse them and put them on backwards, they actually seem to sound slightly better, i assume due to the no longer perfect fit.But as they sit, I sampled music, from classic rock, heavy metal, rock, jazz, country, acoustic, and classical music. And the result was all the same. Very muddy mids, with drowning highs. I was able to clean this up a bit by fiddling with my phones eq, but still not to what i would normally call good.Now on the flipside. These are $17.00 on ear bluetooth headphones, With a built in mic. They have a surprisingly well written detailed instructions, and a very nice build quality to them. The integrated buttons have a nice feedback feel when pushed, Battery life is good, and they seem like these would last a while. Hence the struggle of rating these.well its decided, these are worth 4 stars. and possibly 5 stars if these happen to be purchased for a child or young teenager. I think that with the smaller head , and therefor less tight fitment, these absolutely become 5 star headphones for the money.But for an adult these get 4 stars, upgraded from 3 because of that price tag, you can hardly find cheap wired on ear headphones for this price, and these are bluetooth with a mic.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"I am not sure why other post refer to these model as being wired. The hd-p2 is a wireless bluetooth selfie stick. I think there must have been a page error or something that has them posting a review for another aukey selfie stick in the place. none the less my review of the hd-p2 wireless bluetooth selfie stick from aukey followshe Hd-P2 selfie stick features a very nice design. While i personally have never taken or intend to take a selfie in my life, i know far too many people that do. And once i completed testing it out i actually keep this in my tool box as you'll read below.This model features a collapsible shank that extends from just over 7 inches all the way out to 32  inches. combined with your arm length and you can get pretty far away. Could be handy for including more scenery in your selfie.It's light weight and small enough to throw in a beach bag, your purse, your man purse, your moms purse where ever and take it anywhere.The handle features a nice rubberized typed grip that definitely helps improve grip to get that perfect orientation. And right on top is an easy to reach shutter button to snap the camera.I find the weight of the battery is perfect because it helps counter balance the weight of a your phone when the stick is fully extended. This was a feature quite a few stick lack so i'm told. And the simple charging mini usb charging port on the bottom is nice that it uses the same charging cord as everything else so you're sure to always have a cable. And the wrist lanyard helps make sure that you aren't dropping your phone.The clamp expands well to fit most any phone out there. No problems fitting my old note 2 in there. and it really seemed to hold it securely i have complete faith that my phone was safe.As i said i have no desire to take selfies, i do however keep another selfie stick around to use my old phone as an inspection camera when i need to see what is blocking the gutters, or what is going on just out of reach. As if you put your camera in video mode, this will start the recording.While i would have loved to use this for the same with that nice long reach i decided it was too nice of a unit to sit around in a toolbox for use a couple times a year.So no matter if you want a makeshift inspection camera or to take 1 too many photos of your duck fish face, this is a nice stick that will get the job done.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"Short sweet and to the point.Everyone likes grilled food, most everyone likes cooking grilled food...... No one likes cleaning the grill.So since you have to do it anyways, Might as well get it done faster. how? 3 individual heads team up to make a grill cleaning brush that looks like it could clean your grill and then be used to clean your deck.At first i admit i thought it seemed more like a novelty than anything actually functional, at least to the extent advertised. However, i think in a large part due to the fact that each wire brush head has its own supporting rod, it actually functions very well and cleans just like a good normal brush, just covering more surface area at once. The nice long handle keeps your hands and knuckle hairs further from the heat as your reaching the back of that bottom grill plate.so much for being short..... lets try this, "" Trust me : You Want This, Buy it"" -- Done :)This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"I have never been into solar power that much to be honest. Not because i have something against the sun, but most things were either diy mad concoctions or pretty expensive. And no matter what you could count on them being somewhat fragile.When i opened this ravpower 9 watt charger however, i immediately notice how it folds up into a nice well protected portfolio. At roughly 9.25 x 5.5 inches, its small enough to take anywhere. unfolding i was suprised to find that the solar panels themselves seemed thick and well protected. So much so that i wouldn't hesitate to take this outdoors on a hike, mountain bike trip and anything.aside from being able to open and prop this up in many configurations due to its 3 panel design, it also includes an eyelet at each corner, allowing you to use the included carabiner clips to hang this an many configurations as well to be sure to get the best angle of the sunlight.In the easy to follow instructions, it tells you you can store your device in the pouch sewn into the case, and while you certainly could for some devices, i found that having the charging cable attached to my Galaxy S5 made it a bit of  tight fit. So much so that i would be wary of doing that ofter for fear of messing the jack up.In my test of charging my S5 on a cloudless PA day, using the usb 3.0 phone cable that came with my phone i was able to charge my 2800 mah battery from 71 % to 77 % in 10 minutes of direct perfect sunlight. So i cannot complain about that, as we know batteries tend to charge a little slower once they are closer to full.I do really like this and find myself using it frequently. I also pair this with rav power power banks that allow me to charge my phone anytime with the sunlight. I would REALLY love to have see this include a built in battery that you could allow it to charge whenever and use that stored power anytime. Its the same as you would do with a battery backup but with less wires and less to carry and forget.All in all however, this is cool i like it, i use it and would recommend to anyone in the market for something like this.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is a cool little device. It took me a little effort to get it to function properly, however that was more of other people's misinformation. More on that later.This little headset takes your phone and basically holds it inside the case, and anything that can be displayed on your phone (doesn't matter if your phone is 3d or not.) and gives you a private little screening room.The instructions are a little hard to follow as many are, again in broken english however, it is a very simple concept to use. After reading this you'll be all set.All you need to do is google or torrent (legal or not depends on copyright blah blah blah check your local laws) anything even some you tube clips. What you need is 3d-sbs (stand for side by side) What side by side will look like is 2 of the same images on the screen at the same time. Not one image with red and blue lines like the old 3d books. not one blurry image. It NEEDS to have 2 of what appears to be the same image on the screen. Double vision.The problem for me is that when i searched youtube for 3d sbs i got a lot of 3d video results that were labeled as sbs that were labeled incorrectly. I started to doubt my knowledge of 3d and thought perhaps the headset was just not working. the different 3d formats all have a name. And sbs or side by side should have what looks like the screen split and half with the same image on both sides.open it on your phone, turn your phone landscape ways put it in the box, close it. now with the unit strapped onto your head you may need to adjust the eye pieces using the 2 small sliders just on top of the box, I could see the center divider of the box and it hurt my eyes to look in until i found an actual correct sbs. then my eyes focused properly and it no longer hurt.This is a cool little gimmicky box. My boy who is nine really seemed to love it. While we never got big into 3d i can see it is still growing slowly and more content is becoming available.So i would have no problem recommending this product to someone who was into this kind of stuff. The build quality and function is there. I would love to have seen either a notch for headphone wire or perhaps an aux port to allow for some headphones, that could really create a little mini theater experience.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This Controller is very cool. This being blue tooth allows you to connect to most electronics today, phones tablets, amazon tv boxes and sticks, laptops, desktops (older models of computers may require a bluetooth dongle. They are inexpensive.)While this probably wouldn't work on some game apps that require frequent tapping, (think candy crush, clash of clans) it would work great for fighting games, racing games etc.The real gem of this is in emulation. While legal in some places and illegal and others i would give you the ol wink wink ""be sure to check for legality before following anything i speak about in this paragraph."" You can download from google play, Apple app store or, for computers, a simple google search for snes emulator Will act as a super nintendo system. Then another simple search for SNES roms, will provide you with every game (in this case Super nintendo) that you can download as a small file and by opening the emulator and hitting load, pointing it to where you downloaded said rom. Will launch that game in all its 8bit glory.While this may be shaped like a Super nintendo controller, it certainly is not limited to controlling super nintendo games, following the emulation crash course above you will find there are emulators out for most early gaming systems. up to the playstation, however you might need those thumbsticks for some games. And of course many games and apps on the app stores work well with this.The controller is wireless which is nice other than it no longer has a leash when i die, and throw the controller across the rooms like i am still 10 lol.It includes a nice flat tangle free type charging cable and syncs effortlessly. The instructions could use a little work as the broken english could be a tad confusing for some, however they really arent needed as it is so easy to sync.This is one of those few products i have been fortunate enough to review that i will use often, and recommend to friends frequently, because it is easy to use, wireless, nice weight that feels right in the hands, the buttons have nice feel and response.

"OK so i thought i was immature because the first thing i did was call my sons into the kitchen and pretend to be wolverine..... however after reading the other reviews.... I have been reassured that this is actually proper procedure and i am in fact still a responsible adult.Then we made a pork roast specifically to test these out. Though it was a little cumbersome to reach into the crockpot without burning my hands on the sides, and actually remove the roast, it was worth the effort as shredding the pork for bbq was unbelievably easy and even fun.Upon completion of shredding i almost wanted to try and climb a tree with them just because, but the food looked to good to exert anymore energy.Although i see no mention of it here on the description page, the box clearly states on the back that these are in fact dishwasher safe, and i had no issues after running mine through my dishwasher.Solid 1 piece abs design, and adequately beefy (no pun intended) claw bases lead me to feel that these will last even the most enthusiastic griller awhile, so long as they dont try to climb walls, trees or box a real bear with them.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"A great shower hose, at a steal of a price. This hose comes fitted with rubber gaskets on either end, and the seal is so well that to my amazement i didn't have to break out the plumbers putty or tape.With metal ends and a stainless  steel spiral design hose this is sure to last. the hose design allows for great flexibility that should never kink, or become contorted as some plastic hoses do from the heat and age.A great length,secure connections, and a great price at half of what the stores charge for just plastic hoses,  makes this a winner in my book. 5 stars all the wayThis was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is my review for the An-sh001 kids handheld shower wand.Upon opening the box, both my 9 and 5 year old saw the vibrant colors and were excited to figure out what it was.When i finally hooked it up this thing has some real water power, i was actually afraid it might almost be too much pressure, I have really good water pressure at my house, but due to my shower knob being all one, i cant just not turn the water on full blast as it would be all cold.Then while writing this review i noticed that in the picture there are 3 white disk, and these appear to be water retarders, changing the pressure from ""pressure washer"" to a much more mellow spray that would be good on younger children. you simply select one of the disk ( i wish they were marked with some kind of gpm rating or something, they all seem slightly different in spray but no way of knowing which is which without testing each.) and insert it in the handle before attaching to the shower hose.Apparently these had shifted under the bag during shipping and were not noticed by me at first.That evening i gave both boys  a shower with it, and they loved it, they said it did not hurt at all and they liked that they could hold and control where the water was being sprayed.This does not come with holder which i really would like to have seen but they can be found online for a couple bucks. You will also need to either reuse or purchase separately the hose to hook to your shower. I would recommend the Ancheer 2 meter hose found at this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YULD2XCThe unit is made of what feels like a durable abs colorful plastic that should have no problems lasting for years. and i had no issues even at just barley snug with any kind of leaking.With the included bag wand and water retarders the only thing missing from this package is the aforementioned holder, though as it is not mentioned in any description or picture it should not be expected. And i still give it 5 stars because it uses the disk system allowing more options over the spray intensity.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is AWESOME. As with any ""waterproof"" item i surely wasn't going to through my galaxy s5 in and hope they were right. In fact when i first received the item and saw how that latch clamp system worked i was kinda sure it would leak a little at least. And in all honesty, i think because i thought it would leak, i may have went a little overboard trying to make it leak lol if that makes sense.First i put tissues in it and held it in the bottom of our kitchen sink, with a full bleach bottle. After an hour the tissues were completely dry.So i thought well, thats just a small sink, so i took it with us tissues still dry and intact to the pool, with some weights i and dove it down to the 9ft deep end, with a 15 pound weight on it. I left it there for a few hours while we swam, forgot about it and retrieved it the next day, Tissues again bone dry....TO THE HOT TUB thinking the warm water and the jets may have some leaking effect on the bag.... Long story short, i was outsmarted by this bag, Seriously, im not proud, and i kind of felt like the coyote trying to catch the roadrunner. Now to write this review i saw someone using this bag to make there iphone 5 and underwater camera and it took great video right through the bag. a lot cheaper than a gopro.At this point i was willing to put my phone inside, thinking well it still kinda sucks to have to take your phone out to use it.... Then i find out that i can use all the features of my phone right trough the bag.! awesome. I typically use bluetooth but the added feature of a leakproof Aux out cable on the back is just a bonus. The lanyard and the armband also allow me to take this with me wherever i may be going because they attach securely i have no worries.I can honestly say this is one of my favorite things i have tested, and as someone who has lost quite a few phones due to falling in the water, (i think i have lost a phone in every form of water now, from the ocean, (saw a shark make a call with it on sharkweek) to the creek to the shower, pool, river.... etc i got them all) I will never be near a body of water again without this. IT really is awesome.

"This is a very nice inexpensive desk or night stand led light. Piano black finish will fit with most decors well and the interface is quite simple.The base is nice size and weight, providing nice stability to the light without being to bulky and taking up too much room. On the base you will find a total of five touch sensitive buttons. A power button, and 4 preset dim levels arranged in a slide type pattern. Although they are preset the 4 modes seem to cover every lighting level one could want.The back of the base is where the removable wall wart plug plugs in as well as the 5v 1A usb output for charging phones or anything else that has a usb interface charger. This is a big reason i knock this a star. I really wish companies in general would charge a couple dollars extra and upgrade the usb output level to at minimum 2.4A. With much of our technology and even phones getting more and more power hungry the need for a lowly 1A charge is gone. I want something that i can plug my phone in and at least get close to the charge level i would from the wall. Even if the product cost another couple dollars, i think most would find it worth it. While 1a would probably charge most phones in an overnight situation, someone like me that sleeps in short shifts, or maybe takes a nap, it can be a little slow.Onto the actual light and light arm, the arm itself does not pan but will go from standing straight up all the way to laying forward 180 degrees to be perpendicular with the table surface.  at the top of the arm is another short arm that extends out. It tilts in the same fashion, from sticking straight up in the air to 180 degrees down collapsing on the lower arm.And finally the actual light part will spin clockwise 90 degrees and 180 degrees counter clockwise so combined you can rotate that around in any direction.Worth noting that upon receiving the light neither the upper or lower arm would hold itself up when i contacted aukey they responded over that night that this was intentionally left lose for packaging purpose, the the 2 screw that were visible would just need tightened. They also inform me that they would be including a small screwdriver in every new package. I snugged the screws up and have not had any issues since, however, those screws being tight have absolutely no bearing on how the light folds upon itself for packaging, and to confirm i have repackaged the item in the box with screws snugged and sealed it up flawlessly. So that explanation leaves me a little confused.All in all however this is still a nice light, and even if you need to tighten the above mentioned screws (took literally like 10 secs) it performs well and lights well. The color temperature is warm, and not hurtful to eyes that may have been adjusted to the dark. And this light is a good value, at the cost, i would still recommend it. As aukey seems to be a great company, and releasing quality products at a great price point.Now what I really want to see, is a lamp similar with a built in bluetooth speaker. That would be very functional and great to see from a quality company.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is another cool desk lamp from TaoTronics, While most companies are moving toward the slim design, and TaoTronics has them also in their line, This is a cool almost retro with a modern twist design. My son pointed out it reminds him a little bit of the pixar lamp from the beginning of all their kids movies. :)The base is rather heavy and i love that, keeps the lamp from being remotely tipsy, even at a tall extension. And the rubber like material on the bottom keep it from wanting to slide off a surface if bumped.The light itself has 3 points of articulation varying height and position forwards and backwards of the lamp. With one of them being right behind the dead, that allows you to tilt that to aim the light where you need it most.  All the joints have a locking mechanism, so they will stay in place where you put them. Just remember you will want to loosen them before adjusting otherwise, you will wear the joint down to where it no longer will support the lamp eventually, though given the light weight i would imagine that would take quite awhile.Where the light post attaches to the base is a screw that fits into a channel allowing a little side to side movement without re positioning the base. I really like the actual shade style, it is black plastic but does not have a cheap look or feel to it and the bulb itself has a lens over it, that is not see through, adding a little more sophistication imo. While that lens helps with aesthetics, i am pretty sure it is there to help with light dispersion as we all know led lights are typically directional.And last the switch. In keeping with the classic modern vibe, there is 1 simple toggle switch to turn on and off. No touch buttons, dim buttons, popcorn button, just a welcomed simple switch. while I also enjoy all the modern touch interfaces, and dimming this and that, I was pleased to see that they went with the switch, as i i feel those would have wrecked the aesthetics that this light  offers.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"Pretty cool little dongle. I have sprint so while i am unable to use this because i don't have a sim card,(the same for verizon users) I was able to borrow a friends during a recent visit to check this out.Basically, in case it wasn't clear in the description what you have here is a usb dongle that you can hook up to your say laptop, insert a sim card from your cell phone provider and create a wifi network allowing other devices say a childs play phone gameboy, a tablet etc. to connect to your cell phones data plan.As a bonus with a micro sd slot, you could store movies, music pictures and such while allowing any of the connected devices to access them.Setup is relatively easy which is good given the lack of directions. Insert the usb in a computer, it will load drivers, and after a minute will open up the user interface tab allowing you to make the network name, add a password and such.I give this 4 stars, because while it works well during the time i was able to test it,i have no way of really testing the device for an extended period of time. I also, feel like there should at least be some basic instructions included with the item.However it performed well and would recommend someone in need give it a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QQ7ZDJLI1G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6FX31Q#wasThisHelpful","R32QQ7ZDJLI1G3","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit the only thing i hated more than the windshield suction mounts was always the vent clip mounts. Both only ever seemed to hold until the most inopportune times and then would fall crashing your device off of center consoles, or worse under gas and break pedals.This is the first vent clip i have tried in a while, and after using the Aukey suction mount to much success, i hoped they could surprise me again.And THEY DID!The mount installs easily, right on any air vent of your choosing, so your not blocking any part of your windshield view. Also looks a lot less tacky in my opinion. And still gets your phone up to where you can see what is going on and easily follow say your gps app. The rounded vent clip also seems to hold this in place even if you tilt that vent to direct the air flow.The Large C clamp that grabs the phone, it opens all the way to 4.5 inches and has 2 ridges to help accommodate many device sizes,  and keep the phone from popping out.While the 360 ball joint allows a tilt of roughly 90 degrees and can be turned to position your device in portrait or landscape mode.So again i was actually very impressed by the strides that at least aukey was able to make with the vent clip style system. This has gone from a product that i might have reviewed and tucked away somewhere to a product that is going to stay mounted in my Jeep.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is another Quality item from rav power. They are really impressive in all aspects, from their product quality, to their pricing and their customer support has always been spot on. And this Lighting cable is no different.I like others have had plenty of poor quality lightning cables over the course of the last 2 years or so. Most of them were hit and miss.Sometimes you can just feel the difference in the quality immediately, sometimes it isn't obvious until your struggling to make such a simple product work.This cable is 3 ft making it slightly shorter than the factory lightning cables, but not enough to make a problem.The rubberized coating feels nice, and the end fittings fit well with extra rubber at the joints to provide extra protection.The lightning port fits well with no loose fitment or wiggle room in any of the devices i tested on. And apple mfi certified means it will work with full functionality.So I would say this is a winner with a great 12 month warranty with no hassles from ravpower.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is a nice clear case that has a slim fit to still showoff your new phones design characteristics. The clear case fits snug and securely, providing nice coverage over side buttons while not having to have the hand strength of a gorilla to be able to use the buttons.One the front the case has just enough of a rise to help protect the screen from smacking the ground. I would also recommend a tempered glass screen protector as they have already saved my phone twice.This case feels nice in the hand, and has the right material to really help absorb some shock when dropped.

"When i opened this package i was completely lost at first. I thought... who makes a cellphone case that blocks the Camera?Looking at the description, i remember thinking that the magnetic pieces they were referring to was the typical band strap closure.Then i realized the actual phone cradle itself is magnetic and removable, and immediately thought ""that is genius"" While some may be slightly annoyed by this, as someone who has had their camera lenses scratched and thereby ruined in the past with a ""protective"" case on, i love this little feature. Also i have found that usually over time the case material in other cases will start to fray around that camera cut out and you end up with alien looking threads in your pictures of grandma at her 89th birthday. Having the phone cradle removable also means that your not holding a big bulky wallet and everything up to your face to talk on the phone.The overall feel of the case is nice and what you have come to expect from the PU simulated leather material. The stitching was all good, and tight with no frays or random threads, that i have seen a lot of on these many cases even though new.The cradle grips the phone well and is low profile enough that it doesn't feel bulky or cumbersome in the hand.2 credit card slots and a larger pouch for cash and such. Really the 1 credit card slot, is more of an id slot as it has the clear view window. the pouch is welcomed, for those rare occasions i actually have cash. Some cases seem to forget they still make that stuff.All in all this is a nice case. I feel it does provide a good bit of protection, even though, the inside cradle may shift if dropped just right, i don't think it will fall out, and it won't shift far.And it's at a reasonable price so you still have some money left to store in it.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"I am not a runner, but as a frequent beach and pool goer, i see plenty of uses for this belt.The material for the pouch is very similar to the material of an air mattress, and the belt is very stretchy with a broad adjustment range to fit most body types.The pouch unfolds to be a rather good size, and through the ziplock type seal i was able to fit my wifes Galaxy S5 with a rather bulky wallet case on inside, and would still have had room for cash, credit cards and others. My concern however being that because of the air mattress like material, i would be very hesitant to place many keys inside. Perhaps a single key or possibly 2, depending on how you would be using the pouch.I also did a water test to check the waterproof claim. I just put it on one of my boys when they were in the pool to see how it did. Upon opening i found that the moisture reactive dot sticker, (like those used on many electronics,) Had not been tripped. So that is a good sign.So all in all i do like this pouch, its small and discreet, and would be nice out at the beach or the pool to keep your things sand and water free.

"This Thing is REALLY cool. IT really has a lot of features packed into one and would make traveling even with a lot of family very convenient.First you have the ability to charge your devices through both of the onboard usb ports, while it is plugged in or while it runs off the internal battery. Very cool. I like that this plugs directly in and not yet another cable to carry around.Then you have the ability to stream music picture movies to any connected device, even multiple at a time. I only tried 2 hd rips but both played back smoothly with no sync issues.And then as a bonus you have a little travel router. Great for when you are getting slow speeds in a hotels wifi. you can hard plug into the wall and have your own high speed wifi.Typically in multi purpose items like this i find that each function suffers in quality and function, however this item does each of the task very well, as good as an individual designated unit. It actually does function as 4 in one.I love it and have friends and family that have already also purchased off my recommendation.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"While its hard to get excited about a cable, you immediately can tell the difference in quality in this cable vs so many others, including the stock cable.Gold ends, helps with corrosion, the ends themselves have a good fit with the cable and have nice support to keep from pulling loose.Braided fiber cord, holds up better than the standard plastic, and the nice blue and yellow cable look nice as well as easily distinguish it from the 2.3657 million other cords i have.3.3 ft is a nice length, plenty for functionality but not so much that it hangs all over the place.Very nice cord, i actually show slightly faster transfer speeds between my s5 and computer with this vs the stock cable. while it is small, it is interesting none the less.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"Right off the bat you notice that this is well packaged for protection during shipping in what appears to be made of recycled packaging, that provides a nice touch.Upon removing the speaker, it feels great, metal frame and speaker grill. The back features your on/off switch, charging port as well as your aux in for connection via cable. Rubberized strip on top contains 4 buttons:Mode- if you have something synced via bluetooth as well as plugged into the back via aux cord. you would switch between sources.Track/volume down -quick press for track long press for volume control (these are also controllable from phone )Play/pause/ answer or hang up phone calltrack advance/volume up again short press for track long press for volumeInitially i was ready to give this only 4 stars due to having no real bass to speak of, then just out of curiosity i tried a different music player that i had not yet had time to load on my new phone, and the bass immediately screamed to life. Now it sounds like i had expected and hoped, with clear highs, nice mids and respectable low end bass.IT is worth noting too, there are many factors that go into sound quality, starting with the quality of your source music file, mp3s range from 120kb to 320kbs, not all phones have the internal ports to make good sound, though this has improved a great deal in the last few years, then you have the player app itself, as mentioned, i hadn't downloaded the one i use on my android phone yet (Rocket media player if you need a good one) and was just using google music app. and it made the world of difference. and last little tip, on my phone i always turn the bluetooth volume all the way up and then minus 1 notch, many times it will distort output if left turned all the way up.While i understand that they certainly need to brand the product i would have rather seen the name smaller on the top vs sprawled across the screen in large white letters, but this is more of an aesthetic preference.Long play time at normal volumes, in a speaker that has no problems filling a room or two with clear sounding music. Really is a winner.As others have mentioned, the talking when you turn it on and switch between modes, i did get a bit of a chuckle out of the accent, and i would maybe like to have seen this feature able to be turned off for the more confident users, however it does make it very clear to the state of your speaker.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"Great sounding headset.I have had the chance to check out a few bluetooth headsets here on amazon. And let me tell you these are right up there with the best of what i have sampled. And surely at this price point.I Have a deep appreciation for good sound quality and clarity, and while these certainly are not the best that money can buy, they are do deliver clear highs, nice mids and sufficient bass. So they are good quality headphones all by themselves, Now when you consider the price, they are an amazing value.I love that they include multiple sized ear buds. I had thought this to now be standard practice, however i received quite a few different manufacturers pairs that did not include these.I also like that the buds have little wings on them that fit into your ear and help hold them in place. If you use these wings and they still fall out you need a different sized bud try the next smallest one.While i am not a huge fan of the color, they are easy to find, and i had no issues with them staying put through my day working in construction. the buttons are easy to reach for volume control.I would and have recommended these to family and friends.Because again at this price its really tough to beat these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DRZPPXFE2DGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7ZZSGS#wasThisHelpful","R3DRZPPXFE2DGZ","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and 1 child have almost constant sinus issues, and the doctors kept telling us to get a humidifier, we had got one for my sons bedroom at night, and it did seem to help, ever so slightly. Then we got this from TaoTronics. I put this in our living room, where we spend most of our family time when its not outside, and they have greatly improved, they still have the issues, but not nearly as bad.Aside from being so much more aesthetically pleasing than those we found in the stores, it has a slim design, and a few cool features that either weren't available or just were out of the question as far as budget.the led screen makes it easy to see what the setting is a good distance from the unit vs, dials that you have to walk up to see.  3 mist modes instead of just 1 or two like the standard. I also like the nightlight feature that provide a cool blue glow.Included time to let you run it from 1 up to 24 hours before the unit shuts itself off.Automatic low water shut off. These units are expensive. I think it was around $50 -$60 bucks we paid for a really basic one in the store, and to my disgust, i have found it doesnt shut itself off when low or out of water. That is a big no no and can easily ruin the machine. This has built in protection, so if i forget about it because it's so quiet, and forget to fill the tank, i know that it will shut off and be ready to go when i refill the water.I also REALLY love the position able mist direction on the top. Allows me to put this where i want out of the way but still send the benefits in our direction.I Got the humidifiers for my wife and son, never thinking of any kind of benefit to myself, however, i have noticed. as odd as it may sound, we seem to get a lot less dust that settles on our piano black electronics, as well as i seem to breath a little better, and the house just feels cleaner. Very hard to explain.As others have mentioned i would like to have seen some sort of securing the tank to the base of move to built in handles on the side of that base or something, because your first thought when going to move this is ""oh there;s a handle,"" if you grab that however and its full of water your next thought is "" OH C'mon! wheres the mop"" because it will just lift the tank, and leave you with a soaked floor. It is a nice way of making you mop more though.All in all though this humidifier is packed full of features, at a great price. These are never cheap, but you get a lot of feature for your money here, and TaoTronics have proven to have good quality products, time and again. I will probably pick up another one for our house and will continue to recommend to friends and family.  This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"I will admit i have not owned one of these headsets for a long long time 7+ years. The last one i owned, worked intermittently at best while still managing to be highly uncomfortable for any sustained use. And to top that all off the people could rarely hear me, which in truth is surely due in large part to the fact that i mumble.I mumble, my father mumbles, his father mumbled, so.... what better way to test a new headset than to call and mumble with my mumbling father.I was very pleasantly surprised. He had no problems hearing me and easily understanding what i was saying, despite being outside with an occasional breeze. And i could clearly hear and understand him. That is an A+ score in my world. no further testing required.I have used it quite a few times since then as it is very convenient to free up my hands while talking.The build quality seems nice. lightweight but still sturdy feeling. The design is very nice and almost sophisticated looking with a simple diamond style check pattern. I was glad that it didn't have the brand name slathered all over like some i have seen.Includes 2 different sized ear hooks for fitting different size people. These are interchangeable for either ear. Also, unlike the last headset i tried the speaker is is more of a flat spade that fits in your ear instead of a standard rubber booted circle that always seems to irritate my ears after awhile.Pairing was easy, hole the phone button until the small led light flashes blue. volume up and down included also.(keep in mind you will also have volume control from your phone once paired.I have not exhausted the battery yet. as i certainly can think of no combination of people that i would want to talk to for a total of 5 hours in a day.As for sound quality.For talking the quality is nice. AS for music however, this is something that is useful to provide a little background noise perhaps, definitively lacks bass and mids for any serious music listening. however, i could see myself using this out in the yard when i need to be able to hear the kids and dogs but want a little ambient music.So i would recommend this to anyone who is primarily going to use this for phone calls with perhaps the occasional ambient music listening. You simply cannot beat the price with a stick.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"While i admit it is usually hard to get excited about a cooking utensil, I really do love this spatula. As others have mentioned, the 15.5 inch length is great for keeping hand back from splashing fluids, from boiling water or popping grease.Because the edge actually has a little bit of a cup to it also it works well as a bit of serving spoon.I have used this for grilling, as well as making my chicken corn soup in a large pot, and it cleans well by hand every time.I will be looking into more products from Haiwa.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"As others have said, it is so hard to guess the size of a spoon by just a picture. I had expected a very very small infant spoon from reading other reviews, but i was glad to see that really is just a little smaller than a normal tea spoon.The slightly shorter handle is the only thing that i would say really makes this only ideal for kids, or i could see myself using it.The ""Bowl"" of the spoon holds a great amount that both my 4 year old and my 9 year old are able to use perfectly.These look and feel great. they are smooth and the wrapped black cording on the handle provides great contrast as far as looks as well as a little bit of grip for functional purposes.If there were a standard silverware set of these available, i would snatch them up in a heartbeat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124LQG3EB3BQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q65UZVC#wasThisHelpful","R124LQG3EB3BQ8","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another great looking product from Tao tronics. It looks rather modern but still would fit well with many other types of decor, with its glossy piano black finish. I really like the large LED panel as it provides for wider light diffusion that has been a thorn in the side led light bulbs. Aslo because it is touch style buttons i love that they include a wipe cloth to wipe the fingerprints that show up on any glossy surface.I really like the multiple joints that allow for so many ways of articulation that i have been unable to come up with anything this wouldn't be good for. Desk, reading light, bedside light. Even the light head rotates 360 degrees.I also like the multitude of features available allowing you to really customize it to what i need and want at the time, weather that be a dim, warm yellowish  light like a nightlight or a bright bluish light (if you have ever bought a bulb labeled daylight that is what that would be) and everything in between. Really makes this light uber flexible.I also like that the base is nicely weighted that you don't have to hold it down while changing the articulation. at first mine was a little tight but it has since loosened just enough to not need to hold the base. I did play with the light a lot (roughly 1.5 hours while watching tv) to see if they would loosen too much and not be able to hold the set angles and had no issues. Still holds the exact angle i set it at.It is also nice to have a built in usb output for charging your devices.  the output is only 5v 1 amp output and so you are looking at a slower charge on your power hungry devices like tablets and some smartphones. I personally would have like to have seen at least 2.1a output as our electronic devices grow more power hungry however, it works to supplement power usage, and would still charge a device fully say overnight if using this as a  bedside lamp.5 buttons provide full control with one for higher, one for lower brightness, one for warmer temp (yellowish light) and one for cooler temp (blueish /daylight) , your power button of course and a sleep light that easily turns it onto a preconfigured setting to function well as a nightlight.I have come to have complete faith in Tao Tronics LED products. From their eco friendly packaging, to their typically well thought out design and function, to their good pricing. I would recommend this to a friend without hesitation.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"Looking at the other reviews for this item I wasn't quite sure what to expect. However I also understand that the whole tv box structure is relatively new and some people may not quite understand what is going on, or may not have managed expectations very well. I can also say that as with all electronics, sometimes you get a dud.That being said I took a chance on this box to test it out and see how it really was. I “cut the cord” or did away with pay tv (cable, satellite, all that) a little over 6 years now. And when I did that back then, you pretty much had to have a dedicated “media pc” to be able to take advantage of a lot of the tv options out there.Fast forward, now we have these dedicated tv boxes. They have taken the need for that big clunky computer that while it worked fine, slow to start up, and not so nice to look at and shrunk them down to a very small and indiscreet size that can go anywhere and not look too out of place, even sitting on say a dresser for a bedroom tv.Upon receiving this box, opening it up you will find the box with included internal wifi, remote,  power cable, an AV cable (not HDMI) and what I would consider a “quick start manual”Set up is straightforward and requires no instruction. I would recommend using an HDMI cable right to the tv however to get hd quality.Right off the bat, I will tell you that while the included remote will get you started, you will want to use it to go to the play store on the box, and download a program called anybox. Then on your smart phone in the play store (im not sure about iphone compatibility) you should download google tv remote.The included remote is an ir remote and the angle of operation Is almost 0, meaning you have to have the remote almost perfectly dead on for it to work. While this is manageable to use once set up it makes  setting up the unit VERY cumbersome. Although the savior for the remote was the included mouse button that let you control a pointer with the directional buttons.Also the 2 usb ports will not work with my rf keyboard as I had hoped.The description however says that it does support them, so it very well could be my specific mouse keyboard , And lastly This does not support bluetooth either, so the little keyboard/mouse pad combos I had been using for remotes, will not work with this.  So you will want to do the above to set up google tv remote, allowing you to input text right from your phone. This will also allow you to tuck the box away in a cabinet or stand no longer needing direct line of sight for the remote to work.Next I would tell you to delete the included XBMC install. It was clunky, and VERY slow, plus there is a better one out there already preconfigured that will not give issues. Once that is done, head out to the browser from the menu, and type in google TVMC. This is a custom install of xbmc with many of the best and most popular add ons already installed. Also for what its worth, I use YATSE xbmc remote app from the play store for controlling xbmc. Alot of nice features there and allows sending video from phone right to xbmc. As well as typing from your phone and of course standard controls. Though it should be noted, this only works from within Xbmc so it does not replace the need for the google tv remote set up mentioned previously, if you are going to do anything else with the box than xbmc.I mostly use the TVMC included add on called genesis for all my tv viewing and movie playing, but feel free to explore and see if you like one add on vs the other.With this box, I find that im not getting full 1080 p playback, roughly 720p, from xbmc which is ok as most of the sources are 720p. However from a thumb drive It did look very close to 1080p, so that could be an issue with the wifi distance and the source.Now, this box does have some issues as well as some GREAT high points.  Honestly they all do, just a matter of how minor they are vs the others.The issues thus far:- I really would like to have seen a better manual written. It is basically the equivalent of a quick start manual, which would be fine if it at least told you how to get a remote going on a smart phone. That is the big one and because of trying to use the included tv style remote, it was a huge hassle of trial and error to figure out which remote program would work. (I think all told I ended up downloading and trying about 10 before finding this one that worked.) Tell me how to get that remote going on my smart phone and the rest is gravy!- The no blue tooth support issue. I would really like to have seen bluetooth support, even if it raised the price by a few dollars, as there are now both remotes and game controllers, that are able to connect via blue tooth that would allow you to better control, and play some cool games from the play market.-the occasional freezing requiring a hard restart. (They pretty much all do this. The $180 box does it as well as my amazon stick and even my media pc would do it from time to time) When I say occasional, I mean maybe once a week, and that’s being left on 24/7-in XBMC I find that it has an issue with AAC audio codec support, so some sources with play audio but display just squiggly lines. This is just a case of you learn which sources do that and use different sources. (most shows have at least 10 sources with many having over 20) you learn which ones work for you and just use those.Also note that there is some playing in Xbmc settings disabling one of the Hardware accelerators that helps to minimize this.- the remote is loud clicks and as mentioned before requires you be almost straight on for it to work. As for range I had no issues sitting on my couch about 8 feet away. Much more than roughly 14 ft it does become hit or miss.The nice pros of this unit:-First and foremost price. Again its about managing expectations. No your $30,000 Chevy doesn't win a race against a $100,000 Ferrari. However this box delivers better than the comparably priced amazon fire stick (which I also have running TVMC) And Has Way more options with the Play store and such.-It comes already rooted from the factory. This is very nice as it gives you complete control over every aspect of the box and android. As well as lets you do some very cool customization. This also means there are several hundred more compatible apps.- Another VERY important one to me is the support of both flash and html 5. I watch all my football directly online, and currently all of those players use flash player to play it. Android itself no longer supports flash player trying to push people to the new html 5. That would be fine, except that Flash has been the primary standard for a long time meaning, it will take some time to get things changed over.This isn't just about football either, a lot of online video still is based off of flash player, so without it you really are limited.-You tube compatibility within xbmc. I don't often watch much you tube, however, there are some things I highly enjoy watching on there, as well as when you watch a preview for a show or movie it is sourced through you tube, and even my amazon stick modded to run XBMC had issues playing You tube videos from within xbmc. And while the amazon stick would run youtube from its main dash fine, Navigation was more than clunky and cumbersome. I do not have that issue with this box, it runs you tube from both the internal app as well as sending from my phone through the Yatse remote app mentioned above.So in wrapping this up. I Give this box 5 stars, simply based on price to feature and what the available alternatives at this price point are. Also as I use the amazon stick on my upstairs bedroom tv, I have experienced the same amount (albeit infrequent) of crashing requiring a forced restart. It  has some great aspects to it and though it has a few quirks here and there, many of them are not specific to this box, but shared by many types of boxes. We have to remember that again this is relatively new technology and also keep in mind that some of these can be fixed with updates.I wanted to knock it a star for the lack of bluetooth and lack of instruction to get a usable remote for my phone on  there, However no where in the description does it say it supports bluetooth, and while annoying, it seems any android device not from the big players, comes with a poor quick start manual. Luckily if you have ever worked any android, it is all very similar, and feels second nature.  Again assuming that my rf remote/touchpad is just my specific model that is not supported. I have been running this now for about a month, as my daily tv source, and it took me 2 weeks of tinkering off and on to get that remote set up. (though only 10 minutes to get TVMC going) but now that it is I can really appreciate the box.It is on par with the amazon fire stick and on par and I might even say better that some of the more expensive boxes. I would and have recommend to friends now, knowing its quirks and advantages.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"These Look Great. I am redoing a small desk space in my laundry room/pantry/office and needed some minor files storage without the bulky filing cabinets or the high price of descent looking solutions.These work great to throw files into, sit on a shelf and they look like typical decor. i Was able to fit an entire standard filing cabinet drawer into one basket (of course after going through the drawer and recycling things i will never need again.The wire file hanging racks are optional, so the other one i use to store the odds and ends with plastic stacking trays from office ax and staples and such. All my office supplies, (pens, rubber bands, paper clips, stamps, envelopes, Etc) all fitting in several trays stacked neatly on top of each other hidden in plain sight. And i have found since they are not in one big drawer, they actually stay neatly organized.Some mentioned there being no bottoms lol, These are collapsible, the bottom simply folds down to rest on its holders. I found these to be very strong and durable.They do not work with standard tabbed Folders however because of height. The folders linked below, are what i use and they work great, lid closes tight no issues.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CDZ4U0/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00The little rope that keeps the lid from falling all the way open does, sometimes have to be guided inside the basket when closing, and i wonder if this couldn't have been remedied by simply moving the rope a little more inside toward the center or even to the center. It hasn't bothered me enough to even look at moving it myself.Great purchase, exactly what i needed. When i went to buy them the first time they were out of stock, i shopped and shopped the internet for probably over 2 hours collectively and i found nothing close to the look of these at a reasonable price. im talking $ 45 for something that didn't look half as good.

"A very nice motion light, and something i have been wanting to put over the driveway for sometime just never got around to doing it.My first thought when i received this was, ""who wants to fumble around with no doubt a complicated process of changing the batteries in an outdoor security light""However I found the battery design to be great, a simple twist of the front and the whole compartment comes out allowing you to easily hold it in your hands wherever you find it most easy to work. a simple squeeze of 2 clips releases the batteries, and your ready to replace the 4 D cell batteries.Light comes packaged nicely in a way that presents well, protects the light, but isn't wasteful and i do appreciate that.The package comes with easy to read and follow instructions, the light of course and 3 screws and 3 plugs. All you need for usually an easy install.The 2 led lights provide a nice amount of light that at roughly 8 feet high covers a width of roughly 15 feet.its rated at 12 hours or 2000 turn on's on a single set of batteries, Although keep in mind that there is a difference in the dollar store batteries vs a good set of batteries. Not saying there aren't good generic batteries, (Costco's kirkland brand as well as monoprice com batteries, are really affordable and work really really well) i'm only suggesting that if you don't have a brand of generic battery that you are familiar with, and know they are a good battery you put a name brand set in so you don't have to change them every month. While it will certainly depend on activation counts throughout a day, i expect mine to last roughly 1 year on a set of batteries, depending upon how much the bunnies mess with it this spring.Brightness, duration, and sensitivity is not adjustable, they are set from the factory with the light duration to be 20 secs after motion stops, i find this to be sufficient and have no complaints there.I agree with the other review that if possible 3 meters (around 9 ft) is a better height for both field of motion sensing, light spread, as well as just keeping some shady character from just knocking it down. Sure they could use a bat, or crowbar but loud noises like that have a tendency to wake my shot-gun up, (man is he grumpy when woken up ) so i would think (or at least hope) most would just move on and avoid that.I really like the 2 points of articulation on this light. Really allows you to mount it and point it pretty much wherever you need, and once tightening the finger screws, it has been secure in the pretty windy few days we have had. No issues thus far with the rain and snow either.I have no complaints about this light. The one that was provided to me was brown not black, so i am assuming they may have different colors to choose from. Be sure your ordering the color you want. I would definitely recommend to a friend.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is a nice 3 mode lantern. Runs off of 3 D batteries, with reported 30- 40 hours of operation. While i did not fully test this, i did leave the light on overnight on the 2 brightest setting, and upon checking in the morning not only was it still just as bright, but the unit was not remotely hot thanks to the 2 cree led bulbs.I don't know much about led bulbs, all the internet information i could find on Cree bulbs suggest that they are quality component and should provide long life and hassle free usage.I Like that this light is a little larger than the previous TaoTronics light i tested for when a little more light is required. Walking around with the lantern in the dark, this easily lights your feet and directly in front of your feet up, where some other lanterns bases seem to cast a shadow directly in front of your feet.Ip44 means that most wires and screws are protected as well as it is able to withstand splashes of water from any direction, so a light mist on a quick run through the rain should not effect the light.3 modes allow usefulness in a variety of situations. all controlled from the single button on the front. Low light, High light, and the s.o.s strobe Even on low this is plenty bright enough for most uses. Keep in mind that battery quality makes a HUGE difference in brightness and run time of the light. Dollar store batteries will not be as bright or last near as long as a good set of name brand batteries.In addition to the carrying handle, and the removable shade (for even brighter light) i like the little fold out hook on the bottom for quickly hanging this light in a tent or from something overhead to provide hands free lighting. While the rubber base, grip, and top keep it skid free when standing on its own, they of course also add some protection to the heavy duty abs plastic housing which is nice.MY only complaint of this light, is the battery compartment. When you unscrew the bottom, first there are no clear labels to identify the orientation of the batteries. You have to look for a small round ring where the plus side point would fit. And secondly reattaching the battery cover is very cumbersome. While i understand the need for a sure fit for water protection there has to be a better way. There are 2 little grooves that 2 slots from the light must line up with push down on before twisting. While Taotronics did a fine job of clearly marking them with 2 arrows on the lantern side and 2 arrows on the cap side, they are still quite tricky to actually get on just right easily. Once you do a few times, you kind of get the hang of it, but it is not something you want to be trying to do in low light for instance. I had my wife try it just to make sure i wasn't just having a case of stupid. Even with me explaining it to her, she bumbled with it for about 3 minutes like it was a mislabeled rubiks cube, before she was finally able to get it.That is my only complaint is that battery compartment, i had to knock it a star for that. That is something that gets picked up on and becomes easier after doing it a dew times however. Other than that, i really like the light, seems well made, brightness functionality are right on par with what i am learning to expect from Taotronics and there great led products. So even with the battery cover issue, i would still recommend to a friend, and beg that he let me watch the first couple time he tries to use the battery cover lol.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This thing really puts out the air.  I was really surprised. I mean sure it's its an air pump and it's suppose to blow out air but the pressure was so nice i was actually able to use it to blow out my computer.I really like that the 3 nozzles that come, not only should cover most anything this type of pump is meant to deal with. beach balls, air bed, rafts, pool toys, the list goes on I also like that they are all tethered together. They have enough to get out of the way for use, but they stay together, and helps not lose them, drop them.I also like the deflate feature, for quick deflation of large items like beds and rafts.It is worth noting, that the pump can run for 10 minutes, then it needs to cool down, so factor that in. I don't know what would need to run longer than that. I inflated our air mattress in less time than that. However, That is the instruction, clearly written on the side of the pump.This is made for home use or you will need a power inverter as it is an ac plug, so taking it to say the river to blow up a raft will need that inverter. I would like to have seen some type of dc converter to be able to run this from a vehicle for such instances,However for just over $10 bucks, Really can't complain.So yes i would still recommend this to a friend.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"This is one of the few types of products, your a little scared to turn use lol. Having raised 2 puppies in our home as well as dog sitting several other  dogs throughout the last few years, i was honestly a little TERRIFIED to see what my carpets may hold.I was surprised that all my shampooing and scrubbing did a pretty good job, there was a few remnants of spots here and there but pretty good. As i walked around the room with it it highlighted some other things besides urine. Also showed i need to shampoo the couches.But highlights dust, and the fingernail polish my wife had spilled and cleaned up way back when.The light came with the wrist lanyard attached, and batteries ready to go. Unscrewing the back little section, reveals the cradle that holds them. pop them in, close it up and go.I like that it is metal not, plastic. Though the led cover is plastic. But being they are led they don't get hot.All in all this light does what it needs and is suppose to do. As others have said, if you ever want to sleep on your next vacation, DO NOT TAKE THIS LIGHT. Just enjoy knowing that your room is cleaned and the sheets are washed often.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"Installs pretty straight forward. In our recent bathroom remodel I put down travertine tile in the whole bathroom, wanted to make sure we always kept humidity under control.With the way my wife's morning routine would go with the kids, she was getting out of the shower just a few minutes before leaving the house. and having 2 dogs one of which still loves to occasionally shred rolls of toilet paper, leaving the door open when no one is home isn't an option, So to error on the side of caution, i would have her leave the fan on, which i would shut off when i got home from work. Problem is this puts a lot of extra unneeded wear on our expensive bathroom fan.Enter this. Yes it kicks on automatically if someone forgets, Although as others have mentioned, because of position, (at light switch height) it really does take quite a lot of humidity to kick on. i wish this were adjustable but it is not. So i have to ding it a star since its big thing is automatically switches on. However, i do thing that if the humidity levels arent high enough to trip this, they arent high enough to cause damage to the floor and wall tile. We just turn it on as we go in to take a shower.The 30 minute timer is what saves us, she can let it run when she leaves and it will shut off, saving electric and premature wear on our fan.The bottom switch is the fan, and obviously this isnt optional to switch as the sensor would then turn the light on and off. And having a 4 year old that cant quite reach the light only the fan, is a slight annoyance but he grows everyday so soon wont be a problem.All in all, it hits what i needed to, but i ding it a star for not having a humidity sensor adjustment.  Would still recommend, and buy again.I have had this installed now for like 4 or 5 months.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUO4XL65O3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Q6CGLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3LUO4XL65O3A","A9DXIOIV63IGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9DXIOIV63IGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nice cover here to protect most types of bikes. I was successfully able to fully cover both a mountain bike, as well as a standard style bmx bike.Seems to be respectable as far as thickness, while not thick like say a tarp, it conforms well to the bikes, and i feel confident in the strength of the material.Comes with a nice little storage bag, to keep it clean and rip free while not in use.The material itself did not let water through while testing under the sink faucet. It did however leave a few drops through the seams where the black meets the silver. I mean a few drops not a stream. This is always a common issue with every bike cover i have used even costing 3x as much. The nice thing is when put on most bikes, these seam locations, would allow any water that does get through to drop straight to the ground and not really touch the bike. So a real non issue.I like the included little buckle strap to keep the cover secured on your bike. Surprisingly, i've had a few covers that didn't have this, and it never fails my cover is in the neighbors yard if i happen to need the bike outside.I would still recommend the cover, as i stated the seam leakage is the same on just about all bike covers. So at this price it is still a great value.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"When i opened this package i was completely lost at first. I thought... who makes a cellphone case that blocks the Camera? what is this the 1950's?  (yea i know)Looking at the description, i remember thinking that the magnetic pieces they were referring to was the typical band strap closure.Then i realized the actual phone cradle itself is magnetic and removable, and immediately thought ""that is genius"" While some may be slightly annoyed by this, as someone who has had their camera lenses scratched and thereby ruined in the past with a ""protective"" case on, i love this little feature.  Also i have found that usually over time the case material in other cases will start to fray around that camera cut out and you end up with alien looking threads in your pictures of grandma at her 89th birthday.The overall feel of the case is nice and what you have come to expect from the PU simulated leather material. The stitching was all good, and tight with no frays or random threads, that i have seen a lot of on these many cases even though new.The cradle grips the phone well and is low profile enough that it doesn't feel bulky or cumbersome in the hand.2 credit card slots and a larger pouch for cash and such. Really the 1 credit card slot, is more of an id slot as it has the clear view window. the pouch is welcomed, for those rare occasions i actually have cash. Some cases seem to forget they still make that stuff.All in all this is a nice case. I feel it does provide a good bit of protection, even though, the inside cradle may shift if dropped just right, i don't think it will fall out, and it won't shift far.And it's at a reasonable price so you still have some money left to store in it.This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

"I like these!I am new to the ukulele, and am playing some finger style and blues on the uke, so it is a bit different than the usual strum sing-a-long style, and these are soft, have some give, and maybe will make a bit of a ""come back"" in popularity!Especially helpful for guitarists making the cross over to ukulele. The ""blues"" style on the ukulele is fun to play (see Fred Sokolow's DVD on Blues) and the accent that comes from using a soft pick is a nice sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7VNG6MCTFU14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002Z2CZY#wasThisHelpful","R7VNG6MCTFU14","A2X64F7DOMZO23","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X64F7DOMZO23?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are perfect for shuffle type percussion on the Meinl Cajon.  They are lightweight, well balanced, and appear well made.  They sound perfect with the Cajon, especially for soft rhythmic beats, and are a nice compliment to using the Cajon hands only.  I found that having the adjustable length of the brushes allows for a nice change of sound, including a deepening sound, or even a 'beat' with stick only, especially when targeting the bass section of the Cajon.These bring a nice variety of sound to the Cajun and make a versatile instrument (Cajon) even more versatile, and allow for a pleasant ""shuffle"" pace sound that goes so nicely with Americana, folk, and country blues music.  If you like the ""unplugged sound"", a la Clapton, these sounds really nice with the Meinl Cajon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R77YUHZHJC992/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2G2NRY#wasThisHelpful","R77YUHZHJC992","A2X64F7DOMZO23","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X64F7DOMZO23?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice for acoustic sounds.  How I learned of this is important.  My family and I were visiting a church and the hymn singing was beautiful, and we loved the cello solo, for example, and heard a nice percussion that was non-intrusive.  I have never seen a cajon before, and at first, I could not tell where the sound was coming from until I realized that the percussionist was sitting on his instrument!  The church used a single mic near it, and he kept a steady, even bass while adding the ""trebles"" or ""snare"" sound, gently and appropriately.  It was beautiful sounding so...our musical family read the Amazon reviews (our norm!) and settled upon this.  It is well made, has the nice bass sound I was looking for, and we purchased the brush drum sticks recommended for it and the results, thus far, have been really nice for our home recording (Tascam DP-008EX).Great for acoustic groups, church groups, or home music, the Meinl Percussion HCAJ1NT is perfect for home multi track recording and sounds wonderful behind the guitar, acoustic bass, ukulele, and so on.  We have much to learn on it, and you tube is replete with many free lessons, but with the specially constructed ""brush"" drum sticks, it is a great home instrument for percussion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BYDHZ9S6HHNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B6FADU#wasThisHelpful","R2BYDHZ9S6HHNH","A2X64F7DOMZO23","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X64F7DOMZO23?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you hated Self Portrait, you will like this.  If you liked even a portion of Self Portrait, you will love this.  It is almost as if Dylan has had the last laugh; that which critics lambasted is re-introduced without all the schmaltzy background singers and some of the later additions in the studio and we are left with some beautiful Americana songs, Dylanesque singing, and some performances where it is very evident:  Dylan was having fun.

"Tested 9-15-2015 Jones Beach, New York.Smooth, fast, and lightweight, this is an excellent boogie board providing enough sturdiness an adult, but best made for children.Most of the boogie boards, or ""bodyboard"", ""body surfboard"" are smooth and fast, but some can break upon a strong 'fold', where the rider hits the front of the board into the sand, ruining the board.  Others, very strong and near unbreakable, add a great deal of weight to the board, which may convince the rider to just 'graduate' to a surf board.  This is a lot of fun for kids and will provide good buoyancy for them, including in wading water, but is strong enough to support adult male's bodyweight but it is not designed for the adult's possible abuse in rough surf.  It is also light enough to not burden parents with carrying it on lengthy walks to the water, which, as a parent, is a plus.  It is compact size but long enough for a 10 year old, for example, to lay across and cover enough to ride a wave in.  Too long and it can be cumbersome, but too short and the kids will fall off it.  This is nice sized.This item was received in exchange for a review.

Thus far, those that show strong signal and good battery life, however, have been in short supply.This picked up reception nicely, and the battery life is 7 hours in non-stop use, which is more than needed, but it is in its standby mode that is most assuring as this is a very long time between charges.

"Although the price here is artificial due to minimum advertising price, this review is about the instrument itself.  Please note that dealers should be contacted directly for appropriate pricing and this review does not reflect the advertised price here.The guitar is a masterpiece of Martin.  The only complaint that I, and others have had, is, itself, a compliment to its quality:  the owner often fears playing it for the possibility of it being damaged, especially when a visitor asks, ""May I play it?""Having said this, the rival of beauty is the sound.  It is deep, beautiful, and although Martin sells guitars at much higher prices, in my opinion, it is the epitome of Martin quality:  the best you can buy as a standard.The beauty is breathtaking, the wood long aged, adding to the cost, something the knock offs from China do not do, which takes decades of storage.  Everything you could want in a guitar's sound, comfort, playability combines with the beauty of the mother of pearl, and tasteful but not over done design.  To behold either side is to see a work of art that rings out beautifully when played.  For the 42 series, Martin uses their best East Indian Rosewood, and those who have played the rarer Brazilian Rosewood have said it rivals it in sound.One only need to look at the cost of used OM 42s to see how well it holds its value.It is a treasure and a family heirloom to own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQYNQGX9I9HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UM6AS86#wasThisHelpful","R2TQYNQGX9I9HB","A2X64F7DOMZO23","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X64F7DOMZO23?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of Martin Guitar's best kept secret:  the beautiful, soft tones of mahogany, American made quality, beautifully and gently stained, with understated detail and appointments.It plays wonderfully and with the new ""Retro"" strings, will give you the ""Americana"" or ""Country Blues"" sound from the 1920's and 1930's.  It is moderately priced, and Martin remains the most duplicated of manufacturers, especially with the knock offs from China.Owning a Martin is a special thing for even casual guitarists and the 15 series, uniformly, is the perfect balance between Martin known quality and a price within reach.  No laminates, but all ""real"" wood, bone pins, and it will only improve with age.  The satin finish 'rubs off' in time, making it a very personal, unique instrument.  The 15 series, in all sizes, has been recognized by reviewers for years to have uniformed quality.Any all wood Martin is a value to own and although I have heard and played some fine ""sapele"" models, there is nothing as the lovely, soft, gentle sound that resonates from aged mahogany.  This model, as well as the 00-15M, and the custom 15 models, are finger style and finger picking delights.  The 000 model is perfect for soloing as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y6YZDRXYY6BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K0IRLQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Y6YZDRXYY6BR","A2X64F7DOMZO23","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X64F7DOMZO23?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very nice piece that came quickly but wasn't packaged all that well.  The box the cooler came in was pretty well packaged but they put it in a large mailing box too big for the cooler so the outer box was pretty beat up when it arrive.  Luckily the inner box and cooler were not dented or scratched or broken in any way.As for the cooler, it is very light weight, and good looking.  It is all black on the front, top and sides and the glass is smoked.  It has a nice light on the top rack but not the bottom so it only illuminates the first 6 bottles.

"This is really beautiful and the glass is rather thick, so it looks like it could last a lifetime if taken care of.  I used pure paraffin oil in the lamp and it lit up beautifully.  You only need about 1/4 inch of wick exposed to get a good light without the smoke or soot.  It does get soot on the attached snuffer when put out so you'll need to clean it up occasionally to keep it looking nice.I was concerned about the wick and its price because it said that it was almost $20 for a replacement wick.  This is a specialty wick made for this lantern, so it would be difficult to just replace it with ordinary wick.  The cost was almost $20 but upon closer review, that is for 4 wicks.  The wick replacement is the wick and the copper cap, so you'll pay about $4 and change for the replacement.It does stand pretty high, so I can't use it on the dining table as it will block faces but it looks great on a center table or end table.  I recommend you put it away after use as not to allow it to be blown over or get dirty being outside.Overall a great purchase, Love, Love the look and the Customer Service from the company is A++++Cheers and Vidimo Se!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1M9BFUA2SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKSQF2Q#wasThisHelpful","RH1M9BFUA2SK","A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is Great, Charges fully and fast using the smart system as not to overcharge.  It comes with a base to hold it upright and about a four food power cable, not too long, not too short.  First I thought it being mostly plastic, it would be fragile, but I admit it is rather solid and the base does a good job holding it up.It provides a good fast steady charge to all of my devices and has a blue indicator light on the front letting you know it is on.  Keep in mind, it is a small unit so if your using all the ports it can be a bit tricky manuvering the cords in place.There is some room for improvement:1.  Put rubber on one side so if I want to lay it flat vs using the stand it wond slide about.2.  Since it is such a small unit and there are 6 ports that leads to a messy cord affair, I recommend retractable cords or 1 or 2 feet.  If that isn't an option, velcro cord ties help.3.  With so many cords at once, you may want to label your cord for easy identification.Overall this is a great unit that does the job and does it well.  The room for improvements can be done by the end user if needed to keep things nice and tidy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18MJCNKS6KZ83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7DIIH4#wasThisHelpful","R18MJCNKS6KZ83","A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I brought this to keep all of my electronic cords in while traveling.  It is a little bigger than I expected but I like it a lot.  It is spacious and nice looking and appears to be very sturdy.  The interior has a plastic coating so it is somewhat leak-proof, not sure if the zippers are as well I wouldn't think so.I do have some suggestions for improvement:1. The zipper opens left to right, this is a bit awkward for right handed people at least for me.2.  It is a bit difficult to see the items inside as the mesh is very tightly woven.  Bigger mesh would be helpful for easily finding items.3.  The pouch comes with a swivel hook but it is so hard to press, I will have to remove it and put a different one on it.Although I have suggestions for improvement, it is by far the best electronics bag I have found yet and the pro's outweigh any suggested improvements.  I'll post some pictures for your review.I do recommend the product it appears to be made EagleCreek solid as expected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23DIX1DLU4BBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9S8VLI#wasThisHelpful","R23DIX1DLU4BBI","A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for my hearing impared mother and while the sound coming from the speaker is great, it is muffled to the receiver on the phone.  It's easy to use and sets up without a hitch.  The button were also not very responsive.  We had to keep hitting the buttons to get them to work.  Note to the maker:  The brochure is so tiny, mom couldn't read it without a magnifying glass.  Also, the press to call back button said to press twice but we found it was a long press to call back the last dialed number.This is a great sounding speaker with a lot of potential, just be aware of the downsides esp. if using it for hearing impaired.  It is not friendly for the elderly either with the small printed user guide and lack of wall plug.  They supply you a USB cord but not a wall plug.  Mom doesn't have a computer and we weren't sure where to find the correct amp wall plug so we had to send this back.I think with some changes this is going to be a great speaker phone, it just isn't there yet.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19AC65TK6VWE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKOZ5DC#wasThisHelpful","R19AC65TK6VWE1","A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TRSUX9JYKNCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, I liked this book a lot. I liked Mia. I liked her off-beat family. I liked her geeky friends. Well, I liked one of her geeky friends. However, I feel like we were shortchanged on the romance. I'm HOPING it's because this is book 1 of a series and we'll get more resolution down the road because it felt like there was a lot of potential for steamy hook-ups and awesome romantic banter and it didn't quite pan out.That said, Mia's life is a fun, fun place to visit. She gets to dress up in awesome costumes, has a family who might get a little snippy with her upon occasion but who ultimately support her, and do something she enjoys. Well, I don't think she enjoyed the murder that popped up, but she works in IT because she's good at it and she likes doing it.Basically, Mia is a woman of many talents.Fortunately, her talents come in handy as she works her way through the clues as to why and how her friend ended up dead in her office. She also has to prove her own innocence to Jake, which kinda sucks for her, but what can you do?Solid, engaging, and fun, I just wish we'd been given a little more resolution on the romance end.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RXZTTF413LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPTDGXG#wasThisHelpful","R28RXZTTF413LG","A1UH21GLZTYYR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UH21GLZTYYR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maddie and Logan were so CUTE. Even when Logan was convinced he was heartless and Maddie was trying to figure out how to get out of the pickle she found herself in. SO CUTE.Quite frankly, Logan won my heart the first time Maddie found him reading in bed. *swoon* Muscles, a verra sexy accent, and a bed reader? *triple swoon* And that doesn't even scratch the surface of the guy! He's all concerned about his men and needs to make things work and swoon swoon swoon.And Maddie. Yeah. I get her. Inventing a beau might have been an accident, but there reached a point where she couldn't gracefully back out of it without doing something drastic. And that drastic thing both saved her a life in society and ended up hurting the man she didn't know was real. Which is a complicated thought if you start thinking about it too long.I genuinely adore all the heroes and the heroines in this entire series. Logan and Maddie hit the spot--socially awkward girls and the men who fall for them, FTW!--and I loooooved Logan's men. They all might be a little broken, but they're a solid unit when they work together.I think a full series reread might be called for, don't you?-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343WL5MG8ZQ2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062349023#wasThisHelpful","R343WL5MG8ZQ2Z","A1UH21GLZTYYR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UH21GLZTYYR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, Courtney Milan makes me happy. Without fail, her books make me smile. The indomitable Free teaming up with the brooding Edward? Hellllooo, sparks.Honestly, I don't know who I felt for more in this book. Free is trying so hard to make changes. She's standing strong in the face of adversity and it's heartbreaking and fantastic all at once. But then there's Edward. What his family did to him was terrible and the fact he survived at all is a testament to his strength. As physically strong as he is, he feels fragile when we first meet him. Determined to do what he needs to do to get his revenge, yes, but he also felt like he was hiding. The Edward he could be was buried under what he showed the world.And, oh, the things those two could do when they put their heads together.I loved seeing appearances by couples we've met before. Free's family always makes me grin. Her daddy is something spectacular and I loved how he dealt with Edward when things fell apart.I read these books all out of order and I'm not sorry about that in the least.

"Good GRAVY, S.M. Reine knows how to end a series with a bang. And some of the things revealed were mind-blowing. Like, I'm still trying to wrap my brain around them. *stares at everybody with creepy concentration and tries to keep it together*GUYS, I didn't even hate Stark by the end. And I don't know what to think about that. I mean, the guy's a jerk and a total butt-nugget most of the time and I DIDN'T HATE HIM BY THE END. That's some impressive writing, because there was a time I thought he was irredeemable. And the stuff that went down in winter?!?! *crazy eyes* Heck, I ended up liking a DRAGON who did some pretty reprehensible things (or so it seemed at the time) and I'M SO CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT ME NOW.*deep breath* So. This book is good. It gave me some things to think about and it tied off the overall series arc with some serious awesomeness. If you've read the previous books, you're going to want to read this one. If you haven't read the previous books, go back and start from the beginning. I mean the beginning-beginning.

"Another fun installment as Sophronia puts her finishing school training to good use. Her teachers are beginning to fear she might be too good (is there any such thing?) and her gentlemen callers are piling up.Oh, and she might be in a position to thwart a most dastardly plot. AS ONE SOMETIMES IS.Before I go on, I'm going to point out that once again I was saddened by the lack of werewolves. I mean, there were more than in the previous book and the ones who did show up were decidedly naked (always a plus), but my rally cry is and shall always be MOAR WEREWOLVES.*ahem* So. Sophronia has her hands full trying to keep Sidheag from getting into trouble. Except Sidheag knows what she needs to do and it isn't aboard a dirigible. I LOVED seeing the events that brought Lord Maccon into Alexa's orbit in the Parasol Protectorate books. Not that we saw them. But we did see the fallout.

"I really enjoyed the family dynamics going on with this book. Lydia has some issues with the way the brotherhood always takes first place in a fire fighter's life. She's fierce when it comes to defending those she loves and she's rather uncompromising when it comes to her views.Her views being that she won't play second fiddle to a fire fighter's job again.So she lies to herself when she and Aidan tumble into a relationship. She sees their time together as having a built in end date since she's not sticking around Boston.Except, she's falling for the guy. Because, you know, he's sweet and sexy and he's NOT her ex. Or her dad. Or her brother. Which is good, because EWWW.I liked Aidan. I liked that he was willing to go for what he wanted. I liked that he was torn up about lying to Lydia's brother. I liked that he listened to Lydia and found a way to make things work.I just liked him. Part of that might stem from the way he sheds his clothes whenever he's not working. I appreciate a man who likes to strip down when he's relaxing.

"Holy wow, this was a good book. Not a little good. A LOT GOOD. Like, I want more good. Basically, it was a punch to the emotional gut in the most wonderful way. It's painful at times and sweet at times and always heartbreaking in one way or another. I'm not saying I teared up or anything, but you might want to have a tissue or two handy. Just in case.Hannah's circumstances were just painful. Her reaction to a friendly touch said so much about her. And her parents, come to think of it. All the lies she's been forced to tell, all the times she felt like she fell short, they hurt. As the truth began to come to light, it hurt even more. Because no child should be expected to do the things she had to do to maintain the facade of perfection for her family.And Sean. SEAN. Trying to reconcile these new feelings he's having for Hannah against EVERYONE reminding him he needs to stay away from her because of his history with her sister was rough. I honestly adored him and could NOT get enough of his sweetness. Sweet as hell bad boys do it for me, apparently.Loved, loved, loved the small town setup and all the characters.

The sex isn't too shabby either.But let's not talk about how much I adore a good romp through alien worlds. Let's talk about Lexa and Damon.Lexa and Damon. They definitely have some sparks when they're first on page. Sparks of the ""I loathe you and your high-handed ways"" type. It's awesome.

"Serialized novels and I sometimes give each other the side eye. I wasn't blessed with an abundance of patience so having a story STOP partway through makes me sad. Especially when it's a story I'm (mostly) enjoying.The mostly part revolves around the secrets kept from Emma. Part of me gets why the Belles were keeping those secrets. Really, I do. Yet... I have an irrational knee-jerk reaction to secrets. Especially when they're so blatantly kept from the main character.Again, I get why Virginia was trying to ease Emma into the truth. Emma had been through more than her fair share and she needs time to find her footing. But secrets like this make me have crazy eyes. It's a proven fact. I mention it in many reviews. I get it and I understand how those secrets help move the story forward, but I'm irrationally peeved by them.That said, I did enjoy this book. The Belles are secretive and with a diverse set of powers. I don't know if I'd be thrilled being thrown into the middle of them given what their talents are, but what can a freshly minted orphan do, right?There were some ups and downs here.

"I have said this before and I'll likely say it again: S.M. Reine's books kill me. Her characters do things (THINGS) and I honestly can't figure out how they're going to come back from them. Then the pieces fall into place and a bad situation turns worse (because these are some awesomely gritty books) before they get better and BOOM everything is rosier. Or sometimes more effed up. I end up confused and heartbroken and I LOVE IT.Take the Deirdre/Stark dynamic, for example. I don't even want to marginally like the guy and I REALLY don't want him to end up with Deirdre because their whole relationship is a textbook example of domestic abuse. BUT... I get where he's coming from and I do get why Deirdre is drawn to him.I still don't like him, though.(And I'm holding out hope that something said in the first book will have GOOD repercussions for Deirdre once all's been said and done. Of course, there's always the chance I read it wrong and that thing isn't going to happen and I'll have to cry myself to sleep on my pillow once I finish the final book. WE'LL SEE!)Things aren't looking good for Deirdre and her crew, but there are hints that there might be another path she can take. And I'm ready for it.

Which makes for a rollicking good time.Fallout Girl: You had me at ""Cannibal Psychos"", Amanda Close. Kelly Killjoy has found a way to survive and thrive in this harsh apocalyptic wasteland and she's giving it her all. From boning the cannibal leader to sexy, naughty times in a mineshaft with a bunch of dwarfs, Kelly gives all her sexy-time activities her all.Straight to Video: Sexy times before a hard, violent battle is just what a girl needs to get her blood flowing.

Impending bloodshed and imminent death are good for the libido, AMIRITE?Freak Legion: Circuses and dirty little towns, oh my! I must say Kelly Killjoy has an uncanny ability to turn a bad situation into something that wrings a few Os from her. More than a few, to be honest. This world is deadly and Kelly is just the woman to grab it by the balls and take it for a ride.Lady Wasteland: Once again, Kelly Killjoy is dropped into a situation that would destroy most people only to end up on top. Not that she was always on top. Sometimes she let others take that position. The point is she took the bad situation she was put in and punched her way out of it. Mostly.Frankenstein: When Kelly Killjoy makes plans to take out the evil AMA, she REALLY makes plans. And then she makes those plans bleed. And moan in pain. And bleed some more.

"I genuinely love Cherise Sinclair's characters. Whether they're Doms or subs, they're strong and sweet and they make the wrong choices sometimes and they feel so real. SO REAL.It thrills me how perfectly she makes the strong, dominant characters come to realize they're not only NOT infallible, they don't have to be. They have people they can turn to. They have people who will have their back. Likewise, the subs aren't doormats, they're strong in their own right.Ben and Anne are the perfect example of this. Anne is known for being a strong Domme with a taste for pretty boys. Ben claims he's vanilla, but for Anne he'll give the lifestyle a chance. On the surface, they don't seem like they'd be a good match, but they work so perfectly together. Watching Ben wage his campaign against Anne's heart was awesome. And, yes, there were some stumbles along the way, but things worked out in the end.All these characters make me smile and I'm looking forward to seeing what's coming up for them in the future.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2JRRR5D6UX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT206F6#wasThisHelpful","R1V2JRRR5D6UX9","A1UH21GLZTYYR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UH21GLZTYYR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I honestly think I would have liked this book more if I had read ANY of the previous books. As it was, the cast of characters was so large it was hard to follow along with who was who and why they were important to the main plot. On top of that, the bad guy was one that I'm guessing was introduced in an earlier book because he seemed to have a lot of baggage and backstory where the rest of the characters were concerned.As it was, I was pretty lost as far as the secondary characters went for most of this book. I knew they were important, but I honestly lost track of how they fit into the overall shifter hierarchy. I'm kind of waffling how I feel about both the hero and heroine, too. Eli didn't seem to value Nivea's skills as a guard although she'd been described as being one of the best.It's hard to like a man who says things that indicate the woman who is nearly as skilled as he is would be better off making time in the kitchen instead of doing the job she was trained for. (For the record, he didn't say THAT, but that was the feeling I got every time he spouted another pithy comment about how she should stay behind.)Bottom line, I recommend having at least a passing acquaintance with the couples from previous books in this series for maximum enjoyment. I not even sure if this book could be considered a standalone based on that and the politics that drove the plot.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUP9AG6DNMI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSG8I5C#wasThisHelpful","RSUP9AG6DNMI1","A1UH21GLZTYYR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UH21GLZTYYR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a very tough time liking Jane. I can't even say I really ever *did* like her. She's passive and doesn't stand up for herself. Given her abusive childhood, I can see where that came from. But it made it hard to like her when she let people get away with things that she should have been screaming about.On the other hand, having a dark angel on hand to mete out justice (like a superhero, but, you know, waaaaaay scarier) meant that Jane didn't have to act to get revenge. She just had to pass along a name and (eventually) the wrong-doer would get their just reward.Still, I had a tough time with her. I do think the hardest thing was how she had no idea what she was getting herself into when she gave her angel the first name. Unfortunately, once she'd started, there was no way to stop. She was in for the long haul, regardless of how she felt about it.Frankly, Catherine Cavendish did an excellent job balancing Jane's past against the choices she had to make later on. Jane was an abused, lonely girl who grew into a woman who had a hard time liking herself and let people walk all over her. There was something oddly satisfying in following her to the bitter end.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLA8HL0Z6VAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYTF3C0#wasThisHelpful","R1FLA8HL0Z6VAK","A1UH21GLZTYYR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UH21GLZTYYR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this one. Quite a bit. Which isn't surprising given that I've enjoyed the other books in this series, but I think picking it up at the right time helped. You know what I'm talking about, right? One of those days were you're looking for something lighthearted and fun with a dead body or two (that last part might just be just me, I dunno).Well, Stormy delivers on both the lighthearted and fun AND the dead body. On the downside, we didn't get to see as much Logan this time around. Sad. Burly hunks of lawyers with good banter should be a staple in every book. That said, I still had fun with the characters. (Side note: Logan feels like a werewolf name to me. From here on out I'm going to imagine this Logan turns into a brawny beast on the full moon.) (Side note to the side note: I probably need to pause my endless rewatching of the X-Men series until I stop associating the name Logan with beastly men.) (FYI, that last side note isn't going to happen.)Okay. Enough about my unconscious word associations. Let's get back to the matter at hand. Stormy. Dead body. Trapped away from civilization. I'm going to be blunt, I didn't care for her ex. Almost-werewolf lawyers seem like a much better choice for her and I'm all for them hooking up. So the ex... he didn't do it for me. However, the ex did come in handy during the investigation. So there's that.Ultimately, this book was fun with a side of dead bodies. Well, A dead body. But that doesn't sound as good, does it?

"This one took me a little to get into. I mean, I liked the fighting and Max's emotional evisceration at his wife's death was well done, but there was a lot of world-specific info that I had to assimilate before I (personally) felt comfortable with who was who and what went where.That said, watching Savina and Max dance around one another was entertaining. Her father's implication in his wife's death makes Max a little harsh with Savina. Her determination to prove her father was innocent gives each of their interactions a little oomph.And when they both gave in? Hello. Sex-ay.Ultimately, while the vampire hunter politics took me a little to get into, the overall story pretty much rocked. Max and Savina had some definite sparks and they got to take on a few vampires to make the world a safer place.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KYL4FXGOVY9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HO9POY#wasThisHelpful","R2KYL4FXGOVY9I","A1UH21GLZTYYR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UH21GLZTYYR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I love Eve Langlais's books like whoa. So, yeah. Expect some fangirling and general flailing because I tend to do that with all her books. Just prepare yourself and we'll be fine.Duuuuude. Arik and his hair. Kira taking off like a bat out of hell when the shearing happened. I found great amusement in her wild flight from his fury. I found even more amusement in how his Beta and Omega made fun of him for the incident. Arik may be Alpha, but his second and enforcer get in some good digs about the chopping.As always, Eve Langlais gives us a heroine who is sassy, a hero who is growly (maybe not *always* on this one, but often), and a slew of secondary characters who made me giggle. I do adore extended families who go out of their way to butt their noses in where they're not needed. And territorial mamas.

"Lucifer's story was a surprise to me since I had thought this series was finished with book 7. A happy surprise, mind you, because the poor guy has shown a little heart in previous books and deserved to not be rotting in hell on his own. Which isn't to say he's a good guy. He is the original fallen angel and his years ruling hell have left their mark on him.But... he's also not all bad. His interactions with Erin and her son have shown us a slightly softer side of Lucifer and it was fun watching him fall for a fragile human woman in a big way.And by ""fun"", I mean sad and a little heartbreaking. Occasionally with bloodshed. Not Nina's, because Lucifer's all about protecting her. Oh, you'll see.As always, Felicity Heaton has given us a complex, tortured hero who has to work past some major roadblocks before he figures out the woman he's trying to push away is the one for him. Yep, Lucifer has some trust issues. Who saw that coming?Enjoyable and sexy, with some fun cameos by previous characters. Erin's wrath over one of her father's actions was pretty epic. You don't mess with a mama bear when she had a cub to feed.You know, that's a good rule of thumb no matter how you look at it.Bottom line, I'm glad Lucifer found someone to make his reign a little less dreary.

"The end of a series is always so bittersweet. I love that we got to see Tom and Nell FINALLY get their happily ever after, but it's hard to say goodbye to a family that started out as a ragtag group of street kids and became something so much more than that. *sniff* Goodbye, wacky Hadrian family with your crazy, huge get-togethers and loads of supernatural gifts.But before we say goodbye, we have to watch Tom and Nell deal with the aftermath of his youthful marriage. Given that these two have been in love FOREVER, his bombshell at the end of the last book was devastating to Nell. For his part, Tom has closed himself off from the family so as not to pain Nell with his presence. In some ways that hurts Nell even more because she does still love him and she doesn't want to see him hurt.Yes, theirs is a complicated relationship.Man, their issues weren't pretty. However, the more time they spend together, the more things smooth out between them. Finding out the truth about Tom's wife goes a long way toward making things better. EXCEPT, Nell has come to terms with being alone and she's not willing to risk her heart after Tom destroyed it so thoroughly the last time.Like I said, theirs is a complicated relationship.I loved seeing how the various couples we've met through the previous books have expanded their families and are still desperately in love. I enjoyed revisiting old haunts. I... just like this series.

"I kinda dig these Lexi books. She's smart and totally socially clueless, but she still manages to navigate the rough waters of dating while battling international terrorism. AS WE ALL DO. Well, at least the dating part.Lexi being Lexi, she freaks out over bringing her hunk of a man to meet her parents. I'm not going to lie, her having to admit that she knows very little about him (such as his real name or where he lives, etc) to her parents made me crack up. Hearing that, it makes him sound fishy, but knowing he's a government asset adds a little more context to Lexi's lack of knowledge. But her parents aren't quite in the context loop and I can only laugh at how awful it must have sounded to them.And of course, Lexi being Lexi THINGS HAPPEN to toss her feet first into danger. And her friends and family into danger. But mostly Lexi. Because that's how she rolls.I LOVED the dynamic with the SEAL team. Lexi isn't a soldier and she asks questions when she shouldn't, gets in trouble when she should be hunkering down, and has a very hands-on run in with the SEAL team leader. Which, OUCH. Watching them come around and begin to appreciate Lexi and what she can do sort of made my day. Geek girl takes on the SEALs and charms them with her awkward social banter (and her level head in a tense situation). YESSSSS!All in all, I felt for her friends (OMG!ELVIS!), am finding her relationship with her man growing on me, and like seeing Lexi in her element. Which seems to be anywhere.

"I had a bit of a tough time getting into the 2nd book in this series (probably my fault for skipping book 1. What can I say? I'm a rebel. I do what I want.), but this one worked from page 1.We got (kinda) introduced to Vince in the previous book. Well, he got mentioned at least. His life has been terrible since he was abducted and imprisoned and, when we first meet him, there's no end in sight. Then the love of his life reappears and suddenly things are looking rosier.Except they're not at first. Because years and years of degradation and torture aren't something you get over right away. Vince has a lot of healing to do before he feels worthy of Zara and their son. I got that. Totally. His need to stick it to his captors worked. His desire to prove himself worked.

"The second half of Sophronia's first year (or maybe it's the middle part of her first year. All I know is a lot happens to the wily girl and I see plenty more on the horizon.) is just as deadly and dangerous as the first half. With the added bonus of boys. Boys from the boiler room and a duke's son and her best friend's brother and a vampire or two.(Where are the werewolves? I ask. Their lack is a disgrace! WHERE ARE THE WEREWOLVES!?!?! I should probably point out that the lone werewolf NEARLY made up for the lack, but my inherent love of werewolves makes me demand MOAR!)*ahem* So. Sophronia. She's ingenious and sneaky and she can ferret out the inner secrets of the teachers and students of the school faster than anyone else. Which is fortunate because there's a lot of STUFF going on that needs to be taken care of. I'm torn about the love triangle because as much as I like Soap, I can't see anything coming of it due to the fact that the girls are conditioned to expect they'll have their husbands picked out for them. I mean, this is a THING at the school. A THING. Like, they might be told EXACTLY who to marry to advance the cause. Or whatever.While I like Soap, I really liked Felix. Because, well, he amuses me.Fast paced and appropriately ridiculous at times (OMG! The NAMES! LOL!), I'm completely looking forward to the next book. Because I sense more werewolves.

Juliette and Andre have a sort of complicated relationship. I say sort of because she doesn't know he's a vamp and he might have done something a little questionable when ending things with her. I mean, I guess it wasn't questionable when you take into account that he was doing what he thought he needed to do to keep himself and her safe, but... no, it's still a little underhanded. If he hadn't been torn up about doing it, he would have lost some major hero points.But he was, so he didn't and what were we talking about again? *enjoys being purposefully vague*Anyway. Vampires.

"Holy bananas, I love these books. Ridiculously so. I reread all the previous books in the series this year just so I could be (re)caught up when this book came out. To be fair, I'd have probably reread them even if there hadn't been a new book on the way, BUT STILL.*draws sparkly hearts around the Elder Races*Anywho. Julian and Melly. Those two have some history they have to get over. Tangled, angry history. Being that they have to have contact with one another every so often because of their positions, this makes meetings fun. Or shouty. You decide.Picking up almost directly from Xavier's book, we get to see a darker, more feral side of the Nightkind. Justine will use whatever she can to obtain her goals. Melly and Julian are simply obstacles she needs to remove or use to get to where she wants to be. Which is not a good thing for the two of them. Because Justine is pretty ruthless and whacked.As bloodthirsty vampyres often are.Speaking of ruthless, previous books have drawn Julian in that light. Which isn't entirely untrue, but he had his reasons for acting as he did. Seeing his reasoning puts some of those earlier actions in perspective and I completely understand why he did what he did to Carling and why he's so volatile.As for Melly, I genuinely liked her. I liked that she saw her own limitations and decided to forge on despite them. She knows she's a B-grade actress at best, but she loves doing what she does. As the heir to the Light Fae Queen, she's toed the line her entire life except for when it came to Julian.

"Awww. I liked this one. A lot. Simon was a little closed off and a lot messed up by his past (although he might disagree with that statement) and I LIKED him. His sudden attraction to Daphne was made even sweeter by the way he tried to ignore it because she was his best friend's sister. Oh, and the way he delighted in tormenting Anthony just made me laugh. Because that is SO a guy thing to do.What can I say about Daphne? First off, I love her family. Mama Bridgerton is hilariously pushy while also being a pretty awesome mom. Daphne's brothers are pretty spectacular in their desire to keep their sister and her tender heart safe. I totally appreciate the way Daphne could hold her own against them, too. As she kept pointing out, having three older brothers has made her pretty adept at standing up for herself and given her a good sense of how to score a hit (sometimes literally) that can drop a man in his tracks.Simon was charming while also managed to pull off the brooding, tormented hero thing. Daphne knew what she wanted, but she was able to adjust her plans on the fly when circumstances changed. I liked that about her.

"I didn't dislike this book, but I didn't quite adore Finn the way I liked his brother. Mostly, I think, because his initial need to tear Marissa's life down was hard for me to wrap my head around. I get that he was hurting and the issues he was dealing with made him a little unpredictable at times, but...I don't know. The whole revenge thing was a wee bit off-putting.And Rissa. YIKES. She made some bad choices before, but she's spent the last little bit trying to put her life back together and get out from under the shadow of her past. Probably the only thing that made me slide back into thinking Finn would be worthy of her was how quickly he abandoned his original plan once he saw her again.That said, I did like Finn. He's messed up and he chooses a path that isn't exactly honorable, but a teeny part of me gets why he felt like he needed to do it. Other than his plan for Rissa, his actions showed him to have a big heart and a great capacity for caring. So, yeah, I liked him.The brothers (all the brothers, not just Tank and Finn) still look to have A LOT of issues to work out between them.

"Honestly, the only lack I found in this book was that there could have been MOAR werewolves. The one we were treated to was nice enough, but I have a decided soft spot for those wild men and you can never have too many by my standards.Nonetheless, I can overlook the sad werewolf showing. Because as with the Parasol Protectorate books, this one is borderline ridiculous with some of the names and circumstances Sophronia finds herself in, yet I couldn't put it down. Mrs Barnaclegoose alone gave me a giggle with her name. Sophronia's propensity for ending up on the wrong end of pies and various other foodstuffs made me cringe (in a good way). Her first year at the school is a little rocky, but Sophronia certainly proves she's ready for anything life has to throw at her.Except, possibly, avoiding making a mess or getting embroiled in crazy schemes.Some old (yet young) faces pop up to tie this series in nicely with PP and we get see how progressive the teachers are in showing their charges how to be a deadly lady.I have to say, I'm looking forward to the next book.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UPVT78IYKFF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZGKMXM#wasThisHelpful","R1UPVT78IYKFF6","A1UH21GLZTYYR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UH21GLZTYYR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Justin was more in the light reading spectrum, Lance deals with slightly weightier topics. Christi Snow makes it work in a big way (not going to lie, I love that Lance's way to let off steam was by doing male modeling. Because muscles.). The danger Lance and Andi end up in is chock-full of Christi Snow's trademark romance and suspense and I had FUN reading it.That said, there are definitely things these two deal with that probably weren't all that fun for them to go through.I LOVED how tongue-tied Andi got around Lance. She's shy and awkward around people, especially someone who pushes all her sexual buttons like Lance does. For his part, Lance knows there's more to Andi than the wallflower she presents to the world.

"You know when you're reading a book and you can see the ignition point coming and you know it's going to be bad because lies never make things easier when they're found out? Yeaaaaah. Stacy Gail gets me right in the heart when she lines up these events and you can see them teetering like a house of cards, ready to fall over at the slightest upset.*stares at everyone*I like Scout. I felt for her what with her past and the issues she has with trust. But... BUT it was Ivar who killed me dead this time. Ivar with his terrible childhood and desire for the truth about who he is. Ivar who is used to being used and doesn't even realize how desperately he wants a place to belong.That said, I did love how Scout and her ""stray"" foster sisters banded together. I liked when Scout is given a hard truth about her inability to trust and she sees how her past makes her unforgiving about some things that need to be forgiven upon occasion. I liked her. I genuinely liked her and the relationships she cultivates with those she interacts with. Not going to lie, I liked when she went batshit crazy on Twist and Angel, too. Sometimes a girl just needs to lose her cool to make things happen.I have Twist's story in hand and I'm ready to dive in. (Also, Sass and Rude? YES?

"All right. I have to come clean. I REALLY liked this book. It was... fabulous. From Dallas and Carson's first interaction right up to her mini-meltdown. I like these guys. I like them hard. Heck, I ended up liking SILAS and I pretty thought he was a grade-A douchecanoe in his first scenes. So that says something. (Also, I'm TOTALLY looking forward to his book. Because pretty, broken boys are my fatal flaw.)So. Dallas and Carson. I loved Carson and his... I don't know. His sweetness. He had a plan and he worked toward his goal. Sure, the sparks he had with Dallas threw a bit of a wrench into that plan, but a good quarterback knows when to adjust and ... yeah, I'm no good at sports analogies. Let's just say Carson figured things out and leave it at that.And Dallas. Man, I felt for her. When her wish to break free from football is thwarted by her father's new position, she sucks it up. Not right away, of course, because everything isn't hearts and roses for her and who'd want to read about that anyway? Honestly, it's a bumpy road and she makes some mistakes along the way and things look bad for a while...but she figures it out.This book is sweet and sexy and I really, really liked the dynamic between Dallas and Carson, Dallas and her dad, Carson and the team, etc. But what I really loved was when things fell apart, they talked it out. They didn't do the over the top drama thing and make misery rain down on themselves by jumping to conclusions or stewing in what they thought the issue was. THEY TALKED IT OUT.

"Since Amazon released its new Kindle Voyage late last year, it seems as though the market has been inundated with folio covers, cases and numerous other accessories for this popular e-reader. I have a Kindle Paperwhite e-reader so I had to borrow a Kindle Voyage from a friend for this review. Belkin calls this kind of folio a Shield Fit Cover and that name accurately describes this hard shell cover. This folio cover measures 6"" x 5"" x '"" and only weighs 3.5 ounces. It comes in three colors: Blacktop (black), Nightfall (purple) and Bubblegum (pink); the one I am reviewing is the purple cover.The front of this folio is covered by a thin sheet of hard polyurethane (PU) with an imprinted grain for gripping and to minimize smudges and fingerprints. The underside of the front cover is a gray piece of soft microfiber fabric to prevent scratching on the Kindle Voyage. The molded cradle on the back cover is made of thick polycarbonate plastic and each corner has a raised lip to safely secure the device. Inserting the Kindle Voyage was easiest when I slide the right side edge in first, then I just laid the device down and pressed the left side into the cradle. I discovered that removing the Voyage was easiest if I held the cradle down with my thumb on the lower right corner and then pressed down on the upper left corner of the cradle. When I did this the Voyage popped out with no problem. There are other ways to remove the Voyage, but I found they all involved working the corners of the cradle. As most folio covers do, this one also provides full access to buttons and ports even when the cover is closed. If the hard-shell exterior and cradle needs cleaning, that can be done with a clean wet cloth.Once the Kindle Voyage is inserted, the front cover can be closed and the integrated magnets snap the cover shut and secured. The hinge that holds the front and back covers together is just an extension of the thin gray microfiber fabric on the underside of the front cover. It is worth noting that the hinge doesn't cover the entire side of the cradle; only 4 of the 6½ inches. The front cover can be flipped around to the back and the same integrated magnets hold it in the open position, though not as aggressively. As I flipped the front cover around to the back, I noticed the cover flexes because all that is holding it together is a thin piece of microfiber fabric. Also, when the front cover is closed, it does not always line up with the cradle very well. Yet at no time did this flexing expose the Kindle Voyage to potential damage. But still, in my opinion, this is the weakest link (and the only one I could find) in this Belkin folio cover and though it is working very well now, over time the hinge may very well loosen or tear.By the way, there has been a lot of chatter about the fact that the integrated magnets don't consistently turn the Kindle Voyage on and off, or sometimes not at all; and that is true. However, there is nothing on the Belkin or the Amazon websites that says they are supposed to! All the integrated magnets are supposed to do is secure the folio open or closed. And they do a pretty good job of doing that.I still like this Belkin Shield Fit Cover. It's a nice looking and yet a very basic folio cover; I like that because I don't need a cover with all the sparkle and flash that some seem to want. It's thin and compact, so it doesn't add unwanted weight or bulk to the Kindle Voyage and is manufactured with a tough exterior that will adequately prevent damage, scratches and scuffs, and minimize fingerprints and smudges as well. And like I just mentioned a moment ago, the integrated magnets held the front cover both completely open and closed, just like it was supposed to. Just work on a better hinge and you would have a no-fault product.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Side Note): For those prospective customers who may be interested in this, some of the statistical information on the Amazon website for this Belkin product (size, weight, etc.) does not match the actual product. I measured, weighed and tested this product, so I know my measurements are accurate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWBZQ8M236EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU7CCWO#wasThisHelpful","RYWBZQ8M236EU","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Sterling Silver Love Knot Two-Row Bangle Cuff Bracelet is a piece out of The Amazon Curated Collection. This bracelet is Rhodium-plated, mostly so the silver retains its shine and prevents tarnishing. It is made of sterling silver, a combination of 92½ percent silver and 7½ percent copper. This mixture balance makes sterling silver more durable that pure silver and at the same time keeps the silver's sparkle.Unlike other bangle cuff bracelets, this one does not have any gemstones or precious stones added to enhance the bracelet. This two-row bracelet relies on its simple symmetrical design, making the textured ""love knot"" the heart of this jewelry piece. My wife doesn't care for showy jewelry, but chooses a piece that complements her outfit rather that jewelry that is the focus of her outfit. Sometimes she will wear a bracelet on her bare wrist, and on other occasions (usually in the winter) she will wear it over the top of a long sleeve top or dress. Knowing this, it was the overall simplicity that drew me to this sterling silver bracelet, along with the two-row design.The bracelet is attractively smooth and shiny and measures 7¼"" from tip to tip and almost a ½"" wide at the widest point. The size can be gently adjusted, if necessary. Quite a few bracelets have a chain or clasp closure, but as the drawing indicates this one doesn't. That hasn't posed a problem for my wife since the opening between the two tips is only 1¼"". For the purposes of this review I weighed the bracelet; it weighs in at half an ounce.As I mentioned earlier, this bracelet features a textured knot that generally forms the shape of a heart; Amazon calls it a ""love knot."" There is no question that the knot in the drawing is much more detailed than the actual knot on the bracelet. Frankly, that is to be expected since the graphic is an artist's rendering of the bracelet and not an actual photo. Though that detail seemed to be bothersome to some, it wasn't of concern to my very practical wife, who understands that with jewelry like this, it's the impression that is on display.Even very good plating can break down over time and usage. So it was a nice of Amazon to provide a double set of dark blue boxes to safely store their Sterling Silver Love Knot Two-Row Bangle Cuff Bracelet in. The inner presentation box is nicely lined with a velvety fabric so the bracelet stays shiny and protected, as any jewelry should be.Even though Amazon refers to this bracelet as fine jewelry, and elsewhere as fashion jewelry, I would describe this particular bracelet as mostly for any nice occasion jewelry. By this I mean it has a variety of uses. My wife likes it, wears it and enjoys how it looks on her. There is my recommendation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19K9DFBQ5CVTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LB4J99C#wasThisHelpful","R19K9DFBQ5CVTZ","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new Belkin Classic Folio Case is designed specifically for the much larger iPhone 6 Plus smartphone. For its size (6½"" x 3¾"" x ½""), this folio case is still rather lightweight, only 3½ ounces. The Belkin case I am reviewing is black and case is made of a smooth, but still easily gripped, polyurethane (PU) and has fitted side and corner clips on the right side of the open folio to keep the iPhone 6 Plus safe and secure. Inserting was easy; just snap it in place. Integrated magnets keep the cover securely closed. The left inside of the open polio case has a nifty 3½"" slotted pocket for storing such things as an ID, driver license, credit or AAA card; I was able to comfortably slide in two cards.As most folio cases do, this Belkin case allows full access to all of the important controls and ports without removing the smartphone, as well as cutouts for the camera and speaker. Evidently, this folio case will eventually come out in a variety of ""vibrant jewel-toned colors with a luxurious, buttery smooth texture"" (from Belkin website). However, right now it appears that this case is only available (on Amazon anyway) in black and navy blue.Another feather I liked a lot was that the back cover of the folio case can also fold into a convenient stand for hands-free viewing and also adjust to multiple viewing angles. I own a small Kindle reader with a folio case, so bending the cover around and securing it to the back for easy single-handed reading is commonplace. This Belkin folio case can also do this and the integrated magnets to a fairly good job of securing the front cover to the back cover for easy single-handed phone use.Even though this Belkin Classic Folio Case is relatively plain looking, I still like its sleek, understated and smooth feel and look. When I carry my phone and reader around with me, the last thing I need is to draw attention to them. I'm not a slave to fashion, nor do I wish make a fashion statement with my mobile gadgets. But if you do, Belkin printed the following concerning this Belkin folio case on their website:""Inspired by some of our favorite street style looks as well as the high-fashion runways, the Belkin iPhone 6 Plus Cases, Wallets and Folios have evolved beyond your basic protection to become the perfect fashion accessory.""In my opinion, that is completely overstated. Though it is possible that after the cases with the ""vibrant jewel-toned colors with a luxurious, buttery smooth texture"" come out I may have to reconsider my subdued fashion opinion.I really like this Belkin folio case, mostly for its sleek, yet basic look and utilitarian design. In other words, it works as advertised and looks good while doing it. Recommended.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Side Note): For those who may be interested in knowing this, some of the statistical information on Amazon and the Belkin websites for this Belkin Classic Folio Case (size, weight, etc.) does not match the actual product. Both sites state that this case has a soft microfiber inner lining, but the inside of the case I have is made of polyurethane; there is no microfiber inner lining. Just to make this a bit more perplexing, the photos on both sites (Amazon & Belkin) and the photos on the back of the retail box match the product I am reviewing perfectly. The front of the retail box clearly indicates this case is for the iPhone 6 Plus. Neither the case nor the retail box has a product number listed for comparison purposes. I even checked the light brown micro printing on the back of the retail box with my wife's vintage graphic designer magnifier cup; nothing. Even the Vine Program label that is usually attached to the products was missing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEW8WTLOD71D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NM9OCBO#wasThisHelpful","R3HEW8WTLOD71D","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Outdoor Tech Wired Chips® Universal Helmet Audio System is a specialty item designed for use inside helmets with a built-in audio liner inside. This type of sound system is most commonly used by motorcyclists and snow skiers, though I suppose a long distance bicyclist who was willing to use an audio fitted helmet could just as easily benefit from this product, too. One of my Air Force friends rides a Harley and loves these wired Chips®.A prospective customer should know that the photo on Amazon is a little misleading. It makes it appear that this product is a headset with a headband. What appears to be a headband is actually just the very flexible wiring that connects the two Chips® together. There is no headband since these wired Chips® are not a traditional set of headphones.This Outdoor Tech system comes with the two wired Chips® and a 53"" in-line cable that includes a manual multifunction control device, plus two sets of instructions, one for quick Get Started set and another more detailed booklet. Connecting the wired Chips® is no different than any other media device. First, plug the 3.5mm jack nearest the in-line multifunction control into the left ear Chip® port and the other 3.5mm jack at the other end of the cable into your smartphone, iPod or other pocket-sized audio device. Then insert the Chips® into the helmet audio liner, clip the multifunction control onto your jacket collar or sleeve near your head (a clip is built onto the control) and you're wired up and ready to go.Actually, this is a dual button control system. Your media device can be controlled by the in-line control I mentioned earlier and a second controller is built into the right-ear Chip®. The advantage of the Chip® control is the large 1¼"" diameter button in the Chip® can be activated by pushing or pushing and holding the button without having to look away from what you are doing; and this can be done without removing your gloves. I really like that feature. The one feature you cannot control from the ear Chip® is the volume; that has to be done by the volume wheel in the in-line multifunction control.The multifunction buttons can control the following functions on your media device:* Play* Pause* Raise and lower volume (in-line control only)* Skip Forward* Skip backwardThis multifunction audio system isn't limited to media devices (this is where is really gets good). It also answer, reject, hang up and mute phone calls from your smartphone as well as activate Siri! This is why the in-line control needs to be clipped relatively close to your head so you can use the built-in mic.I had to wait until my adult son came over with his smartphone (I only have a not-so-smart phone) and helmet to actually test out the speakers and controls. The sound from the 2"" diameter Chips® was pretty good, depending on the song and genre, and the controllers worked well, just as indicated in the instructions. The Outdoor Tech website has a couple of videos that were helpful. One of the videos featured an older gentlemen who sounded, dressed and acted like he was straight out of vintage Woodstock era of the late 1960s. The instructions must have been written by the same guy because I can ever remember reading the phrases ""This page was created to give you a 2-minute run down of how these babies work."" ""Can I get a hell ya?"" ""Rock out, make calls, and, you know, ski and snowboard and whatnot."" And finally, ""Well, we've all been there and know that this situation totally sucks.""The most challenging part of using this Outdoor Tech Wired Chips® Universal Helmet Audio System is memorizing the controls: Short press once, long press for 2 seconds, press left ear button, etc., etc. Both instructions have charts that include function and action commands. The booklet is small enough to carry around with you, so it will just be a matter of time, and a few dropped telephone calls, until I have all of the commands stored away.A couple of warnings are worth noting: (1) Keep Chips® dry, (2) Keep Chips® away from direct sunlight or hot places (High temperatures will shorten the life of electronic devices. (3) Do not let the Chips® onto hard surfaces. (4) Do not use intensive chemical products or detergents to clean the product.One last thought that is completely irrelevant to enjoying this set of wired Chips®, so disregard the following if need be. Outdoor Tech calls this product a ""Universal Helmet Audio System."" But it doesn't fit in all helmets; just the ones with built-in audio liners. That doesn't seem like a universal system to me. Two additional accessories I almost forgot to mention: Comes with (1) two Outdoor Tech peel & stick company logos. (2) A soft white cloth pull-string carrying bag.I really like these, mainly because the system is so easy to set up and use (except for the memorizing part). The 40mm drivers produced a good sound experience and the connection cables look like they can weather a real workout, especially the 53"" cable. It has what appears to be a tough nylon wrap around the cable for strength and durability. Nice idea! The Chips® can function in weather down to -4 degrees F / -20 degrees C. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26VJ4Z80CKCQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTWLKMW#wasThisHelpful","R26VJ4Z80CKCQ0","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have tried to apply a clear screen protector to a mobile phone, iPad or eReader you are acutely aware that trying to get it on straight, and without those annoying bubbles and dust particles rarely had a completely satisfactory outcome. If you wanted it bubble-free, you paid a professional to apply it. Thankfully, that is a thing of the past. With the release of the new Kindle Voyage late last year, Moshi also released their iVisor XT Screen Protector for that device.I have a Kindle Paperwhite, so off I went to my favorite big-box store to test this screen protector on a Kindle Voyage. The Moshi iVisor XT comes packaged in a simple cardboard packet with a zip open top. Before I visited the store, I took some time viewing a few videos to become acquainted with how this Moshi iVisor should be applied. There are some excellent how-to videos on YouTube. I checked out the Moshi video, too, but it had no instructional audio so it was less helpful than the ones on YouTube.When I unpacked the screen protector it immediately reminded me of the old fashioned overhead projector slides (I'm really dating myself now!); the ones with the cardboard border and a clear film window. This Moshi iVisor XT has a black border with a much thicker, crystal clear protective screen. There is also a microfiber cloth included in the packet and the manufacturer recommends the front surface of the Voyage be thoroughly cleaned prior to application. One thing I noticed about this iVisor is it is really glossy . . . I mean REALLY GLOSSY! Since I wanted to successfully apply this screen protector without any dust particles or bubbles, I decided to clean the iVisor screen, too, before I applied it.The instructions for this product are very basic and mostly of the picture variety. This is why I usually recommend watching narrated videos for before I try applying or assembling anything I'm doing for the first time. Once the Voyage was cleaned the next step is to gently pull the tab on the backing down to remove it from the iVisor. One of the guys on a video recommended keeping the backing for future use if you decide to remove the iVisor you will have something to temporarily stick it on. What I found really nice about this screen protector was the adhesive is only on the black border and not on the screen itself. And the adhesive is not your typical sticky to the touch type of adhesive. The Moshi website described the adhesive as a polymer-based adhesive which allows the screen protector to be used, removed and applied again. According to Moshi:""iVisor's polymer-based adhesive provides for unlimited cleaning and reapplication cycles, making it the most durable and easiest-to-install protector on the market today.""Once I removed the backing I was pleased to discover that the screen protector doesn't curl up like the old fashioned ones but remains flat, ready for installation. According to the video, and my customer associate friend at the store, the iVisor should be applied from the bottom first, ensuring the black border on the iVisor aligns with the bottom edge of the Kindle Voyage. Since the adhesive isn't particularly sticky, applying the iVisor was surprisingly easy. After it was applied, I checked around the edges of the Voyage to make sure it was a perfect fit. This Moshi screen protector covers the Kindle Voyage front surface from top to bottom and side to side. Once I had the fit I needed, I gently pressed the black border down first, and then the screen itself. After cleaning the iVisor again with the microfiber cloth to remove my fingerprints and any dust or lingering smudges, the store's Kindle Voyage had a BUBBLE-FREE, and removable screen protector! By the way, I did remove the Moshi iVisor Screen Protector, reattached it to the peeled off backing, inserted it back into the cardboard packet and took it back home with me.Like I mentioned earlier, this iVisor XT is very glossy, and that didn't change once I had applied it to the Voyage. The reflections were there depending on the angle I held the device. I was more interested in what the screen protector looked like with the Kindle Voyage on than when it was off. When I turned it on the Voyage the screen was highly transparent with only minor reflections every now and then, again, depending on the angle I held it; it wasn't bothersome. I did notice that when the device was turned off there was a rainbow-like distortion in the center of the screen protector. According to Moshi this is not a defect, but a natural occurrence. It isn't noticeable when the Voyage is on.Checking the screen sensitivity was my next test. The iVisor passed this test with flying colors. The full touch sensitivity of this iVisor was excellent. According to their website, Moshi uses: ""MicroGrid technology to ensure optimal touch sensitivity.""Here are a few miscellaneous features worth noting: (1) The screen protector stayed firmly in place while it was on the Voyage, yet it was also very easy to remove. (2) To my surprise, both sides of the screen protector can also be washed with water; this should only be done when the iVisor has been removed from the Kindle Voyage. (3) The Moshi iVisor XT for the Kindle Voyage only comes with a black boarder at this time. (4) The iVisor comes in XT and AG models, though I'm not sure the AG model is available yet (XT: Crystal Clear; AG: Anti Glare).I was impressed with this Moshi iVisor XT Screen Protector. Mainly because it is easy to put on and can be taken off just as easily and mistake free. And, of course, who couldn't enjoy a bubble-free, scratch-resistant screen protector? I couldn't find any legitimate defects or recommended improvements to this product, except possibly the glossy, reflective screen that caused other reviewers such consternation. Other than that this product is excellent and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0F0STG0LYK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU7COAE#wasThisHelpful","R1Z0F0STG0LYK0","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both of our adult children do some form of fitness training. So I decided to use them as my test subjects for this review. Though this Belkin Slim-Fit Plus Armband is specifically designed for the iPhone 6, my daughter discovered that it would also accommodate her iPhone 5 without any adjustments or problems. The Belkin armband that I am reviewing is for arm size small-medium.The first thing I noticed after unboxing the armband was how lightweight it is: only 2.1 ounces. At the same time the size much larger than I expected: 6½"" long and 4"" wide. Our daughter used an armband some years ago when she had a much smaller and not-so-smart phone; this Belkin product dwarfs that one. The Belkin Slim-fit Plus Armband is made of a very thin black and gray stretchable (and breathable) polyester fabric and the faceplate on the front is made of a flexible black rubber material. The actual strap is 2"" wide and very smooth and comfortable to the touch and will accommodate a flexed upper arm with a circumferential size of 8"" to 12"". A strip of 1"" wide black Velcro is stitched to the backside along the entire length of the adjustable strap. When the iPhone is inserted inside the holster a thin built-in clear plastic protective faceplate covers the phone's screen, protecting it from inadvertent scratches and water damage. There are reflective accents built into this Belkin armband for nighttime visibility; neither of our children run outdoors after dark so this feather wasn't something they considered useful for them. There is a two compartment pocket on the backside of the holster: one for the iPhone 6 and another one that can be used to secure personal items like plastic credit or key cards, keys and other small thin objects. I thought the card compartment was a nice idea and definitely a welcome accessory. Before inserting the iPhone into its pocket, there is a black cardboard insert that needs to be removed first. That may seem like a no-brainer, but since this product comes without instructions, just inadvertently pulling on parts may lead to damaging the product. In this case, however, it was the right thing to do. There is a polyester fabric flap that covers the opening of the holster which must be rolled up in order to insert the phone. The slit is pretty narrow so a phone case may need to be removed in order to insert it. I had no problem inserting both the iPhone 6 and 5 without removing the cases. Both phones fit snugly in the pocket and the polyester fabric flap over the opening stays closed preventing moisture, dust and other unwanted materials from getting inside the pocket; another nice feature. There is also a hole at the bottom backside of the holster that matched perfectly with the iPhone's headset jack.One feature I noticed while I was checking out the armband was a ½"" wide black rubber belt loop that encircles the strap itself. When I pull the Belkin armband out to the box this belt loop was on the same side of the armband as the black rubber closure tab (the right side as you are looking at the front faceplate). It had the image of a set of headphones pressed into the rubber so obviously it must be related in some way. It wasn't until later when I was looking at the photos of this product on Amazon that it dawned on me that the rubber belt loop was on the wrong end of the armband. I slid it around to the left side (the same side at the headphones jack I might add) and the mystery was solved. It was a loop to hold the headphones cable against the armband, and thus the user's arm.Now it's time to find out what my two testers had to say about the Belkin Slim-Fit Plus Armband for iPhone 6 (Blacktop):Our twenty-something year old son has a gym membership and works out using both aerobic and anaerobic (strength training) exercises. He purchased an iPhone 6 late last year and was very interested in putting this Belkin armband to the test during his workouts. Our son liked the lightweight design and especially the easy insertion process, even with his phone case still on. He is 6' tall and weighs 175 lbs.; his body size is about average. He put the Belkin armband on in a straight arm, relaxed position with ease, but when he cinched up the adjustable strap he could barely wrap the rubber tab around side loop to secure the Velcro. He said the armband was comfortable until moved his arm into a casual flexed position. At that point it was obvious that he needed a larger strap. He had no problem navigating his iPhone's touch screen and was pleasantly surprised that this worked so well.Our twenty-something year old daughter confines her workouts to mostly dance routines, outdoor jogging and indoor stationary machines and small free weights. Likewise, she was also eager to strap on this Belkin armband for use during her exercise routines. She also liked the lightweight design and the fact that her iPhone 5 fit just as well as her brother's iPhone 6 did. She is rather petite so strapping on and securing the Belkin armband was a breeze. She also liked how smooth and comfortable the armband was once it was on her arm and the second pocket for storing things was definitely a big hit with her. She also liked the fact that the Belkin armband was hand-washable and especially that she could thread her headphones cable up through the black rubber belt loop so it wouldn't flop around while she was dancing or exercising. Navigating through the clear protective screen took a little more patience, but she said it wasn't a problem. The only thing she didn't like about the Belkin Slim-Fit Plus Armband for iPhone 6 (Blacktop) was the bulky size. Like I mentioned earlier, she is petite and so the large size of this holster on her small arm was a game breaker for her.Overall our opinion of this Belkin Slim-Fit Plus Armband for iPhone 6 (Blacktop) was very positive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14TFX40AXTLA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O08PW2Y#wasThisHelpful","R14TFX40AXTLA7","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used ArmorAll products pretty regularly to protect and care for the exterior and interior of my cars. However, over the last several years I have become dissatisfied with the performance of their spray-on products. So when I saw this bottle of Chemical Guys Natural Shine product, I was ready to give it a try.I live in the Midwest and the weather can be brutal on cars. One of my vehicles is a 2001 Dodge Stratus that was really in need of some help. The Chemical Guys have been around for over three decades and when I visited their website I was impressed with the variety of products and tools to wash, restore and protect vehicles, old and new. They even offer classes on how to properly detail your car and more videos explaining and demonstrating more applications than I would ever use. They released this Natural Shine (Satin Shine Dressing) in September 2013, so it has only been on the market for a little over a year.So, how did it work? I decided to work on the interior of my Dodge first to get an idea how effective the Satin Shine Dressing actually is and how satisfied I was with the results. My dashboard is in pretty good condition, but it obviously needed some nourishment; a real pick-me-up! The first thing I noticed was the product smell. It didn't have a greasy, petroleum smell like ArmorAll, but instead left my interior a fragrance similar to a leathery new car smell. That's the best way I can describe it. And more importantly, it has a thicker more creamy consistency so I could easily determine what areas get the dressing and those that don't. By comparison, my ArmorAll is runny and difficult to control. Also, this Natural Shine is a water-based product with a UV blocker included; I really like that.As you may have guessed already, this Satin Shine Dressing doesn't come in a spray bottle. It comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip nozzle and is applied very much like a liquid car wax. There are simple written instructions on the plastic bottle: ""Shake well--Clean Surface--Wipe or Sponge On--Allow to penetrate--Wipe Dry If Desired--Re-apply as Needed."" I decided to use one of my round, palm-sized paste wax applicators to apply the Satin Shine Dressing to the top of my dashboard; it worked really well. I followed the example in one of the Chemical Guys videos and applied a modest amount of the Natural Shine dressing to the applicator by squeezing a single stripe across the center from side to side (they recommend two or three stripes for tires). I only applied the dressing to half of the dash, rubbing it in, because I wanted to compare the before and after results. Wow! Not only did the dash not feel wet or greasy, the satin shine was perfect for an interior. ArmorAll would leave a wet shine and stay tacky for a couple of days afterward. I couldn't wait to finish the rest of the interior:  the console, steering wheel, side panels, cup holders, glove box, door locks, steering column and every other piece of plastic, rubber and vinyl I could find.My dash and side panels have a grainy texture so I was pleased that the applicator I used was able to apply the dressing down into the grain. Since the Natural Shine is an off-white cream I was curious as to just how well it would work on a grainy black interior. The dressing applied with ease and the creamy white color disappeared, completely restoring these parts of my interior to a like new look.I had to wait to do the tires and other non-painted exterior parts until the weather warmed up enough to apply the dressing. My tires have more than a few thousand miles on them so I was particularly interested in how well the Natural Shine dressing would work on them. I thought about using a cloth to apply the dressing, but decided to stay with the same kind of applicator pad that I had used on the interior. The sidewalls of the tires have raised lettering and the video I watched recommended using the pad for that very reason. I applied the dressing according to the video and made sure I rubbed it into the sidewalls really well. Because the tires were older, I needed to apply a second application. Again, the satin shine was just right; not too dull and not too glossy and the dressing provided a nice synthetic polymer coating on my tires.I tried to put this product to the same test anyone else would have. With that being said, I just couldn't find anything to complain about, or even something I thought the Chemical Guys should have added or left out. I like this product. I like the video support this company provides to their customers and prospective customers. I like the easy application process with little cleanup afterward, and I even liked the smell of my partially restored interior. I especially like a product that produces the results advertised. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9PXNUMR10NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FALW57K#wasThisHelpful","R3F9PXNUMR10NH","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new FUEL iON iPhone charger was recently released by Patriot and unlike the standard USB cable method of charging a mobile phone this one uses a wireless magnetic charging system. Designed specifically for the Apple iPhone 5 and 5s, comes with a FUEL iON charging stand, a charging case for the iPhone and a USB connection cable for the stand. This new charger provides an amazingly quick and hassle-free way to connect an iPhone for recharging.The connection between the charging stand and the iPhone is wireless. Only the FUEL iON charging stand requires a power cable. A 39"" USB cable is included with a standard size USB plug on one end and a micro USB plug on the other end. The FUEL iON stand can use a computer, an AC adapter or any other 5V/1 amp power source. In order for the iPhone 5 and 5s to use the charging stand the phone must be inserted into a special FUEL iON charging case. Of course that means any case you already have on the iPhone must be removed. Inserting the iPhone into the charging case is very easy: just slide down the connecting tab at the bottom of the case and then place the iPhone into the case, top first. Then push the tab on the case back up to insert the lightning connector into the charging port on the bottom of the iPhone so it can sync with the FUEL iON charging system. Once that is done, you're ready to charge the mobile phone.With any new product I always expect a clear and thorough set of instructions. Well . . . this product doesn't include anything even remotely resembling instructions. What poses as instructions are called ""Useful Tips"" and they are printed in a micro type font on a 2¼"" x 3"" piece of paper. Having said this, it is true that the charging system has so few pieces, anyone with a general knowledge of mobile phones and the recharging processes shouldn't have any difficulty figuring out how this system works. If you don't have at least a working knowledge . . . find someone who does before proceeding because you will find little, if any, help on or inside the packaging.The FUEL iON charging case is made of polycarbonate plastic and feels pretty substantial. The thick bottom, corners and '"" wide sides provide ample protection. At least one drawback is the cutouts for the variety of iPhone features in the sides of the charging case also provide a significant amount of access to the sides of the iPhone. This concerns me. One other important concern I have with the charging case is the absence of any protection for the face of the iPhone. Because of the substantial cost of an iPhone 5 or 5s, maximum protection is absolutely essential. In my opinion, a case with an open face is not providing essential security. I'm not the first reviewer to mention this and I suppose Apply with ensure the open face problem will be addressed in the near future.The L-shaped charging stand isn't very large, only 4"" x 3"" x 2"", and weighs less than 5 ounces. I suppose most of the weight comes from the magnets inside the stand. Once the charging stand is plugged into a power source all you have to do to start charging is place the encased iPhone in the charging cradle, matching the charging circle on the back of the case to the charging circle on the charging cradle. The neodymium magnet technology in this device is very strong; so strong that the first time I charged my iPhone the magnet nearly pulled the phone out of my hand, snapping it against the face of the charger. Charging took about the same time as the standard charging cable process, but the zero preparation time with this magnetic wireless system makes recharging a breeze. I keep the FUEL iON charger on my desk ready for recharging my phone.Oh, I almost forgot to add that the iPhone doesn't have to be docked vertically in the charging cradle. As long as the two charging circles are matched, you could place it horizontally, rotate it to a diagonal position, or any other position you may want or need to position it. And this can be done without any concern that the phone will disconnect and fall off the charging stand.If you're not near your FUEL iON charger and need to recharge the iPhone, a standard micro USB cable can be used without removing the charging case through a micro charging port on the bottom end of the case. Patriot also included a 4"" extender cable with a headphone style plug on one end and a plugin receptacle on the other end. They added this because the case causes the headphone jack to be recessed too deep for a standard headphone plug to reach. So just plug in the extender cable through the case to the phone and plug headphones into the plugin receptacle at the other end and the problem is solved.I like the convenience of this wireless inductive charging technology. It's easy to set up and charges just as well as corded systems. My big concern, as mentioned earlier, is the iPhone's vulnerability while in the charging case. The Patriot website has several boasts concerning the impressive protection the charging case provides the iPhone: here is one: ""Elevated bezel to protect against screen scratches."" How can this case protect against screen scratches when the entire face of the phone is open and exposed to any number of threats? In another place on the Patriot website they make this amazing claim in reference to the charging case: ""a fully protective case."" In my opinion, if this kind of charging system is to be really successful, Patriot must solve the current damage risk problem to the iPhone from this case.This FUEL iON magnetic wireless charging system has built-in circuit protection against over voltage, over current, leakage and short circuit and comes backed by a 2-year limited warranty.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VY0KBUT7P85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WK5I2#wasThisHelpful","R3VY0KBUT7P85","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a Kindle Paperwhite and wanted a simple folio case that would protect it from damage and scratches and allow me to insert and remove the reader with ease. I saw this case from NuPro and thought I would try it out. This NuPro Folio Case comes in five solid colors (Black, Blue, Pink, Purple and Turquoise), measures 7¼"" x 5"" x ½"" (with the reader inside) and weighs 3.7 ounces (without the reader).Even though the Kindle Paperwhite is visible around the edges, the cover extends enough over the edge of my Kindle Paperwhite that it is completely protected. Because it's a folio case the charging port and power button are easily accessible while the cover is on, so there is no need to remove it. The cover is made of polyurethane (PU) and has a pressed grain so it doesn't slip around in my hand and also doesn't leave visible smudges and finger prints. The cover does feel tough, with only minimal flex. The four corners opposite the binding are rounded so they minimize the bent corners so common in hardbound books. And NuPro has inset its company logo in the bottom right-hand corner of the cover.The inside is covered by a stitched in piece of charcoal colored microfiber fabric to protect the Kindle Paperwhite's screen. There are no fancy clasps or magnetic on/off closures in this case. Nor will you find a polycarbonate cradle inside that the device must be snapped into. When closed this folio can be secured with a ½"" black elastic band that runs the top to bottom length of the case. Just roll the band over from the back to the front and the case is closed and secured. In the same way, the front flap can be folded backward and secured by the elastic band in an open position for viewing. On the inside, the Kindle Paperwhite or Kindle Touch is secured in place by an elastic band over each corner. None of the bands obscure the view of any part of the screen. Inserting and extracting the Kindle is a snap and leaves no scratch marks on the body of the reader like some cradles can do over time.This NuPro Folio Case is slim and lightweight, keeps my Kindle Paperwhite safe and secure, is easy to clean, if necessary, and looks nice. There is no fashion statement being made here; but it does do exactly what I want it to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R263R6IXR743SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTI52XW#wasThisHelpful","R263R6IXR743SZ","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this recently released Epson Pulsense PS-100 Heart Rate Monitor may be something I could benefit from since I have an Atrial Fibrillation heart condition that requires daily monitoring. This new Epson Pulsense comes in two colors (black and teal), two sizes (Small/Medium & Medium/Large) and is slim, slightly smaller than my Seiko wristwatch. The wristband is about ¾"" wide, '"" thick and is made of soft rubber. The face of this heart rate monitor (HRM) doesn't display numeric data like a digital watch does, but rather uses orange and blue LED light patterns to communicate a variety of heart rate information. Epson also has a Pulsense PS-500 that has a digital readout face, but it is much larger bulk wise and costs more.This Epson HRM is one of those products that requires some serious study time with the instructions (included) and Epson website videos. I mention this because the setup and functions do not fall into the ""obvious"" category. And, more importantly, there is a setup sequence that, if followed carefully, should minimize errors and the level of frustration. After going through this process myself, I have come to the conclusion that there will be a written test given by Epson at some point in the future.The first step is to fully charge the battery. Charging takes about 1½ to 2½ hours. According to Epson, a full charge lasts about 36 hours. There is a 15"" USB charging cable included with this product. The cable has a standard size USB plug at one end and a charging cradle at the other end. Careful attention should be given to the instructions, product photos and Epson's Quick Start video when charging this device for the first time because inserting the HRM into the charging cradle correctly is very important; the trial and error method is not recommended. The cradle has two metal prongs that must be mated with two circular metal contacts on the HRM in order for charging to begin; an orange LED light on the HRM to let you know connection has been made and the battery is charging.Here are a couple of my thoughts on the charging cradle: Insert the HRM into a charging cradle with prongs seemed like a pretty old fashioned and precarious method of charging a device. I can remember back when these cradles (or docks) used to be common. However, with the proliferation of USB charging cables with standard-to-micro USB connectors, charging became simpler and safer. After practicing with the charging cradle, I became more confident and skilled at inserting the Epson HRM correctly. On my initial try, however, all I could think about was, ""What if I snap it in and damage one or more of the prongs?"" or ""Break the plastic release tab?"" Designing a USB port into this HRM device that would accommodate a micro USB connector would, in my opinion, make charging a breeze.Once the battery is charged the next two important steps in the setup sequence is to download the Epson Pulsense View app and launch and pair it to the Epson PS-100 HRM. According to Epson, the following mobile devices are supported by this product:*  iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c or iPhone 5s with iOS 7.1 or later.*  Mobile devices running Android 4.3 or later with Bluetooth Smart.After carefully following the instructions, getting the app downloaded, launched and synced to the PS-100 was pretty easy, though pairing wasn't as quick as in the Epson video.The written instructions provide a chart that explains the meaning of the blue LED light patterns. When heart rate is in one of the zones, the blue LED light will light up or flash to let you know where you are at. Also, when you move from one zone to another the HRM will vibrate. Becoming familiar with the light pattern system will let you know the status of your heart rate. Such as:*  1 blue LED light means:  ""Heart rate is below the fat burning zone.""*  3 blue LED lights mean:  ""Heart rate is in Fat burning zone.""*  4 blue LED lights mean:  ""Heart rate is in the aerobic exercise zone.""*  1 orange LED light means: ""The battery is low.""The wristband that I am reviewing is the Small/Medium size. Epson recommends the HRM be worn on the ""non-dominate"" wrist and it should be worn snugly to collect more accurate heart rate data. There is a sensor on the underside of the HRM that touches the arm and records the heart rate.To take full advantage of the Epson Pulsense PS-100, you can view the collected data, such as heart rate, number of steps taken, calories burned, and even sleep data, from your PS-100 using the Pulsense View mobile app, as well as viewing it on your computer by creating your own on-line account. There is even an airplane mode! I have no idea what that is all about?By the time I finished tinkering around with this PS-100 HRM I realized there were more features built into this small device than I needed. My primary concern was monitoring my heart rate when I was outside of my home and on the go; alerting me when my rate was elevated. This Epson HRM did a better than average job of doing that for me. Having a good set of instructions like the one included with this HRM was invaluable. Much of the information in the instructions is also listed on the Epson website.This is my first portable heart rate monitor and, like I mentioned earlier, it has many more features than I will ever use. With that in mind, I was probably not the primary focus group for this product; but it does meet my need and being rather small and resembling a wristwatch, it doesn't attract undue attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TCXJPKR75TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUKZB84#wasThisHelpful","R17TCXJPKR75TH","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's that time of year again when boys and girls dream of making it onto the roster of a baseball team. Like any other sport it takes practice to hone the skills needed to excel at a sport. One of the distributors of sports training and practice equipment is SKLZ and one of their hitting aids is the SKLZ Bat Weight PL24. When I played ball it was called a ""doughnut."" It was a weighted hard rubber ring that slid on to the barrel of a wooden bat (yes, we used wooden bats; aluminum bats hadn't arrived yet) as a warm-up tool. The problem with the doughnut was if you were using it in the on-deck circle and it was your turn up to bat, getting the doughnut off the bat could prove very embarrassing if it wouldn't come off; unfortunately, I do speak from experience here.The SKLZ Bat Weight has eliminated that pesky problem. Their bat weight, or what some call a batting sleeve, is made out of rubberized PVC and is shaped in the form of a bat barrel. I still have several bats from when I played and coached Little League baseball and so I had a variety of sizes to try out the SKLZ Bat Weight. According to SKLZ the bat weight is supposed to fit all bat sizes. Inside the sleeve is a cleverly designed permanent insert that grips the bat barrel and, unlike the old doughnut I used, this batting sleeve won't scratch up the barrel of the bat; wooden or aluminum. The batting sleeve is approximately 7"" long and 3"" wide at the widest point and it worked just as advertised with each of my bats, T-ball to Senior League. This product comes with a Usage Guide which shows the correct way to install and remove the bat weight. Once the sleeve was on my bat, all it took was a firm tap of barrel end on the ground to secure the sleeve and a firm tap of the bat knob to remove it. No more embarrassing moments.The purpose of a batting sleeve is for stretching and warming up the upper body muscles prior to hitting. As a former baseball coach I know the value of stretching and warming up first. It can also be used for improving swing speed and accuracy. As with most of the SKLZ products they have a training video for this batting sleeve posted on their website as well as on YouTube. Coaches and trainers would do well to take advantage of these videos, whether you're using SKLZ products or not.Not surprisingly this product requires some care. The Usage Guide indicates the sleeve should be washed with a mild detergent when necessary and it should not be left outside in the elements for extended periods of time. As far as I'm concerned, no equipment should be left out...ever! It should be stored away for when it is needed next. The SKLZ Usage Guide says, ""Do not store in extremely high or low temperatures to avoid damaging or reducing the life of the Bat Weight PL24.""It also shouldn't be any surprise that the PL24 means the bat weight weighs in at 24 ounces (1½ pounds) and, according to SKLZ, it is actually used by some professional ballplayers. Even though the batting sleeve fit my T-Ball bat, I am of the opinion that at 1½ pounds this training device is too heavy for those in their early years of Little League baseball.This is a pretty simple device, so there really isn't anything not to like about it. It's easy to put on, take off, practice with, clean and store. It's better than the old doughnut I used so what's not to like?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQLN7U7D494M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GIMRWS2#wasThisHelpful","R2DQLN7U7D494M","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often hear people refer to an A-ha! moment; that moment when something they read, heard or saw just ""clicks"" in their mind or something they have been thinking about makes real sense for the first time. In his new book titled ""AHA"" author Kyle Idleman takes that basic idea and develops it beyond a momentary thought into the life-changing God moment that changes everything.Early in his opening chapter, Idleman briefly illustrates AHA:""I love witnessing AHA. I see it almost every weekend at the church where I serve. I listen to people as they tell about the spiritual awaking they have experienced. In the moment there was a beautiful collision. At just the right time, a person's life collides with God's Word and the power of the Holy Spirit, and everything changes.""Instead of the traditional use of an A-ha! moment Idleman uses this general idea and then creates a three-point principle around the acronym AHA. He calls this principle ""A Recipe for AHA."" Without going into too much detail Idleman defines AHA in the following three principles:1. A sudden AWAKENING2. Brutal HONESTY3. Immediate ACTIONIdleman presents his AHA recipe using Jesus' story of the Prodigal Son. I've read other books that use this same story, unfortunately to their own embarrassment and with dreadful consequences. Usually because they fail to understand why Jesus told the story, who the story was deicting, its salient points and the dramatically shocking conclusion. To his credit, Idleman does a fine job of exegeting the Bible text and displays a healthy grasp of the story and its application.It should come as no surprise that this book is divided into three parts that correspond to Idleman's three AHA principles. Even though he uses the Bible as his foundational support, much of this book is propped up by anecdotal stories; in some chapters there is one story after another, after another. Though I enjoyed the way he developed his AHA acronym by way of biblical texts and real-life stories, the sheer number of stories packed into this book was sometimes overwhelming, often tempting me to flip ahead to see how much of the chapter was left. I guess you could say I got his point early on and didn't need the extra stories; but that's just me.One of Idleman's more valiant points in this book was when he spoke about the chilling moment when the Prodigal Son realized just how desperate his situation really was. The author writes:""It may sound harsh to say, but the number one contributor to spiritual growth is not sermons, book, or small groups; the number one contributor to spiritual growth is difficult circumstances. I can tell you this because of personal experience, reading spiritual-growth surveys, and my own anecdotal evidence after talking to thousands of people over the years. AHA comes out of the suffering, setbacks, and challenges of life. Many people could point to those moments as their greatest moment of spiritual awakening.""I thought Idleman got his message across in this book in a fairly clear and concise way. Yet I still have at least two recommendations that may make this yet to be published book a better read. First, the book is really in need of an editorial scrub down before it goes to final print. Just so you know, I am using an Advanced Reading Copy, which may be the source of some of my consternation. Second, I felt Idleman's use of a single acronym (AHA) throughout the book was actually the source of some confusion in some places. There were times when he was referring to two different ideas but didn't take the time to distinguish them. For example, sometimes he was referring to an A-ha! moment (or more accurately a God moment as he puts it) and then other times he was referring specifically to his three-point recipe for AHA. If he would have used ""a God moment"" (or an A-ha moment) for those moments that describe the actual moment of experience and then the acronym ""AHA"" when he is talking about his three-point principle it would have been much easier to follow and much more accurate at the same time.Now that I think about it there was a comment in chapter three that I shouldn't overlook. Under the heading ""Redeeming the Pain"" Idleman makes the following comments:""Right now someone is reading this who is experiencing difficult circumstances. In your pain and disappointment, there is part of you that wants to turn from God and walk away. But don't waste the pain. Hear the alarm and wake up. In 2 Corinthians 7:10 we read, `For God sometimes uses sorrow in our lives to help us turn away from sin and seek eternal life' (Living Bible). It doesn't say `God causes;' it says `God uses,' and He wants to use these circumstances to draw you closer to Him.""Idleman writes that God only ""uses"" and never ""causes"" sorrow in our lives to draw us closer to Him. Then four pages later while recounting the Bible record of Jonah he writes the following:""Jonah was on the ship heading to Tarshish when God sent a violent storm. When I'm on a boat, any storm is a bad storm. But a storm sent by God? This was the kind of storm that tossed the boat around like a toy in a bathtub. The ship's beams groaned from the violent waves, threatening to break apart. Scripture says that the sailors were terrified.""Up to this point it was just a bad storm that had the crew terrified. Fast-forward the story to the point when it really got terrifying; for the prophet Jonah anyway. Scripture says that God prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah! I don't know about you but that would definitely cause me some serious pain and sorrow. My point is this: In one place Idleman writes that God never causes sorrow in our lives; then four pages later he adds one of the most hair-raising, sorrow-filled stories in the Old Testament; sorrow that was specifically caused by God. So which is it? Does the Bible really say God only ""uses"" and never ""causes"" sorrow in our lives to help us draw closer to Him?Although seeming contradictions like this one need to be cleaned up, I still think this book provides really sound teaching on the subject at hand. Going back to Idleman's central story about the Prodigal Son for a moment, it was the Prodigal's pain and sorrow that brought him to his senses, which should show us that God will bring anything to bear on those he loves to accomplish His divine purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAESYX1E0KZEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHI4VHI#wasThisHelpful","RAESYX1E0KZEJ","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for an effective mouthwash that was alcohol free because I'm tired of the ""alcohol burn"" that comes with many of the top-named brands. When I saw this new product from Colgate I thought I would give it a try.This new Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield is alcohol free and is advertised as an anti-gingivitis, anti-plaque mouthwash. The product I am reviewing is the 16.9 fluid ounce plastic bottle manufactured by the Colgate-Palmolive Company and comes with several fairly remarkable claims:~ 12-hour protection against germs, even after eating and drinking.~ Kills 99% of germs; kills germs that cause bad breath, gingivitis and plaque.~ 24/7 protection.When I first saw the 12-hour protection guarantee and then noted the 24/7 protection promise I thought, ""Wait a minute!"" I may not be a math wiz but those two claims don't add up. After closer observation I spotted the following recommendation: ""Use 2X daily.""A couple of things I did like about the container were (1) the plastic cap came with a safety sealed wrapper around it so the consumer can be assured that there has been no tampering (most mouthwashes come this way, but not all do) and (2) the cap just screws off; no tricky push-it-down and turn or press-in-the-sides and turn caps. Also, if you flip the cap over so you can see the inside, there is what appears to be a cap inside of a cap. I doubt it was intended for this, but I found the inside cap could be used as a measuring cup for dispensing the right amount of mouthwash. I suspect the double-cap design is intended to prevent leakage but I thought it also worked well as a dispenser, too. Even though this was a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle, I was surprised just how quickly I used it up; even when using the nifty pseudo measuring cup I had discovered.Now let's get to the questions most consumers have when they shop for mouthwash: (1) Does it work as advertised? and (2) what does it taste like? The product I have has a flavor that Colgate-Palmolive calls ""Wintermint Rush."" Now considering that I was looking for a mouthwash without a burning sensation or one with a soda pop taste I was hoping this ""Wintermint Rush"" also wouldn't taste like the title...a RUSH! After trying it out it definitely didn't have a burn or a rush. This mouthwash has a very mild, rather dull taste; no fizzing, bubbling, burning and definitely no rush; exactly what I was looking for. After rinsing I found the mouthwash left a fresh, clean taste in my mouth. But does it work like advertised? As far as I am concerned it does. My breath stayed reasonably fresh and free of an undesirable smell. I found the mouthwash left a pleasant coating on my lips, which my wife also found appealing. This new Colgate-Palmolive mouth also comes in two additional flavors: ""Peppermint Blast"" and ""Spearmint Surge.""The label comes with many of the usual list of active and inactive ingredients, warnings and and so forth. This product is intended for use by adults and children over the age of five. One recommendation I thought was excellent was children 6 years to under 12-years-old should be supervised while using this mouthwash.Overall I was pleased with this new Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield mouthwash. The fact that it doesn't have a strong flavor wasn't a problem for me. The taste isn't impressive, but then I don't purchase mouthwash for its jazzy flavor like I would the smell of my cologne. I buy it because it works; because it:~ Kills germs.~ Significantly prevents and reduces plaque.~ Helps prevent gingivitis.~ Has no alcohol burn.~ Freshens breath.Postscript (17 March 2014): I finished my bottle of Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield mouthwash this morning and I'm still impressed with this product. One additional note: I have been for decades prone to having minor, yet still annoying sores on the inside of my cheeks (not my gums) because of some prescribed medication I'm taking. After using this product for only a few days I haven't had another sore in my mouth. This was completely unexpected; what a relief.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZOXPLG8NNI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAGJHVA#wasThisHelpful","R2FZOXPLG8NNI6","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I share an early generation model Apple iPad that still has the original Apple case that came with the iPad. It's time for a new case and I saw this one on Amazon just before I went shopping for a new case downtown. This recently released case (2013) was designed by Francois et Mimi specifically to fit the Apple iPad Air and comes with a choice of black, white or brown faux leather.The Francois et Mimi iPad case is noticeably lighter than the case on our iPad; almost 6 ounces and measures 9½"" x 7"" x ½"". The light weight of this case initially raised the question of just how well it would protect the Apple iPad Air? Since I don't own one (it wasn't a prerequisite for doing this review), nor do I know anyone who does for that matter, I decided to drop by our local brand-name electronics store and let them help me test it out with an actual Apple iPad Air. While I watched, the sales associate put an iPad in the case and then ran through a list of consumer questions I had prepared at home before arriving at the store.The first comment Brian made when I pulled the case out of its box was how much he liked the brown color. He also expressed surprise that the case was faux (imitation) leather and not real leather. The case has the feel of a hard shell, with some cushioning from the imitation leather covering the front flap and on the inset of the plastic shell-like back. The front cover is actually made from three vertical pieces, hinged together by the imitation leather (see photo; photo has four vertical pieces, which is not the way the case I am reviewing is made). This tri-fold design allows the cover to be flexible when opening and closing the case and I'm sure also lessens the likelihood that the cover would be easily broken. The inside of the case is covered with a soft gray felt-like lining to cushion and protect the tablet from scratches. The Apple iPad Air the sales associate selected from his store display fit nicely into the case, sliding easily under the plastic side lips to secure the tablet into place. How secure the device would be in the case was one of my major concerns. Just looking at the case itself it doesn't appear to look all that well designed in this regard. But after handling the encased iPad myself in the store I was convinced that it was secure in the case. Without actually testing the case with an actual Apple iPad Air I don't think I would have been all that confident.Like our older iPad case, there are a number of cutouts that allow some functions to be completed without opening the case or removing the iPad. The most noticeable ones are on the backside which allow the camera to be used and also cutouts for the speakers, a headphone jack and mics. Another cutout on the bottom edge allows the charging cable to be attached without opening the case. Other cutouts provide easy access to some of the controls like the camera shutter button, power on/off and sleep/wake modes, volume control and screen rotation lock/unlock.This product doesn't come with any instructions, so when I wondered whether this case could double as a stand for an iPad Air (like the case on our aged iPad does) I had nothing to consult. I Googled this product but that also didn't produce any guidance; so I was on my own. The tri-fold cover does flip around backwards and the folds will bend into a triangular shape that seemed like it could support an iPad Air. Back to the electronics store I went to test it with an actual Apple iPad Air. It did work, however I'm not sure the angle of incline would be enough to ensure the safety of the iPad (preventing it from flipping forward). And I'm still not sure this Francois et Mimi case is actually designed to go through the contortions I am putting it through to create a stand.The one feature that I found most interesting was the virtually invisible magnet that is underneath the gray felt near the edge of the underside of the case cover. Once the sales associate pointed it out I was able to feel it by running my finger over the felt lining. When the case cover is closed it automatically turns the iPad screen off and puts the tablet into Sleep mode, which puts the iPad into a minimal power usage status. Open the case cover and the iPad immediately awakens from its slumber and is ready to go. Our aged iPad doesn't have this feature.The following is printed on the back of the case storage box:""The Francois et Mimi faux leather iPad case provides the necessary protection against everyday shock and scratches, with automatic wake & sleep functionality.""For the budget-minded consumer this iPad case may be a reasonable alternative to Apple's $80 pale brown genuine leather case. When visually compared side-by-side in the store today, the sales associate opted for the less expensive, bold brown Francois et Mimi iPad Air case over the Apple iPad Air case. This is definitely an indiction that beauty (and frugality) is in fact in the eye of the beholder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMCHP04H7IM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5C7JVO#wasThisHelpful","RQMCHP04H7IM5","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's never too early to start training for baseball season. I suppose that would apply to just about any sport. As far as baseball is concerned practicing hitting, fielding, throwing, etc. before the season begins helps with individual confidence as well as overall skills. I volunteered to be a hitting coach for a couple of friends who will be coaching a coach-pitch team next season; they have sons and a daughter who will be on the team. I coached youth sports back in the 1980s so I needed some work on my skills, too.Hitting from a tee takes more practice than one might think; and doing it correctly takes even longer. I thought the SKLZ 360 Power Alley (Version 2) Heavy Duty All-Position Batting Trainer would help with the basics as well as improve the skills of the more advanced players. This batting tee definitely met most of our needs.There was not much assembly required and what needed to be assembled was easy to complete. The batting tee is constructed out of heavy duty rubber and heavy-gauge wire. The tee shaft attaches to the rubber home plate and can swivel around 360 degrees and lock into several positions for practicing hitting inside, outside and down the middle of the plate pitches. The tee shaft can be raised and lowered to accommodate hitters of different heights (22"" to 36"") as well as practicing line drives, fly balls, grounders and even bunts. In my experience, moving the the tee shaft up and down should be left to adults since the two pieces fit tightly together. One of the designs I liked about this tee was the added heavy-gauge wire frame added to the front of the home plate; it helps to keep the tee from tipping over when the ball is hit. It worked pretty well except when one of our ""free swingers"" came up.The winter weather in the Midwest usually doesn't allow for many outside practice. So I set up the tee down in my basement and began practicing with a plastic wiffle ball. These balls don't last a long time, but you can probably imagine what my basement would look like if I didn't use the plastic balls. My goal at this point is developing correct hitting form rather than hitting distance, so this hitting tee works very well for this exercise. Unlike the earlier version of this SKLZ hitting tee, this new version 2 model is made of thicker rubber so it takes a lot more punishment. The plastic balls stayed in the cup as do a hardball and softball.As mentioned earlier, the hitting shaft swivels and locks into different positions for practicing hitting pitches on the inside, middle and outside part of the home plate as well a low, knee-level and high strike-zone pitches. I thought the multi-positioning of the training tee was a real plus. Teaching how to hit inside and outside pitches takes a lot repetition and patience.SKLZ has an impressive number of training videos covering virtually every aspect of baseball instruction. Dozens are posted on their website and some addition videos on teaching hitting for youth baseball may also be found on YouTube. I like SKLZ sports training products and I appreciated the improvements they made to this new version 2 model, particularly its durability. I did notice that SKLZ also has a tee with a brush cup; unfortunately, I'm not sure how well that one works.I really liked the movable design of this tee as compared to the other SKLZ stationary tees. I do use a stationary hitting tee for T-Ball and some coach-pitch baseball. I can definitely give this new and improved hitting tee a two-thumbs-up rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBR1COL1I6K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI2CNDE#wasThisHelpful","RBBR1COL1I6K5","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had a number of deaths in my family during the past several years so this book by Joseph Primo, a former hospice chaplain, titled ""What Do We Tell the Children? (Talking to Kids about Death and Dying) was of interest to me for obvious reasons. In his Prologue, Primo provided the reader with a glimpse into his early aspirations when in his own words he refers to himself as ""a religiously fanatic teen"" who longed to become the pope when he grew up. Musing over what this would be like Primo compares being the pope to being an American president:""Bill Clinton did not wear snazzy robes or drive in the white pope-mobile. In my mind, being a world religious leader for an indefinite amount of time totally surpassed the powers of the presidency. Oh, and believers kiss the pope's ring. That is the epitome of an instant ego boost. You don't get that in the White House!""Before delving into the heart of the book, Primo provides a 10-page Introduction where he describes his ministry as a chaplain for a fifty-four-bed hospice facility; the first of its kind in the United States. Most of the patients were middle aged or older adults, but many were also young children. This is where Primo practiced what he describes as the power of being present, listening, and showing that he cared. According to Primo, this is the process that started him ""in the direction of becoming a caring presence, a witness, and a companion to those in need of support, rather than a 'fixer' or someone who could help resolve grief.""This is not a long book; only 127 pages and eight chapters. To a some degree this book took on the form of a textbook on the subject of death and dying. Some might find this as morbid but instead Primo's style made it intensely interesting. I think the fact that it was not loaded down with cited quotes and reference material enhanced the readability and kept me interested (there are only three notes in the endnotes section at the back of the book). Though the author does cite some reference material within the text, much of his support comes in the form of anecdotal stories from his own life experiences as well as from actual encounters during his years working in a hospice.One of my favorite chapters was the one in which he discusses and corrects the misunderstanding and misapplication of the well-known book by Swiss psychiatrist Elizabeth Kubler-Ross. She is the creator of the ""Five Stages of Grief"" model in her 1969 book titled ""On Death and Dying."" According to Primo, most have applied the stages as linear steps through the grief process. Yet Primo insists Kubler-Ross never intended the ""Five Stages of Grief"" to be understood and used in this way.I have intentionally refrained from discussing or divulging much of the material in this book out of concern that I may misrepresent what the author has written. This isn't a novel, so due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, and in deference to the author I have chosen to withhold further comment. In my opinion, this should be read and digested without my interpretive comments. Primo has written a very good, albeit a short book on the subject of how and when to include children in the grief process of death and dying. His book could be used for personal study, in a study group or even as a oft referenced refresher when a family or friend's child loses a parent, parents or a beloved guardian and needs to grieve in a helpful and healthy manner. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PFD1BFAG71G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0TN8M4#wasThisHelpful","R30PFD1BFAG71G","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This baseball tee is similar to the single-position tee that has been around for decades. The difference in this version of the baseball tee is SKLZ has taken the single-position design and expanded it into their ""SKLZ 5-Position (Version 2) Traditional Batting Training Tee."" By adding four additional hitting shaft positions SKLZ not only has a device that develops and improves swing mechanics and body positioning, but it also focuses on specific areas of hitting; inside, outside pitches and fastball and off-speed pitches. This 5-position tee trains the hitter for maximum plate coverage.Like other baseball tees the SKLZ 5-Position Tee is made of rubber, comes with a single adjustable hitting shaft (adjustable from 20"" to 34"") and five holes in the home plate for positioning and repositioning the hitting shaft for a variety of training exercises. I use the front two hitting positions to train hitting ahead of the pitch and stroking the ball to the opposite field, up the middle of the field or pulling the ball down the left or right field lines. The front two hitting positions also help teach the hitter how to hit the dreaded curve ball. The back two positions teach how to wait on the change-up or off-speed pitch. This tee is even helpful for instruction in the proper way to bunt (a lost art as far as I am concerned). As you may see, this isn't the same baseball tee that I used when I was coaching back in the 1980s.As I noted earlier, the hitting shaft is adjustable for use by younger/shorter and older/taller hitters as well as instruction in hitting the low ball and high strike-zone pitches. The two-piece hitting shaft fits pretty tightly together and therefore should, in my opinion, be adjusted by an adult. As with some of the other SKLZ baseball tees, the weakness I found in this tee has always been the durability of the hitting shaft, especially the cup at the top. It didn't take long before it began to show wear and damage. The earlier version of this hitting tee wasn't very durable in this area. However, SKLZ has definitely improved this version 2 model. It is made of heavier rubber and is able to endure more punishment.This hitting tee may be used for both hardball and softball training. Unlike other tees I have seen, the home plate has a built-in carrying handle along the front edge and the hitting shaft can be snapped onto the  plate  for easy transport and storage; I really found this feature very handy. One issue I have found with most hitting tees is there tendency to flip over forward when the ball isn't hit cleanly. Constantly repositioning the tee was a never ending nuisance. I often used plastic or metal tent stakes to anchor the front and back; they worked pretty well, but could still only take so much pounding. I did notice that SKLZ has added a heavy-gauge wire frame to the front of one of their other batting tees to prevent it from tipping over.This batting tee is a good training device. SKLZ also has a couple of dozen excellent baseball training videos on their website. Overall, I am satisfied with their new, version 2 SKLZ 5-Position Traditional Batting Tee. Though the stability of this new model is better, it still needs improvement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y2IFX7T0GUWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI2CNIY#wasThisHelpful","R2Y2IFX7T0GUWO","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a couple of small shop vacuums through the years; one was just a vacuum and the other was both a wet and dry vacuum. Neither was very impressive and the wet vacuum died shortly into a crisis situation when our basement flooded. I don't have an actual shop, per se, so I just wanted a wet/dry vacuum mostly for cleaning our cars, the garage and disposing of liquid spills. Though our basement is now watertight our washer and dryer are downstairs so even with a nearby floor drain there is always the possibility of a significant spill or water backing up into the basement; I live only a stones-throw away from Lake Michigan. Thus, I had a genuine need for a good wet/dry vacuum.The Workshop Wet/Dry Vac (WS0500WM) seemed to have the potential to fit my basic need, and maybe more. It came with a nice complement of accessories and also included a couple of surprises; I'll mention those later. This vacuum comes with a huge owner's manual (54 pages). Anyway that's what I thought until I skimmed through it an found out it was divided into three different languages (English/Spanish/French). The smaller, 18-page manual still covers everything a user needs to know.This 5-HP, 5-gallon (medium-sized) shop vacuum doesn't come fully assembled; yes, some assembly is required but by following the owner's manual assembly is quite easy. This is a portable vacuum (no wheels) that is reasonably lightweight and easy to carry. It can also be mounted on a wall for storage only (one of the surprises!) or it can be used in a stationary mode (like the vacs at a gas station or self-help car wash). The owner's manual dedicates several pages on how the 2-piece hanging rack should be properly mounted; I liked that since I do plan on mounting the vacuum in my garage. The unit comes with two vacuum hoses (one 2-foot hose that expands to 7 feet; another 14-foot hose that expands to 21 feet) that snap easily into the front of the vacuum and can be used separately or connected together for a whopping 28 feet of hose! There are a variety of cleaning attachments for vacuuming carpets, sucking up water from hard floors and getting into those narrow, hard to reach spaces around the house and garage. Two hard plastic extension wands are also included for vacuuming floors and reaching into overhead spaces. The attachments can be stored in a handy removable storage bin that snaps on securely to the side of the vacuum, keeping al of the accessories together in one place.When my daughter came home from college recently she wanted to be the first one to use the Workshop Wet/Dry Vacuum to clean the inside of her car and the trunk. Once we had the shop vacuum assembled and transported to the garage it was time to plug it in flip the switch. This vacuum isn't any louder than a household vacuum and really packs a lot of suction power; definitely more than our Kirby. I would guess that my daughter had her entire interior and trunk vacuumed in about 15-20 minutes; and that included the removable floor mats. She used the extended 7-foot hose and a couple of the attachments to do the job. She said the vacuum was easy to move around (in and out of the car) and the hose was very flexible and easy to use. The detachable exhaust diffuser also does a good job of reducing the intensity of the exhaust stream, dispensing it over a larger area. (NOTE: The diffuser only has a thin sponge-like filter so it may not be ideal for indoor use). I did a simple test of the wet vacuum feature by spilling some water on the cement floor in the basement utility area. The suction was great and the large integrated filter worked very well.Here is the second of the two surprises: Earlier I mentioned that this unit had an exhaust port with a detachable deffuser. I was initially curious why does this vacuum have such a powerful stream of exhaust that it would require a diffuser? Well, I discovered why. This vacuum is also a blower that can be used for yard work and patio or garage cleanup! Just remove the diffuser, snap in the locking end of either hose (or connected hoses), add an extension wand (optional) and turn on the blower. Workshop recommends safety eye wear be worn while using the blower feature. I have a blower, too! What a nice surprise this was. I blew some leaves out of our flowerbeds as a test and the blower worked just as advertised. Of course, the blower power from the individual shorter hoses was greater than the 21-foot hose, but hat was to be expected.I was intrigued with the clever design of this compact vacuum/blower. With the exception of the 21-foot hose, all of the attachments, the shorter hose, two extension wands and the power cord can be stored on this self-contained unit at the same time. Even with all of this the vacuum/blower is still what I would consider a lightweight, easy to carry mobile product. The fastener clips that secure the top half of the vacuum/blower to the lower half are not easy to unfasten. I don't consider this a negative feature. In fact I would expect it to be snapped securely together considering this unit can carry gallons of liquid. I wouldn't want it any other way.The owner's manual begins with two pages of safety instructions; there are also numerous Warnings throughout the manual. This is no toy and failure to use this vacuum/blower in a safe manner may result in injury; possibly serious injury.This Workshop Wet/Dry Vac is definitely a keeper and is built to last a long time.Postscript (15 Jan 2014): Our 80-gallon water heater died this morning and spilled its contents on the cement basement floor. It took a minute or two to get the Workshop vacuum in place, snap the hose and plastic wand together and hooked to the machine. When I clicked the power on the vacuum sucked up the dirty water like a champ! After the job was done I emptied the last vacuum bucket load of water and washed out the bucket, removed the filter and rinsed it clean as instructed in the owner's manual and left them both to dry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAJKWLIY5UN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX389KC#wasThisHelpful","R3BAJKWLIY5UN7","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SKLS is not the only company to develop a basketball dribble stick. But after using the SKLZ version with my son, their Dribble Stick is definitely an effective basketball training device. It was difficult to understand just how the trainer worked by just looking at a few photos, so off I went to Google to see if there were any videos available on a dribble stick. In fact there are quite a number of introductory and training drills available. Some dribbling and conditioning drills are included in the three-page instructions that come with the SKLZ Dribble Stick. The written and photo drills are okay but the videos do a knockout job of showcasing just how useful this relatively simple device really is.It probably comes as no surprise that the Dribble Stick does not come fully assembled; yes, there is some assembly required. However their is no reason to worry about that as the instructions provided are definitely sufficient to complete assembly. And there are actually a minimal number of parts to put together anyway. Assembly is pretty easy and takes only about ten minutes once the parts are removed from the box and spread out for inventory. The SKLZ Dribble Stick comes with some practical warnings that should be followed; SKLZ also recommends this product be use only by those over seven years of age, and only with adult supervision for those under 18 years of age.According to their website, the stated purpose for this training device is as follows:""Improve hand positioning, stance, and speed with the ball using the Dribble Stick. Get immediate feedback on movements and mimic on-court dynamics against defenders. Easily adjustable arms enable a wide variety of drills for plyometrics, ball control, speed and agility.""This was just what my son and I needed. He wanted to improve his overall basketball skills as well as augment his weekly exercise regime. For me, I just wanted to keep up with the other over-the-hill basketball guys at the ""Y"" and keep in shape at the same time. By the way, a health-issue warning from SKLZ comes with this product for guys my age since if used as intended the Dribble Stick can develop into a serious aerobics regime.The SKLZ Dribble Stick comes with a heavy base (12"" x 12"" and almost 5 lbs.) to anchor the device to the floor and an aluminum slotted center post (2 ¼"" x 2 ¼"" x 35""). Four 24"" dribble arms (2 black & 2 gray) fit easily in the center post slots and can be moved independently up and down the post in a large variety of configurations. A large circular cap fastens onto the top of the center post and also acts as a storage location for the dribble arms and a basketball when the Dribble Stick is not in use. SKLZ: ""To maximize the life span of the product, avoid leaving the Dribble Stick out in the sun or cold weather for long periods of time.""The dribble arms are not flexible and are actually very stiff. They appear to be made out of fiberglass or some composite plastic. My son and I have hit them with the basketball quite a few times, but so far we haven't experienced what seems to be the most common complaint about this product from the other reviewers: broken dribble arms. I also see by the comments made to previous reviews that SKLZ has taken an active interest in this flaw and are or have already begun to include a better, more damage-resistant dribble arm with later Dribble Sticks. According to comments made by customer service reps, SKLZ will replace the older version arms if they break during proper usage. Contact information is included in the Dribble Stick Guide.SKLZ recommends storing the Dribble Stick when not in use to prevent unintended accidents and damage. Storing is a snap; just remove the four dribble arms from the center post and slide each down through one of the holes in the center cap and put the Dribble Stick aside or store it away. That's it.I usually include music during my ball handling and conditioning drills; I'm older and my attention span isn't what it used to be. The music helps me maintain my rapidly depleting sense of rhythm; I often work out to Sweet Georgia Brown! (If you don't get the humor in that you are just way too young {wink}). Having used it now for about five weeks, I am impressed with this training device and have benefited in the ball handling area the most; I definitely break a sweat and have lost a few pounds, too; that makes my wife happy and helps her put up with all of the dribbling that goes on down stairs. Overall, I can recommend this product. Two things still need to be done, though: (1) Get better quality dribble arms; (2) Put the instructional and drill videos on SKLZ.com that the Drills Guide says are already there, but aren't. In the meantime, ""Just GOOGLE It!"" to find the other on-line training videos I mentioned earlier. You will be glad you did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B3EDE37M25IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB6OGN6#wasThisHelpful","R2B3EDE37M25IC","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new McAfee LiveSafe software may be new on the market but the software is essentially a standard internet security anti-virus program. However, according to the advertisement on the slipcase and their website McAfee gives the impression it is more than that. Here is the statement I am referring to:""McAfee security software brings you the deepest protection available by taking advantage of technology in the very latest Intel processor.""Sounds like McAfee (an Intel company) is implying this new LiveSafe software utilizes the Intel ""DeepSafe"" technology... but it doesn't. What is actually new with the LiveSafe software is a bundle of additional services. Please don't misunderstand what I'm saying. This basic internet security anti-virus program from McAfee does block malware, phishing and the latest virus attacks.I have had a particular internet security anti-virus program on my PC for quite some time now and a couple of years ago I was offered a free download of the McAfee basic software. I was concerned that the two programs would conflict with one another but they didn't. I mention this because instead of uninstalling the free McAfee security software I have on my PC and them install this new software I decided to install this one on my daughter's laptop instead. The LiveSafe software install and setup was pretty easy, with onscreen, step-by-step instructions. One thing I need to note is this software does not come on a CD. Actually very few software programs do these days. The slipcase included a card with a product code that allows the purchaser to download the software from the McAfee website. We now have McAfee protection for our laptops, my adult children's smartphones and my wife's tablet; all from one software setup.One of the first things I noticed about this new software is McAfee included is a new slogan (or tagline): ""You live your digital life. We keep it secure."" The second new thing is, in my opinion, the feature that will draw consumers to this product. The McAfee LiveSafe offers an unlimited device license for all of your PC, Mac, smartphones and tablets in your households. There are system requirements and a specific list of operating systems on the back of the slipcover which, of course, should be consulted prior to purchase.A third new thing is McAfee's offer to secure your identity and personal data. We are already using other systems for that so I didn't set that part up. According to McAfee, you can manage all of your on-line passwords from any of your devices and track and lock your PCs, tablets, and smartphones if they are lost or stolen. You can also store sensitive personal data in a secure on-line vault--accessed only with your face and voice. I seriously thought about setting this up just to see how it worked, but didn't.My product came with a McAfee LiveSafe 1-year free subscription. This was nice since McAfee subscription rates aren't cheap. I called McAfee's customer support to determine when the 1-year subscription began--at the time of purchase or upon activation? This seemed to me like a very basic question and should have been made clear on the packaging. Surprisingly, I was put on hold for some time while the customer rep consulted his superiors for an answer. The answer I received was ""upon activation.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28AV52HPQQ7Z3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3CKE2Q#wasThisHelpful","R28AV52HPQQ7Z3","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With the emergence of the soundbar speaker system as less complicated solution for today's poor flat-panel television sound has introduced flat-panel enthusiasts to a giant leap forward in improved sound and performance. This summer Audio Products International (API), owned by The Klipsch Group, has released the next advancement in the evolution of the soundbar. API calls it the ""Energy Power Base"" (EPB). The ""Energy"" brand has been around for some time and has consistently been at the forefront of providing interesting and popular options that have improved the sound quality for movies, TV shows and especially gaming.API describes its new Energy Power Base as ""...a compact, high-performance, pedestal-style 2.1 system that provides a new alternative for placement and aesthetics."" The EPB weighs in at almost 18 pounds with dimensions of 4 in. H x 25 in. W x 14.1 in. D. When compared to the average soundbar this unit is overall larger and certainly much heavier, too. But once you find out what this speaker power station was designed to do, its size and weight could very well not matter at all.The Energy Power Base system consists of one cabinet (Satin Black/Matte Black), is just 4 inches high and most flat-panel TVs with a stand can be set directly on top of the unit. Try doing that with your typical soundbar and DVD/Blu-Ray players. There is of course a limit to the size flat-panel TV this system can tolerate. The maximum size TV would be 80 pounds with a base no larger than 23 in. W x 12 in. D. When I first read that in the specs I had to wait for a few minutes and let it sink in...an 80 pound TV! This is what API means by a pedestal-style system; one designed to sit under the TV.The single digital optical cable (included) connects from the back of the EPB to the TV, eliminating the tangle of cables and power cords behind my TV. This system's built-in Dolby Digital decoder provides for a simpler no-hassle setup whether your TV outputs PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation ~ I had to look this one up) or Dolby Digital sound.Now let's get to the really good stuff. A soundbar should not be just louder than the TV. What it should do is provide a balanced, full-range sound so that the program dialogue and subtle details are not overpowered by a distorted or overblown bass. This EPB utilizes two separate .78-inch tweeters with aluminum dome drivers and two 3-inch mid-range IMG drivers for each channel enhanced by dual 3 x 5-inch subwoofers in a front firing composite cone/ported enclosure encased in a bass-reflex single-cabinet design. I suppose it is this new console form that sets the EPB apart from most soundbars and provides more cabinet volume and the potential for a high quality sound. The speakers peak at 160 watts. Even though the EPB is only a 2.1 system the switchable 3D surround sound feature simulates a 5.1 multiple speaker system pretty well. According to API this unit will provide ""A well-balanced, detailed, full-range sound no matter where the EPB is placed."" I can't disagree with that, though I can distinguish some differences between my old 5.1 home entertainment system and this Energy Power Base 2.1 system.As I implied earlier, you don't have to put the EPB under the flat-panel TV if you don't want to. If you have a TV cabinet or stand large enough to accommodate the EPB you can put it there if you like. I tried doing that and ended up leaving it inside the cabinet. If you do this remember to pull the EPB forward as far as is practical. This will ensure maximum benefit from the EPB sound system. Also, like any other piece of electronic equipment make sure to allow for maximum ventilation.The EPB is equipped with Bluetooth wireless technology so it can also be used for playback of your digitally stored music. Just turn on the Bluetooth wireless technology feature on your smartphone, tablet or other device, connect it to the EPB and sit back and enjoy your favorite music wirelessly streamed through the Energy Power Base. My tech savvy son even got Spotify and Pandora to play through the EPB! After disconnecting our 5.1 home entertainment system, with its multiple speakers and stands, speaker wiring, receiver and multiple cords I was able to install the Energy Power Base in about 15 to 20 minutes: Attached one cable from the unit to my flat-panel TV (one cable!), plugged in the power cord, completed a basic sound test and made a few adjustments; that was it! Since hooking the EPB up we have discovered a few additional things we can use the EPB with by reading through the excellent instructions that came in the box. I also noticed that after the EPB was installed it automatically muted the speakers in my flat-panel TV; this prevented the two sound systems from competing with each other. If your speakers don't turn off you can manually mute them through your flat-panel's Settings menu. As far as my family is concerned...this speaker power station rocks!Now what would a system like this be without . . . a remote? There are instructions included (and also a video on the Energy Power Base website) so you can program the EPB's volume up and down and mute functions into your own TV remote for easy operation. You also have the option of controlling the same functions with the remote control included with the EPB. I love options. I do need to address one point about the remote. The remote that comes with the unit about as basic as you can get, so it has to be pointed directly at the Energy Power Base front sensor for it to work. This was the weakest link in this system. Energy pours its Research & Development into the system, and then goes cheap on such an essential part . . . the remote. In my opinion, this needs to be corrected.What review would be complete without the mention of the accessories? I've already mentioned a couple of them, but they are worth repeating. The Energy Power Base comes with one 4.9-foot (1.5m)digital optical cable and one 4.9-foot (1.5m) 3.5mm to dual RCA cable. And as previously mentioned there is also one VERY BASIC, unsophisticated remote control included. Speaking of controls, if you are not into using a remote control most of the system controls for the EPB are conveniently located for manual use on one vertical bar locate right in the middle of the front face of the EPB (see photo). I left the bottom line until the end of this review. The Energy Power Base TV Sound System with Bluetooth Wireless Technology retails new at the time of this review for $399.99.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M11UL3UJU65Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW0N46C#wasThisHelpful","R2M11UL3UJU65Y","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have quite a few mature trees in our yard which provide an ideal place for bird feeders. Anyway that's what I thought when we moved here. I hung several of the birdhouse style feeders and in no time the squirrels and chipmunks figured out how to scare the birds away and skillfully scatter their meal on the ground. I watched some even work in tandem to steal the bird food.Perky-Pet® has recently released their latest in a line of anti-squirrel bird feeders. They call this one the Perky-Pet® Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler (Model 397). If you have ever observed a rodent at work, they are clever and persistent in their desire to secure food and housing for themselves. As you can probable see by the photo this bird feeder has a long clear plastic seed tube that makes up the body of the feeder and providing a visible place to store the bird seed. The bird feeder dimensions are 25 in. H x 11.7 in. W x 11.7 in. D; the seed tube is about 4 inches in diameter and will hold a substantial amount of seed, up to 3 pounds! Here is a promotional blurb I found on this product from Perky-Pet®:""Best Used For: Attracting and feeding birds without allowing squirrels to get the seed. This unique squirrel-proof feeder will increase your bird traffic while minimizing seed lost to squirrels.""This feeder has an attractive shiny metal saucer-shaped lid (or as Perky-Pet® calls it ""a dome"") that connects to the top of the plastic seed tube. There is a hole at the center of the saucer to connect the two parts and at the same time provides a place for a ring to be fastened on the top of the dome for hanging. The dome is part of this new squirrel-baffling bird feeder, along with a very cleverly designed metal base that comes already attached to the bottom of the seed tube. There are four holes (or ports) about the size of dime around the metal base right through the seed tube. These holes are the feeding ports. Small perches are also attached to the base in front of each feeding port and are made out of metal just like the base for durability. Considering the dimensions of the perches and the feeding ports this bird feeder is obviously made for small lightweight birds; No crows or pigeons allowed!Now let's get to the patented weight-activated base and other features of this squirrel-baffling bird feeder. The smooth metal dome is not secured tightly to the top of the seed tube which allows it to wobble around when any weight is applied from above or below; like from a squirrel or large bird. According to Perky-Pet®: ""The dome tilts and wobbles as well to throw squirrels off balance who try and land on the feeder."" This also applies to those pesky crows that dominate our backyard in the mornings, scaring away the smaller birds we are trying to feed. Likewise, if weight is applied to the base, such as by a leaping squirrel, chipmunk or a large bird, the base swivels like a bucket under their weight, automatically closing off access to the feeder ports and preventing the loss of seed.There is very little assembly required. Perky-Pet® has included an excellent sheet of instructions that are easy to follow and is written in English only. In fact, there are only two steps to complete assembly. All assembly applies to attaching the dome to the seed tube; everything else comes already assembled. During assembly one thing concerned me. The seed tube is plastic and there are two small holes on opposite sides to attach the dome to the seed tube by poking the ends of a metal bracket through the holes. This feeder is not light and once 3 pounds of birdseed is added it is quite heavy. In my opinion, this is the weakest link of the Perky-Pet® bird feeder. In order to prevent a future disaster I decided to drill-out the small holes so I could insert a 2-piece hard rubber grommet into each new hole. This allowed me to still insert the metal bracket as designed while also providing reinforcement for the plastic seed tube. Only time will tell whether my modification will prolong the life of the feeder, or not.Perky-Pet® has three short and informative videos on their website explaining (1) How the Squirrel-Be-Gone Baffler works, (2) Where to place your bird feeder and (3) Instructions for cleaning the feeder. You can Google the website by typing the following in your browser window: perky-pet squirrel-be-gone baffler model 397.I had originally intended to hang the bird feeder on one of my wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles but decided not to when I realized the bottom of this 25-inch bird feeder would only be hanging about 3½ feet off the ground; much too low and inviting for the numerous non-flying animals that roam around my backyard. After I watched the videos mentioned above I decided to relocate my bird feeder to a higher point and nearer to our birdbath; I also added a hook to the end of the metal strap I am now using to hang the feeder from a protruding galvanized metal pole mounted horizontally on the bottom roof line of a large shed in the backyard. I have to use a stepladder to hang and remove the bird feeder, but that is no problem. This product was built in the USA with both U.S. and Chinese parts. The label information on the front of the box is written in English, French and Spanish.Overall I am pleased with this new bird feeder. The squirrels and crows have tried to access the feeder without success so far; the wobble and tilt action has definitely kept them off guard. However, they are crafty and persistent animals and since there has been a minor amount of seed loss, mostly during the recent wind storm, the seed that did fall to the ground has kept them motivated to devise new ways to thwart the security measures built into this new Perky-Pet® bird feeder.On the front of the box Perky-Pet® added the following statement:""Feeder base and dome tilt to baffle the squirrels and protect your bird seed! Birds feed undisturbed from 4 feeding ports.""I think Perky-Pet® is overreaching reasonable expectations for this product by expecting small birds to feed undisturbed. There is always some animal around my neighborhood looking for a free meal; either in the form of birdseed or in the shape of a bird. Though it would be nice, so far undisturbed feeding is not the norm around here.Otherwise, The Baffler has worked as promised. Since there are moving parts it stands to reason that some attention will be necessary in the future to ensure the mechanisms continue to wiggle, tilt and wobble. There is no mention about maintenance on the Perky-Pet® website that I could find. Only time will tell how well this new feeder will work over the long haul. Since much of the Perky-Pet® Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler is manufactured with metal parts I expect my Perky-Pet® bird feeder will outlast most if not all of the plastic and wooden bird feeders on the market. This bird feeder retails new for $73.99, which is a hefty price for what you are purchasing. I know you can shop around and buy this bird feeder for much less than that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DUIO0O4DXOSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004ZAVI#wasThisHelpful","R3DUIO0O4DXOSD","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never purchased flowers on-line before. But after being inundated a couple of weeks before Mother's Day with marketing mailers, e-mails and on-line promotional deals from ProFlowers I figured, ""Why not? The flowers in the photos look great and with an advertised Mother's Day special price of $19.99 (which includes a FREE glass vase) it seems like a great deal."" I eventually found out this is not a special price after all...it's actually the ProFlowers everyday price. Regardless, I made a suggestion to my children that we buy their favorite selection from the bouquet specials. They chose the bright and beautiful One Dozen Rainbow Roses.So I went to the ProFlowers website and began the ordering process. The process isn't difficult, but with what seemed like an endless series of decisions, it wasn't a snap either. All the way through the ordering process I had flowers for $19.99 on my mind. Once I reached the final website page I discovered that with all the service fees, postage, extra fees and postage for the FREE glass vase the cost had reached an unexpected $38.00; for my children's sake I removed the vase from the order. We have plenty of those at home.Everyone knows Mother's Day is on Sunday; no surprises there. In order to have these flowers delivered on any Friday, Saturday or Sunday there are even more fees added, bringing the final price to around $45.00; and that's without the vase. Frankly, in my opinion the flower business should be like a grocery store; a 7-day-a-week industry. I'm sorry but it shouldn't cost the consumer more for for the same flowers and service just because of the day of the week. To keep the cost down I had to have the flowers delivered on the Thursday before Mother's Day. My wife is very understanding and appreciated the children's involvement.The flowers were delivered in a large decorated box sometime on Thursday before my wife came home. I have no idea who delivered them (the label didn't indicate) and the box was just left on the front porch, even though I was home; no doorbell ring or knock on the door. I moved the  boxed flowers downstairs and kept them in a cool spot eagerly awaiting my wife's arrival. When she opened the box it was very clear that a lot of thought and effort had been invested in designing a package suitable for shipping flowers. Even the card with our personal Mother's Day message was beautifully done.The flowers had a water tube attached, but it was immediately clear something was wrong. First, the flower selection was nothing like the photo. The bright-colored bouquet of small roses in the photo wasn't what was in the box. They were small roses alright, but there was a single dark red rose and the rest were white, lavender and pink; nothing bright (see the photo). And the flowers were obviously in distress; some, including the leaves and fern-like branches, were even beginning to curl.We live in Southeast Wisconsin, so I looked to see where the flowers came from expecting to find a local vendor, or at least a vendor in Wisconsin. To my surprise I discovered the flowers had been processed and shipped to us from a vendor in...San Diego, California! That's over 2,100 miles from here; no wonder they were in such distress. It will probably come as no surprise that the flowers lasted less than a week. It should also come as no surprise that I won't be purchasing flowers through ProFlowers again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8GVFXBXICX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FJNZMM#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8GVFXBXICX0","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sony has joined several other companies that have recently released their version of a portable wireless storage device, using WiFi to transfer and stream data. They recently released the Sony Portable Wireless Server which Sony claims is ""your mobile storage solution."" Considering quite a few companies are ready to or have already released their version of a wireless media storage device Sony may have more competition for this market than they realize.Sony's Portable Wireless Server (PWS) is a little larger than an iPod (approximately 4¼"" x 2"" x ¾"") and is loaded with a number of features. Like most of the other similar devices this PWS uses a WiFi network to wirelessly transfer and stream data. This PWS does not have any embedded (internal) memory. Sony makes this clear right on the front of the box. In order to store and stream data a memory card or flash drive (or similar USB device) is necessary and is not typically included.The Sony PWS is compatible with both Android and iOS®-based smartphones and tablets and can view and transfer content wirelessly, though I has some difficulty sending data to my PC. Sony does include a USB cable that has a very cleverly designed cable holder which eliminates a dangling cable (you will have to see it yourself to understand that). Thus, as far as a PC is concerned it is little more than a card reader. Like most of the other devices, this PWS relies on an Android or iOS®-based App to configure and remotely manage the functions on the Sony PWS. The Sony App is available FREE from the usual sources for downloading to your mobile device(s) (Sony website, Apple App Store, Google Play Store). You can also password the system for security through the App during configuration.Because I'm not the most tech-savvy guy around I often either rely on my family or I most often check out the companies on-line tutorials to acquaint myself with what features a product has and how to best use them. Sony does have quite a number of these available on YouTube, anyway that's what they are supposed to be. What I actually found were high-tech, big production videos that focused more on visual effects, sensation-stirring, high-decibel, rhythmic music, and fancy graphics than it did as a useful tutorial. In short, they were sadly a waste of time. So having pulled an App and configured the manager at least once before, I gave it a try; it was pretty easy to do.The Sony PWS is capable of streaming content to up to 8 users at one time. It can stream, store and transfer photos, videos, music and data files. Another feature my wife really enjoyed was the ability to wirelessly back up digital photos from the memory card in her digital camera to free up space, even while she is on the go! Another plus is this PWS can be used as a battery backup to recharge portable devices like a smartphone. Now you're talking! The Sony PWS has a USB 2.0 high-speed port, a USB 2.0 micro high-speed port, a memory card slot. A USB memory stick and a memory card can be inserted into the Sony PWS and used at the same time.According to Sony the usage time on this PWS is approximately 10 hours before it needs recharging. It also comes with a 1-year limited warranty. As I mentioned earlier this PWS does not typically come with a memory card so that must be purchased separately. However, I did notice that Sony is currently offering a bundle deal on their website where they offer a 16GB memory card with the PWS (WG-C10/NWC1) for an extra $10. Right now this Sony Portable Wireless Server retails for $89.99 ($99.99 with the memory card). With a larger memory card like a 32GB or a 64GB card this PWS would provide plenty of storage space to backup your mobile devices.Side Note: I don't usually pay much attention to product jungles or slogans, but the slogan printed on the front of the box for this Sony PWS really caught my attention. After staring at is for awhile I'm still not not exactly sure what they meant to communicate, though I have a couple of possibilities in mind; must be the generation gap. Here it is: ""SONY® make.believe.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG2IQIQYTQRTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZ7510K#wasThisHelpful","RG2IQIQYTQRTX","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I think of external computer storage devices I always include SanDisk® on the list. Earlier this month SanDisk® introduced the next step in flash drives; their new ""SanDisk® Connect Wireless Flash Drive."" According to their promotional blurbs, this wireless flash drive can store, share and stream your digital files across tablets, smartphones and computers. And the real kicker is it ""works anywhere, no internet required."" Now I'm certainly no digital device ""techie"" but even I was interested in knowing more. According to SanDisk, this ""Wireless Flash Drive is the next-generation of wireless storage technology.""My family has a PC, a couple of Mac laptops and an iMac, as well as a couple of mobile devices. It would seem we are probably the target audience for this new flash drive. My spouse and I both have external storage devices hooked up to our computers and share data back and forth by way of the internet, standard flash drives and memory cards so I hadn't considered upgrading to something else. The device itself isn't much larger than one of the older SanDisk® flash drives from a decade ago and comes in 16GB and 32GB models. The one I am reviewing is the 32GB flash drive. It works just like a regular flash drive but has the added convenience of wireless mobile access to your movies, photos, music, and documents from anywhere in the house or while you are on-the-go, and all without the internet! According to SanDisk® it works with iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Kindle Fire and Android devices, as well as a PC (Windows 8, 7, Vista, XP) and Mac (OS 10.6 or higher) computer. I've already heard that PC/Mac users are not very satisfied with this device.This device works wirelessly using Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n); no internet or router required. It can connect up to eight devices at the same time and stream video to as many as three devices, with accessibility up to 150 feet from the ""SanDisk® Connect Wireless Flash Drive."" Unlike a standard flash drive, this device must be charged up first and can then be used for up to four hours of continuous streaming on a single charge.  Charging is easy and can be done by either plugging the device directly into a USB port on a computer or by using a USB AC adapter. I plugged it into my PC to charge it up. There is a small light on the flash drive to let guys like me know when it is fully charged. This is the kind of detail I really like because, as I noted earlier, I can be technically challenged at times, especially with new innovations like this one. An additional feature my wife discovered is the 32GB memory card is removable which means once it is full either move some or all of the data to another location or just slip in another card and you're ready to go.After charging the unit you then need to download an App so you can control your ""SanDisk® Connect Wireless Flash Drive."" I found several places the App was available for download (Amazon, Google and the Apple App Store), but I decided to download it to my wife's iPad from the SanDisk® website; it's FREE! After that is done just press the on/off button on the ""SanDisk® Connect Wireless Flash Drive"" and it creates its own WiFi network. By the way, all of the information you need to get started and use this device is available in written and video format on the SanDisk® website. Based on what I've already written, I doubt you thought I was technically adept enough to set this up and use it without professional help. You were right. The videos on the SanDisk website are especially helpful. Kudos to SanDisk.I wasn't interested in using this device to transfer data between our home computers, we have other ways for doing that (like Drop Box), but my adult children did find sharing and streaming digital files to and from their laptops ""really cool"" and my wife really enjoyed wirelessly moving files back and forth between this wireless flash drive and her iPad. More importantly, for my children to have a device to stream movies and such between their smartphones was even ""more cool."" Watching my family enjoy this SanDisk® product may change my mind about joining them. As with most new devices there is always a learning curve to master before becoming proficient at using a new device. The ""SanDisk® Connect Wireless Flash Drive"" is no exception. The device comes with Quick Start instructions in the box and as I mentioned previously the website videos are excellent and easy to understand; a toll-free phone number is available for technical support on the SanDisk® website.This product is brand new on the market and frankly not that easy to find yet; it's not even available on Amazon.com at this point. Like any new product it's not inexpensive right now. I'm sure this comes as no surprise since it is the ""next new thing."" It retails for under $60. Oh, I almost forgot, the WiFi network on this device can be password protected for security. It also comes with a one-year limited warranty.It will probably take some time before I put this device into general use, using all the capabilities it has to offer. I stream movies through other devices hooked up to my TV and I don't own a tablet or smartphone. However, I am sure that my children will give it a full workout each time they come to visit; which is often. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease by which we were able to set up and use this relatively small device.

"I've used Chap Stick® lip care since it was reintroduced in 1963; especially since I moved to the Midwest (winters here can be brutal on exposed skin). On occasions I've experimented with the latest lip product on the market, like Blistex, Nivea and Carmex, but I always came back to Chap Stick®.Recently I tried one of the grooming products for men from Baxter of California, a lip balm called ""HYDRO SALVE (Natural Lip Balm)."" Baxter of California produces an entire line of men's grooming, skin care and shaving products advertised under the snappy little tagline ""The evolution of men's grooming."" A half fluid ounce tube of ""HYDRO SALVE"" comes packaged in a slender and rather dull in appearance 4"" x 1"" x 3/4"" box. Considering this is a California company, I was surprised they would package one of their products in such an unappealing container. Doing so certainly wasn't what inspired the company's ""evolution of men's grooming.""Almost everything on the box and the tube is written in five different languages (English, French, German, Italian and Filipino). The decision to do that is probably the most California-like of anything about this product. The following brief instructions are printed on the back of the box and also on the tube:""USAGE: Apply to lips, as needed""""WHAT IT DOES: Natural moisturizers and vitamins soothe dry skin and keep lips soft and hydrated""Besides a couple of cautionary statements (for external use only and don't stick it in your eyes--I paraphrased that second part) the rest of the information on the containers is an extensive list of ingredients (all in multiple languages). It wasn't until a few days after I received ""HYDRO SALVE"" that I discovered what I thought was simple silver graphic design work on the side of the cardboard container was actually the most interesting and informative characteristic of this product: A brief biography and purpose statement of the Baxter of California company! Except for the product name, which is printed in reasonably readable lettering, the rest of the printing on the box and the tube is so small I had to borrow my wife's large loupe (a magnifying cup used by jewelers, watchmakers, photographers and graphic designers) to read what was printed. Then throw in what looked like silver bands and white lettering printed on a cream-colored box, this could be considered a graphic design and promotional disaster.The applicator on the top of the tube is cut at a 45º angle for easy application. Underneath the product name on the box describes the balm as a ""Mojito flavor/vitamin enriched formula."" Just to show how out of touch I am, I had no idea what a Mojito flavor was. So what do you do then? Google it! I discovered the word Mojito traditionally refers to a citrus fruit-flavored cocktail or a Cuban highball. This product was getting more California-like by the minute.Equipped with the information in the paragraph above, it was time to apply HYDRO SALVE externally on my lips and not in my eyes. I quickly discovered that though the applicator was well designed it was still easier (and more frugal, considering there is only a half ounce of liquid in the tube) to apply a small amount of the gold-colored salve to my index finger and spread it over my lips. The citrus Mojito smell is very pleasant and the taste is just as enjoyable (and non-intoxicating, too). The salve went on very smoothly and I was able to cover my lips with a very small amount with ease.Some of the reviews I read indicated this balm didn't last very long on their lips. I found it was just the opposite. It went on easily and stayed on for quite some time. I even noticed that when I woke up this morning I could still feel and taste the HYDRO SALVE on my lips, thought not as much as the evening before. I was impressed with that. I'm not sure I can be that complementary about my old standard, Chap Stick®. A half fluid ounce of HYDRO SALVE sells for around $8. Doing the math, that's $16 an ounce for lip balm! Though I liked the product more than I thought I would, it's just too expensive when compared to what other lip balm products can do at a much more reasonable price. If you are planning a trip to California anytime soon, take along some HYDRO SALVE with you. When in California, do as the Californians do!Post Script: Please relax. Before anyone gets too heated up over my subtle, tongue-in-cheek treatment of California and its residence, I must let you know I was born in California and lived there for almost 45 years before moving to the Midwest. Any perceived barbs or jabs were all intended in the good spirit of literary humor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZG4OIXJ1Y23T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UEROLE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZG4OIXJ1Y23T","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used Fabreze products for years as an air refreshener so when I saw this Bissell ""Pet Odor Eliminator"" with an added ingredient from Fabreze I wanted to give it a try. We occasionally kitty-sit my son's cat when he is out of town. Having an extra strength pet odor eliminator on hand seemed like the sensible thing to do.The Bissell extra strength ""Pet Odor Eliminator"" comes in a generous 32 oz container and is primarily designed for carpets and rugs, though there are other uses Bissell endorses which I will mention later. In fact I not only used this product on our carpet throughout our home, I also used it on my daughter's removable rugs in her car. Care and common sense should be taken to remove and clean the car rugs first and then use this product as instructed on the container while the rugs are outside the car. This may come in conflict with what Bissell recommends, but I do not recommend this product be used for the carpet in a car, only the removable rugs; and then only when the rugs are kept outside for a period of time after application and vacuuming.This white deodorizing powder has a very STRONG scent! I can't say that firmly enough. This is why I don't recommend its use inside the small enclosed passenger compartment of a car. Once I got the container open (I'll comment on that later) the smell of the powder immediately made my eyes water. Though the scent is nowhere as pleasant as the Febreze air refresher products I have used over the years, it does have a fresh, clean scent. If you are looking for a perfumery scent, this may not be what you are looking for. This product is specifically a pet odor eliminator, and an extra strength one at that; it is not an air freshener.Bissell also recommends this product for use on ""upholstery, automobile interiors, and drapes."" Surprisingly, they provide no cautionary when using this product for these areas. Bissell put on the label exactly what this product should be expected to do:~ Eliminates tough pet odors~ Refreshes your home with a fresh, long lasting fragrance~ Releases pet hair & dirt~ Leaves behind softer, fresher carpetsBissell also included a list of things this product should NOT be used for, as well as a safety cautionary:~ Not intended for use on velvet, silk, vinyl or leather fabrics~ Keep out of the reach of Children and Pets.~ Avoid contact with eyes. In case of eye contact, flush thoroughly with water for 15 minutes. If irritation persists, seek medical attention.There are simple instructions provided on the container (English & Spanish) in written and pictorial mode. STEP 1: ""Sprinkle evenly over area to be treated."" (There is no indication as to how dense the coverage should be; evidently it can be according to personal preference). STEP 2: ""Wait a few minutes and vacuum thoroughly."" (The drawing provided indicates the ""few minutes"" is actually 20 minutes).Most products have a couple of noteworthy things that should be mentioned in a product review. This one is no exception. Though the Febreze trademark icon is the most prominent one on the container, the reader should be aware that this product is not manufactured by Febreze (Procter & Gamble makes Febreze); it's manufactured and distributed by Bissell Homecare Inc. However, the product is marketed (even by Amazon) under the following label: ""Febreze Extra Strength Pet Odor Eliminator Deodorizing Powder."" With that being said, the large endorsement on the front of the container seems rather misleading as well as in this case very self serving: ""ENDORSED BY BISSELL.""This point may seem a little silly to some readers. As I noted earlier opening the container is an important part of using this product. That shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone at this point. However, just how to safely open the container was not, for me anyway, apparent at first. Thus, it would seem reasonable to expect Bissell to provide some help in this regard. Not a single word of instruction!A secured plastic cap covers the entire top end of the cylindrical container. There is a circular insert in the cap that obviously is designed to turn freely around 360º. So far, so good. (I can hear the laughter starting already). There are two ways of dispensing the white powder: (1) two rows of holes for gently shaking the contents out and (2) a large smile-shaped opening for a more generous pouring application. In my mind anyway, there was no obvious way of opening the top of the container without cutting the lid open underneath the large pouring opening with a knife. In my opinion, anytime a cutting tool is necessary to open a household container...there must be explicate instructions included somewhere on the container! With some effort I was able to cut the plastic seal under the large pouring opening; this allowed the circular cap to twirl freely 360º, exposing openings for both the shake and pour applicators. Again, in my opinion this is one of the most poorly designed containers I've ever opened; with respect to safety anyway.When storing this product it would seem prudent to twirl the cap so both the shaker applicator and the large pouring applicator are covered. With this cap, there is only one setting that covered both openings; a 1/16 of an inch either way slightly exposed one or the other openings. The large pour spout needs to be smaller. I bumped the product over while reaching for my dictionary during the writing of this review; some of the white powder spilled out on my desk. I was able to find a plastic cap from a can of tennis balls that fit snugly over the top of the container, preventing this accident from happening again. It appears the old proverb is still true: ""Necessity is the mother of invention."" Maybe Bissell should try this quick, snap-on safety solution?Though Bissell's extra strength ""Pet Odor Eliminator"" does have a very strong scent the smell does dissipate over a short period of time after application. Also I didn't find the fragrance offensive like some of the other reviewers did, but thought is was rather pleasant after a several minutes. Furthermore, the scent doesn't stay around for a long time even though Bissell claims it has a ""long lasting fragrance."" What I did find was though the fragrance did dissipate, the product definitely neutralized the odors in our carpet. There are other products that can sanitize the air, such as Febreze Air Effects air refresher. I was more interested in getting rid of the pet odor in our carpet and making it softer. This product did just that.Before I finalize this review I have a curiosity question for Bissell: ""If this product is supposed to be sprinkled on carpets and rugs, what is the purpose of the large pour spout?"" Bissell does also provide a 1-800 telephone number for Questions and Comments. I see a phone call in my future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20F6UY69SQQ9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DBRDH6#wasThisHelpful","R20F6UY69SQQ9N","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After two years of drought, this spring and summer have been exceptionally wet. When that happens in the Midwest mosquitoes will be especially bothersome, along with a number of other pesky insects like ants, grubs, and lawn moths. Cutter makes a great deep woods mosquito repellant for campers and hikers so I decided to try their ""Cutter Backyard Bug Control"" this year.The insect spray concentrate comes in a ready-to-use 32 oz plastic jug with a garden hose attachable spray nozzle. The manufacturer claims this has a ""fast-acting"" formula that will kill and control nuisance pests for up to 8 weeks! Since I am using this product for the first time, I'll have to wait to determine the validity of that claim. There is a very detailed set of peel-open instructions (English & Spanish) attached to the back of the container. Listed under PRODUCT FACTS are three important pieces of information: (1) ""What it Does"": lists a large number of victims; some common (like grubs, ants and fleas) and some not so common pests (like European Crane Flies, Sod Webworms and Whiteflies), (2) ""Where to Use"": Lawns, Landscapes and Outdoor Surfaces, and (3) ""Coverage (32 fluid oz)"": Up to 5,000 square feet. A Questions & Comments 1-800 phone number and website address are also included. Based on some of the negative reviews for this product it would not be surprising that the manufacturer's phone may have been ringing off the hook in 2010-2012. However, a promising number of positive reviews have appeared in 2013.The instructions for application are very specific and should be followed to the letter. If you have applied other liquid outdoor products, like sprays for dandelions, this one isn't all that much different. However, spraying during the rainy season can be tricky and applications can be neutralized if it is followed by rain within days after it was used. Reapplication may be necessary. I used rubber garden gloves, old clothing, tall rubber boots, a hat and a painter mask on a calm day when I applied this spray to protect myself from spray mist and the residue on the lawn after application. A complete wash down afterward of the applier and clothing is recommended. The common-sense application guidelines are worthwhile reading before application; saves time, saves wasting the product as well as saves embarrassment if done without an effective application strategy.The guidelines for using this ready spray nozzle are very important, primarily since this Cutter product evidently has had a rash of poorly designed and manufactured nozzles in the past few years. I didn't have any problems with mine, which may indicate the manufacturer has responded to the wave of complaints about these nozzles. This bug control product has a very strong odor that stays around after spraying for some time. One thing I don't remember reading about is how long after application is it recommended before the lawn and other surfaces can be walked on (including domestic animals) and before the lawn can be mowed again. Hmmm, I see a 1-800 phone call in my near future.I was surprised to discover that this product can be safely used on ornamental trees, shrubs and flowers and is also recommended for patios and other cements surfaces. There is a short section in the instructions titled PRECAUTIONARY STATEMENTS; absolutely mandatory reading! In my opinion, this should have been at the very beginning of the instructions, but it was left to the very end.We haven't hit the height of our mosquito season yet so I will have to wait and see how effective this bug control really is and for how long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VGTQ2TWA3X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PGE032#wasThisHelpful","R21VGTQ2TWA3X2","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do a fair amount of shipping out of my home so having a shipping scale for weighing parcels saves time, money and trips back and forth to the post office. According to Amazon, the AccuPost (PP-110) scale is a postal scale from the USPS; it is very similar, but I checked with my local post office and this is not the one they sell. The AccuPost (PP-110) comes securely packaged, which is important to keep the scale undamaged and working accurately. The one I am reviewing is the small 10-pound desktop AccuPost (PP-110) postal scale manufactured by Measurement Ltd., Inc. It's compact (8""L x 6""W x 2""H) and weighs just over a pound.[NOTE: I was supposed to have received the USPS PS-10 scale but Amazon sent me this one instead. So I am reviewing what I received here where the PS-10 is supposed to be reviewed because the Amazon Vine program won't recognize my review if I don't. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.]This scale comes with a user manual (English only) and provides excellent instructions and pictures, the first of which are several WARNINGS to prevent damage to the scale. Some of the warnings are the common sense variety (Don't exceed the weight capacity, don't drop or bang the scale or use it other than in its intended use). There are no parts in this scale that can be serviced by the user and therefore the scale should not be opened. ""Attempting to service the scale will void the warranty and my permanently damage the scale."" The manufacturer ""... warrants this product against defects in material or workmanship for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase and agrees to replace it. This warranty does not cover damage resulting from misuse or abuse of the product. Should your product require service, you may send it back to Measurement Ltd., Inc. for repair of replacement.""The scale comes with a Star IV power adapter for a 110 volt wall outlet and a USB cord and port for use with a computer. The scale can also be used with 3 AA batteries (not included). It also has an automatic power off feature. For a small scale the digital screen is large and easy to read (1.3"" LCD display). It has three function keys: One to turn the scale on and off, another to switch from grams to pounds and ounces (LB/KB for international use), and a third to activate the Hold feature (retains weight reading on the display for a longer period). It also has a flip-up stand built into the scale surface to weight oversized envelopes.The digital reading may be set for any of four modes: (1) Grams (2) Ounces only (3) Pounds & Ounces in decimal mode and (4) Pounds & Ounces in fraction mode. I'm not sure when the fraction mode would be helpful, but there must be some need for it.Probably the most helpful feature of this scale is its use with a Windows PC (evidently the program won't work with a Mac). This allows the user to use the shipping data from the scale for use in their USPS, FedEx or UPS website account and to pay for postage and print shipping labels from your ink jet or laser printer. I have a USPS account and the downloadable program works well with USPS website. However, I do most of my shipping through eBay and PayPal; I gave up trying to get it to work. You can paste the data to a clipboard and then copy and paste it into the PayPal template. I might as well just type it into the template.Overall this compact postal scale does what Measurement Ltd., Inc. advertises it will do. I also have a larger WeighMax postal scale for bigger jobs (35 lbs maximum). If you need a scale to handle more weight, the WeighMax is a good desktop or countertop scale and can be purchased at a great price; less than this 10-pound postal scale that retails for around $38 to $40.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W06A2U6N6Q3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJA0QM6#wasThisHelpful","R2W06A2U6N6Q3S","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is rare for me to include my regard for a book at the beginning of a book review. In this case, however, Timothy Witmer's latest book titled ""The Shepherd Leader at Home (2012)"" is such a needed book and well worth my highest recommendation. There are certainly other book about a husband and father's role at home, but none that I have read come close to Witmer's compact, simply presented and so very biblically based. In my opinion, this book should be required reading in every home, right next to the Bible.This could be considered a companion volume to Witmer's first book titled ""The Shepherd Leader (2010)"" which addresses the shepherding of a church family. In his Introduction, Witmer gives the reader an insight into the purpose for his latest book. Witmer writes:""The heart of this book, therefore, will be to walk together through the fundamental shepherding functions of knowing, leading, providing for, and protecting and their application to leadership in the family. These shepherding functions represent four of the most fundamental human needs the God meets through those who lead families. Each of the four parts will begin with an introduction showing its biblical rationale. This book is intentionally practical, personal and heart-to-heart. I write not as someone who has it all together, but as someone seeking to take seriously what God has called me to do and to be as a husband and father.""Witmer divides his study into four parts, one for each of the shepherd's fundamental responsibilities: (1) Knowing, (2) Leading, (3) Protecting, and (4) Providing for his family. He adds discussion questions at the end of each chapter to enhance both an individual and a group study. It should come as no surprise that Witmer opens his book in chapter one with an essential introduction and overview of the biblical model for the family, beginning at the beginning in Genesis chapter one. Witmer writes: ""Let's go back to the very beginning and take a look at how fundamental this concept of relationship is to marriage.""Witmer captures the heart of the shepherd metaphor in this book by pointing first to Jesus, the Great Shepherd as a model for all husbands/fathers, who are His under-shepherds to their own family. Each relationship is a reflection of what the Old and New Testaments reveal a shepherd must do and must be; such as in Psalm 23 and John 10. Witmer rightly points out that: ""If your relationship with your wife is the primary human in life, your relationship with your children comes next."" Both come under the care and protection of the household shepherd.Beside discussion questions at the end of each chapter, Witmer also provides a list of valuable resources to use in family devotions. His recommendations include Bibles and Bible stories and even resources for singing, as well as material for memorization. I must admit I have never seen this kind of material added to other books for the family. Witmer's book is not loaded with notes, yet there is helpful material noted in the text and cited in the endnotes at the back of the book.As mentioned above, this book is biblically solid and very practical. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23BNXV6VMV35D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433530074#wasThisHelpful","R23BNXV6VMV35D","APDVHUTTR05XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDVHUTTR05XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I loved the way the ear pieces looked so comfortable - and he confirmed they did feel nice. There are smaller and larger ear cushion pieces so you can adjust them to fit your ear size.I really liked the red color because I felt it made them easier to see. They are wireless which is really nice. There is a function button and two separate up/down volume buttons that also double as a forward/backward button on the headset itself which makes using them easy!He had no trouble figuring out how to use them and stated that the music coming out of them sounded great.

"This is a fantastic handheld shower head with 5 different functions! I am truly impressed! It is made of high quality Brass and ABS thermo material so it can handle high temperatures without any problem. The 67 nozzles are made of rubber, so they will not rust! I love the rainfall setting which is not only ideal for me, but also for my plants! In addition to the rainfall setting there are 4 others - a jet setting, a mist setting, a full body spray with massage and a full body spray.I like the larger head and the handle is just the right size for smaller hands - not too long and not too short - however a person with larger hands can certainly hold onto it with no issues.It comes with everything you need to install it - a small roll of Teflon tape, washers, the hose, the mounting bracket and the shower head. It is all a very shiny chrome color. The shower head is lightweight and easy to handle - even for a child.What I really love about handheld shower heads is they are ideal for bathing pets, young children, the elderly or disabled. They are great for rinsing your hair or giving your body a final rinse after a bath to make sure all the soap and bubbles are rinsed away. They also make cleaning things in your tub so much easier!Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

I had never seen  a shower head with buttons on it until I saw this one. The buttons allow you to switch between the two modes - waterfall and rainfall. Speaking of when you install this you want to make sure the straight line which is the waterfall nozzles are facing down closest to the tub. The waterfall mode is quite relaxing in my option and much like actually being under a waterfall.The shower head is very modern looking and is made of ABS thermo material so hot water is not a problem. The nozzles are rubber so they o't rust and it is easy to clean.Overall I like the design and love that it keeps my entire body warm when I shower.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

"This is a reversible showerhead that has 10 mist nozzles on one side and 40 rainfall nozzles on the other side. The nozzles are all rubber so there is no need to worry about them rusting and ruining your shower head. To switch between the two settings, just turn the shower head so the side you want to use is facing downward and push the shower head down. Putting the shower head in the center turns the water off on both sides. Be careful however because it is easy to spray yourself in the face by accident with this shower head should you press it the wrong way.The shower head is easy to install and comes with everything you need - Teflon tape, washers, the hose and even a shower head holder. It is made of ABS thermo material so it handles hot water just fine.I like the unique circle shape of this shower head and think the empty center is quite unique. I like that it is a handheld shower head which is ideal for bathing children, elderly or disabled people. It also make washing or rinsing your hair easy.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

"This dress is so pretty - and I am sure my grand daughter loves it! Even her mother was impressed with how pretty this dress was! It is very dressy looking - and I love the little embroidered flowers that add that ""sweet"" touch to a grown-up looking dress. Many little girls do not want something too frilly and this certainly is not. The material is easy to hand wash should any spots get on it and just hang it to dry.I love the crinoline underneath the skirt - and that vibrant pink bow around the waist just sets the dress off. All of the seams are well sewn and the dress is made of a high quality material that is sturdy enough for a child to wear without worrying about it tearing easily.It is sleeveless but a shawl or cardigan sweater would certainly look nice with it and keep your child warm during the winter. For the summer months your child is not going to sweat to death. I really like the seasonal versatility of this dress.I really wanted something for my granddaughter that she could wear and look nice during the holidays. This dress is perfect for that as far as I am concerned.Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 5:06 MinsI gave these to my husband to review because I cannot put anything into my ears. They are very nice looking and seemed sturdy. I loved the way the ear pieces looked so comfortable - and he confirmed they did feel nice. There are smaller and larger ear cushion pieces so you can adjust them to fit your ear size.I really liked the red color because I felt it made them easier to see. They are wireless which is really nice. There is a function button and two separate up/down volume buttons that also double as a forward/backward button on the headset itself which makes using them easy!He had no trouble figuring out how to use them and stated that the music coming out of them sounded great. They have a voice confirmation of when they are on and when they are pairing to make them even easier to use. These would make a great gift item.Disclaimer: I received this item for free  in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

" 2:04 MinsIn this kit are two boxes that contain 15 LED Fiber Optic Light Up Flashing Hair Barrettes. That is enough for several people to fully light up their hair, so these are great for parties, holiday celebrations or just to have fun anytime. I love that the batteries are removable so I don't have to throw these away once the batteries die.The barrettes are very easy to open and close - best of all they actually stayed put in my hair which is amazing. Most barrette type products slide right out of my hair within an hour - give or take.The barrette is large enough it is going to be seen - but that was ok with me. I liked the colors but I did not wear mine late at night in total darkness where I am sure it would look more colorful. They can also be cut to match the length of your natural hair. I did not try this however as my hair was actually longer than the product.I did not find any problems with this product.Disclaimer: I received this item for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.
