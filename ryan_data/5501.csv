"At first glance, I thought this seemed like just the usual can opener.  I doubted the ""Smooth Edge"" claim.  But, after opening many cans now, I have to admit...these really do leave a smooth edge behind.  I also liked the ease of attaching the opener to the can.  Some openers struggle to get a good grip on the can, but this one digs right in.I will point out though that, like many can openers, the lid may not always completely release at the every end.  It may hold on by just a thread of metal.  But a little twist of the lid will finish the job.  As a result, you may find that one tiny connection point sticks out a bit even though the rest of the can is smooth.Add to this its modern look and feel, and this is a really nice can opener.  I have a few can openers in my kitchen.  This will now be my go-to opener.Reviewer's note: I received this can opener free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTOB1WPR5NC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAKQ1HG#wasThisHelpful","R1DTOB1WPR5NC6","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In short, the sound and Bluetooth connectivity of these headphones are great.  The fit is pretty good, even given my weird ears.Some details:Connectivity is smooth and quick.  On my Galaxy S6, there is roughly only a 1-second wait time between turning on the earphones and actually being connected to Bluetooth.Sound is very good.  For podcasts and music, the quality is quite good.  Normally, I expect to sacrifice sound quality for sports-based headphones.  Here, though, the sound is much better than I expected.  This may partially be due to the snug fit in my ears.Good sound control: Some Bluetooth headphones simply adjust your phone's actual volume.  These, on the other hand, actually have their own volume control, independent of the phone.  So, use your phone's volume to set a ""max"" for your headphones, and then you can use your headphone's volume control to adjust from silent up to that max.The fit is pretty good.  One of my ear openings is slightly larger than the other, and so it's nice that there are three different tip sizes included.  My only complaint is that the little ""wings"" that help hold these in my ears don't seem to do a bit of good.  Perhaps I am using them incorrectly?  I cannot seem to figure out any way to use these effectively.  For my workouts (mostly weight training), the earbuds stay in place well.  But for running, I wish the wings did a better job.All in all, a decent seat of Bluetooth headphones: good sound and connectivity for the price!Reviewer's note: I received these headphones free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R110JTOF3ETT72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HYM0KE#wasThisHelpful","R110JTOF3ETT72","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a handy tool, I now keep it in my backpack so that it is always handy.  The stick is solidly built, and the lanyard is a nice safety feature so that you won't lose your camera if you accidentally let go of the stick.Given that the stick has a standard tripod mount, you can mount nearly any kind of camera on the end of it.  I have a holder for my Galaxy S6 and my wife's iPhone 6.  Either of these can attach to this stick.What makes this better than one of those telescoping ""selfie sticks""?  Primarily, it is very sturdy.  I have played around with selfie sticks and would not trust them with any serious action.  But this offering from Ho Stevie! is designed to endure the same kinds of bumps and jumps that the GoPro can handle.So, if you're just looking for something for taking selfies in your backyard, this probably isn't the right choice.  But if you want to run, jump, bike, or swim with your camera, this Floating GoPro Grip Stick is a great choice!Note: I received this stick free for the purpose of testing and providing an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BF1VS04K0FFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011D5XV5G#wasThisHelpful","R2BF1VS04K0FFA","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was impressed with the quality of this lock, given its low price.  Once connected to your laptop, this lock serves as a good theft deterrent.  It has a solid look and feel.  I am currently using it on my somewhat older (2011-ish) Macbook Pro with no problem.This style of lock is ""universal"" in that it fits a LOT of different laptops, but certainly not all.  My Asus Chromebook and Macbook Air are not designed to work with this kind of lock.  Do a little research before ordering, to be sure you are getting the right kind of lock.Regarding setup: BE CAREFUL.  Selecting and setting a combination for the lock is straightforward.  But if you make a mistake, you may never know what combination you set unless you are willing to try all 10,000 combinations.  I nearly messed up in this process, partly because my 47-year-old eyeballs could not adequately read the tiny numbers on the combination dial.  When setting it up, you need to press a little button on the lock while you turn the dials to your desired combination.  This is probably best accomplished with an extra set of hands, because pressing that button requires a fair bit of pressure.  So, while your hands are busy holding in that button, you might ask someone else to set the numbers for you (and that extra set of eyes could be useful as well).I certainly recommend this lock, despite the slightly tricky setup.  Once that combination is set, you'll have a solid theft-preventer for your laptop.Reviewer's note: I received this security cable free for the purpose of testing and providing an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X7R7C1YBPJQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3YG93O#wasThisHelpful","R2X7R7C1YBPJQ1","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical that these would work, but it turns out that they live up to their claims: they do save space, and they do stay sealed.Many ""space saving"" bags required some kind of device to suck out the air.  These do not.  Essentially, these are like very large ""ziploc"" bags.  You remove air from them by mostly sealing them, then rolling them to push out as much air as possible, and then completely sealing them.And they work.  I put a pair of jeans (that's about the width of these bags...wide enough to hold a folded pair of jeans), a couple of t-shirts, and a pair of socks into a bag.  Then, I followed the mostly-seal-then-roll-then-finish-sealing procedure.  That was enough to remove nearly all the air from the bag.  Then, we got on the road for our trip.  4 hours later, the bagged clothing was still just as sealed as when we started.All in all, these are great bags for traveling!Reviewer's note: I received these bags freee for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8HQKIMC1MNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SONHMY#wasThisHelpful","R2S8HQKIMC1MNX","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid turner, great for stirring and tossing in a non-stick pan (and any other pan for that matter).I like the feel of the rubber handle, and it seems to be nicely secured to the wood.  In other words, it hasn't slid or rotated on the handle.  I do have a bit of concern that water could get between the rubber and the wood, but this would only be a problem if you let it soak in water (which you shouldn't do anyway).If I could cite one minor issue, it would be this: When I use this for stirring ground beef, bits of the meat end up getting caught in the slots.  It takes a little extra effort to remove these.  So, just be diligent about cleanup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSJ5YJ4AJW1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKL4R8#wasThisHelpful","R1JSJ5YJ4AJW1D","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For both my Galaxy S6 and my wife's iPhone 6, this is a sturdy and reliable car mount.I've attached it to the dashboard and to the windshield.  In both cases, it attaches very easily...almost effortlessly...and then stays put.The arm is flexible, allowing me to twist and turn my phone until it is at just the angle I need, and then it stays in place.I will say that at first I was put off by the ""sticky"" feel of the suction pad.  Then I realized this is the intention.  That stickiness gives the car mount a little extra stability.  Apparently the stickiness is mean to last a long time: the instructions say to wash the suction with warm water in order to refresh it.Finally, I like how easily the clip will open to accommodate a variety of phones.  It, like the rest of the mount, is very sturdy: once you put your phone in, it's not going to come out.I highly recommend this if you are looking for a reliable, quick-and-easy way to mount your phone in the car (for GPS, hands-free talking, etc.)Note: I received this mount for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9V3E1G137UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Y4S2RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1H9V3E1G137UO","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience with a barcode reader, and I was instantly impressed.  It was truly Plug and Play on my Windows 10 machine.  Plug it in and start aiming at bar codes and pulling the trigger.Note that you technically don't need any special software to make this work.  It is like a keyboard except that its input comes from barcodes.  In fact, I just aimed the scanner at a barcode as I was typing this review, and it instantly put the barcode number into my review.  You can also scan directly into a spreadsheet: just point and click, and the bar code is entered into a cell (this worked flawlessly in Google Sheets and in Microsoft Excel).This scanner is lightweight but sturdy feeling, as is the connection cable.  Not that this matters much, but note that the images on Amazon's product page show a blue and white RUBAN logo on the top of the reader.  This does not have that logo.  In fact, RUBAN does not appear anywhere on the device.Note that this is specifically for reading barcodes, and not other kinds of codes (it won't handle QR codes, for example).Long story short, if you are looking for an inexpensive easy-to-use barcode reader, this offering from RUBAN is a great way to go.  As a complete beginner, I'm very happy with it!Note: I received this barcode reader free for the purpose of testing and providing an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MJ4B4YZWDGWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01191D7QC#wasThisHelpful","R3MJ4B4YZWDGWZ","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, you realize what this is NOT, right?  This looks a lot like something else, but it is not that.  Once you understand that, you can begin to appreciate this for what it is: a decent mp3 player, FM radio, photo viewer, digital recorder and more, AND it comes with a 16GB Micro SD card.  Now think about that, and look at the price.  It would be hard to beat a price like that.There are minor issues here and there:* Menu navigation takes some getting used to* It plays AMV/MTV video formats (not MP4 as far as I could figure out).  I had to spend time converting files to one of these formats before I could view them.* You will need to connect it to your computer and drag audio, video, and photo files onto itStill...audio quality is decent, it picks up FM radio stations quite well, and has a nice feel to it (the brushed metal makes it look more expensive than it is).Should you buy this?  If you are looking for an inexpensive audio/video/photo solution, and don't mind dragging and dropping files, and putting up with a quirky menu system, then absolutely.  It's worth it.  If you are looking for something that is more like an Apple device, this is definitely not what you should be considering.  But then, those Apple devices are WAY more expensive than this device.Note: I received this player free for the purpose of testing and providing an unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8YLXCVYBKAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBXDG1S#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8YLXCVYBKAQ","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The strength of this recorder is that it is discreet, so it won't easily distract the person being recorded.  Too often, voice recorders are big and have multiple lights, thereby distracting people.  By contrast, this voice recorder...* is small (about the size of a flash drive)* has only one tiny button on the side, almost not noticeable* has a little LED light that turns on when you switch on the recorder, but that goes off after about 10 secondsNote that this is purely a recorder, incapable of playing back recordings on its own.  Instead, you slip it into the USB port of a Mac or Windows computer.  Then, you just double-click on the recording you want to play, or download the recordings for future listening.The recording quality is very good for close, face-to-face conversations, which is how I tend to use it.  However, it is not what I would recommend for recording in a large room where the person being recorded is 10 or more feet away.  There is a noticeable dropoff in sound when the subject is beyond that distance.All in all, I like this for its simplicity: turn it on and it records.  Turn it off and the file is saved.  I recommend it if you need to record one-on-one conversations without distracting the person being recorded.Reviewer's note: I received this recorder free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6JM02MNXFNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2GY2UY#wasThisHelpful","RY6JM02MNXFNS","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've tested several wallet-type phone cases, and most have disappointed me because they can only hold two cards.

"Ok, I was not brave enough to test the waterproof-claim of this cover with my Kindle.  But I did want to test it.  So, I put a piece of paper in the case, sealed it shut, and held it under a few inches of water for a minute.  And....success!  Not a drop of water in the case.Note that Incipio says the waterproof seal is good for up to 2 meters of water for 30 minutes, so my test could have been more thorough.  But it is nice to know that this will offer good protection against rain, or an accidental drop in the pool.Here are a few other details you might care about:* All of the Kindle Voyage features still work when this case is on. In particular, all of the following work: the light sensor in the upper-left corner, the power button on the back, the side buttons for moving forward and back (and I can still feel the little vibration feedback with each page turn), the touch screen, and the charging port.* The touch screen was my biggest concern, but it mostly works fine when it is in this case.  I did find that touching the right side of the screen required a bit more pressure than I normally needed.  That was a bit distracting.  It used to be that my slightest touch would advance to the next page.  Now, sometimes that touch does not register...but tap just a bit harder and it's fine.  This is my main reason for the 4-star rather than 5-star rating (though there are a couple other minor issues...read on).* The out-of-the-box experience was a bit confusing.  When I opened the box, there was the case.  But I could not figure out how to open the case.  So, I thought I should read the instructions.  I could not find any instructions.  It turns out that the instructions were INSIDE the case.  And the first step in the instruction explained how to open the case.  This seemed rather silly to me.  Then I figured out that, if I had removed the protective sticker from the screen of the case, I would have been able to read the instructions through the screen.  So, probably I'm just a bit dumb, but that never occurred to me...that the only way to find the instructions was to peel a sticker off the screen of the case.  So, I figured out on my own that it was safe to pry apart the case and just work around the perimeter of the case to separate the two pieces.  Also, the instructions referred to the included microfiber cloth, but there most definitely was no cloth included with the case.* This will add some bulk to the normally very light Kindle Voyage.  But if protection from water and dust is important to you, then the extra bulk is probably worth it.* Finally, as best as I can tell, Incipio assumes no liability for damage to your Kindle while using this case.  This is not really surprising, given that user error could cause problems.  Specifically, they say, ""Incipio is not liable for any damage to your device, including data loss that occurs while using the Atlas case except as expressly outlined in the Incipio Protective Products Agreement (where applicable).""  The instructions include a LOT of detail about the steps you need to take to be sure that you get a good seal...it is clear that they want to make sure you know there are risks involved if you are not careful.All in all, this case does what matters most: protects your Kindle Voyage from water.  I can put up with some minor issues if it means knowing that my device is safe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EUX9P49B3XL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU7CN0U#wasThisHelpful","R3EUX9P49B3XL6","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What surprised me most about this lamp is its size.  It is the biggest desk lamp I have ever owned.  I was not quite prepared for it.  Fully extended, this is 4 feet long (not that you would want to fully extend it).  Not to overstate it, but do consider the desk or table where you want this to go.  Roughly speaking, you want a lamp to accent your desk...not overshadow it.Having said that...this is a really nice lamp.

"I have tested and liked many cases for the S6, but this OtterBox case is by far the one that I've liked the best.  It has a really solid feel to it that just makes it seem like a natural part of the phone.Some additional details:* The fit is very snug.  The product description says the case ""easily slips on and off"".  While it is true that I can remove it in a few seconds, I find that the fit is quite tight...so much so that you may find that the buttons on the side of the phone are being triggered as you put on or take off the case.  This may be a deal-breaker if you frequently take off the case, but if you plan to keep it on and leave it on, then this won't be an issue.* The product photo makes it look like the back of the case is textured.  It is not.  It is as smooth as can be.  If you put the phone face up on a table, you will find that it slides around easily.* The rubber edge around the front of the phone is perfect for gripping.  Because it has a rubberized texture, I recommend setting your phone face down rather than face up.  It won't slide around if it is face down.* I like the appearance.  A lot.  I am a fan of blacks and greys in general.  This case is exactly what I'm after.* It works with Qi chargers.  I love being able to set my phone on a pad to charge it, rather than needing to plug it in.  The case does not interfere with the two Qi chargers I own.It took me a month or so to find it, but I now have the perfect case for my phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KFDFO95O1UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYTBHKK#wasThisHelpful","R31KFDFO95O1UV","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is, bar none, the best grill brush I have used: sturdy and highly effective.  I'm using it on stainless steel grates on my Weber and find that it gets into each crevice perfectly.  The whole thing is constructed so solidly that it should last a long time.A couple notes:1) The instructions explain how to clean your brush when you are done using it.  I recommend not cleaning your grill at the end of a cook.  Rather, the next time you cook, preheat the grill and then clean it right before it is time to cook.  By that time, old food has turned to ash and is easier to scrape clean.  Then, I see no need to clean the brush.2) The metal on this brush will rust if left out.  With that in mind, find a place to store it where it is protected from the elements.  You can certainly get years of use out of the brush if you treat it nicely.All in all, there is so much to like about this brush.

"Though I have tested many earbuds, earphones, and headsets, this is the first time I have ever tried the neckband-style earphones.  I'm very happy with the results, but have learned a few things about how not to use them.For me, the biggest advantage of these earphones is that the controls are simpler to use.  Many earphones have just 3 buttons, with each serving multiple purposes (for example, one button switches tracks and changes the volume, depending on how long you hold it down).  With the neckband, it is very easy to locate the volume and track controls.  Each button has a unique shape, making it easy to find the right button even if you forget which is which.  Volume and phonecalls are on the right side, and playing/pausing/switching tracks are on the left.I also like the sliding switch to turn the headset on and off.  While many earphones have a button that you must press and hold (but not too long...you might go into Bluetooth pairing mode), the Q800 lets you flip a switch to turn it on and connect.Finally, I appreciate audio feedback that tells me the status of the battery.  It's easy for me to forget how long it has been since I last charged my earphones.  A voice on the Q800 lets you know how full the battery is each time you turn it on.But now, let me tell you how NOT to use these earphones:1) They did not work too well for me on my run.  They tend to bounce up and down on my neck, which I find distracting.  I tucked the neckband under my t-shirt, which helped, but eventually as my run progressed, they came out again.2) They worked well in the gym, until it was time to do my sit-ups on an inclined platform.  Then, the neckband fell off my neck.  In all other ways, these worked well in the gym.I don't fault SoundPEATS for the above problems...I suspect this is the nature of neckband-style earphones.If you plan to use these on a walk, or around the house, then I highly recommend them.  On the other hand, if you plan to use them for a run or workout, you might look at some other options (SoundPEATS has another set of earbuds, Q8, that work great when I am running).Reviewer's note: I received these earbuds free for the purpose of testing and reviewing","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJWTIN3ZHKVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R1LJWTIN3ZHKVC","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience using compression sleeves.  My impressions:*  The material is flexible yet sturdy.  They fit my calves well, and seem built to last.*  They are comfortable.  On my run this morning, it was 59 degrees outside.  They felt nice at the start of the run...though I was happy to remove them at the end as I could feel my legs getting a little warm.I hope to get a lot of use out of these!Reviewer's note: I received these sleeves free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQF9B2NADNKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIRRXXE#wasThisHelpful","RKQF9B2NADNKQ","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Kings Mountain"" by Hank Messick is an older title (1976) but a good read on what some historians believe was the turning point of the American Revolution.  The book is around 180 pages and covers topics such as:1.  Events leading up to the battle.2.  Background info on the patriot leaders, particularly: Shelby, Campbell, Cleveland, Winston, Williams, etc.3.  Description of the mountain men's march from Sycamore Shoals TN to Kings Mountain SC.4.  Background info on Patrick Ferguson (British army officer who was from Scotland and led the loyalist forces at Kings Mountain) and some of the loyalist leaders.5.  Description of the battle.6.  Results and impact the battle had on the American Revolution.7.  Post battle careers of the patriot readers.Messick uses an entertaining narrative:  Refers to the mountain men as hillbillies or rednecks as described by the British, provides appropriate details as needed, and gets to the point.  The only complaint I have is a similar one to other military-related titles I have read:  would have liked to have seen more maps.  Complaint aside, still a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O05SNEVODZ29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316567965#wasThisHelpful","R3O05SNEVODZ29","A4QC76NMWE5OC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4QC76NMWE5OC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yesterday I passed the PMP Exam on the first try, yipppeee!  Now that I have recovered and am no longer a basket case, time for some comments and a review.  First, I have never been a full-time project manager but until after taking some PMP courses and preparing for the exam, realized that I have been applying PM principles during my whole life and career.  My career has consisted of being an Air Force Officer and mainly sales and am now looking to going into a new phase.  As I completed my last PMP class and started to prepare for the exam, I started to read the PMBOK as my only study source.  After reading a chapters and seeing that I was doomed to fail, it was time to find other resources that could help me better understand Project Management and go back and read the PMBOK with a ""new set of eyes"".Now, my comments about Head First PMP:1.  In my humble opinion,  Head First PMP is the best resource to use for exam prep for someone like me.  The authors' philosophy of learning by visuals, examples (wedding, baking cookies, etc.), exercises, repetitively describing key concepts (although in different words), etc. really work.  I consider myself a visual learner and the Head First fits the bill.2.  Really like the exercises, crossword puzzles, and exams - the questions were somewhat challenging.  Like I said earlier, repetition works.3.  Really like the way the Head First is organized - the first 3 chapters serve as an introduction to Project Management and chapters 4 - 10 correspond with the knowledge area in the same chapter in the PMBOK Guide.4.  Good practical pointers throughout the book.  For example, the Head First mentions practical tips on preparing for the exam, red herring questions (have to say, I did not find too many in the PMP exam version I took) and so on.  Very helpful.5.  Very good layout - eye catching, logical order, etc.For what it's worth, here's the strategy I implemented for passing the PMP exam:1.  No boot camp for me - (don't do well with trying to cram in too much information too quickly, I prefer to pace myself.  Some impatient folks may disagree with me, but I believe taking your time and pacing yourself, when possible, is a better way to learn).  Instead, I took 4 courses at a local community college whenever my schedule allowed me.  Earned plenty of credits to qualify for taking the exam.2.  Studied the Head First quickly to get an idea of how the book is laid out and its content.3.  Next, I read through the book several times for more in depth knowledge of PMP principles.  DO NOT skip the exercises, puzzles, and mini exams, they really help!4.  After reading the Head First a few times, I then started to read the PMBOK - really helped me look at the PMBOK in a new way.5.  Studied the PMBOK Guide glossary after reading Head First.  One of instructors strongly recommended this and I do too.  However, I would say the glossary was easier to understand after reading the Head First.6.  While the Head First did have several math problems, I wanted to supplement learning the formulas with the McGraw-Hill PMP Certification Mathematics title.  The title is a good aid and I recommend it.  Will probably do an Amazon review on that title soon.7.  Pray like crazy and get a great night's sleep! I tried to keep things in perspective - the worst thing that could have happened to me if I failed was to take the exam again.  Compared to the difficulties that millions of people around the world are experiencing, that helped me see things in a different light.  I can say, that praise the Lord, I am relieved that I don't have to take the exam again!8.  Finally, do some online exams - Gary Lehman has a great site with several exam examples.In summary, I highly recommend the Head First PMP.  Buy the book, study, pray, and pass the exam!  Go get'em!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EE239Z4M8JYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449364918#wasThisHelpful","R3EE239Z4M8JYG","A4QC76NMWE5OC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4QC76NMWE5OC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Take My Hand Again"" is a good title for anyone wanting to assist an aging loved one.

Would have been great if we had access to this title about a year or so ago when my mother-in-law was (and still is) going through an especially difficult phase in her life.3.

"""How To Enjoy Reading Your Bible"" by Keith Ferrin is a good title for anyone wanting insights on how to get more out of your Bible reading time.

Have a planned strategy for reading your Bible.3.  Understand the high points of a book first instead of focusing first on details that may distract your learning.4.  Read aloud during your devotion time - will engage you more and help you remember verses.5.  Suggested 60 day and 4 month Bible reading plans.The narrative flows freely and is easy to follow.  I will give this title for our children to read to aid them in their devotion times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30W847V3J30KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764213237#wasThisHelpful","R30W847V3J30KX","A4QC76NMWE5OC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4QC76NMWE5OC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Seven Men"" by Eric Metaxas is a great title for anyone looking for an introduction to 7 men who made a positive impact on the world in their time.  The book is around 240 pages and covers the following men and their challenge:1.  George Washington - leading the country during the American Revolution and turning down the chance to become a king.2.  William Wilberforce - his long and eventually successful struggle with abolishing the slave trade and improving common manners in England.3.  Eric Liddell - refusal to run an Olympic race on a Sunday.4.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer - resisting Hitler's dictatorship in Germany during World War 2.5.  Jackie Robinson - letting Christ rule through him as he endured racism and hatred in Major League Baseball and elsewhere (and not only in the South!).6.  Pope John Paul II - resisting communism in Europe and reaching out to common folk.7.  Charles Colson - letting God use his time in prison to minister to other prisoners and eventually starting various prison ministries when he was let out of prison.Some reviewers appeared to be a little critical of Metaxas' book because the title apparently did not  go into sufficient detail into each man's life.  I submit that the author's aim was to give a glimpse into each man's life on how God worked in and through him to advance His kingdom.  In that goal, the author succeeded admirably.  Indeed, if the author wanted to do a more comprehensive biography on each man, the book would be considerably larger!  Plenty of books are available that cover each man's life in more detail.I will give this title to my son when he is a little older and able to read such titles so he can get a grasp on how God works in our lives.  Read and enjoy.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOQXTAFPKTJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718030958#wasThisHelpful","R2JOQXTAFPKTJL","A4QC76NMWE5OC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4QC76NMWE5OC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""What Every Christian Needs to Know About Passover"" by Rabbi Evan Moffic is an enlightening read on how Christians can celebrate the Jewish Passover remembrance/celebration.  As a committed Christian, I see Jesus Christ as the sacrificial lamb whose blood was shed to spare His children from God's wrath.  While Rabbi Moffic does not appear to be a Messianic Jew (perhaps I am wrong), he shows much knowledge about Jesus' life and how Christians can tie their own beliefs into Passover.The book is around 190 pages and covers such topics as:1.  History of the Israelite exodus from Egypt.2.  How Passover was celebrated during Jesus' day.3.  Celebrating the Passover is more of a home event - makes it more intimate.4.  Preparing spiritually and otherwise for Passover.5.  Singing during the Passover observance.6.  Telling the Passover story.7.  Examples of freedom throughout history when people sought to be free of oppression.A good read and helpful future reference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I01ZU542GZE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426791569#wasThisHelpful","R2I01ZU542GZE6","A4QC76NMWE5OC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4QC76NMWE5OC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Praying Over God's Promises"" by Thomas Yeakley is a good title for anyone needing encouragement to hang in there and cling to God's promises for your life.  The book is around 110 pages, is an easy read, and covers topics such as:1.  While God does not promise a problem-free or stress-free life, He does promise to be with us.2.  Suggestions for mentioning God's promises for your life.3.  Learning to walk by faith while waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.4.  Some promises will not be fully realized during our lifetime.5.  Reasons why a promise may go unfulfilled.6.  Being careful to twist Scripture around to suit your own purpose.7. Using Abraham's life as an example of living a life of faith.The book may be read in 2-3 sittings and the narrative flows freely.

"""The Complete 101 Collection"" by John Maxwell is a comprehensive treatment on the subject of several leadership topics:  attitude, self-improvement, relationships, success, teamwork, equipping, and mentoring.

Good basic information - nothing exactly earth shattering, but full of reminders that we need to apply when in a leadership position (home, work, community, etc.).  My main complaint is that there seemed to be some unnecessary repetition in some of the chapters (later chapters would repeat what earlier chapters already addressed).

"""Natural Balance Dry Dog Food, Limited"" so far seems to be a good product. Our dog, a Jack Russell mix, is not a picky eater and this product was no exception.  The first time we gave him this, he took about 5 pieces out of the bowl to investigate (different from other food we've gotten him), eat them one by one, and then consumed the whole bowl.  Obviously, he liked it! Bailey has finished the other portions we've given him and plan to keep feeding him until he finishes the bag.  He looks forward to dinnertime!So far, so good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TMLYUP7HS83D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR99EDY#wasThisHelpful","R2TMLYUP7HS83D","A4QC76NMWE5OC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4QC76NMWE5OC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Along with ""Killing Lincoln"" and ""Killing Kennedy"", ""Killing Patton"" is an engrossing read of arguably the best fighting WWII general with the focus on his war accomplishments, relationships with various personalities (Eisenhower, Bradley, Truman, Stalin, etc.), and the events surrounding his mysterious death - was it a conspiracy or not?The authors mention some strange events after General Patton's accident - the driver of the truck that hit Patton's care never being tried, other people supposedly involved in the incident not apprehended or taken into custody for further questioning, etc.  The title is around 330 pages and is a great narrative that covers a lot of Patton's war accomplishments - tense, dramatic, etc.Great read, my only real complaints is that I would have liked to have known more about General Patton's early life and several examples of Patton's salty language.

"""Ordinary"" by Tony Merida is a good read for anyone wanting to be different from the self-absorbed, self-obsessed world we live in.  As a member of the ""evangelical right"" I have to admit that at times we emphasize right theology to the point of forgetting to apply what we believe into practice.  Specifically, Merida addresses the following areas where folks like me can see God work in great and mighty ways for His glory:1.  Focusing more on serving God quietly out of the spotlight and serving to be pleasing to Him instead of serving to please people.2.  Showing hospitality to others - not trying to impress people when having them over to your house, but making them feel like honored quests by serving them.3.  Caring for others unable to fend for themselves - orphans, widows/widowers, elderly, etc.A good and brief read that will encourage and challenge you to get out there and serve for God's glory and honor to a lost world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T0OZ9LKNK5R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433684160#wasThisHelpful","R3T0OZ9LKNK5R8","A4QC76NMWE5OC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4QC76NMWE5OC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a sales representative for several years in various industries (especially education), ""Customer Experience For Dummies"" was a natural title for me to check out.  Indeed, in a business where repeat sales can go a ways in achieving quotas, making sure current customers are happy and want to renew makes it easier to focus on new customers.The title is around 325 pages and covers several topics such as:1.  The financial impact (positive and negative) a customer experience can have on a company.2.  Taking care of an angry customer.3.  Getting customer feedback (I do this now with a view to securing future business and getting referrals).  Indeed, a happy customer is the most powerful kind of advertising.4.  Ways to improve customer experience (hint, good listening skills are one of the keys - have to reminder, we are born with one mouth and two ears!).5.  Working within your companys' culture for dealing with customers.  As the title mentioned some companies have a great culture to work in to positively address customer experiences, while others, well, aren't so good.

"Because literally nothing goes right in this story.  And I'm sure that was his point.Main character, Ryuu, witnesses a brutal massacre of his town folk including his parents, right before his eyes.  He's saved by Shigeru, a nightblade.  Raised as Shigeru's prodigy.  There's a darker story to the nightblades, but the author attempted to blur the lines of good and evil while emphasizing causality: for every action there is an opposite, equal reaction.I had three problems with the book.First, Ryuu got way too good, way too fast.  I understand there's more to him than meets the eye, and we'll learn about this in the second book, but it was like he couldn't fail.  He was killing people left and right with ridiculous ease, even those that seemed to have godly powers.  It was almost laughable.Second, Takako made no sense.  First, she's enthralled by Ryuu's conversation.  Then, Ryuu selfishly acts, and the result is bloody.  Takako ends up hating Ryuu, no real forgiveness, never gets over it, but never leaves.  Then ""the end"" happens, and while it's expected, it's like the author couldn't make up his mind which way he wanted to go with Ryuu's feelings.  We never got to explore Takako at all, and she never revealed anything of herself.  She became a victim of circumstance with no real substance.Third, General Nori and his son.  Without spoiling things, this goes back to my first issue.I gave it 4 stars because it was a very easy read, very well written, and it took an intriguing story that made me want to read the sequel at the end of the week when it comes out.  Just don't expect a happy ending, and don't expect resolution or absolution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7J8501GQUSG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013D0H2GS#wasThisHelpful","R7J8501GQUSG3","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those who criticize the game really miss the point.I played this game ages ago.  Vividly remember it.  If you're a fan of creating your own character and playing the game as if you're in it, this is the game for you.  However, if you're just into ""graphics OMG!!!"", don't play it.  This game focused more on telling a story.You create a character.  He has a storyline, starting from fighting in small, seedy gyms with a few people and gaining fame over time, all the way up to the main event scene.  Along the way, realistic things happen; you get injuries during training or in fights, you have to buy stuff, you'll get into a feud with another fighter, dirty fighters where the judges/refs don't call it, etc.  I remember once, my guy broke his hand, and you take damage with every punch with that hand.

".First let me be clear: Renshaw is a very good writer.  He was able to explain scenery very well.  I only detected one grammatical error so minor I don't even remember specifically what it was.  Character development was about a B+; I was able to feel personalities from most of the main cast.The problem here is the same that Terry Brooks suffered in the Genesis of Shannara series: there's just not enough to care about.  I didn't care about any of the characters except Lira, who wasn't really explored.  Part of this is because Renshaw went so many ways; this is a book that could easily be a third the length. There's that much ""fluff"" and it was dull.  It got to the point I speed read to the end just to get to the predictable outcome I totally expected.Main character is at first presented as just a kid with his friends.  Slavers sneak into the town; he tries to warn people but is ignored.  This was an interesting few chapters.  But then, he's in a cart being taken somewhere by his parents (this is the FIRST time we're hearing anything about parents, and we don't learn hardly anything about them except that his dad is a violent child and spousal abuser).  This felt like a forced attempt to make the reader feel something for Aedan; it didn't work on me.Then, the bulk of the book - and when I say ""the bulk"", if it's 639 pages long, I'd argue that the breakout is something like this:~50 pages with the first town and his friends~400 pages of just Aedan training to be a marshal and failing, while constantly being bullied by nearly everyone.  This segment was extremely DULL.The rest, random out-of-nowhere quests complete with deus ex machina event and no real resolution at the endThis is not what I expected.  I expected Aedan to be trained as a marshal, then thrown into battle fairly quickly; rough yet getting better.  I expected him to overcome his fears naturally and by confronting them - you know, like NORMAL people do - and not by some strange light.  I expected him to master his horse, which would become a loyal and trusted companion, not a terror to the town later completely forgotten.  I expected him to finally forge a sword worthy of song, one that people would later talk about.None of this happened.  It just...stopped.  And it stopped with Aedan no more a man, no more a warrior, no more a marshal, than when the book started.What also went unresolved:- Beef with Malik, never really explained or resolved- Emroy, who basically threw Aedan ""under the bus"" (this might be dealt with in the next book, but he was so sparingly mentioned in this one the reader doesn't have any idea what's to happen or why)- Ilona's strange ""not when my friends are around"" behavior (Aedan theorizes, but there's never a full 100% explanation of it)- WHY Peashot feels a need to shoot things- WHY Lorrimer freaked out in the middle of combatI give the author major credit for not writing the equivalent of a short story and for writing so well, but too long is too long.  I also would have preferred more closure, more definitive action, and more resolution than what I got.Small side note for the author: the book does not paginate properly on Kindle because the chapter headers are images, not text (KDP tells you this is a no-no).  Thus, when you want to go to a ""chapter"", it just lists the first sentence, not the chapter number.  If you update this book, please do at least include basic text with chapter segments appropriately, so it's easier on Kindle readers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ZMQMHQFP05W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV63K22#wasThisHelpful","R39ZMQMHQFP05W","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm reviewing the last book first, because it's supposed to be a culmination from the series.  I felt dissatisfied, and here's why.The first couple of books are slightly dark.  There is failure.  There's heartache.  There's stress.  There's death.The last book has a bit of stress, and nothing else.Pairings of couples, friendships, even stories told are not wrapped up in this book.  The author essentially throws away everything that came before, as if he started off telling one story but somewhere along the way decided to tell a completely different one.  It felt like he was trying to tell the reader that ""everyone's got a little evil and a little good in them"", but it ended up like ""we're here, but yeah, we can't do what we came to do and everyone who was mad, is no longer.""Irrelevant characters are brought in, for no reason.  Here, it felt like someone told the author, ""hey, I read books 1-5 and uh, they don't feel like YA stories.  You need more child-relatable characters!"" so then he throws in a barkeep, a mage, some farmers, and some kids, but doesn't really do much with any of them except the mage, a character that simply makes NO sense.Plot holes are all over the place - Percy walked off mad and vowed revenge, then nothing.  A wooden arm is ""critical"" to Sleag's Quest, but only so he can see an arm that looks like it and know what to do?  Sleag and Danagh are constantly carrying boatloads of weapons around only to leave all but one behind every time?  What about the weapons Danagh left in the tree?  Bree can talk to animals yet only does so once in the whole book - well, what's the point of her having the skill if it's not to be used after that?  And what about ""Danagh's Quest""?  The ultimate cliffhanger.I don't know if Hayes was compelled to ""hurry it up"", but I was not pleased with this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZUXSO9LNUYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0I5V0Y#wasThisHelpful","RNZUXSO9LNUYP","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike others, I didn't get this stuff to fill a dog bed (IMO, that's too much money for such a use case when you could just buy a replacement dog bed for the same price, but I digress).No, on a recent trip I stayed at a hotel that had quite frankly the perfect pillows. They never got too hot, never got too soft, had perfect neck support, and my head didn't sink too far down.  I'd never had a pillow so comfortable, and believe me, I've gone through many types: down (""Poker face"" anyone?), down alternative (sore neck anyone?), memory foam (breaks down when hot), water base (half of it too firm), shredded memory foam (either too hard or too soft), cervical (OUCH)...A previous patron had ripped a corner of one of the pillows (clearly, as curious as I was what the stuffing was).  Come to find out it was this stuff, though I didn't know it at the time.  Google was key here.So I bought a 5 lb bag and some zippered pillow protectors.  Didn't want to bother sewing up a pillow and have it fall apart over time.  These were King size protectors, and I would estimate that 3lbs was needed to properly stuff one of them.  Which means for two King size pillows I didn't have enough, and this concerned me.  Usually I have to sleep with two stacked pillows due to the issues above, but not here.When properly stuffed, one King pillow was the same height as two pillows which worked perfectly for my neck.  It was firm enough to support my head, but not so firm as to be painful.  My head sinks down roughly halfway and just waits for blissful sleep.  Less stuffing can be used for a softer pillow, but then you get the ""down alternative"" effect where your neck will suffer.  It also didn't seem possible to ""overstuff"" the pillow, which was nice.  It remained breathable no matter what.I know pillows are a subjective thing, but I strongly recommend trying this if you've had issues finding a good pillow out-of-the-box.  Might be that you have to just knuckle down and stuff your own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OJ82477XVJAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OUP6JE#wasThisHelpful","R2OJ82477XVJAS","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will make updates to this review over time.  It is difficult to know things such as quality, durability, heat retention, and flexibility of the piece without sleeping on it for a good deal of time. I purchased this to help make my Casper mattress a bit more comfortable.  While that mattress is basically a memory foam mattress, and while it touts great heat dispersion and durability, The problem is that it suffers from the same challenges that all memory foam mattresses do : when it receives a certain amount of heat, it breaks down and gets weak.  This causes you to sink into the mattress, into a dented space, which wreaks havoc on your back, sides, and legs. I've been sleeping on this topper for a couple of days now. I can say with confidence that it's a lot easier to fall asleep than it was without it.  The top layer is a down alternative, plush and comfortable.  There's a foam middle pad just beneath the down top layer, then a gel layer at the bottom.  The gel layer is rigid enough that you will not dent into the mattress beneath unless if you weigh more than the rated amount for the mattress in the first place.At first, the topper did not feel all that comfortable compared to the regular mattress, but my body adjusted quickly.I get hot at night, especially my lower body, but this never got overly warm or uncomfortable. It seemed to do a great job separating the heat from my body. Note that this is not a cooling mattress; the heat will just flow away from you which has the net effect of keeping you cooler. Time will tell whether this continues to be the case as I sleep on the topper. This does not come with any sort of fitted corners or extra fitted sheet, so you will need to add your own.  It's just the topper. Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280CQAS7430Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PR1FVW#wasThisHelpful","R280CQAS7430Z8","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"tl;dr: This works, despite the price shock.  But the vendor should consider different hardware options.Upfront: I am not, and have never been, a smoker.  I don't believe I suffer from COPD.  But I diagnosed with asthma as a kid, inherited from my mother, or so I was told.  I used to carry a Proventil (albuterol sulfate) inhaler around, just like she did.  And truthfully, I was wheezing and coughing, but not nearly as frequent as her.  Mine usually had to be triggered by exertion.  It was no fun being one of the fastest sprinters in high school, only to resort to a coughing fit that would last for a long time.When I hit my 20's, all of a sudden the asthma was nearly non-existent.  I had to really push myself running or lifting or climbing to get it to trigger and even then it never lasted.When I hit my 30's, the asthma came back but in the form of chest tightness, seemingly all the time.  By now I was nowhere near in the shape I used to be, being 30-40 pounds heavier and not nearly as defined.  Being in Washington State seemed to make this worse, and I don't know why, but I suspect it's the lack of sun, and the humidity at times.Robitussin Peak Cold Cough and Chest Congestion DM, 8-Ounce seemed to always help this, so I figured it had something to do with phlegm.  I started a regimen of RidgeCrest Clearlungs Extra Strength, Homeo/Herbal Decongestant , 120 Veg Capsules, which worked, but took hours to kick in and required taking them every 4 hours constantly.  Not fun.  If it was decidedly bad at night I would turn to good old Vicks Vaporub Cough Suppressant Topical Analgesic Ointment 1.76 Ounce,  (Pack of 3), which worked, but is extremely messy and has to be re-applied constantly.On a whim I decided to give this a try as it made rather large claims, but the ingredients seemed to match those you'd find in basic oils + Robitussin (expectorant) + ClearLungs (oxygenium) plus Vicks (menthol), but deployed directly into the lungs in atomized form.  You can do the same thing with an ionizing mister, but with a lot wasted.In my case it did come charged and I haven't had to charge it yet.  After application, I noticed the pressure in my chest wasn't there anymore.  I didn't cough at all as the instructions indicated.  But it did trigger me to clear my throat a couple of times, and it was the same effect as if you take Mucinex Maximum Strength 12-Hour Chest Congestion Expectorant Tablets, 42 Count - clear, thin, easy to cough or spit out.No effect with my nasal passages, at least not a noticeable effect.  And yes, I tried exhaling both via mouth and nose.I further tested this the best way I knew how: singing.  And I was able to sing songs that gave me trouble, better than before.  Louder, more powerful.  No shortness of breath after multiple tracks which would usually be the case.So, to summarize the experience, it does work and it didn't take several days.  Also, despite some of the other reviews, my version of the instructions seems to indicate that they re-engineered the tank cartridge.  It no longer needs coil replacement, with a life of approx. 6 months.  Having never used a vaporizer before, I hope that helps someone.First negative.  While they tell you how long to hold your breath, they don't give any sort of guidance as to how many times to repeat.  I would argue that if there's expectorant in the solution, it's probably not good to do this too many times per day.  I don't know for a fact.  I can say that I did feel nauseous after the first day's treatment, and I did it 5 times in a row.  This is with the mild that comes pre-loaded.  It says ""half a Pyrex tank to a whole one"", but there's no way to measure this against the pre-loaded solution, so I ignored it.Second negative is that you have to essentially disassemble the thing to charge it.  I'm not sure why they didn't just put the charging port on the bottom of it for easy access.  I assume it was to block use of the product while charging, but why not just implement an electronic kill switch that disables the device while charging?  This can be done.Third negative is that it requires a proprietary charging cable.  I would rather they just include the screw-on piece with a micro-USB opening, and include the cable as a detachable.  That way, it doesn't matter if the cable gets lost; I've got at least 10 micro USB cables around the house and they're cheap to buy on Amazon.  As is, if you for whatever reason lose the charger (and it's small enough that I can see this potentially happening at a hotel or something), you're screwed and have to go back to the vendor.  What if the vendor goes out of business?  Screwed.  (if you're concerned about the solution, don't be.  As I said, it's comprised of commonly available oils, and it's not a stretch to replicate if need be.  But the charger part is of greater concern.)Fourth negative.  While it is effective, considering the hardware at play here, I consider it grossly overpriced.  Let me explain.  The bottles are $40 each separately, you get three of them in the case, so technically you're already at $120, so they're charging only $20 for the vaporizer.  A deal, right? Except that as I said, the solution is comprised of widely available common oils that collectively, one could buy for much less $40.  This is where I feel it's overpriced; the bottle solutions.  $15 a bottle to me is more acceptable (which has profit in there but not gross overprofit), at which point, you're down to $45, add $20 on the vaporizer then add profit, Come to $89.99.  Or, sell the vaporizer with ONE solution bottle and do the pad I put above, come to $69.99 as an alternate option.  I find that much more tolerable.  Personal opinion.  The mild was more than effective anyway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5CYK8KHQC8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXDNLJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2H5CYK8KHQC8I","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me be clear.  The stuff works.  But you need to be aware of some things.First the default pack gives you four tablets.  That's it.  Nearly $15 each.  We're talking tablets the size of Alka Seltzer here.  That's called a ripoff.  I could forgive the price of each tablet lasted a full 24 hours; they don't.  Each lasts 2.5 hours.  Means you'll need all four if you do a cross country trip.Seconds there's nothing magical in these that would help justify the cost.  They're basically multivitamins with one thing added: pycnogenol which is basically an antioxidant, readily available everywhere for under $10.In other words, if you took pycnogenol with a Starbucks Refresher, you'd get the exact same effect, flute a fraction of the cost.Now, besides cost.  I don't think it tasted all that good, either.  Think Airborne, or Kool-Aid with no sugar.Effective?  Sure, but remember, it's not a cure, it just delays the effect.  If you do one tablet for a three-hour flight, you'll feel energized and fully functional that day, but come that evening (I estimate about 12-15 hours), you will knock out.  The idea is to get you through the day, say if you're fresh off a redeye flight but have a meeting or something.  You could of course keep taking the stuff, but your body benefits from the sleep, so it isn't really recommended.Something else to more, at least from my experience, is that it appears to conflict slightly with Dramamine.  Nothing serious, but I usually take the non-drowsy version; taking 1Above and the non-drowsy seemed to result in the same effect as taking the normal Dramamine.  Woosy after an hour.  Totally unexpected.  This is after sleeping for 6 hours.Anyway, those are my thoughts on the stuff.

"As a purveyor of fine shaving products, I decided to give the Shaving Powder a try, mostly to try and deal with ingrown hairs that show up on occasion.First the powder bears an eerie resemblance to cocaine.  It also will get all over the place no matter how cautious or careful you are.  It's not hard to clean up, but it's annoying.Second the container is not X-ray friendly, so despite the fact that it's a powder which is normally allowed through TSA, the cannister might cause them to stop you.  When they open it and see what appears to be cocaine, they may very well proceed to frisk you.  A very easy way to address this issue is for the manufacturer to consider a different container style, ideally one that is transparent and just screws on like any other cannister.Speaking of screw on, the container is difficult to open without a flat edge of some kind.  I use a multi-tool that has a small metal cutting edge, then I don't completely re-close it afterwards; it's closed enough that it keeps it fresh but not so much that I can't re-open it by hand.  Again, a different container would help this a lot.Mixing the powder and water is the worst.  Of the total time it takes to complete the process I would say that mixing is the great majority of time, even more so than the set time.  I really wish there were a way to just have a ""micro blender"" or something that could blend this faster.I've left it on for 10 minutes without issue.  I wipe it off with a damp, hot towel while I'm in the shower, then proceed to wash my face with a scrub.  Afterwards I go lightly over the area with a safety razor downward.  The hair that doesn't get removed via the towel (I'd say roughly 30% does not) falls off easily with this method.  I'm left with a baby smooth surface.  This additional step seems only necessary with my face.  If I use the powder on my body, the hot towel seems to get 95% of the hair off.  Longer, fine hair, best results.  Short, coarse hair, not so much.Good stuff and the value of this 12-pack was awesome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRUWJOY27YLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KOJOWQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XRUWJOY27YLS","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think some people don't really understand coffee.  By that, I mean that there is a science to brewing coffee correctly.  Of course, how the beans are harvested and roasted and whatnot matter for the flavor of it all (Starbucks, as an example, is too roasted and tastes burnt), but when you're sitting down to have a cup you really need to have the right components.Bulletproof Coffee's claim to fame is that it's organic.  That's it.  There are a lot of fancy words on the packaging and on the Bulletproof website, but at the core, the coffee is grown organic with no additional chemicals.  That means that you're getting a maximized antioxidant effect out of the coffee.  All coffee has antioxidant properties when drunk in moderation; how much depends on the chemicals, the growing, the harvesting, the roasting, etc.  So please, don't think this is some magic coffee with stuff added to it to make it superpowered; it's not.That said, there's nothing wrong with organic coffee.Tastewise I felt that the coffee fell just short of Starbucks: burnt but not overly so like theirs.  I did like that it was ground coarse rather than fine (Starbucks is ground fine and it's annoying when not using paper filters, for example), and I did appreciate the smell.  It's a Columbian roast, not too light and not too dark.  Some might feel the coffee is weak; I don't.  I use two heaping teaspoons which suits me just fine.  One teaspoon was like water, three teaspoons was...well, like Starbucks. Disgusting.One annoyance for the packaging.  It uses just a sticker to reseal the bag rather than what everyone else does with a metal bend.  Not sure who thought this was a good idea but it's a failure.Second annoyance for the packaging, the bottom is in an ""X"" shape rather than a box-shape.  This means there will always be coffee grounds stuck in that crevice when you start to run out that you can't get to.  A small thing, but I point it out.I usually blend this coffee with unsalted butter, half-and-half (I have to have cream in my coffee, I can't just have butter), Bulletproof Brain Octane Oil - 16 oz., and a drop of Vitamin D Drops - 2oz Liquid D3 5000 IU Per Dropper - 100IU Per Drop - Best Absorption - Natural Vit D Supplement Treats Deficiency for Baby, Kids and Adults - Boost Your Immune System, Fight Fatigue Naturally.  Seems to help with energy - it's not a magic elixir or anything.  I have to supplement this with a can of Starbucks Refreshers Variety Pack, 12 Ounce Slim Cans, 12 Pack, which is where my focus and sharpness come from.I read reviews online about people making a similar blend and having it curb hunger.  Not me.  If anything I end up quite a bit more hungry than I normally would within 2 hours, guaranteed.  It's not good to drink too much coffee, so I only have one cup of this per day.I also read about people losing weight drinking the coffee.  Again, not here.  If I lose weight it's because I'm purposely eating foods designed to do that.  This doesn't help me lose weight because, again, it doesn't curb my hunger, it makes it worse.These are my personal experiences.  Your mileage may vary.  I still order it and I still enjoy it if only for the energy and wakeup power it gives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PSA4DIVE0B2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8E0RDS#wasThisHelpful","R2PSA4DIVE0B2Z","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this adapter somewhat in a hurry as I was on business travel and had forgotten the charge cable for my work-issued iPhone.  Tim Cook and Steve Jobs with their mission to keep people using proprietary adapters isn't my thing - I have at least 6 microUSB cables, 2 of which are with me at all times.

But it's what the company issues, so I'm stuck with it.The adapter is tiny, and I can see how it would easy to lose this thing.  I really wish they would have included some sort of small chain or loop so that you could attach it to keys or a lanyard.

I did not try data connection directly, but I did notice that I couldn't get USB tethering working.

"But it didn't.See, I'm a Magic Shave Shaving Powder Gold - 4.5 oz user.I had to take a business trip and didn't want TSA groping me after assuming it was cocaine or something (the powder looks a LOT like illicit drugs, unfortunately).  The canister also was not very X-ray friendly.  I was going to buy some after I arrived at the destination, but because the powder works so well, you really only need to use it like every 2-3 days or so, which would have been a waste to sit there mixing so much for so brief a trip.  So I got the cream, figuring it'd be the same.It wasn't.First, the instructions tell you to apply it thick.  But the cream is so watery that it just didn't want to apply like that at all.  Not for nothing, because even with what it did apply, I got some removal.  Nowhere near what the powder did with the same instructions.The real issue is that it burned the living (blank) out of my neckline just below my beard line, where the bend is when you look down.  And yes, I used a pre-shave, and no, I didn't wash my face before hand.  A red, swollen line right across.  It looked like I'd been hanged - and being African American that's not a look you want to go for.For some reason, I had no redness or burning anywhere on my beard area.  I'm not sure why there was this reaction, the area in question was constantly exposed to the powder version with no ill effects.  I'm thinking it was the crease itself that the cream just overreacted to, though I'm not sure why.So on the first hand, it didn't really work that good, and on the second it burned the living (blank) out of me.

"And I was impressed, just not for the price (thus the one star knock off).  Don't let that deter you if all you want is a way to keep an eye on things and be alerted to (other) things.PRO: The setup was very simple.  A caveman could do it.CON: Such a small device literally requiring a cable is a turn-off.  That this does not have a Li-Ion battery and support recharging is simply a joke, I'm sorry.  Now, you might say ""but then how would you charge it if it's mounted somewhere?!"" Easy - I would buy 4 or so of the portable recharge packs and just swap between them every week or whatever while the others are recharging.  The value of doing this is that when mounting it somewhere that is not readily accessible to a power outlet (for example, the ceiling), I don't have to care about buying extension cables BUT I could charge the thing.  Something this size should be able to hold a charge for at least a week if not longer.  Might seem like an additional maintenance routine, but at least provide the choice for those that don't want cables everywhere.PRO: The video quality is great.CON: Why do you have to tap anything to ""improve quality"" when zooming in?  This doesn't make sense, the camera should automatically assume improved quality since - SHOCK - the only reason one would zoom in is to get a CLEARER LOOK at the target!  This is clunky and silly.PRO: The alerts give you enough to know when something's going on.CON: As with most other cameras it's picky about lights and shadows.  So it lets you pick a zone where you want to detect movement, the problem is if light from a window runs across that zone as the sun moves, the camera detects this as motion and sends false alerts.  It's annoying, because you can't tell the camera how to properly identify true motion even though it's pinned down to a specific region only.PRO: It's versatile enough to mount nearly anywhere.CON: The drywall anchors provided didn't accept the screws at all.  As a result mine is mounted precariously.  A better design would have included a center mount screw, no drywall mount, and drywall anchors as part of the back plate (not separate) that you just drive the screw through and into the wall, so that the screw itself creates the hole that the anchor goes into, while the center screw allows you to at least keep the thing up there while getting the mounting done.PRO: it picks up audio quite nicely.  I was able to hear sounds from downstairs, which is what I wanted.CON: Because the microphone is amplified there is a ton of white noise in the background, so it's hard to detail exactly what you're hearing unless it's a car going by on the street outside.  Would it have killed someone to implement some cleanup here?  It's called noise gate, it's not hard.PRO: You can tell the camera not to detect, dependent on the location of your phone or tablet.CON: This is GPS dependent, meaning that of course, it's not going to be fine enough detail to know if you're in one room vs. another.  It will know if you're in one building vs. another, yes.  If that isn't what you wanted, well, you're kinda SOL.  I'm not sure why this bothers me so much, but it does.PRO: You can tell the camera not to detect during certain times of the day.CON: The issue here is that it assumes such times are static OR that you would combine this with the location detection (so for example, if you're in the home, it doesn't detect but if you're not in the home, it does).  But say I'm in the office.  I don't want it detecting.  I can't use the location setting (see above), and I might be in the office any of the 24 hours in a day, so I can't use the time setting.  So ultimately I have to manually disable alerting while I'm in the office, which is annoying.Again, pros and cons.  I think I can recommend some improvements, if the ""Director of Customer Relations"" for Dropcam is still paying attention.- Rather than location based and/or time based detection disable, consider making your app more useful: when your phone is in range of the camera (and it will know that it is once it's joined the same WiFi hotspot), tell the app to prompt the user to disable the alerts because you're on the same network now.  Let the user choose (A) disable now, (B) disable for a period of time, or (C) don't disable now but prompt again in (X) minutes/hours/days.  That's better than nothing, or until we can get a technology that is smarter than wireless and shorter range than Bluetooth that would allow for more intuitive management.-  If you're going to pitch a ""wireless"" camera, make sure it's truly ""wireless"" in every way.  Figure out a way to power this thing without having to have it plugged in 24/7.  I'm sure you can do it, I've got hallway lights that use 4 AA batteries and last for over a month before I have to replace them, so I'm almost certain it's possible to do the same here.- Noise gate.  Figure it out.  You can detect movement, why not detect sound and THEN play it rather than just blaring a bunch of static noise?","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6JRDE139JK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9FCW7K#wasThisHelpful","R1L6JRDE139JK7","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does it work?  Yes.Is it the most effective?  No.  Well, maybe not.See, I've been using this for a bit and I found that it's really just an underpowered application for managing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  In fact, following the directions given will yield no results.  I apply it like I would an aftershave, and that seemed to have better performance.But coming from a world of using products such as Bump Patrol, I found that the Tend Skin product took longer to do anything and when it did start working, required multiple daily applications to remain effective.  Bump Patrol, on the other hand, is/was so effective that applying it in the morning of Day 1 resulted in significant improvements in the shaved (or unshaved) area by the morning of Day 2.  Less frequency of application, lasts longer.  The only downside of Bump Patrol is it's a lot messier than this stuff.Perhaps that's why this bottle is so much larger; they knew you'd have to apply a lot more to get the same effect.Unfortunately, Amazon refuses to carry Bump Patrol directly for some reason, so it's either get it from a local store or get ripped off by a third party marketplace seller.UPDATE: Bump Patrol is now properly carried by Amazon, and not a moment too soon.  I noticed myself growing annoyed with Tend Skin.  It just takes too long to work.  With Bump Patrol I can apply it fresh in the morning even over existing bumps, the next morning they're completely gone.  Tend Skin takes days of applying it 3 times a day before you get an effect if you're applying over existing bumps.  It works better as a preventative than it does a cure.  But Bump Patrol does both, faster.Maybe it's more effective on certain skin types than others.  Wasn't effective enough for mine.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14O89XUUCA9EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ECQ7G4#wasThisHelpful","R14O89XUUCA9EG","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:45 MinsI purchased this mat to replace an old mat I bought in 2012 rather suddenly after a move where I needed a new desk.  The old mat was extremely thin and flimsy; it felt sturdy in the store but when I got it home and under a chair, it was an entirely different story altogether.I had concerns over buying this mat because my carpet was not something I installed.  I wasn't sure if it was too plush or not plush enough.Receiving the mat and seeing it rolled into a box was a bit concerning given those that mentioned cracking, but when I released the tie, it folded into nearly flat in an instant.  It's a good deal larger than my old mat - the perfect size - and felt durable and solid.  Now, sitting on it with a chair I recently bought to replace the old one, it's a lot easier to move around and I don't see the dimpling effect seen with thinner mats.  It does sink in, so it's not like the glass ones where you don't sink in at all, but it's a lot less pronounced, and once you roll away from a spot, you can't tell the chair was ever there.I did not experience the sliding phenomenon that others encountered.  I don't know if that's the carpet thickness being just right, but I assume this to be the case.  I actually slightly injured myself on one of the barbs, they're that sharp.I attached some photos so you could see how mine is placed and the material.

"What a messy affair.  Styrofoam particles all over creation, poor stack methodology in the boxes, interdependent parts...This is all over the place with how it's laid out.  First, each of the two cabinets are in separate boxes BUT each has pieces that are in the center box.  You can't even get started unless you assemble the center desk first yet the instructions tell you to start with one of the cabinets.  That's normally not an issue, but the center desk has WAY more pieces than the sides, so I wanted to get the cabinets out of the way first.Second, there the labeling on each of the part bags is illogical.  They just have inconsistent labeling.  On one of the cabinets they're labeled ""U/V"", for the cam bolt and the fastener.  On the center piece it'll be ""X/Y"" - for the EXACT SAME cam bolt and finisher.  And there still aren't enough, even combining the ones from all three components, if you plan on assembling this exactly the way it's shown (I didn't, because I didn't want the two side pieces for the monitor stand).Also, with so many components, on the larger pieces they refused to put the letter stickers on the face, putting them on the edge.  This made it EXTREMELY difficult to locate pieces because you're too busy rotating four edges to find what letter a piece is - rather than doing what they did on the smaller pieces which is to put the letter on the face (meaning only two sides).  Larger letter stickers wouldn't have hurt, either.  Some pieces didn't even have letters; they'd fallen off during shipping.Some pieces are the exact same dimensions, exact same drill holes, yet the instructions distinguish them separately.  If they're they're functionally the same piece LETTER THEM THE SAME so it's clear it doesn't matter which panel you use!The material which appears to be laminated particle board which fractured way too easy when hand screwing in the cam bolts.  It's required to use a power driver if you want to avoid damage.Lastly - and most importantly - the instructions are needlessly complex.  The pictures are difficult to follow, and the reversible drill pattern makes following along and getting the right side showing harder than it should be.  They're basically telling you to build each cabinet, then build the center, then connect the three, which ends up being confusing because you jumping back and forth between part bags that are not lettered consistently. You also can't clearly tell the direction things are supposed to go.After attempting this method and failing twice, I eventually backed completely out and started over, manually matching the sizes of the drill hole to the part and then building from left to right, using the instructions only to tell me the size of the panel or the part needed for that stage (so start at left wall, attach back panel, attach right wall of cabinet, attach back panel, attach support panel for center, attach foot panel for center, connect foot panel for center, attach right support panel for center, attach back panel, then left cabinet wall, then back panel, then right cabinet wall, then accents, then drawers, then put the desk tops on).Doing it this way not only got me done faster, it made a lot more sense!  The only part that was tricky was the monitor stand, only because they designed it to require the two smaller side parts, even if you don't want them.  I had to drill two more holes to get the stand the way I want it because the predrilled holes don't work if you don't use the side parts.Speaking of backing out, heaven help you if you ever need to go backwards.  The problem I see is that the entire set is reversible: you can build the drawers to the left or to the right, but I don't see why that would be for a single set.  I'd rather they create different drill patterns for the component set but have this one be more strict, to minimize on errors.  As is you'll be left over with quite a few open holes as a result of this.I've assembled many a desk - including the old one - and I have never seen such unnecessary complexity.  Now that it's built I like the desk except for the laminate peeling that I'm seeing in places, and not due to my install. Also there's a weird coating on the desktop, when I went to clean it with a general purpose cleaner I've used for years, there was some residue the same color as the laminate.  I'm thinking it was a paint or a varnish or something, which means things will likely rub off over time.  Not good, but time will tell.Time to assemble?  I did it over three days and I didn't rush at all (I already had a desk and was doing it in spare time, with interruptions), so I'm going to assume about 12-15 hours.  If you have a couple of people assembling it likely wouldn't take nearly as long.  If you were dedicated on it you could probably knock it out in a day if you weren't interrupted.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DTZK7E9OHFKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009QXS1AI#wasThisHelpful","R3DTZK7E9OHFKB","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As anyone who read my review on the Sleep Better Iso-Cool Memory Foam Pillow, Gusseted Side Sleeper ,Standard, there is a constant war between my neck and my head.  I don't know why.  I assume something must have gone wrong with a chiropractic visit from 2013, but because it comes and goes I have never gone back to revisit.  However my quest for a proper sleep continues as I upgrade my bedding components piece by piece.  I think, after spending nearly $2,500 overall, that I might be close.I got this pillow initially as a second pillow - a body pillow that isn't - but then it occurred to me to at least try it for my head and neck comfort.  The pillow is longer than I expected.  It fit rather snug into king-size pillow cases that I got as part of a bed set I bought.  Snug meaning, of course, that it took me nearly 10 minutes to get it into the case.I was skeptical.  I pressed on the pillow and saw that it barely rejected my hand.  Thinking this was a mistake (I have another pillow with a similar design where it had no support whatsoever), I decided to chance it.  My head didn't go all the way down as my hand did; rather it went about 70% of the way and left a cushion that wasn't firm, wasn't soft, was just right for the back of my head (which often experiences pain due to the firmness of the pillows I've used).  What I found was that I was actually getting sleepy just laying on the pillow for a time.  Imagine that - a pillow that makes me want to sleep, rather than me forcing myself to sleep based on what time it is.If I had to describe the pillow in better terms, I would say that it feels like a pillow that you'd find at a Marriott hotel.There was a problem though, a minor one.  Another reviewer commented on how far down into the pillow you sink.  If you sleep on your back this isn't a problem.  In fact it might be appealing, because the sides of the pillow come up HIGH in this position, covering your ears.  But if you're a side sleeper, this created a bit of discomfort where it was covering my mouth.  I had to do this weird business where I laid down on my side, and then pressed down on the side that was coming up, somewhat to push air under my head.  It's hard to describe.  But it did work, and I was able to sleep that way without neck pain and without constantly tossing and turning.I'm going to give it some more nights to see if everything goes hunky dory.  If so then I'll know that I'm on the right track with this pillow.  So far so good though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84Q9Y4C8QIDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMRP9NI#wasThisHelpful","R84Q9Y4C8QIDJ","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I docked two stars for what I can consider quality issues with the stitching.  But I'll get back to that in a moment.First this set is visually awesome when combined with a matching bedframe.  I have a cherry wood platform bed and wanted to color coordinate with the frame.  It did this nicely.  Second, I did pick a larger size (King) than my bed (Queen) based on the fact that the platform is at least a foot wider than the rated size.  This proved to be a smart decision, as the comforter and skirt both fit near perfectly on the platform.I was not necessarily a fan of the raised pattern on the pillows.  For a side sleeper this will dig into your face.  I put a T-shirt over it to avoid this.Does not come with sheets or mattress cover, so you'll need to splurge on those for yourself (all the better.  You can find the texture that's most comfortable for you).When combined with the right lighting, the right bedframe, etc., this set looks like something you'd find at a high end hotel.  Very attractive, very comfortable, holds in heat well.I docked two stars because I noticed that near the foot of the comforter, where the velvet section is, there's a torn stitching.  I then noticed that there is a stitch pattern roughly every two feet up the comforter where it looks to have been done too tightly or something.  Velvet as a cloth is very prone to tearing (as anyone who owned velvet Vans back in the day can attest to), so I think it was a bad design decision to have stitching here.  The other parts of the comforter that are not velvet are a lot more durable and seem to handle this stitching fine, although it's a mystery what the stitching is actually accomplishing.  It's not for visual reasons that I can tell.If you buy the comforter be aware that your stitching may have torn in the velvet area.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUW8V44A3S8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9V63FU#wasThisHelpful","R3TUW8V44A3S8E","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't buy this to clone, rather to use an old SSD that I had from a previous laptop as an external drive.  I already had the 2.0 version of this cable and just wanted to upgrade to the 3.0 standard to take better advantage of the SSD speeds.  And yes, it's a notable difference in performance.  If you didn't know better, you'd swear the drive was installed into the laptop. It's that fast.Windows 8 does not require use of the CD, so don't worry if you don't have a drive.

"This was used on a Windows 8 (not 8.1) laptop that I've had for a couple of years.  I do have a condenser mic, but don't like its style.  I more prefer the XLR microphones, they're more mobile and suppress background noise much better.  I had a small preamp device that I bought from Best Buy, but it started to wig out and eventually died on me, so I was looking for something to replace it that wasn't overpriced.  The ICICLE seemed to fit the bill.It DOES work.  And yes, it's built rather fragile.  All plastic, unlike the photos would have you believe. That's not an issue.  The issue is that it's extremely underpowered, even for being a USB preamp.  The other one I had was also USB powered only, yet managed to be so strong that I could never max its volume.  It also had a headphone jack for monitoring and separate settings for phantom power and instruments.  The ICICLE has none of this.  I can live with that, but it's also underpowered.  I had to crank the input to max to even get any sound out of it.  That seems odd, because Windows shows the input as being over 200% which should normally be overkill.  Yet I could barely hear myself talk.I'm not suggesting to avoid this device, but make sure you temper your expectations about it.  It's not going to blow you away with audio quality or volume.  It'll do for most basic applications such as podcasting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RML506ZK6BZRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EW5YQS#wasThisHelpful","RML506ZK6BZRZ","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree that this is a very solid, very well built hand blender. In my case I'm blending beverages with partial solids (butter, for example), but I didn't want to have to wash out a blender pitcher.  This is small enough to fit into just about any cup, jar, pitcher or bowl.  It's also easy to clean because of it size.As noted, this is not really for batter mixing.  You could do it if it were, say, not-overly-thick pancake mix.  But the blade (which is not visible in photos) is too small to make enough of a centrifugal force if your mixture of whatever is too thick.As far as the unit itself, it's not light but not overly heavy.  The button is hold-down with two speeds.  I didn't find it too hard to press and hold, but I can see with the weight of the unit and the button style, someone with arthritis or muscular problems not being able to use this effectively.  If you're reasonably strong (i.e. you can handle a lawnmower and hold its handle down without letting go), you shouldn't have any problems whatsoever with the blender.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C1TVBVQEM5UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MMNAYE#wasThisHelpful","R1C1TVBVQEM5UU","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's not to say it doesn't work at all.  Just that it doesn't work nearly as well on coarse hairs that it does on fine hairs.  In other words, if you're wanting this for your back, legs, arms...you'll be largely amazed at how well it takes off hair.  You're unlikely to be impressed with groin, face, etc. where the hairs may be more coarse.For my case, I bought it for my face.  There, it took three treatments before I saw even the slightest hint of smooth, hairless skin. Even then, it still left stubble on the neck and under my jaw.  Comparing this with a safety razor where I could get these hairs quite easily, this was a bit depressing.  What it did do a good job of was minimizing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.A lot has been made of the mixing strategy.  Yes, it's pain.  But that's because the instructions are faulty.  If you mix the way it tells you on the can, not only will you be stirring forever, you'll end up with a very slimy, very inefficient solution that will make you think you got scammed. I'm going to help you.You need:- A mixing cup.  You can use any cup, or you can get official and get something like Edwin Jagger Porcelain Shaving Soap Bowl With Handle, Black- A spoon.  Or something else to stir with.  I prefer a spoon but it's up to you.- A shaving brush.  You can use your hand, but I strongly recommend against it. Just get a shaving brush.  Like Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush- A large towel - you'll use both ends. Or if you're not into messing towels up, consider something like Kleenex  Hand Towels Everyday, 60 Count where you can throw them away when done.- A preshave balm or lotion, or oil.  You want something that is NOT alcohol based.  Something like John Allan's Slick Water Lotion, 2 Ounce- Something to tame the skin afterwards.  Something like Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 mlMind you, the above are just recommendations.  Choose whatever products you want, just make sure they are comparable to the above.  Or don't use them, but be prepared to be frustrated with your results.First, to give you a sense of scale and scope.  A heaping teaspoon is enough for a grown man's entire face.  If you're doing legs, arms, chest, etc, bump it up to two teaspoons.  This is just to have enough when you're done mixing.  Next, your water ratio should be just enough to end up with a consistency between pancake mix and cake batter; not runny, but not overly thick.  You'll know it when you see it.  Imagine perfectly made oatmeal ""stick to the ribs"" style.  That's what you want.  So if you have a heaping teaspoon of powder, put maybe a barely full teaspoon of cool water in.  Then stir slowly using the spoon (or whatever).  It will look like it's not mixing; it is.  It just takes a while.Here's the hint: you'll know when you're almost done because you'll get hit in the face with a smell that I can't describe, but you'll know it for what it is.  If you've ever used NAIR, or any similar depilatory, it's the exact same smell.  Once that smell hits you, you'll notice the mixture getting thicker and it'll all make sense (finally).  Usually takes me about 2 minutes end-to-end.  If you end up with a consistency that seems watery, use a flat edge (i.e. a knife or something) and add a bit more powder, then continue to stir.  Conversely if it feels way too thick (like paste), add a half teaspoon of water and continue stirring.  After you do it once, you'll get the hang of it.Second, DO NOT do this after a shower or after washing your skin.  It should probably be the first thing you do after getting up on the days you do it (which is every other day, NOT once a day).  Why?  You want your skin to be oily, to have some coating to protect it, in addition to the preshave.  This is how you can get the best result without burning sensation.  So don't wait until after showering to do this.Now, prep your location.  By prep, I mean use the preshave, something that is designed to protect your skin from burn and irritation.  DO not use regular lotion, it won't do anything.Now, it's important to note that this, when mixed, is essentially a plaster.  It will go on wet and then dry, just like a cast.  That's okay.  But be prepared for it to ""flake"" everywhere.  Try not to move too much. You don't want to make a mess.Apply using the shave brush as if you were applying shaving cream or foam.  But go in strokes against the grain.  The goal is to lift the follicles and help the mixture do its thing. Make sure you get good coverage.  You'll notice that the bottom of the mixture looks dry; that's okay.  It'll still apply like a plaster.  But feel free to drip a bit of water in there if you're not sure.You'll need to wait between 7 and 10 minutes (depending on skin sensitivity) for the mix to work.  During this time, clean out your mug and shave brush.  The mixture should rinse rather cleanly in cold water, but the brush will take some hands-on help (it's safe).  Depending on how long it stays on you may or may not feel a tingle.  That's a good sign.  It should not burn.After the time has passed, this is where people get confused.  You can use a dull pseudo razor (like Pseudo Shaver), if you want, but I found much better results just using a warm, damp towel.  You can warm up the water while waiting for the mixture to dry, and if you use the disposables, have one that is your warm water towel and one that is your dry towel.  Or you can use a single towel that serves both functions.  Wipe the mixture off in firm, slow strokes against the grain.  Then clean the towel off and go back over the area vigorously to get the remainder.  Dry off with the other towel.  Finish up with the aftershave.If you did everything I noted above, you should see amazing results, with certain exceptions (I could never get the mixture to work at all above my mustache, it did 97% of the job in the groin area, and 99% of the work under my jaw).  Figure 15 minutes total time to do.  But again, you only need to do this once every other day minimum.  My arms have been smooth for three days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF92NFVT5NQML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048ZIFA0#wasThisHelpful","RF92NFVT5NQML","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right now, you're probably wondering why there is a nearly perfect split between ""This product WORKS!"" and ""This product made me sick!"".  So am I.  But I think it has more to do with the instructions.You're directed to take this twice a day, on an empty stomach.  Don't do that.  Instead, take it WITH food.  For some reason, this will upset your stomach like nobody's business if you take it on an empty stomach, even if you end up eating 20-30 minutes later.  For the longest time, I was wondering why I felt ill at work, then I switched up to taking it with breakfast along with my daily vitamin, and suddenly I was no longer feeling ill.As far as heart racing, there are some herbs and whatnot that your body will react to.  I know that this will increase your metabolism, otherwise it can't do its job, but I never experienced my heart going much faster than normal.  This might be related to other things being consumed with the product: if you take it with coffee, the caffeine might cause the behavior.  Same with sodas, fruit drinks, etc.  Drink just water, ONLY water.I am straightedge, so I can't speak to whether alcohol or cigarettes or anything similar has an effect.As far as results?  I lost 20 pounds across two months.  While that doesn't sound like a great deal, consider that the weight loss came without working out; I was already on a fairly strict diet and loosened up a bit ( there's only one food I won't eat.  Other than that I eat whatever I want, in moderation ).  Problem is, I had started the new diet right around the same time as taking Forskolin, so I have no idea whether it was a placebo effect and the diet was the real power.  I've been off Forskolin for two weeks now, and have not gained the weight back despite being able to polish off ribs, pizza, fries, breadsticks, etc.I can say that this made me less hungry.  I was eating less of what I would normally have eaten.

"GE Affiliates was kind enough to provide a sample of this charger for my review.  (Don't you hate reading a super long review only to end in a tiny sentence disclaimer?  I like to tell you UP FRONT that I didn't buy the thing.  I digress.)I echo the sentiments of others.  This is a very effective flashlight.  So much so that it has replaced an LED flashlight I got at Radio Shack about a decade or so ago that at the time was the brightest thing going (and it's still going, despite never having changed the batteries).  So there's that.  I mean this is like one of those cop flashlights they'd shine directly in your eyes as they walk up.As a charger I have not had heavy opportunity to use it, but I did use it to charge up another powerbank that I got from a convention.  I found that it charged admirably well.  It does have a light indicator to show you when it's charging (red) as well as when it's charging another device.  It does not have a power remaining indicator, but I've noticed that with the exception of Duracell and other ""battery"" companies, most powerbanks do not have a power level indicator for some bizarre reason.  It's important to note that this is not designed for you to charge a phone or a tablet while using it, and Apple saw fit to hack their iPads and iPhones so that they won't take a certain type of charge.  But I was able to charge my Dell Venus 8 Pro tablet, a Kindle Fire HD, and both of my Android phones without an issue (as long as I wasn't using them at the time).Battery capacity was also admirable.  You should be able to get about 50-60% charge if this is fully charged.  Depending on the device, that may not be enough.  If you're just needing a charge to make an emergency phone call, this will work absolutely fine.  In fact, under that scenario you can power your phone long enough to get the call done if you turn data off.The downside is that while the case feels sturdy and nice, the inside of it (as I was checking what the battery looked like) is reminiscent of some kid's junior high school electric shop project.  I mean loose wires, loose battery, loose USB females, etc.  It's appalling to look at, and I'm fairly certain that if you were to hand this to your kid, they'd say ""I built that in school!""  It's that bad.  As long as you don't ever open this thing, you can stand oblivious.I feel that it's well worth the price though, and if nothing else, it's a very impressive flashlight for when the lights go out.  Too bad you won't be able to see it in the dark.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQ7CHJ3DNHOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV5Q0WM#wasThisHelpful","R2MQ7CHJ3DNHOI","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"F&W Trading LLC was kind enough to provide a shower head for review.I normally like powerful showerheads.  The one I own was a spur-of-the-moment pickup from Sears that I can't find anymore.  I reviewed another shower head from F&W that I initially didn't care for as it wasn't strong enough but after a few uses, it has now become the gold standard.This AquaFlow showerhead has more functions than the other showerhead.  But there are two main things that hold it back from being better than it is.  First, I agree with other reviewers that the settings lever is much too difficult to move.  It doesn't take a strong man, it's the location; it just doesn't move well with a head this size.The second is the mist setting.  This the only standout setting on a showerhead because you don't find settings like it.  And yes, it does put out mist - the problem is HOW it does so.  It uses extra airflow to mist the water; the problem is that you lose about 80% of the heat you'd normally get from the water because of this.  In other words if you have a hot cup of water and you poured it in front of a fan blowing directly at you, it would mist the water and feel somewhat warm because it'd been cooled long before touching you.  Same thing here and it's unfortunate, because it otherwise does feel nice on the skin.The other settings are a center power spray (which I don't like because it only targets a single small area), rain/normal spraying, and ""off"", which still drips water out.The rain setting feels great though, and this would be a good fit in a secondary bathroom.  Unfortunately the head isn't big enough to unseat the primary one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KABG5M5LU1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0YUWXE#wasThisHelpful","R25KABG5M5LU1Q","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GPCT was kind enough to provide a watch for review.Unlike others, I found the band to be one of the most comfortable of any watch I've owned - and I've had plenty of them over the years.  In almost every other case, they snagged on arm hairs or didn't have enough fastener holes for my wrist.  This one didn't have the snag issue and it was able to fit perfectly.I love the look of the watch.  If you're the kind of person who misses the old school ""wind it up and it'll last until the next time"" watches, you'll favor this one.  There are no batteries here.  It also has an appearance that belies its price.Unfortunately, I picked it up one day and discovered that a small area of the glass face had shattered; a pinhole shatter that looks like stress damage.  The watch was never dropped or had anything impact it, so it's a bit odd that it would just shatter like this, but I know some dual pane windows do the same depending on the pressure of where they're at.  My area is in a slightly higher elevation, not sure if that was the cause.  But given that glass is extremely cheap, I was disappointed to see that thicker, more durable glass wasn't used here.  So the price matches the quality you can expect.In terms of functionality, I had no concerns.  It kept time so long as it was wound up, and part of me had fun winding it rather than worrying about batteries.  I love the look of it too.  But the glass randomly shattering is just not good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5MUKIB0SRJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWSMDM8#wasThisHelpful","R3V5MUKIB0SRJ8","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"F&W Trading was kind enough to send one of these to me for review.I am a big fan of powerful waterflow.  I really don't like weak shower output.  On the flip side, my water heater doesn't stay hot for very long depending on how much water is coming out.  I've tried waterfall/rainfall type showerheads in the past and ended up going back to my powerful one.After trying the AquaFlow, I wasn't satisfied with its power flow.  But it wasn't totally weak.  On a scale of 1-10, my current one is a 9.  This one is more like a 5.  It's not horrible, but not overly powerful.The one benefit it does have is that it puts out a lot of water, meaning it won't take nearly as long to get clean as it would on a smaller head.  Additionally, because of the size of the head, it addresses another concern I had which is the height of the shower head installed by the builder; I don't have to crouch down to get hit by the water, which is nice.Now, the downside of the water output is, as I said, the water heater seemed to run out a lot faster than I'm used to.  That may be due to the temperature outside, I'm not sure.  I think if you have a tankless system, this would be an awesome unit.  There's really nothing to describe getting hit by this spray on a nice hot shower.Overall I'm impressed with the unit, and the only thing I would suggest improving is the threading on the pipe fitter.

"F&W Trading was kind enough to provide a sample for review.I won't bore you with technical details.  This speaker is able to play music and handle phone calls.  I did not get to use the phone call feature since obviously, nobody would hear me anyway with the water running.  But it CAN do phone calls.  Or not.Pairing was not complicated, I was able to get up and running with music starting within a few short minutes after an initial partial charge.I think the charge time is excessive and ridiculous.  Over 2 hours to charge this when a Logitech Bluetooth speaker 4x this size takes an hour is illogical.  TO be fair, it does have a power save mode after a few minutes so it's not constantly running, but still.If you're an audiophile you may want to skip this guy.  While it does have loud sound and the sound is booming, it lacks fidelity and clarity.  It's hard to pick out fine details when the shower is going.  I make the assumption that phone calls might be a bit muddy as a result of this.  But it IS extremely loud, and in a shower, should echo off the walls nicely to create great (but not clear) sound.Caveats:- The suction cup does not work on fiberglass enclosures even if it's glass smooth.  Just doesn't.  It'll go on initially but will eventually fall off.  Glass it works perfectly, but very few people have a four-sided glass enclosure, so if you want it to face you (and thus be underneath the shower head), you'd need either glass or possibly porcelain.  I strongly doubt tile would work.- The volume buttons are specific to the device, not to the A2DP, meaning they don't control the source device's volume.  That's a bit annoying, because you have no way of knowing exactly what the device's volume will come through like.  It would be preferred to have this device simply control the source device volume which is part of the A2DP standard.Other than the above it's a solid device.  If they were to resolve the A2DP item and the audio fidelity, it'd be a much better device overall.  But still worth the purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R385R2RIWM5SXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O15BQC6#wasThisHelpful","R385R2RIWM5SXM","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like me, you likely read these reviews and figured this stuff is a scam.  IT really isn't.  But the key is to do it right AND HAVE PATIENCE.  If you don't do it right, you won't get growth, and if you don't have patience, you won't see it growing.Thing is, it works well.  I put photos up so you can see that it does work.  But it's a LOT of work.First, yes...this is a bunch of shredded up newspaper, feed, seed and a little bit of mulch.  It's packaged like insulation, very dense, in a brick-ish form and you have to break it up with your hands.  Don't worry, there's no harm from inhaling the little particles, though you may cough and/or sneeze doing so.  Your steps are as follows.- RAKE THE BARE SPOT THOROUGHLY.  This means break through the ground at least an inch or two.  You may have some thatch, get rid of it.  You want nice, bare soil.  If you have an aerator or a service that does aeration, it helps, but it's not enough.  You need to agitate the ground very well or this stuff won't take root properly.- The newspaper keeps moisture in and helps the seeds get more of the water over time; despite this, WATER UNTIL YOU SEE SLIGHT POOLING.  I know, online searches tell you not to do this.  So I didn't at first and saw no activity.  It wasn't until I did a slight pooling that I started seeing sprouts.  So just water the stuff, use a spray nozzle set to shower or a sprinkler system, doesn't matter.  (The key to knowing that everything is soaked good: the mix should turn a blue-green shade.)- This mix works in sun or shade BUT plants love sun.  Means if you're patching in a shaded area, it's not going to grow nearly as fast as a sunny one.  Take that into account when planning this.  It'll grow, but if you're in a rainy season, it's going to take a LOT longer.  If you're not patient then go another route.- I noticed faster growth when I didn't water every day - maybe once a week or so unless I was in an extended sun period and it wasn't a shaded area.  I went on business travel and when I came back, I had superior growth (photo).- It's unsightly.  It looks like cement if you don't know what you're looking at.  Take that into consideration when deciding which bare spots to use this on.  For now I'm targeting my back yard only, and now that I know it takes a really long time to take root, I may do something different for the front.- The color of the grass is likely to clash with your other grass.  There's nothing you can do about that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HLCRAVDPS56E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWUCH8G#wasThisHelpful","R2HLCRAVDPS56E","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The common theme with most of the reviews I read before the book came out read like one of three general summary statements:""Terry Brooks has lost his touch, this book is evidence of that, not even close to his earlier works.""OR""Great simple read, but I don't know that it's worth buying at this price.""OR""Just go back and read the Heritage series.  Thanks.""I don't think Brooks has lost his touch with this book.  If I had to pin it down, the flow of the book feels like he's been pressured to write a different kind of story for a different audience.  Which is perfectly fine; but I think Del Rey or whoever is doing the pressuring (assuming that theory is true) needs to allow him to do what he does best.  It's also likely that he just wants to please fans as much as he can and is going to end up alienating some of them no matter what he does.  Even Shawn Speakman wasn't glowing with his forum review of the book, which is telling.  He didn't bash it, but he was clear that it's not going to appeal to everyone.Now that you have some summary, the thing with High Druid's Blade is that it feels like a much, MUCH better written version of another book I read from a different author, Elseerian: The Second Draeken War #1 (The Chronicles of Lumineia).  Taken from the angle of someone who's read (and owns) every other Shannara book there is, I never at any time felt that I had to go back and refresh my memory of anything.  Enough is restated that you get the sense of what's going on without being overbearing; this in itself is an impressive feat given how much there is to know about what came before Paxon Leah and the Sword.As usual, Brooks showcases his excellent storytelling prowess throughout the book and clearly has mastered the English language.  Unfortunately, as with every Shannara book starting with the High Druid series onward, there is a very clear lack of character development with the exception of Arcannen.  Even he isn't fleshed out nearly as well as earlier Shannara works, and this is disheartening, since Brooks does these types of descriptions very well.  Take, for example, his description of Menion Leah and his background, which takes up nearly two pages in The Sword of Shannara, and is capped off with the following:""Dressed in a multicolored cloak and vest of green and pale yellow, his lean, whiplike frame moved with the graceful ease of a cat.  He was not a big man, though several inches taller than the Valemen, but he was broad through the shoulders and his long arms gave him a rangy look.""In those two sentences alone the reader gets at least a general picture of Menion Leah when he first meets Shea and Flick, and it is this ability that drew me to Brooks in the first place.  That skill hasn't been used heavily since the Voyage trilogy.  It's not on display here, at least not as well detailed.I will say it's better of a read than A Princess of Landover by a very wide margin, and I never found myself bored with the book.  It's just not as thrilling as the Heritage trilogy, not as detailed as the Sword trilogy, and not as ""different"" as the Voyage trilogy (those analogies, of course, are directed toward those who have read other Shannara books).If you're new to Brooks or Shannara, I don't think the book will keep you interested.  Even though it's written to allow newer readers to enjoy the story, Paxon will come across as bland if you were never exposed to the other Leah members.  Aphenglow was never interesting to begin with and she won't be here, and there's nothing here that screams ""must read"".  It's good for what it is, and the score is reflective of that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RTCFG36I7WH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPTK4KY#wasThisHelpful","R1RTCFG36I7WH3","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I write this review after having completed book 4 and started book 5.  I do note that this and book 3 are getting negative reviews and frankly, I don't think they're deserved.  Missing proofreader?  Absolutely.  Tons of grammatical errors?  Certainly.  Improper use of verbs and nouns?  Definitely.  So drop a star off and be done with it.  Three stars is harsh, because the thing is this author definitely has the gift of storytelling.  It catches you, and makes you want to find out what happens next - and that's hard to consistently do in a series.Book one introduces Flare, who is of royal descent.  Without spoiling the story, Flare ends up leaving his kingdom to join the Guardians, who are sworn knights of a neighboring country.  The Guardians are then placed in a live-or-die situation that defines that happens next.I did have a few issues with the story.  First, the beginning part with his kingdom is totally glossed over: there's an early scene with an escort that you hope will be explained later, and it's somewhat alluded to but you really have to take a leap of faith as to what's going on.  There are no ramifications to Flare leaving the kingdom, at least not that I can tell, and he never goes back to revisit any of the people who helped him become a Guardian (with the exception of one person that he competed against).  In other words, it felt as though the author was trying to hurry up and get to the Guardians section and spend as little time as possible fully developing Flare early on.  We also never get a sense of consequence for what he's doing.Second, there are character interactions late in the story that feel random and contrived.  There's a death, and though we see a reaction to that death, it's totally blown off in later books of the series.  We don't get that sense that the death was life defining.  Trying desperately not to spoil things, but the actions in later books contradict the emotion that the author was attempting to evoke with the death in this book; goes to a lack of continuity and story flow.Lastly, there are too many sub characters. The author had so much difficulty developing Flare that it spilled over into the development of the other characters.  It's extremely challenging putting a face to each person and how they fit into the larger picture.  You know certain characters are warriors, certain others can use magic, some are female and some are male.  Beyond that, you just don't feel invested in the rest of the team.  It's as though their sole purpose is to have Flare not be a vigilante.There is an underlying plot that is reasonably well developed, and it is this plot that makes the reader want to continue with the series.  It's never blatant, never given away, just enough that you hunger for more.  If the author were to work on their character development and continuity, they would have a tremendous story on their hands. Regardless, it's worth the read if you can overlook the above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2HEKVC3Z1WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Z13UO0#wasThisHelpful","RT2HEKVC3Z1WU","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was rather shocked to find that there are absolutely no studs whatsoever behind the drywall that's above the fireplace.  Seems rather odd, especially since the chute and other things must certainly be there, and my old place had an entire wood panel directly behind this area specifically for mounting.  So I wanted to get something that would be compatible with my existing setup and stumbled across these.There are a couple of things you should know.  First, you'll need a 1 1/4"" drill bit.  You'll also need a power drill that is large enough to make use of that drill bit.  If you don't have those, buy them.  This kit does not come with anything you need to drill the hole or widen existing holes, and you'll need to make the hole large enough for the slide-in bracket.  In my situation, I don't have the power drill in question nor was I inclined to pay nearly $100 for it (renting was out of the question), so I used a drywall saw, marked four quadrants, and sawed an opening that was large enough, though not perfectly circular.  Worked perfectly (pun intended).Next was to slide in the rear brace.  This is where it got confusing.  When you get the package, these are already inserted into the slide in bracket but they're upside down; you want the flat side marked UP to be facing you, not the other way as the default packaging has it.  The slide-in bracket has two side ""arms"" that have teeth; these teeth act like a ratchet for the rear brace to slide in and then lock in place when you have it in the wall.  So you have to exert extra effort getting the rear brace out and repositioned so you can install it.Using the hook to hold the rear brace in place and then ratchet it into position was a SERIOUSLY frustrating endeavor.  If you don't have tons of insulation in that wall, you risk dropping the rear brace because again, it has to ratchet into place, and if you happen to lose grip somewhere...Last, the whole setup is dependent on you actually hanging the mount, because you'll need to do the screws after the mount is up, through the existing mount holes.  Problem with that is, since you can only do one side at a time, the rear brace is stuck at an angle and you have to gently screw it in to get it to line up and squared, crossing your fingers that it doesn't detach and fall into the wall.Once hung it seems quite sturdy.  My 50"" flat panel hasn't budged, and that's with only two hooks.I would like to see them re-design this unit to be not only a bit more secure pre-install, but also not be dependent on the hook part.  Maybe a spring-loaded version that uses the same type of ratcheting system, but include a twist screw to get it lined into place more squarely so that it can be screwed to the mount without concern.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPD7FNHG78BTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MWIMSK#wasThisHelpful","RPD7FNHG78BTP","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First I want to say that this technology is tremendous in concept, and in truth it DOES work as described.  Some people don't understand the difference between this and the Chamberlain CIGCWC Internet/Smartphone Connectivity Kit for Chamberlain Garage Door Openers - The biggest difference has to do with how old your garage opener is.  If it's a Chamberlain that already has myQ technology, you only need the Gateway.  If you have a Chamberlain that does NOT have the myQ technology, you need the Internet Connectivity Kit.  With the Connectivity Kit, it replaces your panel to one that can be controlled by the gateway (it comes with both a replacement panel and the gateway).  With the newer openers, the panel is already myQ enabled.  But you need to add the gateway in order for the internet to see it.  Note that the gateway doesn't just deal with garage openers; it can also support lights (switches), lamps, and other things that are wired in your home.  You do have to buy those panel replacements, but once it's in, you can automate roughly 30% of your home.  So think of the Gateway as making your home internet accessible; the panels then talk to the Gateway, and the Gateway talks to your app/mychamberlain.com site so you can communication and send instructions.There's also the Chamberlain MYQ-G0201 MyQ-Garage Controls Your Garage Door Opener with Your Smartphone.  This is if (A) you have a newer garage with sensors and (B) you don't care about anything but the garage: no home lighting automation, no nothing else.  It's also Wi-Fi enabled, but considering it is nearly 3x the cost of the Internet Gateway, I just didn't see a purpose.MyQ is a tremendous technology in concept.  It's similar to Z-Wave: home automation and mobile accessibility.  The problem is that this particular Gateway makes too many compromises on its path to being your sole home automation solution.  As a caveat, I'm an IT worker, so technology is what I do.  My feedback is from that angle.  If all you care about is looking cool for your friends or monitoring your garage, this gadget will work perfectly for you, and you should ignore the extended paragraphs under each section.INSTALLATION: This is easy.  You plug in the Ethernet cable to the Gateway, plug it into your router, and give it power.  Then you'll need to create an account at mychamberlain.com and plug in the serial.  No issues with that, right?Well, I have three issues with this setup.  First, I don't understand why this could not have had a Wi-Fi option so I could literally throw it anywhere in the house out of sight rather than having to waste an Ethernet port on my router to make it work.  The next product revision should have this as a requirement.  Second, considering it's nothing more than a transceiver, I found it to be rather oversized.  I don't understand why they couldn't have just embedded the transceiver directly into the panel, even if it meant a slightly thicker panel, rather than force people to go out and get yet another piece of hardware that wastes valuable space (and an Ethernet port).  Have the external one as an option for those who don't have wireless.  Third, not clear on why this requires an account on Chamberlain's servers given what it does (relay a signal from one device to another).  If Western Digital can do private cloud where it doesn't need the drive to connect to any server except for firmware updates, I don't understand why Chamberlain put this requirement in place.  Is it for app monitoring?  Should be optional - give me an option NOT to do that, and instead expose a port and connect directly to it myself if I have the knowhow.  Or how about this - use UPnP and do it automatically.FUNCTIONALITY: Allows you to, from any computer or your mobile device, view the status of your garage, open and/or close it, set up alerts, and create schedules.I have one issue with this one, and as stated from Chamberlain Support, it's the ""safety law"".  See, Chamberlain hard-coded a ""feature"" into the gateway that forces it to beep loudly and wait 5-10 seconds before closing the garage.  It doesn't do this for opening the garage.  Only closing the garage.  The intent is to warn people that the garage is closing in case they're near it.  Why would I have an issue with such a ""feature""?  First, it's redundant.  There are safety line-of-sight sensors that have to be installed with the opener; it won't function at all until you install them even if you don't want them (because you're not an idiot who stands under heavy wooden garages).  If they're installed, the garage will not function as long as the line-of-sight is broken, meaning beeping at a person is stupid because it wouldn't close anyway.  Second, you can't disable it at all.  I'm the only person in my house and worst case, if I left the garage open and some criminal were inside, and I closed it, they could walk up to the panel and re-open it again. There's literally no risk and no reward.  But again, I'm the only person parking in my garage.  Nobody should be getting beeped at.  I could perhaps forgive this if I could adjust the timing down, say to 2-3 seconds max, but you can't.  You can't change it at all, it's forced upon you.  So in my case, the garage takes approximately 12 seconds to open but approximately 25 seconds to close.  That's ridiculous.  Should I care?  Probably not.  But I don't like forced ""features"" that I can't adjust to meet my needs.  This definitely needs to be addressed, even if it means the customer accepts responsibility.  Last, it's bizarre that it still does this even if you're on the same wireless network, closing it from the app.  Why?  Who are you alerting?  Maybe I'm upstairs and see I forgot to close the garage; rather than run downstairs, I just hit a button on my device to close it.  Why is it still delayed when I'm in the house?  It's clearly a knee-jerk ""feature"" that needs more options to disable or tone it down.SUPPORT: You can access a knowledgebase online, email to Support, or call Support if needed.Problem with this is, the knowledgebase answers ""stupid"" questions.  It doesn't answer real questions such as the ""safety law"" issue above, because that ""feature"" isn't properly documented anywhere that I can see.  Emailing Support is easy enough, but they'll take at least 3 days to get back to you, and if you reply to them, another 3 to respond.  Calling Support is fine, but their IVR menu will waste 3-5 minutes of your life just trying to get to a voice; not because it's deep because it isn't.  The problem is that the gal talks SLOOOOOOOWWW, and she embeds like 20 options under one: ""If you are calling about installing, configuring, setting, moving, adjusting, programming, calibrating, or reinstalling your Chamberlain myQ device, or you are trying to set up your myQ device with your internet router, or you want to learn more about myQ devices, or you need assistance finding a myQ device, or you want to register your myQ device, or you can't install the myQ mobile app....press 1.""  Ridiculous.  Instead of ""For assistance with your myQ device, press 1"".  Doesn't matter what assistance, it has to do with a myQ device!  After 4 minutes wasted, I frantically pressed zero and got to an agent, then it took him 2 minutes to confirm the ""safety law"" ""feature"" and the inability to disable it.Now for the other bugs.  There is a persistent issue where the app will fail to communicate to the server; it'll throw a message at you about it.  Only happens when you're not in the home on the same wireless network.  It's not a mobile signal issue; full 4G, and frankly, the app still works, but the error is annoying.  Second, there are times when it'll show me the garage door is open when it clearly isn't.  There's some sort of latency between the app and the gateway or the gateway and the panel where it's not showing the proper status.The Gateway is a good device but it needs a lot of work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TI8ZJ78ZXUO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7CDSQ8#wasThisHelpful","R2TI8ZJ78ZXUO6","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, the lock has the ""while it's unlocked you can't remove the key"" mechanism.  If that bothers you keep locking.  I don't mind this so much - keeps me from leaving my box unlocked.What did bother me at least a little bit is the assumption of the door tongues.  All of them are short, all of them.  It wasn't a major deal - I used the one from the old lock fine - but it's almost like they figure every mail box will be tiny or that the lock will be right up on the edge of the door.  In my case I needed one that was 1.5 inches long to reach the edge.  The longest in the package was just shy of 1 inch, and while the door did close, it could easily be forced open.  Would like to see them include all sizes, from .25 inch all the way up to two inches.Installation is easy, at least for mailboxes.  You slide it into the hole or, if you need a hole, drill one.  It does need to be an odd circle/rectangle shape, not a perfect rectangle and not a perfect circle, but that's normal.  When you get the lock in place, the clamp slides onto the back to prevent it from falling out, then you attach the tongue.  If you're looking at the picture that's the locked position, when the lock is unlocked it goes down, not up.  That threw me a bit, so I had to remove and re-attach it.Tools: you should have a socket wrench (or regular wrench.  I make the assumption you have all sizes, I didn't measure how big the nut was).  I just used a socket wrench with a Gator Grip ETC-120A Universal Socket Adapter with Power Drill Adapter which worked perfectly.  Flathead screwdriver if you're removing an old lock that might be a bit stubborn, that should allow you to remove the clamp in the rear.  Drill if it's a new setup.Time will tell whether it rusts or if there is any other issue with the lock but from what I could tell, it was quality and easy to install.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R92KRX5UY5LAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RN32SW#wasThisHelpful","R92KRX5UY5LAX","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AILET was kind enough to send me a case for review.The first impression was that the case fits so snugly and perfectly on the iPhone that it feels as though it should have been part of the base design.  Because of its transparency, it allows the basic appearance of the iPhone to shine through without dulling or making it look ""ugly"" as some other cases tend to do.  It feels like a more durable version of the bumper that Apple used to give away due to ""Antennagate"".There are cover-style pieces for the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, and a cutout for the speakers and charging port on the bottom.  The speaker cutout was not perfectly aligned with the speaker holes, but the charging hole was lined up nicely.At first, pressing the power button seemed to be a bit more challenging because it forces you to press the button squarely in the middle.  Most long-term iPhone users are accustomed to being able to press either side of the button to get it turn on; it's easy to press so you can quickly get to what you need.  The power button cover on the AILET case does not allow for this, and it takes some getting used to.  In some ways this is a positive design: it prevents you from accidentally pressing the button when you didn't intend to, powering on the screen and draining the battery unnecessarily.There were two nitpicks observed.  First, the edge of the case where it was apparently sealed feels sharp to the touch; not to the point of cutting, but it's apparent when holding the device for calls.  If you're a leftie, it's a plus: it helps you hold the phone as it rests comfortably in your thumb.  If you're a rightie, it'll be slightly annoying as it will rest in your finger joint and possibly get uncomfortable after a lengthy phone call.Second was that the phone is not matte or patterned, which means it was prone to slipping out of the hand slightly easier than the phone without the case.  Again, if you're a leftie, this likely won't be an issue.If you're trying to get something that protects the edges of your device and is raised enough to help protect the front and back of an otherwise fragile device, BUT is not unattractive and retains the appearance of the iPhone, consider this case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VD4RXF7F0FQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA8Z4R8#wasThisHelpful","R2VD4RXF7F0FQR","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LifeCHARGE was kind enough to provide a case for review.The case is actually three different benefits.  First, it's a sturdy case for the iPhone.  Second, it redirects speaker output on the bottom to face toward the user.  Third, it essentially re-charges the iPhone when it goes down to a point, providing roughly a day and a half of heavy usage.The case acts the same way as external battery packs, used to charge the iPhone rather than keep it charged.  The iPhone will discharge as used, but then receive charge from the case.  That means that the charging priority is to the case, rather than the iPhone, if you have them both plugged in together.  That's not a negative, but it is important to understand that if the case runs out of charge, and your iPhone runs out of charge, and you plug the case in with the iPhone inside, the iPhone won't charge immediately.  The case has to get to a certain level of charge before the iPhone will pick up - which means you may need to begin charging your case before it runs completely out of juice.Another side note is that the charging is not via Lightning cable, but microUSB.  If you've had nothing but Apple's iPhone, this will throw you a bit, because unlike Android users, you probably don't have 5-6 microUSB cables laying around.  If anything, it should hopefully irritate you to see how inexpensive they are compared to the ripoff that is the Lightning cable.In testing, the case simply wouldn't charge when plugged directly into a computer via USB.  This is likely because the USB port doesn't provide enough output to charge; it's more probable that the case is picky about the port type, just like Apple and Motorola do with their products.  Some might find this frustrating, because other external chargers can charge via USB just fine, though slower.  If you're good with electronics, you might be able to short a USB cable to ""trick"" the case to charge at full speed.  Plugging directly into an outlet using a USB adapter (the one that comes with the iPad works perfectly) took roughly 3 hours to get sufficient capacity back from a completely empty state.Grip was improved using the case over the slim, ""slippery"" form factor of the iPhone.  The only issue is that the power button opening makes pressing the power button more difficult than it should be.  Hopefully a revision of the product will address this small issue.  Of course, the weight of the phone is increased dramatically due to the weight of the battery, so if you're used to the feather light iPhone, this will either shock you or turn you off.  If you're coming from larger Android devices you might find this to be a positive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RFRG954B4TMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGZ247O#wasThisHelpful","R1RFRG954B4TMG","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Menscience Androceuticals was kind enough to provide a bottle of the face scrub for review along with MenScience Face Buff Brush.The scrub is normally sold as part of the  MenScience Men's Skin Care Kit: Cleanser, Moisturizer, Exfoliator, & Facial Cleansing Brush.  Talking specifically about the scrub, it does an excellent job in removing dead skin cells.  It also does not dry the skin out, despite being a scrub.  You can use the scrub by itself with your fingers, working it in using a circular motion.  However you'll get a better experience if you use the brush to apply the scrub.  The combination will also make it easier to shave.  By the time you're finished, your skin will shine and fine line wrinkles will be harder to see.  It'll look like you have concealer on, and that's a good thing.As this is my first time using the scrub, I can't speak on any changed formula.  Obviously formula changes are done with reason, and it's possible that the changes are for the better (for example, an identified skin reaction). I experienced no skin reactions or anything negative after repeated usage, both in the morning and evening.I will note that the ""scrub"" sensation, as with all scrubs, is done with polyethylene granules, which unfortunately have been in the news recently for harming fish.  If that bothers you, consider a different product or use something other than a scrub.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QDE5F141OSFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ZOD9W#wasThisHelpful","R2QDE5F141OSFV","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical that this pillow would be effective.  It will be my 5th pillow in two years; as I age, my neck gets a lot more picky about what I put under it.  I noticed many were recommending buckwheat pillows instead of memory foam (which unfortunately gets too hot and soft) or regular plushy or firm pillows.I did have to add another pillow under it for support due to my broad shoulders.  But once I did that, I was able to sleep on this pillow perfectly.  I was even able to rub a little groove in for my earlobe, which is really sensitive to firm surfaces and will hurt if I sleep on it.  The rest of the pillow retained its shape.Another side benefit is that the pillow does a decent job of sending heat from your head downwards as opposed to holding it in.  it does get warm, but it's never uncomfortable like memory foam can be.  The rounded sides serve as a perfect support for your neck no matter how you sleep, though I did feel that your mattress will really make a difference as far as how comfortable you can get it.In any event, highly recommended if you want a great nights' sleep.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KEIYX8K6WTMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052FU0O4#wasThisHelpful","R1KEIYX8K6WTMU","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I've gotten older, I have noticed the bags forming under my eyes, especially if I've gone without sleep for extended periods which does happen on occasion.  I was seeking an effective solution to this problem that isn't requiring me to apply Preparation-H gently.This came highly recommended so I decided to give it a try.  It's a very light textured cream in a fancy container that is applied with gentle dabs (rubbing the bags makes it worse).  I note for the record that I don't have circles or darkness; just the puffy appearance.This cream is essentially a concealer.  It will make any puffiness less visible, less obvious.  However the puffiness will still be there; so don't purchase this expecting the puffiness to magically go away.  There is a disclaimer on the container that says ""severe"" cases may require surgery; mine isn't anywhere near as severe as some cases, and in fact if you weren't looking up close you might not even see the puffiness.  Despite that the cream was not able to really do much besides make them less visibly obvious.Not a bad thing, but not what I expected, and definitely not my takeaway of how it was presented.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE79BQA9LL26J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXZ027S#wasThisHelpful","RE79BQA9LL26J","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Measupro was kind enough to provide this scale for review.I have an electric scale that has all sorts of extras; calorie, fat, multiple measurements, etc.  But it's extremely bulky and finicky.  Not so with the Smart Weigh.  It's slim, trim and very attractive when placed in a bathroom or other area.  The LCD is large and easy to read, with an indigo (""Indiglow"") backlight and strong contrast.  No complaints with readability, even at night, and it does not disturb others.From the images you might assume the scale is fragile. It is glass, but by no means loose or poorly constructed. It's heavy and sturdy, and you get the sense that short of dropping it on a hard floor, it'll stand up to the test of time very well.Comes with an initial set of batteries, and with the auto-off feature, it should last you quite a long time.  However, there is a trick to the auto-on: it is suggested that you activate the scale by stepping one foot on the scale, right on the LCD area, to wake it up. Let it set back to zero, then proceed to weigh yourself. This will not only help in ensuring accuracy, it'll also make sure that the scale is only on as long as is needed to be weighed effectively.Last point, and minor:wear socks with this scale. It's cold. Might not be a bad thing on a hot day, but I'm at least pointing it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQIEHASK5EBHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTXJ5HQ#wasThisHelpful","RQIEHASK5EBHV","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Menscience Androceuticals was kind enough to provide a bottle for sample and review. Note that this face wash is generally most effective as part of a larger facial care kit along with a scrub, brush and lotion.The lotion does contain salicyclic acid, so if you are sensitive to that I suggest looking elsewhere.  However you won't find a more effective face wash for managing breakouts.  Using it once every morning as part of my shower has yielded solid management and kept my skin from gettinng any bumps or breakouts.  If I stop using it, even for two days, I'll start  seeing bumps again.The only real downside is the smell.  It's not horrible or pungent, just smells like plastic or something 'chemical' if that makes sense.  Hopefully they will consider making the formula without any sort of smell in the future, but I know sometimes it's unavoidable.Still recommended, and again, best used with the scrub and brush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VCLBFRFJO3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ZOD9M#wasThisHelpful","R20VCLBFRFJO3R","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this pomade as a supplement to the Suavecito Pomade to add shine to an otherwise 'normal' looking matte finish.  And in truth, the Layrite Pomade has tremendous shine.  It doesn't look greasy or ""wet"" but your hair does stand out, at least with a short wave.  The problem is that it simply has no hold whatsoever, even when using a durag.First, I had applied the Suavecito which gave me the amazing molded look that I love, not a single follicle out of place, then applied about a dime size amount of the Layrite over top of that, just to give it shine. It basically frizzed my hair.  Not good.Second day, I tried just the Layrite by itself.  Again, frizz, and even worse this time.  Definitely not good.Final time, I tried the Layrite as a base with the Suavecito over top.  Frizz.  Simply made no sense, and I can only speculate that the Layrite is doing something to the hair to purposely make it frizz, which is unfortunate since again, the shine is awesome.So, if shine is all you care about, or you're not working with short waves, the Layrite Pomade may be for you.  If you want hold with that shine, look elsewhere - Suave Professionals, Men's Styling Pomade, 1.75-Ounce (Pack of 4) is a good candidate there.  If you just want hold, the Suavecito is so far the best I've seen.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HELRDOL07I9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOIY5W6#wasThisHelpful","R1HELRDOL07I9T","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SterlingPro was kind enough to provide one of these for review.  Currently, I have a Bodum Chambord 3 cup French Press Coffee Maker, 12 oz., Chrome that I bought a while ago but hardly ever use.  The problem is the size; though it's a 12 ounce, accounting for grounds you really will only get an 8-ounce cup of coffee out of it.The SterlingPro is significantly larger, so I did expect to get a better run and did, managing to not only nicely fill up a travel mug full of coffee, but I was able to brew Level 1 Seattle's Best Coffee, but with the flavor and power of a Level 3 brew.  TO understand how that's possible, you have to understand the way that the proper brewing is supposed to work:  You need good coffee (i.e. not Folgers), good water (i.e. not tap), and the right amount of heat (i.e. not over heated), combined with the right way of making it.French press is essentially a straining process that involves soaking the grounds in hot enough water, then straining through with a metal filter so that the grounds are pushed to the bottom and the coffee is at the top, ready to be poured into your cup.  They all work the same, but the key to minimizing grinds and maximizing flavor is the filter itself.  The Bodum's filter would frequently allow grounds in the coffee no matter how slowly or properly I pressed.  The SterlingPro didn't have this problem.  It not only kept the grinds at bay, but it was extremely difficult to strain the coffee.  That's not a bad thing; it means the filter was so fine that it was hard to displace the water, minimizing the chance of stray grinds and ensuring that what you ended up with was flavorful.  Indeed, this was the case, and I was impressed by how effective it was.  It also comes with two extra filters, since after time the filter will become less and less effective and need to be replaced. For the price this is a nice bonus.I would suggest one small change, one that the Bodum had, which is a way to more effectively trap the steam.  The plunger cap does not have anything to block the pour spout so you lose a little steam and heat.  It's not a deal breaker, but it would be nice to see something where you can rotate it to block this while you're plunging, then rotate it to a pour opening when you're ready to pour.To clean you can compost the grinds, then I suggest cleaning with my odor-free combination.  Odor-free is another step to making sure your coffee tastes great every time.2 Bottles Seventh Generation Dish Soap Liquid - Free & Clear (Set of 2, 25oz) - Odorless, requires no scrubbing.  Just squirt a small amount inside and then run hot water and swish around, empty, repeat until all of the soap is rinsed out.Kleenex Hand Towels, 60 Count (Pack of 6) - Unlike regular paper towels these do not leave an odor when they get wet.  They are also better at absorbing the water, and feel great to the touch.  They don't tear or rip.Highly recommended to check out the SterlingPro.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17YKI0PJRE0QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUHACEE#wasThisHelpful","R17YKI0PJRE0QU","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Galaxy Gear randomly one evening as a compliment for my Samsung Galaxy S4, Black (Verizon Wireless).  The thought was, it's an intriguing concept, and I can't judge without actually using it for a while.  Well, I used it for a while.  Now I'm going to have to return it, unfortunately.  I don't want to, but now that I understand it'll never work in the current generation of device software, it's a losing proposition to anyone considering it.First you must understand what's going on here.  The smartwatch is not data enabled; it manages its communications entirely through the charging cradle, which has NFC, and/or Bluetooth, where it talks to the phone you're connected to.  There are multiple issues with this.  First, the charging cradle was designed to fit the watch body as tightly as possible, but of course if you leave it somewhere (as I left it at work on a Friday), you're screwed for both charging and (re)connecting the smartwatch.  Thus the reason such a device, if it really only has 2-3 days of battery, should have a port directly on the device, preferably standard microUSB rather than a proprietary cable that could also be misplaced or left.But the Bluetooth is another matter, and it is here that the smartwatch hits dealbreaker/showstopper status.  IN order to make the smartwatch talk to your phone, you must download a piece of software called Gear Manager.  First negative is that the NFC connection I mentioned before is the only way to initially get this software.  Second, the software has to run in the background, managing communications, apps, notificaction sync, etc.  You can't just use standalone Bluetooth, and in fact, even if the phone is Bluetooth connected, if the Gear Manager software crashes or starts acting funky and needs to be shut down, the watch will essentially become a zombie.  It will force you to unpair the watch, remove it from Gear Manager, reboot the phone (possibly) and set it all up again through Gear Manager.There's even a problem with this.  Setting up with Gear Manager is a dice roll.  Even though the watch will confirm the pairing code, there are times that the pairing fails for absolutely no reason.  I'm of the opinion that the ""hackaround"" solution Samsung has done instead of just using standard Bluetooth is the cause for this.Once I got it set up the watch worked like gold throughout the day.  It alerted me to notifications, allowing me to decide whether to waste energy pulling out the phone. It let me manage my media streaming.  And yes, it was able to make and receive calls that were reasonably clear in non-noisy areas.  All was well until the evening, when my interactions with the watch diminished and my phone was more heavily used for web browsing, games and video streaming.  It seems that there is some kind of interference with certain apps on the phone and the Gear Manager; the phone would constantly lose and re-establish connection with the watch, resulting in an annoying notification banner repeatedly flashing.  Worse, the performance of the S4 itself seemed to tank during these times.  Unpairing the watch was the only way to restore order, but it got me thinking as to the cause.Bluetooth has different profiles for different purposes, and it is the Bluetooth software itself that handles the routing of the signals based on what the device is trying to send.  For example, If you pair your phone with headsets that support phone calls, you might see your headsets paired with both phone audio and media audio.  You can then choose to disable one if you don't want to use it, but in the case of the watch, it only supports phone audio.  Yet the pairing was consistently interrupted by media audio.  That leads me to believe that Gear Manager isn't handling the signal switching the way it would if it were just regular Bluetooth.In any case, I'm forced to return the device.  I like it, I think it has an application, and perhaps at a $75 or lower price I wouldn't care as much about the picky behavior as it's not overly frequent.  But for nearly $300m, more is definitely expected.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8E4PUEHJ9C2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FH9I0M4#wasThisHelpful","R8E4PUEHJ9C2N","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And unfortunately it may be par for the course.  But for me it is bad enough that I may need to consider returning it.The hinge.  It's huge.Now, this may not bother you.  It depends on your typing style.  If you're the ""cup the bubble"" ""home row"" traditional typist who segments your keyboard in your head, the keyboard may work perfectly for you.  If you're like me and your fingers just go naturally as they type, it will frustrate you to no end, especially the ""Y"" key.  The way I type, it's not comfortable for me to use my right hand to hit the ""Y"" key, likely because I'm left-handed.  So I have a tendency to reach over with my index finger instead.  The result: a constant bang on the hinge, and a need to slow down my typing speed to compensate for this.Strictly from a design perspective, a better approach might be to just resize the keys and shrink the hinge.  A thin ribbon-type hinge would have made a world of difference here.It's really a shame, because I do like the keyboard otherwise.  It works perfectly with the Dell Venue 8 Pro 32 GB Tablet (Windows 8.1), turning the little workhorse into a fully vetted computing experience.

"Ms. Donovan was kind enough to provide a copy of her book for review.  I do so as a fan of sci-fi stories.I found the book draining.  It's not due to bad writing; on the contrary, it was very well written and almost read like a TV show.  It's just that there is simply too much information being given in the first half of the book.  Second, the chapter progression jumps all over the place, from timezone to timezone and even from physical location to physical location.  It's hard to create a linear attachment of any kind, and I suspect that the bulk of the development could have been more easily done in four/five larger chapters, rather than 30 tiny ones.Clearly, the intent here was character development, and in this sense it did a very good job. The issue is that too much of any thing isn't good; such was the case here.  Stepping into a book expecting a story about life from other places is intriguing.  Unfortunately you don't get to taste that full course dinner until WELL into the book, by which time you may be burned out.  I also suspect that were this a TV program, where there are visual cues to things, it would probably be an amazing experience.  Since the author has to create that imagery in the reader's minds, it ends up just overloading.If you're the sort of reader who enjoys character development, who doesn't really care about the payoff or treats it as ""dessert"", then you may just enjoy the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7QKTWM43BUTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEB5BDA#wasThisHelpful","R7QKTWM43BUTQ","A37QUQPYFMR9Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37QUQPYFMR9Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's how it happened for me with my Whirlpool Duet Front-Load Washer (purchased in approx 2006; your model number will be inside the door):Washer began to have a small stream of leakage from the water inlet which is located at the 10 o'clock position on the ring.  The ring was intact, but at the water fill valve, there was a small, relatively steady stream that rode down over the rubber door seal ring to the bottom, then trickled into the washer basin (clothes place).  When that filled to the front lip overnight, in the morning, water was all over the floor (estimated 2 gallons) plus at the base of the drum; only after it was on the floor did I see the trickle of water from the fill valve on the door, 10 o'clock.  Note: we keep our door open to prevent stinky mold, thus water was on floor; if you keep your door closed, the water will build up greatly inside the washer, and when you go to use it and open the door, water will splash out all over your floor and feet suddenly.  Same problem, different presentation.I removed the detergent drawer (just press down on the release button that you'll see when you open the drawer and slide it out; no tools).  In the very back of the drawer open hole/slot, with a flashlight, you'll see water trickling out of the little plastic hole (if yours is like mine).  That water eventually goes into your washer fill valve by the ring.I turned off the hot water valve on the wall, and the water stopped in the rear of the detergent drawer (i.e. the cold water inlet valve is working); I turned on the hot water valve again and shut off the cold water valve and the water continued leaking!  Ah ha, the hot water portion of the blue inlet valve (the one you've looked up here) was not holding back water.  Turned off both wall valves, took off the hoses, opened the top of the machine, and the hot water one had plenty of calcium build-up on the metal screen.  Rather than  clean it, I ordered this part in this Amazon listing.Look up on youtube this video title: Duet Washer Inlet Valve (part #8181694) - How To Replace by AppliancePartsPro  Note: I ordered my part from Amazon, so no clue if it's the exact same part; just showing you how I learned to replace the part.  Note: you will need a Torx screwdriver set, two sizes that I cannot recall.The problem was solved--no more leaks--when I placed the new part in place of the old one!Hardest part was getting the electronic wires off the old brass leads (four of them).  It took placing a large screwdriver in there and encouraging them off.  Note: try not to take them off until you get the new piece; if they go on incorrectly to your new part, you may experience trouble.  A second hurdle, the screw to attach the inlet valve to the back of the Duet did not, annoyingly, fit the old screw location in the tin back of the washer (you'll see when you get there), so I had to try and drill a new hole.  I ended up tearing a new hole with a huge standard screwdriver (widened the old hole with vigorous twisting)--again, you'll see when you get there.  It's annoying that they cannot be made standard.That's it.  The new part looks as good (cheap plastic) as the old one that I removed.  It does have a steel screen on each inlet valve (not plastic), which is good.Best of luck to you on your repair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y1KNU69OWQCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DM8KOLW#wasThisHelpful","R1Y1KNU69OWQCG","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Twenty bucks?  I have many sets of ear protection, including over the head designs and inner ear. These are the worst of the lot.There is no ""technology"" here worth the price.  It's a plug of clear plastic inserted into the usual tri-umbrella of silicone.  No special baffle, no additional patents. Throw in a cheap coin-purse style case (which should cost a dollar) and, literally, a thread for a neck leash, and the entire package should cost five bucks. Instead, they charge twenty.There are many, many types of plugs that let in some sound, if that's the objective. In fact, most are not completely blocking. This is rated at 13 dB blocking...that's too little protection for most applications.  If installed perfectly, that's all the protection?  And, most times, they will reposition and not be ideal...then it's like having nothing in the ears at all.  You could hear a pin drop--it lets every word and sound in.

"Has stayed on my Cordura nylon backpack for about two months now, and still going.Note that the patches at 5-inches are smaller than you would imagine, partly because the corners are rounded (and are thus not five inches corner to corner).Note that, if there is any imperfection, tag, logo, tear, hole, etc. underneath this patch, it WILL show through the patch when you iron this on.  The patch is rugged but thin; it will cover, but still reveal, imperfections in the underlying fabric.Heating the underlying fabric with the iron first, then adhering the patch and heating over it, is a smart tip.Enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CMRVSV9KQ3RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RF0RG0#wasThisHelpful","R2CMRVSV9KQ3RC","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the 55 cm size as I already own 65 cm and 75 cm balls (there are online videos on uTube as to ball sizing).  It's a great ball.Arrives in a cardboard box and a sealed platic bag.  It has the foot pump, which worked for me to inflate the ball, and two long ""stoppers"" of plastic to seal the hole.It is 55cm, it seems, which is small and I use it for a travel/hotel exercise ball.  It's basically taking the place of a weight bench, and as such, it seems robust--I will update if it pops.I have other balls that have a matte finish, like the Gaiam balls, and those pick up much less floor lint and crap than this ball.  One use and it already looks awful.  Its sort of sticky, which is great so that you don't slide off, but horrific for dust bunnies.  If youre carpet is due for a cleaning, this ball will do it.  I much prefer the Gaiam balls for finish and texture.That said, this ball blows up nicely, although not prefectly round.  After leaving it inflated for three days to ""air out"", it still wobbles in a sort of egg-ish way when I spin it in the air.  My Gaiam balls do not do this--they are spherical.I do like that this ball came without a useless DVD, though.  I hate paying for that kind of needless accessory.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BQYOVLGAYPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLIUFI8#wasThisHelpful","R38BQYOVLGAYPM","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A great listen for Bob Welch fans. Some things to note from the version I bought, which is an Amazon MP3 with the red cover:It is a monaural recording. Mine comes out of the right channel much more strongly than the left channel; with headphones, this is particularly noticeable. You get used to it.There are skips, dead spots, and hiccups (especially between songs). This is best for someone who is not an audiophile, but a fan of AM radio, vinyl records, bootlegged and pirated recordings.I bought the MP3 version because its only so-so recording quality to begin with; if it was high-fidelity, stereo, professionally recorded, I might have sprung for the CD. I'm perfectly satisfied with the MP3 version.Bob does quite a bit of talking between songs, introducing the numbers, the players, the guests (his old band, Fleetwood Mac). It's fun for two listens, then gets old.The musicianship on this album is amazing. Bob Welch was an astonishing guitarist--blistering, artful. I'm glad this comes through on this live recording, where the songs have much less polish, a much ""harder"" edginess, to the versions known from French Kiss and Three Hearts. This live performance was from those years--his creative and commercial peak.I find this to be an amazing vintage recording. I have listened to it a half dozen times in the past three days alone.

"The MP3 version is excellent.  Sure, the numbers are a bit repetative, the lyrics as shallow as a frying pan, and the musicianship as sharp as a maul.  But, that was The Outlets.  My favorite tune is Whole New World, and despite being the title track of their most popular album, I could not find a copy of the song outside of this compilation.The best of the band is here, and it's a worthwhile purchase.  It's not just nostaligia for their popular shows at The Rat and The Channel and Jumpin Jack Flash's (the Fenway) and The Paradise and Bunratty's...it's music.

"This is an excellent bag. The Extreme version is, in my opinion, too much bag...thicker and fatter when rolled, and if one needs pouches and zippers, it's not a great ancillary bag; this one is an ideal ancillary bag. One use is attached to a college student's book bag.  When leaving a library desk, rather than worry about leaving your expensive laptop while you use the bathroom, for instance, simply pop it in this bag.Key: The Plastic Silkclip is made for Maxpedition's standard one-inch shoulder straps on any of its bags (Falcon II, Condor, etc.), including the RollyPoly itself (e.g. one could attach the RollyPoly regular backpack to the shoulder strap of the RollyPoly Extreme). Most other bags...such as Janus book bags--also use one-inch shoulder straps at the base (not at the padded portion).When one closes the RollyPoly bag's clip onto any backpack shoulder strap right as it comes off the backpack...that is, immediately at the base of the backpack strap, the RollyPoly bag (this one or any of the RollyPoly dump pouches) is conveniently and securely carried.  It is out of the way, well below the arm, and dangles alongside the main backpack in its rolled-up form factor, thus being carried without taking up space inside the main backpack. It can be detached and used as a ""jettison"" ancillary pack anytime, leaving the main pack at camp, office, car, etc. With the dump bags, many will use them as they are, right on the main backpack shoulder strap, unrolled, to carry a temporary item, such as a disposable bottle of water; when the water is drank and the bottle discarded, simply roll up the dump pouch again...it's already dangling from the main bag's shoulder strap.  Maxpedition was smart to use a stout clip that can be used to carry small items with weight while dangling from one-inch shoulder straps. Works superbly.The simple, but amazing, clip is one of the ingenious integrations with its other bags added by the thoughtful engineers at Maxpedition, and is a feature of all RollyPoly items that make them what they are. The clip is far more useful than the hand-carry loop of fabric added to the Extreme in a closed position; Maxpedition intelligently puts the ever-functional clip on each and every of its RollyPoly line of bags.I wished for anyone considering this RollyPoly backpack, or the Extreme, or any dump pouch, to understand the purpose of the well-designed clip. Note: the BIG belt loop is, obviously, another way of carrying this RollyPoly bag....on the BIG belt, oversized and often padded, of a standard camping backpack (e.g. North Face, Patagonia, Gregory, etc.--all major brands are compatible with this Maxpedition bag).  Some hikers like the RollyPoly bag there, others hit their hiking hand swing on it and prefer to use the clip (I prefer the clip).  This RollyPoly bag is not excessively large and can be carried open, with items inside it, off the camping backpack belt (the issue is not the size of this bag so much as it is the hanging RollyPoly straps, which need to be tied up so they don't hang, but it can be done). One would be unlikely to carry the open RollyPoly backpack from a regular pant's belt; it's not made for that purpose.The two downsides of this bag are that, with any weight, the straps will cut into your shoulders after about an hour. It's just not intended for heavy carries...more a mushroom bag than a camera bag,  and the second shortcoming is rain...the top is absolutely not sealed from the elements, no matter how tightly one cinches it. Beware rain with this bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBIJ223NJ19H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00158319S#wasThisHelpful","R2UBIJ223NJ19H","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is unnecessarily expensive. I own Cap Dumbbells, fixed, exactly like these but uncoated with rubber, just not the whole set. I've purchased them from Amazon and from Dicks, who also sells them. They are good Dumbbells, solid, straight, so-so knurling.Here's the skinny.  You can hold a 5-pound Cap dumbbell in the same hand as any other dumbbell simultaneously.  Try it when you see these at a big box store,  the five pounders are tiny, with tiny heads, and when you cross the handles, they are easily lifted together, one hands with any other heavier dumbbell.  I have fairly small hands for a guy and I can do it.  When my wife dies it, she likes to use eight inch Velcro straps, just Anazin search them, to hold them together; I just do it without straps.If you can do as I say, and the weights individually in Amazon are cheap and free shipping, you can do as I did.These prices are on Amazon now.  Two pairs of five pounders is 20 bucks.  A pair of 15 pounders is 30 smackeroulians. Okay, so what does that give you?  Per hand, you can lift 5, 10, 15, or 20 pounds, depending on what you hold (e.g. Two fine pounders per hand s ten pounds). That might be enough for a person with a total outlay of fifty bucks.Want more? If you buy two 25-pounders for 40 more clams total (based on current price), now you can do 25 and 30 pound lifts per hand.  You would have a total investment of ninety bucks.  Only ninety bucks to go up to thirty pounds (stand sold separately, if you care about such things). That is much, much cheaper than the price of this set.If you want more than thirty pounds per dumbbell, buy a PowerBlock Elite set (I've done an extensive review of that set) or an Ironmaster set...much better use of your money.Hope that helps.

"Adding to the other negative reviews, I'd like to add that you can't easily get your Dumbbells off this rack.  Why? Because the handle of the dumbbell is in the cutaway if the rack.  So, you have to grab the head of the dumbbell to get it out. Not a big deal with a three pound epweight, but with a twenty Lund weight?  You will be side of this rack, one hand on one head, the other on the other head (so, don't plan on putting it against a wall) to lift the dumbbell out. Then, since your hands are occupied, you'll be setting the weight on the floor or a bench anyway just to let go and then take hold of the dumbbell handle. Multiply this process times two as you'll now need to unpack your other dumbbell.  Then, if you use different weights during your workout, multiply it by every weight in your rack, all of which will be in the floor by the end of your workout.Note that the shelf style racks, like at a gym, do not suffer this problem.  They are expensive, though. My solution? PowerBlock Elites.

"Fits standard iPad--2, 3, Air 2, Airr3--like a glove. Soft inside.  Great zipper, with even some splash proof characteristics. Firm but not stiff, modern design. All for under five bucks.I bought a second for my older iPad 2. It has the room to hold my iPads in their thick rubber ""skins"", so that's great, too.

"Heavy Duty Landmine from barbells4me is an outstanding compliment to my weight training workouts at home.  I had considered one in the past, but thought Landmines were mostly for cross-fit training, which they are.  But, for the bodybuilder who enjoys traditional exercises (e.g. squats, overhead presses, etc.), the Landmine is also amazing.  It provides just the right amount of stability to perform, say, a one-arm overhead shoulder press, so that I can use more weight than I could with a dumbbell alone.  It does not provide the restriction of a Smith machine, which is great; its an in-between for a free dumbbell and a Smith machine, one could say.  It certainly is a compliment to those methods and adds great variety to a workout.Sure, one could jam the Oly bar end in a corner without a landmine, but it would chew up the corner (or the corner of your power cage) and chew up the end of your Oly bar.  Some people throw an old blanket into the corner first, but that is insufficient for protection, especially if one does explosive moves with the landmine. One slip, and there goes the drywall.  Also, this landmine, unlike a blanket, need not be used in the corner...it can be placed against any flat, solid surface: a flat wall, the side of your power cage, the bottom of a heavy bench, against weight plates on the floor, etc.This particular device is solid and well-built, as are the other products that I have received from barbells4me (I highly recommend the Calf Block and the Free-Standing Dip Bars from Barbells4Me, available on Amazon, and I have written reviews of those products, too).  The shipping weight was 33-pounds, including the box and packaging, so the true device weight is likely around 30-pounds.  It was well-packed in a strong shipping box and bubble wrapped (see photo). It easily accepts two Olympic plates, and I use two 45-pound plates on it to add more stability.  When the plates are on top of the device, they are held in places by the welded plate pin.  Note: when the 45# plates are atop the device, the corner cut is underneath the plates, so when one places the device in a corner, it is the plates themselves that will bump the two sides of a corner (not the device).  This is, actually, a good thing as it saves the corner (sheetrock, floor molding, etc.) from damage by the metal of the device, if that makes sense.  I typically use mine against a flat sidewall of my gym as I have equipment in the corners. With the twin 45-pound plates on it, this Landmine stays nicely stationary against, and without damaging, the flat wall.  Many lighter weight land-mines cannot be used on a flat wall.The mechanism of this device is smooth in all planes of motion.  It is not simply a nut and bolt through a hole in the sleeve, but rather, it has a metal rotating bushing, brass, through which the bolt travels. It's quiet and buttery.As others have mentioned in their reviews, the device, even when weighted (45# plates x2 plus the #30 device = #120), can still shift during use.  Placing it against something solid, or in the corner of the workout room, or in the back corner of my powercage, or a flat wall or weight rack, is best.  Whether on a concrete floor, a rubber mat, or a rug, it will likely shift and move on you, so best to plan to use it tucked against something.I had an issue that is mentioned by a couple of other reviewers: my relatively new Body-Solid brand Oly bar end did not fit into the sleeve of the Landmine.  Both ends of the barbell would only go into the sleeve about half way, and then would get stuck.  It was terrifically difficult to even get the Oly bar back out of the sleeve; it was as if the Landmine sleeve was somehow tapered toward the inner/far end.  Heres the great thing: a simple email to Barbells4Me via Amazon merchants contacts provided me (and the other reviewers who had this issue on Amazon) with complete kindness and care.  Roger at Barbells4Me replied to my email that same day.  He noted that a few of the sleeves had imperfect measurements as part of the manufacturing process.  He understood completely, and offered either a return and refund, or a new sleeve (easily attached in place of the existing sleeve with two bolts and nuts) that has been personally tested by him before shipping.  The Landmine is such a great device, I saw that immediately when I opened the box (see photo), and I certainly wanted to keep it, so I asked Roger to please ship me a new sleeve.  Boom, 2-Day USPS Priority and the new sleeve is here and its a perfect fit for my Oly bar.  I mention all of this so that (a) if you get one of those rare sleeves thats too tight for your bar (assuming your bar is straight; try both ends first), dont panic, just contact Roger and he will help you, and (b) Barbells4Me, located in NY state, is an honest Amazon seller and its reassuring to purchase from them.  I have no personal affiliation with Barbells4Me, but am just a satisfied customer of their products.This product is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1688NYLAQGOZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2AD0BU#wasThisHelpful","R1688NYLAQGOZH","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple things might not know without owning this cube timer:The timer requires 2 AAA batteries, which are not included.The timer is fairly cheap plastic, sort of a thin plastic, not at all rugged, and if one drops it, it will break.  The battery cover is a slide-on, slide-off affair and is, again, thin, so open with care.There is a one-year warranty mentioned in the package insert; it says to contact the company by an email address provided for instructions on how to ship the device back for a replacement/repair.  (note: I would estimate the shipping at around $7 (if the company is in the USA), and thus about half the price of a new device.)There is a loose fob, a tiny weight, inside the device that flops when you move the cube; it is presumably what signals to the cube which side it is upon.There IS, believe it or not, a small digital countdown timer on the business end of the cube--that is, the end that has no number (it is opposite the 0 side and is thus desk-down when the device is not counting, and up on one side when the device is counting).  So, one can, in fact, see how much time is left in the countdown at any time during the countdown without pushing a button, but by simply looking at the countdown clock.The device does not tell time.The device seems accurate.The device does shut off when one turns it with the 0 side skyward.Despite the answer to my question on Amazon, there is an on/off switch and the instructions included with the cube are very specific: the unit should be switched to off when not in use.  (Those that answered my question say they leave theirs on all the time, just on the 0 position, and the battery lasts a long time, one person saying a year).Although neat, I like the ability to set the time and want a simple to use device, and thus the Polder magnetic slim timer is best for me. (Which has many advantages to this cube, and with a direct input timer setting, I can enter, say, 20 minutes as in five seconds, whereas turning thus cube is one second).

"I'm reviewing this bat for my intended purpose: self-defense. It's the perfect heft and length for a below-average to average size person to wield one-handed (a Goliath might want a Lousville Slugger) during an impromptu early morning skirmish in your master bedroom. The aluminum is firm and will not shatter when cracked against solid objects such as forearms, mandibles, shins and skulls; a wooden bat, should it have an occult imperfection in the ash, might splinter, thereby giving your intended target a rather distinct advantage for the remainder of your altercation.The simplicity of the unibody design cannot be topped: no moving parts to fail at inopportune times, such as when your attacker has you in a headlock and you are trying to catch the bridge of his unguarded proboscis with blind back-flicks of your bat-holding wrist (your other wrist preoccupied by that claustrophobic space between his clenched bicep and your carotid artery, your wrist's desperate efforts slowly failing to bring your vision back to full-field from its dusky descent into tunneling). A bat is designed to never fail, unlike, for instance, a police blackjack baton with its messy two-piece design of rotating handle loosely bolted perpendicular to thermoplastic baton body. While showy, with repeated wrist flicks moving the baton as quickly as the wings of a nectar-feeding hummingbird, this display of power holds little utility for the pajama-clad homeowner who is about to be choked-out by a stranger in front of his wife and two tearful tykes.This bat stores conveniently between my mattress and box-spring and I appreciate that it is narrow enough not to cause ""princess and the pea"" discomfort against my spine during slumber (my ample back-fat perhaps playing an allied role). This gem has a perfect handle-end to allow, during an intruder situation, a rapid grab-and-deploy, like Zorro pulling his sword from a sheath; the handle end-nub and knurling also permit me the hands-on reassurance that I demand of my home defense weapons, a reassurance that has developed into a nightly ritual, immediately after lying down and saying my prayers, of hanging my hand off the edge of the bed, fingertips gently inserted underneath the mattress, to fondle the business end of the bat handle as I drift into the dreamland of sugarplum fairies.if one of the fairies gets out of line in my dreams (it's usually the drunk one with the club foot), I can right them swiftly with 15 ounces of well-lathed aluminum.Relax. I jest. No one is going to use this on a sugarplum fairy; it's exclusively for use againsts felonious miscreants who break my front door glass and reach in to jigger my door lock open at 2AM.This youth-sized aluminum bat--economical, solid, prettily, if rather pansily, painted in pink--is highly recommended for your arm's-reach home arsenal.I suppose one could hit a baseball with it, too, if so inclined.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EPHAPFEP27UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E63LQD2#wasThisHelpful","R2EPHAPFEP27UW","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought from local box retailer today and I will update this review with use.First unit, DOA.  Plugged in properly and the unit was getting ""juice"" because a little light on the rear of the unit indicates supplied power, yet, nothing happened when pushed the Power button.  Tried everything--hooking it to my MacBook Pro, hitting all other buttons, etc.  No go...the screen remained dark as a door.  I called HM Tech support, toll-free, and they did answer the phone and tried a couple things, and basically said that it needed to be returned to the store where I bought it.  So, yeah, it was toast right out of the box, not a flicker.Labored to put it back in the box and exchanged it.  Next one, same day that I bought the other, no issues.  Same power outlet, same set-up, and the thing powered on superbly.  I am using it with a MacBook Pro (2012 model) with a mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter.  The monitor has one VGA, and two HDMI inputs (note: the older model of this unit, still available, has one each of VGA, DVI-D and HDMI).  I had no issues with color or saturation.  I needed to adjust nothing but brightness, which was on 90/100 out of the box and I toned it down to 55 for night use (if sun in my window, I go up to about 70).  Note that I am not too picky about colors and such as I use this for writing (Word files) and surfing the internet; I do not watch full movies, DVDs, BlueRay, or do film or photo editing on it.I love that the bezel is invisible, it;s behind the screen somehow.  Clean design.  Menu buttons are underneath the right side, and are physical buttons (not virtual buttons).  The menu works smoothly, easy to navigate.I do find it low on my desk, so putting it on a riser/lift is a good idea.  It does not adjust up and down, it does not do portrait views/swivel or rotation, but the screen does tilt back-and-forth (i.e. angle up and down).  It does not rotate, so if one is going to rotate it to show another person things very often, then they would need to invest in one of those 12-inch rotating ""Lazy Susan"" type things; the base of this is small enough that it would fit on the rotating disc (sold on Amazon).  I've seen some pretty expensive monitors (like the Samsung line of higher-end 4K monitors) with some very rickety innate stands, but this one is held on two sides, like the photo, and is stable.  I like that, without a single ""trunk"" under the screen, I can actually use the space under there for USB hub, storing the keyboard when I want it out of the way, etc.  The stand clicks into place (rather than screws) and has a button to unhitch it from the monitor, and another to unhitch the silver uprights from the black base; I like this set-up as, without tools, I can simply remove the stand and either store or transport this monitor.This unit does have the power brick in the center of the two part power cord, not on the computer end or on the plug (there is no ""wall wart"").  It has no built-in speakers.  It is 23-inches, as advertised, and I looked at the 21.5 inch model in the store and that was good too.  I bought this one because it was on a better sale, but, honestly, the 21.5 incher was almost identical seeming when sitting in front of the monitor.I have avoided HP products since they were always middle-grade and, when they announced leaving personal home computing (and then changed their mind) in the Fiorina CEO days, I have never returned.  Now, in the Whitman CEO days, perhaps HP is back to some utility.  That said, there;s little excuse for a DOA screen.Overall, quite a bargain for the price, frankly.  I will keep my star rating for now, and update in a couple months to report back and change it accordingly.  It's a good and clean monitor with a great picture and sturdy design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Z9WCBYS4HZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0H08S0#wasThisHelpful","R4Z9WCBYS4HZR","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great for high-bar squats. I use a six-foot Bella bar, by Rogue Fitness, due to the smaller size of my home gymnasium.  The handle is thinner than a traditional Oly bar (see Rogue website for specs) and yet this device still clips on the bar and stays on it. Due to the thinner Bella bar, it was particularly painful on the spinous processes (spine bones), but this is resolved with this device.I considered the large foam Squat Sponge pad, the thick one that is contoured, but for five bucks more, this one would last forever, I figured; the Squat Sponge Pad would wear, hold sweat and odor, and might eventually crack, as foam tends to do.  I'm glad I chose the Manta by Goliath.Note that this is the Manta by Goliath, and not the Manta Ray pad. They are almost identical, and I'll let them fight it out in court as to who stole which ideas from whom.  All I know is, the Goliath device is twelve bucks cheaper than the other device. Lol. This Goliath product is well-made, will likely last forever, so I'll never own the genuine Manta Ray, it appears.This has thin foam lining the inside, where it touches the skin.  Whether it makes a difference over the competitors Manta Ray blue plastic device, I cannot tell.  Seems that most of the benefit is not the thin foam liner, but rather the fact that the device spreads the weight over the trapezius area better. In fact, I would prefer this device to be even wider yet.Cannot do low-bar squats with this device, if that's your thing, because this cannot be slid down the back; it must rest atop the trapezius, above the scapula.Glad I purchased this device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19GRVXSN67MU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MD0WN4Q#wasThisHelpful","R19GRVXSN67MU1","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jennifer Dove is an amazing artist. Her ability to use Copic markers to create 3-dimensional images is beyond compare; I suggest any cardmaker/papercrafter to please search her name and images online to see her style.  For me, I wanted to take the stamped images and pop them off the page.  I wanted depth: curls in hair that roll off the paper, eyes that sparkle, realistic skin tones with cheeks that are full, lips that look moist. Although I'd had other in-person Copic classes, I had never found a video tutorial.  Live classes are hard to remember as the tips come so quickly (although I do plan to attend Ms. Dove's Boot Camp someday, especially if she will conduct it once in Chicago...hint, hint).This is a DVD and a separate CD. Both played easily in my Windows PC (no clue about Apple), and I put Copic-friendly sheets of paper in my laser printer to print out the practice sheets; the first twelve pages are color lists, etc. and I used regular printer paper, the pages 13-26 or so are the practice images that I colored while watching Jennifer. There is no smearing or smudging or blackening of Copics when using laser ink (I think inkjet ink might smear, but I do not know).Then, onto the DVD which I watched on my computer. The production is professional, ideal lighting and sound. Jennifer moves through skin, eyes, hair, etc., and each segment is bookmarked in the disc for easy access. I liked most that I could watch each segment repeatedly, picking up the nuances along the way.Well worth the 25 dollar investment. I've watched it three times already. Five-star.Note: this is for intermediate to advanced Copic users; there are no basics of Copic markers on this DVD, such as refilling, color selecting, blending, etc. Ms. Dove has another beginners' DVD which I do not own.

"Plenty of ""fluff"", and little of hardcore significance.  Unfortunately, that is also the nature of this test--it is far from hard science or mathematics and thus is quite ethereal and subjective (hence the test allows for ""partial credit"" on multiple choice questions).That said, I used the flash cards and they were more grounded with principles than this book.This book has 200-pages of text, and 100-pages of questions.  I used a highlighter and reviewed the 200-pages and, all told, had perhaps 40-pages of actual ""good information"" to learn.  The rest was things like: in a modern classroom, computers are important for learning for a number of reasons such as allowing students with diverse learning patterns to learn at their own level, tracking individual student progress within a classroom setting, permitting a teacher to modify a teaching plan based on computer-based feedback from recent lesson plans, and permitting the teacher to determine the amount of time spent on each question in order to gauge areas where students might be stuck.This type of hogwash is what is on the test, but more importantly, this book is replete with similar ethereal crap that is unlikely to help you navigate the abstruse actual test.Bottom line: the difference between passing and failing the actual IL Teachers Exam is in the few solid questions that they ask (e.g. Piaget, etc.) and to get a grip on those questions--the difference between becoming licensed or not in the Lincoln state--is better served by the flash cards (see other testing supplies) and not the Sharon Wynne materials.

"If you have any experience at all with writing long works (and some of you may not and will find this book by Mr. Horowitz helpful), you will not need this book.  Essentially, it explains scenes and themes, and has you physically write out every scene, then rearrange them in a logical order, even if not necessarily chronological, in order to reinforce a theme.  It's as simple as that.  No great magic, and if one eliminates the pages on such unnecessary (for this type of book) subjects as finding time to write, etc., and the many pages on the story of The Ugly Duckling which is then used as the template for teaching, then the book is quite slim.  Additionally, the author has a way of writing that tends to string out short, concise concepts into many pages.If someone is a new writer, particularly a new novelist, this book may be helpful BEFORE you start plotting and planning a book.  Although the author would have you write 50, or better yet, 100 pages of a story, the process of going back and dissecting out every minute scene is extremely labor intensive.  I tried this method and stopped after a full day of dissection when i realized that this is ton of ""wheel spinning"" for an author who has spent enough time with their manuscript truly can get a feel for it's heft and bulk, the areas to shore up and the areas to cut away.  Mr. Horwitz writes in the book that no author can remember every scene in even the most dog-earred manuscript, which is true, but that does not mean that writing the entirety of it on 3x5 cards or Post-It notes is going to facilitate the process, or the recollection of parts of the novel.For novelists with Scrivener, the Scene building, re-arranging Scenes, is very clear in the software--it's almost intuitive as the software is built around writing in ""chunks"" and rearranging.  Again, a reasonable human being who is adept at writing and reading should be able to look over their sections in Scrivener (or any other software that allows drag-and-drop manipulation) and get a good overview of their work-in-progress.  There are no shortcuts, and this method of writing everything out in longhand is the ""long-cut"", in my opinion.  Money spent on a Scrivener For Dummies book and the software may help some; others (like me) used MS Word and carefully consider what we are writing as we write it, and the end is in sight while not wasting valuable time on making notecards for scenes.If one already has 100-pages or more written, then using MS Word, or Scrivener, and cutting and pasting ""scenes""--those that you have already created--into the Folders and shuffling them around limitlessly is going to take you about 1/10th the time of doing it with a pencil and Post-It notes, especially because once you do the pen-and-paper method, you still have to shuffle your scene around in whatever software you're using to write your novel!Again, if someone is brand new to novel composition, this book might help them.  Might.  For those newbies, one or two words written on 3x5 cards for each small scene (""scene"" is well-defined online, including McKee's Story writing book, and in countless youtube videos--it is important to understand the definition of Scene), jot them out AS YOU WRITE and keep them by your computer, and you can see what needs to be done if you want to re-arrange (this is a suggestion for the computer-averse).  For instance, if I wrote a chapter today, 1200 words or so, and I put one sentence describing the scene on a 3x5 card at each scene change in the chapter (live, as I am writing new prose), I might have 4-6 notecards by the end of the day by my computer.  Save the cards, and at the end of 100+ pages, I will have many cards, which is precisely what Blueprint Your Bestseller would have you do.  I can rearrange, shuffle, etc.  Some novelists will simply incorporate the ""one sentence"" in the text of the manuscript rather than on a notecard.Navigation in MS Word is very powerful, and watching a free 20-minute online video on MS Word Navigation and Mapping will allow anyone to use the power of their software to perform the task of tracking, manipulating, and rearranging much better (efficient as you are working in your actual finished work, not on paper and then re-doing the work in the software) than 3x5 cards.Again, for Scrivener fans, MS Word Styles fans, or those that simply keep writings in Folders instead of one huge, unwieldy manuscript, there is no need for even the 3x5 cards as your write: it's all in the software.Thanks, and note that I did give this book 3-stars just the same.  The idea is good, but the execution is onerous and largely a ""time suck"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQXLA7XOFJV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399162151#wasThisHelpful","R2MQXLA7XOFJV2","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are three Cap brand hex bars on Amazon.  This one is flat, allowing nice low grip on the bar which is ideal for deadlifts, and this one is rated for #1000 max, but one could only achieve this weight if they owned #100 plates, five on each end. The next one is the one I eventually bought and reviewed, the most popular one, which has two handles: the flat bar, plus two welded on u-handles. This allows one to not have to bend down as much to grip the handles when doing shrugs; it allows one to flip the bar over to have it ""flat"", so dual purpose. It is rated to #750, presumably as the second set of handles had to be welded on and thus a small degree of potential weakness.  This bar has the most Amazon reviews, and the most versatility for anyone not lifting over #750 (in reality, with five #45 plates per side, plus the #50 bar itself, it maxes out at #500, which is true of this bar, too, unless someone owns the #100 Oly plates which few of us do).Finally, the third option is the Mega bar by Cap.  It's longer, has #80 weight in the bar itself, has dual pairs of handles, plus #1000 weight rated (thicker steel) , and fatter grips.  Many of those features would make it harder to move and store, fir instance, lying it against a wall needs a longer wall, and I did not want that. Some might (yet, if I was going longer, I'd want it rackable, which none of these are).Hope that helps you select the best Cap bar for your needs.

"Very happy lifter here.Like other reviewers mention, zinc coating rubs off, so I wiped the entire thing down with a damp rag (which turned black). I think the thing will rust over time, but who cares (it'll look cool, like Bradley Cooper's in American Sniper).Strong welds. Perfectly true and ""square"".  My RAW collar-locks work on it well, no slipping.  This is #50 and feels heavier. I'm so glad that I got this and not the Heavy Duty one by Cap that is #80, which would be harder to lean or hang and store and have handles that are larger, harder to grip.  The one-inch grip and knurling on this model is ideal, and does work with straps, too.. I love Rogue Fitness products, and almost got theirs for $340, shipped. So glad I got this one instead; does everything I need it to do.Appears that I can put 4, maybe five, Oly #45 plates with collar on each end, so that's at least #180, and maybe even #225, per end.  So, including the bar weight, that's #410 minimum, and perhaps as much as #500.  It's weight-rated for #750, which would necessitate very uncommon #100 Oly plates.  I like that it's shorter than the Cap Heavy Duty bar, too, that sells on Amazon for about $160. . The expensive Rogue bars are rackable on Power Rack, which I figured might be good.  But they're 88 inches long!  And, frankly, I'll not use mine in the rack (and if I did, I'd set it on my power rack dip bars or across a bench).Superb for lunges, shrugs, squats, deadlifts. I wanted a means to save my back as regular squats and front squats were starting to ruin my spine.  I thought I'd be limited here by my grip strength, but guess what I do?  I wear my Champion dip belt and toss the chain of the dip belt around the front bar of this Hex Bar.  I then hold it a little further back on the handles; the device rotates a bit forward then and the weight goes through the dip belt chain, into my dip belt and thus is held by my hips! I'd estimate that I can transfer 75% of the weight to the belt with only 25% still in my hand grips by doing this (I adore dip belts). Give it a whirl! Hope this review helped and if you have any questions, let me know.  Great product (which is more than I can say for the Cap brand EZ curl bar which I reviewed a month ago).

My belt size is 32-inches, and my other weight belts fits well (and, yes, I wear then properly, around my lower torso, not my waistline).  So, what size do you think I ordered for this belt based on the sizing chart provided by Amazon?  Small, right?  Well, that's what I ordered, the belt is stamped ""S"", and the clear wrapping package reads Small.  Well, it doesn't fit...it's too small.

"Received the Cap bar yesterday. It was well-packed, but had tape over the end of the long box.FAILED after one use, three sets, 25-pounds per side (50-pounds total for curls). No drops, no user damage. Hopefully I can add photos here: the fixed, inner collar on one side came off completely! It is unusable without the collar, which keeps the weight from sliding all the way across the bar handle. I see, and hopefully the photos will show this, that the collar is spot welded, not welded all the way around the bar. It's almost tacked on! If it did not fail here, within the Amazon return period, I feel that it would have failed eventually. It is a cheap and lousy bar. Amazon asks if I would want a replacement or a refund; refund for sure as a ""new"" Cap bar will do this again. Frankly, I would never buy a Cap bar or any other Cap product again except for Cap standard (not Olympic) plates, which were reasonable (no moving parts, hard to screw those up too badly). Cap Industries, Texas, imported goods: avoid!See photos as I want to show the rinky-dink welding on the inside of this failed collar. It is tacked in about three spots, that's it.

"Couple points, please:Extremely sturdy, 8-bolts to put together, 51 pounds, comes with bolts, washers, nuts and traction tread stickers, super solid.need a metric wrench 17mm I think, and an adjustable wrench to put it together in 15-20 minutes. Can be taken apart in similar time.Unlike cheaper ones on Amazon, this one has a handle height of about 52 inches (4 feet 4 inches). Although there is a step with the center brace, a short person (eg five foot seven or less) likely would appreciate something Shorter.  I'm 5 foot 9 inches and I like it high, esp. When hanging weights from my dip belt, but I do have to climb with the middle crossbar to get up on it.Barbells4me is excellent.  I've bought calf block and other items from them.  Ship out very next business day and FedEx tracking and delivery confirmation provided. Amazing seller, I believe they also sell in popular auction site under different but similar name with one hundred percent feedback.This is the most important thing I can tell you: use your imagination with this product. How so?  I bought a pair of 18-inch, looped on each end, automotive nylon straps for ten bucks on Amazon, paired it with gym rings, and now can do ring exercises underneath the bars by just slipping the strap loop onto the dip handle. I can keep my legs in an L at the Hips and do pull-ups. I can do abdominal crunches.Key, key, KEY: I use this entire stand with it lying down as much as I do with it upright!! What are you jiving about, Wayne? Tip it and lay it down with handles skyward, and I can do hammer-grip triceps push ups, and I can toss resistance bands over the handles and sit on the crossbar to do rows, bicep curls, etc.  Flip it over the other way, with handlebar ends downward, and it sits high from the floor to do close-grip push-ups with hands on crossbar, and step-ups onto the crossbar for crossfit, and various types of push-ups with feet on apparatus, hands on floor, or visa versa.  I can stand on it at the crossbar/upright junction, resistance bands underneath it, to do upright rows, biceps curls, etc. I can lay my back on the crossbar and do bench presses with bands or even dumbbells. There are dozens and dozens of exercises one can do with this stand.Bottom line: It is rock solid and stable upright or laying down and this is where the extra cost over the cheaper dip bars shines, plus the extra weight at 51 lbs (still super easy to flip down, a ten year old could do it) and the height--if shorter, like the eighty dollar dip stand that comes with rings, I could not do all the fabulous under-handle exercises.  When comparing this item to the Fuel Pureformance one, be certain to check build quality, item weight and size...that is critical to using the dip stand for the most exercises and in the most variety of positions (ie. Not just upright). The Pureformance stand is fifty bucks less, but half the height and weight.Frankly, I have the Stamina 1690 power tower and wish I'd just spent the moolah on this dip station plus a separate pull-up bar, ceiling or wall mounted.  I've  heard great things about the Ultimate Body Press over-doorway king stud mounted chin bar (not the portable ones, but mounted) that is fifty four bucks on Amazon.  Plus, barbells4me sells several amazing chin-up bars.  Anyhow, that plus this dip stand and some resistance bands and its a complete gymnasium.Astonishing professional grade. product. Again, use your imagination.  If anyone wants me to try an exercise, or has other tips for exercises, please leave a comment below. Thanks for the help.  Wayne.PS there is a gentleman who reviews this exact dip stand if you search its name on Utube and he shows many angles of the stand in the video; someone should tell him to use it for pull-ups underneath and to lay it down (if he doesn't, he's missing half the possible exercises with this miracle gym-quality stand).

"These are good binoculars. I like the rubberized finish, the glass, the size and weight. I am giving it strongs marks, although for the price point, there are other options. Also, historically, Carson keeps edging the price up--even one month after I bought them here, they are forty dollars more than I paid. So, as they get more pricy, one must consider other options (too numerous to mention here, but including Pentax, Nikon, Steiner, lower end Zeiss, etc). Carson introduced these at an even lower price point than I paid, so watch that price carefully if you are interested in this model.Why the stars deduction? Part of the reason I purchased this model over others is the included shoulder harness and case. The Carson flip down padded case is quick and efficient; there are videos on your favorite online video channel of the case, and it's important to see it so that you know if you want something like it.I thought I would like the BinoArmor case system, but now that I have it, I do not like it for its intended purpose.As others have stated, the rubber elastic that keeps the binos in place is already slightly loose, and will stretch over time and allow the binocs to fall out when they are not secured to one's neck. One single, non-adjustable elastic strap is all that is holding the binoculars in the case. Also, I find the case cumbersome to the point that, if I am birding or at a baseball game, I do not want it on my chest; it's too bulky and rather annoying. Sure, I can unhinge it in 10 seconds, but then I have this huge padded case hanging open and away from my chest, it's truly in the way. It looks stupid and it feels stupid. You may not mind it there for taking a quick look at a bird, but to gaze across a meadow while hunting, to flip the binos up and down constantly as one does at a sporting event (I,e. for most common uses) trust me...you will want to leave this BinoArmor case back in the car.There are little mesh pockets along each side of the case, large enough for a film canister, a len cleaning pen (such as sold by Carson), etc. But, when you flip the case down to use the binoculars, everything in the mesh pockets falls out: they are now upside down! Additionally, one cannot store anything in the case itself because of this opening up design. For such a bulky case to not be able to carry anything other than the binoculars themselves is a waste (pockets go upside down, as stated above; and the insides open up, so anything in there--lens cloth, instructions, etc.--will fall out onto the ground at your feet).I find traditional len caps somewhat of a burden and easily lost, but in this instance, they would provide a sweet alternative to the case. But, none are provided with these binoculars. None can be ordered from Carson based on a thorough read of their website and I have found none that fit well after-market. I never thought I'd say this but: please bring me back my lens covers! The padded case does NOT keep the lenses as dust free as one would want, as dust and dirt can easily blow into the padded case through its many openings, such as for the harness/binoc straps on each side. The option of lens caps would be an improvement from Carson. For instance, since the case is too bulky, especially when hanging open off my chest at a baseball game, I would much rather have the binoculars, uncased, harnessed to my chest with lens caps in place. Not an option with these binoculars: no available lens caps. That is to say, it is not the binoculars that are too large, it's the case.The glasses themselves are good. There is, in fact, great light transmission in low light conditions. I have seen better such as my Zeiss (yep, they cost twice as much) Victory Compact, but the Carson is impressive. Whether one could tell the difference between the ED glass here and non-ED glass on similarly priced models I will leave to the compulsive zealots who review such things. I think the view is fine, but not necessarily better than some Nikon mid-range binoculars that I own, and past Steiner binoculars that I have owned truly shined.The 3D in the name--which sounds awesome, like some form of three dimensional viewing breakthrough-- actually stands for, according to Carson's own videos and the box for this product, Design, Depth and Dimension. Huh??!I wanted to be clear about the shortcomings of the ""system"" of use and storage for these binoculars. Some would say the case and storage are relatively unimportant. I disagree; the case and the ability to handle, use and store fine glass is of vital importance. You will use the case and the strap system every single time you use the binos. The Carson lens protection and case system comes up short.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R950IO71D9853/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091SS2Y8#wasThisHelpful","R950IO71D9853","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm reviewing this bat for my intended purpose: self-defense. It's the perfect heft and length for a below-average to average size person to wield one-handed (a Goliath might want a Lousville Slugger) during an impromptu early morning skirmish in your master bedroom. The aluminum is firm and will not shatter when cracked against solid objects such as forearms, mandibles, shins and skulls; a wooden bat, should it have an occult imperfection in the ash, might splinter, thereby giving your intended target a rather distinct advantage for the remainder of your altercation.The simplicity of the unibody design cannot be topped: no moving parts to fail at inopportune times, such as when your attacker has you in a headlock and you are trying to catch the bridge of his unguarded proboscis with blind back-flicks of your bat-holding wrist  (your other wrist preoccupied by that claustrophobic space between his clenched bicep and your carotid artery, your wrist's desperate efforts slowly failing to bring your vision back to full-field from its dusky descent into tunneling). A bat is designed to never fail, unlike, for instance, a police blackjack baton with its messy two-piece design of rotating handle loosely bolted perpendicular to thermoplastic baton body. While showy, with repeated wrist flicks moving the baton as quickly as the wings of a nectar-feeding hummingbird, this display of power holds little utility for the pajama-clad homeowner who is about to be choked-out by a stranger in front of his wife and two tearful tykes.This bat stores conveniently between my mattress and box-spring and I appreciate that it is narrow enough not to cause ""princess and the pea"" discomfort against my spine during slumber (my ample back-fat perhaps playing an allied role).  This gem has a perfect handle-end to allow, during an intruder situation, a rapid grab-and-deploy, like Zorro pulling his sword from a sheath; the handle end-nub and knurling also permit me the hands-on reassurance that I demand of my home defense weapons, a reassurance that has developed into a nightly ritual, immediately after lying down and saying my prayers, of hanging my hand off the edge of the bed, fingertips gently inserted underneath the mattress, to fondle the business end of the bat handle as I drift into the dreamland of sugarplum fairies.if one of the fairies gets out of line in my dreams (it's usually the drunk one with the club foot), I can right them swiftly with 15 ounces of well-lathed aluminum.Relax.  I jest.  No one is going to use this on a sugarplum fairy; it's exclusively for use againsts felonious miscreants who break my front door glass and reach in to jigger my door lock open at 2AM.This youth-sized aluminum bat--economical, solid, prettily, if rather pansily, painted in pink--is highly recommended for your arm's-reach home arsenal.I suppose one could hit a baseball with it, too, if so inclined.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29D5FJ8JYRPB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RXXO4G#wasThisHelpful","R29D5FJ8JYRPB7","A3775OP5VTX5ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3775OP5VTX5ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works well with the Stamina 1690, a great stand for the price. These handles do not migrate inward when used on this type of stand.

"Received the Cap bar yesterday.  It was well-packed, but had tape over the end of the long box.  The bar has not enough angle to it--I have other EZ curl bars with more angular Z-type bends (such as IronMaster EZ Curl); this one is not much more bending than a straight bar.FAILED after one use, three sets, 25-pounds per side (50-pounds total for curls).  No drops, no user damage.  Hopefully I can add photos here: the fixed, inner collar on one side came off completely!  It is unusable without the collar, which keeps the weight from sliding all the way across the bar handle.  I see, and hopefully the photos will show this, that the collar is spot welded, not welded all the way around the bar.  It's almost tacked on!  If it did not fail here, within the Amazon return period, I feel that it would have failed eventually.  It is a cheap and lousy bar.  Amazon asks if I would want a replacement or a refund; refund for sure as a ""new"" Cap bar will do this again.  Frankly, I would never buy a Cap bar or any other Cap product again except for Cap standard (not Olympic) plates, which were reasonable (no moving parts, hard to screw those up too badly).  Cap Industries, Texas, imported goods: avoid!See photos as I want to show the rinky-dink welding on the inside of this failed collar.  It is tacked in about three spots, that's it.

"Great weight.  50 pounder with ridges to aid grip for placing on machine or for plate-on-chest sit-ups.  Some weights have deeper or completely through grips, but at the expense of diameter to get the same overall weight; I did not want a jumbo diameter plate. 15- inches across. Well-enameled, no burrs or spurs on edges or in center hole. Wiped it down with paper towels and orange cleaner when I got it, but the plate was actually clean.  No weird smells. Looks to be in good round and true. Made in China, and has a California warning label about causing cancer; so if you live outside of California, you should be good to go. See photo. Recommended.P.S.

"Great product, but beware: the Classic set cannot be later upgraded for above 70 lbs . The Elite set at this same weight can. It's due to the handle on this not having additional slider pin slots. Buy this if you never intend to go over seventy pounds per dumbbell.

"Silent Nights is a collection of short stories written by some of the top mystery writers of the Golden Age. Some of the authors will be familiar to you, others won't. Although they're all set during the Christmas season, there is very little holiday spirit to be found in them, so don't pick this book up expecting to make merry.Most of the mysteries seem to involve some sort of puzzle, and country house settings are found in quite a few. (Of course-- everyone goes to their country house for Christmas, don't they?) Editor Martin Edwards' introduction to the book and his individual introductions to each short story are interesting and informative, so I suggest that you don't skip them. One of the interesting tidbits I learned was that several authors represented in this volume wrote stories Alfred Hitchcock later made into films.Having already read another British Library Crime Classic, Resorting to Murder, I knew what to expect. Many of the authors are no longer well known, but others-- like G.K. Chesterton and Dorothy L. Sayers-- are included here. On the whole I enjoyed Silent Nights more, although the quality of the stories is still a bit uneven. My favorites include Edgar Wallace's ""Stuffing,"" J. Jefferson Farjeon's ""The Absconding Treasurer,"" Sayer's ""The Necklace of Pearls,"" Ethel Lina White's ""Waxworks,"" Marjorie Bowen's ""Cambric Tea,"" and ""The Chinese Apple"" by Joseph Shearing (nom de plume of Marjorie Bowen). Of these, Farjeon's and White's stories were used by Hitchcock. ""A Problem in White"" by Nicholas Blake (pseudonym of Cecil Day-Lewis) was unique in the puzzle category. The solution is not included in the story itself, but at the end of the book, giving readers time to mull over the clues and form their own conclusions.If you're a fan of Golden Age mysteries, you're still going to find a new-to-you story or two. If you're a novice like I am, they'll probably all be totally unfamiliar. Since these were written many decades ago when outlooks were quite different, you will run into a racial slur now and again. I chose not to be offended and instead was pleased at how attitudes have changed. I also found it interesting to see how popular crime fiction has changed over time.These British Library Crime Classics being released in the U.S. by Poisoned Pen Press are both entertaining and enlightening, and I recommend them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LM0LHKODS53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204993#wasThisHelpful","R19LM0LHKODS53","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alafair Tucker has been likened to Ma Joad in Steinbeck's classic, The Grapes of Wrath. In many ways that is a perfect description, and if she is Ma Joad, her brother Rob is Tom Joad. America's entry into World War I seemingly brings all the world's problems right to the doorstep of small Boynton, Oklahoma, and as author Donis Casey describes the world Alafair Tucker and her family are living in, readers are reminded that things really haven't changed all that much in a century.One of the things that is so much fun in reading this series is the expansion of the Tucker clan. Alafair's ten children are growing up. The little ones are developing their own personalities. The older ones are getting jobs, moving away from home, marrying, and having children. All this growth and all this change certainly widens the series' perspective, but everything is still filtered through Alafair's eyes.In All Men Fear Me (a phrase taken from a World War I propaganda poster), there's an older man named Nick who wears a bowler hat and loves to lurk in the shadows to overhear conversations and watch people. He made chills run down my spine. Nick almost seemed imbued with a supernatural evil. Notice I said ""almost.""  He's not the only well-delineated character in the book. Each of the various factions in Boynton have their representatives, and Casey does an excellent job at bringing them to life. I have to admit to a preference for Emmanuel Clover, an officious little man who's a stickler for the tiniest of rules. He's the type of man born to spike your blood pressure. Mr. Clover loves his daughter Forsythia Lily dearly, and for some reason that girl's name gave me a fit of the giggles each time I saw it.Sixteen-year-old Charlie gets a lot of the focus in this book, and that young man is a corker. He's full of spit and vinegar and at that age where he's just dying to have an adventure. As a matter of fact it's Charlie who gets to conduct a lion's share of the investigating here-- and it certainly brings out the Mama Bear in Alafair.Donis Casey's Alafair Tucker series started out very good (The Old Buzzard Had It Coming) and just keeps getting better and better. I feel that I know what life on a farm in Oklahoma at the turn of the twentieth century was like. I now also have a good idea of how the area fits in with the rest of the country in terms of things like culture and politics. I've come to care about each and every member of the Tucker clan, and I'd no more miss a book in this series than I'd stop liking lasagna. If you're in the mood for an excellent historical mystery series, let me introduce you to Alafair Tucker.

"Mark de Castrique writes compulsively readable books. There's something about the voice of his main character Sam Blackman that commands attention. If that's not enough, the fast pace of the book grabs a reader from the first tragic courtroom scene and won't let go until the final shot of a discarded piece of metal.Readers have to find out why Hewitt Donaldson is being railroaded, and it's not easy. The man's been very busy for a long long time, and the potential suspect list of people who might hold grudges against him is a long one. But as I said before, it's an intriguing path to the solution, and de Castrique peoples his book (as usual) with characters who don't fit the usual cubbyholes. How many times lately have readers run across a homicide detective who plays well with others and a fundamentalist preacher who isn't portrayed as a complete sleazeball? Not often, eh? This is one of the many reasons why I enjoy de Castrique's books.An added bonus is learning something about the Asheville, North Carolina area. There's a lot more there than you may think, and I certainly did appreciate learning about some of the city's more haunted aspects this time around.Sam Blackman and his partner Nakayla Robertson are two of the good ones, and you should seriously consider reading all of their well-written adventures. Do you have to begin at the beginning? No... it's not mandatory, but don't be surprised if you read A Specter of Justice and find yourself looking for the rest of the series!(I received a digital copy of this book courtesy of Net Galley.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9JKTT6VGJHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204748#wasThisHelpful","RE9JKTT6VGJHQ","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Puffin of Death is filled with Betty Webb's fascination with the people, culture, natural beauty, and wildlife of Iceland, and she easily proves that it's a worthwhile country with which to be enchanted. Although the book has a bit less of the author's humor that I'm used to, there are some laugh-out-loud moments-- particularly in describing the romance novels that the dead man's wife writes. Then there's the little thing about the Accidental Incest App to bring a touch of amazement into the lives of Webb's readers.We get to see Teddy working with the polar bear cub, and getting to know the behavior of the puffins. The information Webb imparts about animals in each book of this series is always choice and heartfelt.As I read, I discovered that the book is more about Iceland than it is about the mystery, which isn't particularly difficult to solve. Instead I was left with mental pictures of Gunn Zoo owner Aster Edwina's reaction to the bills Teddy runs up while there-- especially those incredibly long transatlantic phone calls she makes to her boyfriend. There's some fascinating information in The Puffin of Death, but it's not the strongest book in this series.(I received a digital copy of this book for review courtesy of Net Galley.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YR9LD21I4621/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204144#wasThisHelpful","R2YR9LD21I4621","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm still enjoying both the popularity of this fictional lighthouse library and its setting, but I have to be honest and admit that I picked up Booked for Trouble with a bit of trepidation. It's a quirk of mine, but I do not care for high maintenance parents in the cozies that I read, and that's exactly what Lucy's mother is. I am happy to report that although Suzanne is not the type of person to ever become my BFF, that angle of the book was not as bad as I'd anticipated. Whew!Lucy continues to be an interesting main character, but too many of the secondary characters are two-dimensional. Take Charlene for example. It would appear that her sole reason for existence is to annoy everyone with her passion for rap music-- and she's the only one who really stands out in my mind. The rest are a kind of blur, and I hope book three is the ""breakout"" book for them. Speaking of breaking out, Lucy's two love interests need to stop spinning their wheels and start making some moves.Although I enjoyed reading how Lucy finally found the killer, I knew the person's identity early on due to a certain peculiarity in the dialogue. I can be strange that way sometimes.  And have any of you noticed that the latest thing in cozies seems to be cross-marketing-- that is, mentioning books by other cozy writers? At least it fits in here because Lucy is a librarian, but I've been noticing it in several books lately. I realize that things like this place a book clearly within its timeframe, but I prefer my books without branding, marketing, or suggestive selling.Booked for Trouble is a good solid mystery with a winning main character and a perfect setting; however, it needs some of its other components to be fleshed out more so this series can shine the way I know that it can.(I purchased my copy of this book at The Poisoned Pen.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WZ0BIOMIPNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045147094X#wasThisHelpful","R30WZ0BIOMIPNC","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any reader who's a fan of Jacqueline Winspear's Maisie Dobbs or Charles Todd's Bess Crawford should definitely give Susan Elia MacNeal's Maggie Hope series a try. I've been a MacNeal fan since the first book in the series, Mr. Churchill's Secretary. There's something about a strong, intelligent female faced with the world at war that pulls me right into a story-- if it's well written-- and MacNeal's books certainly are.I like how the author weaves fascinating historical facts into her stories. This time the subplot featuring wrongfully accused Wendell Cotton and his defender Andi Martin are based on fact and highlight Eleanor Roosevelt's activism. This subplot also serves to illustrate the President and First Lady's desire to help the disenfranchised-- and how much they were disliked for it in certain circles. FDR had to tread carefully in order to get approval for his most important legislation-- like America's entry into the war. Eleanor found this extremely distasteful and tried to circumvent her husband's caution and political maneuverings. This would make her a perfect target for the sort of plot MacNeal has created.Once again both fictional and historical characters come to life, although I do wish there were fewer references to Franklin's and Eleanor's teeth. FDR's daily routine, his love of martinis, Eleanor's direction of food and hospitality in the White House-- even a quirk or two of Churchill's all ring true and revved up my enthusiasm even more. Add bugged rooms, wire tapping and the like, and you've got a fast-paced story of which you must know the outcome.Everything was wrapped up rather abruptly at the end, which leaves me wondering what Maggie will be up to in the next book. If you're new to the series, do you have to read them in order? I would advise it because of various events in the series' timeline and because Maggie's character grows and changes throughout. But if you're caught up with Maisie and Bess, you've got time for a new series with a strong female lead, don't you? Even if you don't, Maggie is certainly worth making time for!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HHNVIA2MJQBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178704#wasThisHelpful","R2HHNVIA2MJQBQ","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some ways, A Death in the Family is a departure for this wonderful series. Having read all the books with tremendous enjoyment, I know that Kubu has always had a close and loving relationship with his parents. Wilmon Bengu's death is catastrophic for Kubu. Kubu has been in many tight situations, but readers have never seen him grief-stricken or enraged. He comes within a whisker of throwing his entire career away. He scarcely eats throughout the book, and Kubu is a man who has always been passionate about his food. His impatience, his frustration, his grief are felt throughout the book like a steady but subtle vibration in the air. Kubu's frame of mind will make readers turn the pages faster and faster in order to unmask the killer.The investigation in A Death in the Family is a very complex one with many threads, and it was fascinating to watch those threads being pulled out, examined, and woven into a satisfying conclusion. The facts the writing team of Michael Stanley includes in the story are fascinating. Yes, we learn more about the inner workings of the Botswana government, but it's Wilmon's struggles with Alzheimer's and this country's funeral traditions and those of kgotle (a structured and rather familial type of town meeting) that add so much texture and richness to the book.Is an angry Kubu as readable as a funny Kubu? Most definitely! If you love Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books, are you going to like Michael Stanley's Detective Kubu? Chances are very good that you will. To be honest, I prefer Kubu to Precious Ramotswe-- there's a bit less charm and more bite to the stories of Michael Stanley. You can step in just about anywhere in these books, but Kubu's life isn't an unchanging one. Start at the beginning with A Carrion Death so you won't miss one little bit of my favorite-- and the best-- detective in Botswana. The entire series is excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WVRGZPDZTMFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250070899#wasThisHelpful","R1WVRGZPDZTMFB","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diane Vallere's Material Witness series is probably my favorite new cozy series. In Crushed Velvet, you'll find a very good mystery with plenty of misdirection, although it's not Poly's fault. She keeps trying to shove Sheriff Clark in the right direction-- she knows that her shipment of velvet has something to do with the murder-- but the ""something"" turns out to be a total surprise.Vallere has also assembled a first-rate cast. Poly is a perfect blend of smarts and sass, and it's a pleasure to follow her around while she's investigating. Genevieve (tea shop owner) and Charlie (resident mechanic) not only have interesting backgrounds of their own, they make the best kind of girlfriends for Poly. And the chemistry between Poly and Vaughn sizzles and pops as they stumble around getting to know one another. It's also wonderful to see the main character in a cozy series who actually has two loving parents. Too often one parent (or both) behave like escapees from a mental institution. I even have my eye on Poly's busybody next-door shop owner, although I don't know if I want her to be the dead body or just charged with murder. (Can you tell I'm enjoying these books?)Another facet in this Material Witness series is the real estate developers and finance companies focused on this small California town. These folks are back deep in the shadows and remind me of vultures waiting for something to die. It can be easy to forget they're there-- but don't.Like the first book, Suede to Rest, Vallere continues to lure me with fabrics, and I don't even like to sew. In that first book, I was disappointed that Poly didn't finish the transformation of Genevieve's tea shop. Well, she doesn't finish it here either, but the process is absolutely fascinating. Vallere makes me feel as though I've had a hand in it all.I'm hoping that the opening of Material Girl will be a wild and unequivocal success because I can't wait for the next book in the series!(My copy of this book was purchased at The Poisoned Pen.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R272C6QMCQENJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425270580#wasThisHelpful","R272C6QMCQENJ","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who picks up Fall of Man in Wilmslow believing it to have the lightning pace and other qualities befitting a thriller is in for a shock. I've seen snails move faster than the pace of this book, and although it satisfies a bit here and there, it certainly doesn't in most areas.There are biographies of Alan Turing that will tell you more about this fascinating and cruelly treated man than Lagercrantz's novel. Instead it's more of an exploration of the character of Leonard Corell, a young, dissatisfied man who feels as though he's never lived up to his childhood dreams and potential. During the course of the book, Corell will learn just as much about himself as he will about Turing.As he begins to investigate, his beliefs are colored by witch hunters who firmly believe all homosexuals are evil Communist spies; however, his opinions change the more he learns about the dead man.It was a fight to keep my interest in this book. There are just too many deadly dull pages of math, theory, and philosophy-- and I will be the first to admit that those subjects work better for me as personal cures for insomnia. So yes, I skimmed. The book only truly came to life when Corell spoke to people who actually knew Turing, but that didn't happen often enough.As an exploration of a young man's character, Fall of Man in Wilmslow is a very modest success. On almost every other score, it came up lacking.(My copy of this book was purchased at The Poisoned Pen.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15AAAZKCTXDQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857059890#wasThisHelpful","R15AAAZKCTXDQ8","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have enjoyed every single one of Kate Morton's books, and The Lake House is no exception. Extremely few writers have Morton's knack for interweaving multiple storylines, time periods, and characters.Throughout the entire book the Cornish estate of Loeanneth kept me spellbound, no matter the time period. From beloved home to neglected shell, Morton's descriptions held me in the palm of her hand because no matter the state of the place, Morton described a home that was loved, not hated. All that needed to be done was to have the secrets brought out into the light.Young police detective Sadie Sparrow is the perfect character to bring those secrets to light. She is an absolute terrier at digging them up... although she has a secret or two of her own that she doesn't want to share.Pitted against young Sadie is the much older and wiser Alice (A.C.) Edevane-- a strong character no matter the age at which Morton portrays her. We see Alice's parents falling in love, and we see Alice, her parents and siblings happily ensconced in Loeanneth. At the age of sixteen Alice is already writing novels. She's such a bright, inquisitive child, and so eager to become an adult. But her world comes crashing down around her after a party at Loeanneth. Hundreds of people attended, but only one cannot be accounted for: Alice's eleven-month-old brother Theo. The infant is never seen again, and the tragedy shatters the Edevane family.The Lake House has so many interlocking secrets and so many possible solutions to what happened to Theo-- more than enough to keep all our little grey cells hopping. We learn about all these secrets as the time period swings to and fro naturally from present day to 1911, 1933, and 1941. Kate Morton has done it again: created a world, characters, and a story that kept me fascinated from first page to last.(I received a digital copy of this book from Net Galley.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ET91SE93REQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451649320#wasThisHelpful","R32ET91SE93REQ","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to know what it's like to be a woman in a male-dominated world like the U.S. Navy, read Anne Wilson's Hover. If you want to know about the technology and training that goes into being a Navy helicopter pilot, read Anne Wilson's Hover. If you want to feel as though you're participating in secret Navy SEAL missions, read Anne Wilson's Hover. And if that's not enough for you, throw in a toe-curling romance.As I've already stated, Sara Denning is a mass of contradictions. The words she uses to describe the sea can make a person's skin crawl-- and I love the ocean. It definitely made me wonder why on earth she would deliberately choose to join the Navy. Readers aren't left to wonder for long: Sara is carrying a boatload of guilt over her brother's death. She's thrown up so many defensive walls to help her cope-- and even excel-- at something she's petrified of that it's a wonder she's still sane. Hover is a character study of Sara Denning, and it's a fascinating one even though it has more romance in it than I would prefer.  I do have to say that yes, I did find the romance annoying from time to time, but it is essential to the growth of Sara's character, so I just sat back and dealt with it.Dealing with it wasn't all that difficult because there were so many other facets of the book that I enjoyed-- what some readers might call the Tom Clancy elements of military technology and training, those training missions, being part of a carrier strike force, and Sara's being groomed for a top secret mission. These elements shouldn't be too over-the-top for most female readers because of the focus on-- yes-- that romance, and on Sara's relationships with her best friend, her fellow pilots, and her superior officers. Throw in some shore leave in Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates, and Hover is a book that kept my attention from first page to last. If this is a first novel (and it is), I'm really looking forward to Anne Wilson's next book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3FTVDYZZE8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765378493#wasThisHelpful","R3T3FTVDYZZE8C","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I looked forward to reading Siren of the Waters with a great deal of anticipation. It takes place in a part of Europe I know little about and deals a bit with the old Communist regime. Unfortunately the book has some problems that kept me from truly enjoying it.For all the amazing cities that the book takes place in, the settings are rather ordinary and never come to life. And in speaking of coming to life, Jana is the only fully-fleshed character in the entire story. The rest of the characters are two-dimensional at best.The story of Siren of the Waters depends heavily on Jana's backstory in Communist Slovakia, but it doesn't really advance the current investigation. When I finished reading this mystery, I had no real feel for where the series is headed and no real interest in the characters.

"I've enjoyed David Cole's Laura Winslow series for its edgy main character, its depiction of the desert, and for some of the hard-hitting issues the author brings into his stories.""Laura Winslow"" is a false identity for this woman hiding from a dangerous and painful past on the reservation. She constantly fights her addiction to Ritalin, which makes her thoughts jump all over the place until she can't concentrate. Since Scorpion Rain is written from Laura's point of view, I sometimes felt as though I couldn't concentrate and that my own thoughts were skittering around inside my skull. That's  the best way for a writer to get readers inside his character's head.Because of her past and because of her addiction, Laura has trust issues-- especially concerning the government. She should believe in herself more, but it's difficult. Her past is always going to haunt her; her past is always going to be her weak link.Scorpion Rain is a twofold mystery. One concerns the kidnapping of Laura's friend Meg. That mystery is solved, and we are given our answers. However, the second mystery (which I won't give away) is not answered, which bothered me a bit.Laura also bothered me, and I wasn't rooting for her success to the same degree as I have in the past. It has me wondering if I've outgrown this character in the time since I read the previous book (Stalking Moon). I hope not because this has always been one of my ""go to"" series. I'll just let Laura percolate away in the back of my brain for a while before I pick up the next book.

"Patricia Finney knows how to drag readers right into the midst of life in Elizabethan London with all its sights, sounds, and smells. Yes, the murders are vicious (shades of the much later Jack the Ripper), but Finney is a pro-- leavening the action with laugh-out-loud humor in just the right places. From Shakespeare's chicken-raising landlady to people's reactions to James or his sister Portia, we laugh and we can also learn, as when one indignant woman exclaims that no decent woman wears underpants. (How times have changed!) It's also a time in which no decent woman can go out alone without an escort, and this causes James's reclusive sister the occasional problem.The story moves along at a fine pace, and I was keeping a close eye on two particular suspects. I was half right, and the resolution was a surprise, which is always a plus. I look forward to Finney's next James Enys adventure with a great deal of anticipation. Her deft ways with all the major ingredients of storytelling-- plot, pacing, setting, characters, and humor-- make her books an absolute pleasure to read. A minor quibble with this Kindle edition of Do We Not Bleed? was its numerous instances of bad formatting, but I'm sure those will be corrected when next I see Mr. Enys... and Peter the Hedgehog.

"There are three big questions in All Sales Final: (1) Why's Maggie dragging her feet over this wedding? (2) Who's the skeleton in the basement and who killed him? and (3) What's up with Maggie's arch enemy, Summer? Author Josie Belle (AKA Jenn McKinlay) answers them all in fine-- if a bit rushed-- style.Any woman who's marrying at Maggie's age is going to have some emotional baggage and some serious doubts, and McKinlay deals with these issues in a sensitive, understanding manner that fits the characters of both Maggie and Sam. A good deal of the humor in this book revolves around Maggie's enemy- since-high-school, Summer-- a character that I always found a bit over-the-top. Summer undergoes a bit of a transformation in All Sales Final that I found not only funny but believable.I mentioned above that I felt this book was a bit rushed. Several elements could have been developed more fully, but part of me understands why they weren't. This is-- sadly-- the last Good Buy Girls mystery, and fleshing out new characters or developing certain plot threads more fully would not stamp THE END on the story of Maggie and her friends.This entire series has not only been about good mysteries and good fun, it's been a wonderful celebration of friendship. I've laughed, cried, and just plain felt good reading about the lives of these characters, and I will sincerely miss them.

"This follow-up to the first Detective Lavender mystery, The Heiress of Linn Hagh, is set in an actual theatre of the time that was run by a woman. And speaking of women, Lavender's love interest, the beautiful Spanish Magdalena, plays a much more important role in this book-- both as lover and in having her share of the action. In that day attitudes towards Catholics generally were not at all sympathetic, especially the opinions of people in authority. If Lavender marries Magdalena, it could be a career-ending (or at least -limiting) move. It will be interesting to see how Charlton deals with this in future books.The pacing of The Sans Pareil Mystery tends to be slow until just before the end when all the pieces of the puzzle start coming together. It's a solid entry in this fledgling series and holds a great deal of promise for the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1693EKQ1HG4FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947823#wasThisHelpful","R1693EKQ1HG4FV","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeff Cohen ups the ante in his second Asperger's mystery featuring Samuel Hoenig. While enlightening for those readers unacquainted with people who have Asperger's, The Question of the Unfamiliar Husband is a truly enjoyable read with many laugh-out-loud moments and a devilishly clever mystery to solve.In the first book, The Question of the Missing Head, Samuel was seemingly obsessed with his timetable for exercise, and I have to admit that I was a bit worried that his persistence would carry over to this second book. Too much of a good thing is... too much. But Cohen is too smart for that. Yes, Samuel gets some exercise in this book, but now his main concern is vehicular safety, and I spent my time either being amused at his behavior... or agreeing with him.Once again, I am impressed with the parenting skills of Samuel's mother. The type of support ""Aspies"" get at home is crucial in how well they fit into society. Samuel's mother is a strong and very wise woman, and I admire her-- as I do the other woman in Samuel's life, Janet Washburn. Janet enjoys a good challenge, which is why she enjoys working with Samuel and his ""questions"" so much, and it's her calm demeanor and quick thinking that makes them such a good team. If you're going to be the sidekick, be the best, and Janet is. I like her so much that I hope she takes center stage in a future book.The solution to this clever mystery depends on so many things. Planted clues. A knowledge of Christie. A coincidence. And not blindly following accepted beliefs about certain groups of people. The Question of the Unfamiliar Husband certainly kept me smiling and guessing.One of Samuel's endearing traits is his insistence that he can tell a lot about a person by that person's favorite Beatles song. I wonder what he would tell me if I let him know that mine is ""In My Life""?Samuel, his mother, and Janet have certainly worked themselves into my heart, and I look forward to their next adventure with a great deal of anticipation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8444MKD221MT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073874350X#wasThisHelpful","R8444MKD221MT","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of A.D. Scott's series since the very first book, A Small Death in the Great Glen. The setting of the Scottish Highlands in the 1950s is vivid, and a rock solid foundation for each book.The plot of A Kind of Grief was set in motion by the story of the last witch burned in Scotland. Alice Ramsay is the alleged witch here, and there are alternating sections of the book told in her voice. She's a strong, likable woman with secrets that Scott has readers itching to learn. And what better way to learn them than through the persistence of Joanne Ross, another unconventional woman who's had to fight to find her own path to happiness for herself and her children? Joanne is still recuperating from devastating injuries that occurred in a previous book, and Alice Ramsay strikes a chord with her. Joanne's interest soon turns into obsession, and with those government types lurking in the shadows, it's altogether too easy for readers to begin to fear for this vulnerable woman.But it's not just shadowy agents and oily art critics who need to be feared. There's a small-minded, evil-tongued woman in Alice's village-- the dreaded Mrs. MacKenzie-- who's gone so far past the mere title of gossipmonger that it boggles the mind. Scott uses characters like MacKenzie to prove that danger can live in plain sight... right in our midst.I love Scott's books for their setting and their complex stories, but it's her characters and her insight into human nature that make them dear to my heart. A Kind of Grief is another strong entry in this series, and I look forward to the next. A.D. Scott's writing reminds me a great deal of Louise Penny's, and I would urge Penny's fans to sample life in the Highlands. Scott's characters grow and change throughout the series, so I recommend starting at the beginning. You're in for a treat.(Review copy courtesy of Net Galley.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N9JDSBWD3IAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434A1I#wasThisHelpful","R3N9JDSBWD3IAI","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Jeffrey Siger lives part of the year on the Greek island of Mykonos, and he certainly has his fingers on the pulse of what's going on in that beleaguered country. His vivid settings showcase a different part of Greece in each book, and readers learn the customs of the country along the way. (In Devil of Delphi, we learn the unique way the Greek government has of dealing with citizens' real estate taxes and electric bills.)As exciting and as timely as Siger's plots are, it's his sense of humor and his characters that really make me come back, book after book. Now a husband and father, Kaldis's family life plays a large part in the series, and his wife usually manages to steal the scene at least once per book. Add a secretary who's so good you'd swear she was psychic along with a crack team of investigators, and you have the stage set for a rip-roaring tale. Even Kaldis's boss shows unexpected depth in Devil of Delphi, and Kharon is the perfect type of bad guy: skilled, scary, and intriguingly principled. He's a refreshing change from loutish villains whose one-size-fits-all solution to everything is unreasoning violence.I think that one of the reasons why I enjoyed this book (and the series) so much is that Kaldis and his men are smart enough to know when to sit back, observe carefully, and let the bad guys take care of business. Like Kharon, these men know how to think, and this makes for excellent reading.There's an unexpected development for Kaldis at the end of Devil of Delphi that has me anxiously awaiting the next book. This seventh book in the series can be read as a standalone, but don't blame me if you find yourself finishing it and looking for all the others. They're that good.(Review copy of book from Net Galley.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z81OROSC7JUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204322#wasThisHelpful","R1Z81OROSC7JUR","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Timothy Hallinan's first Poke Rafferty book, A Nail Through the Heart, blew me away, and I've been a fan ever since. Rafferty has changed over the years. Where once he was a bit of a smart aleck, now as a husband and a father (and with a baby on the way), his thoughtfulness, compassion, and ability to think through difficult situations have come to the fore. In addition, his adopted daughter Miaow, a former street child, never fails to surprise or tug at the heartstrings. She gives every appearance of being a typical self-absorbed teenager, but don't let her fool you.Hallinan deftly adds touching personal details about the lives of his characters amid chill-inducing action sequences. As we learn why Poke is reluctant to leave a too-small apartment and why the adoption his policeman friend is considering is fraught with problems, in the back of our minds lurks the deadly Varney. He's a man capable of anything, and it shows the caliber of man Rafferty is when-- at the first sign of danger-- the first thing he does is get his wife and daughter out of harm's way.The Hot Countries resolves the story of Haskell Murphy, an unofficial trilogy begun in The Fear Artist; however, it's not a permanent resolution. His daughter Treasure, who's suffered tremendous abuse in her short life, is now a part of the lives of Poke, his family, and his friends. And Treasure is a young girl who inspires great compassion and great distrust. She is one more reason-- among many-- for me to continue being enthralled with the evolution of this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQXKEY75L2TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V28NXC6#wasThisHelpful","R1AQXKEY75L2TA","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I downloaded this book to my Kindle on the strength of the synopsis and recommendations from friends, and then I promptly forgot about it. I've been making a point to go back to read the earliest books I downloaded. I'm not much of a cat person, so when A Load of Old Bones started out with ""The Cat's Memoir"" in Maurice's voice, I didn't know how far I would be able to read. That uncertainty held until chapter three, ""The Dog's Diary."" When I read the very first thing Bouncer the dog said, I burst into laughter.This book reminds me of the old ""Columbo"" television series when you knew the identity of the killer and all you had to do was sit back and watch the detective put all the clues together to catch him. What made me a bit uneasy is how quickly I accepted Oughterard killing a woman and covering it up. It undoubtedly has a lot to do with the fact that the dreaded Mrs. F. is the type of person who makes most of those who meet her want to strangle her.As a fan of Spencer Quinn's Chet and Bernie mysteries, I have no problem with dogs (and the occasional cat) speaking to me, but what surprised me was how harmoniously the voices of Oughterard, Bouncer and Maurice blended together. Between the three of them, a reader gets the complete picture, and watching these two animals come to the aid of the vicar is laugh-out-loud funny.There is very little interplay between the characters in A Load of Old Bones. You're going to spend most of your time in the heads of a vicar, a dog, and a cat. I had a delightful time there; however, I don't think I want to repeat the experience. There are other books in this series, which came as no surprise because there was a strong foreshadowing of blackmail at the end, but I don't think I'd find another visit to Molehill to be nearly as much fun. I'd rather stop with this book and keep the good memories and the smile on my face.(Purchased a Kindle edition of this book that is no longer available on Amazon.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E9Q1G0G6X2HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184901096X#wasThisHelpful","R2E9Q1G0G6X2HT","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In reading Those We Left Behind, I was moved to pity for Ciaran Devine, the boy everyone felt free to take advantage of his entire life, but that was the most involvement I felt. To me the story was all too predictable from beginning to end and filled with people for whom I really didn't care. It's well-written and the pacing flows smoothly, but unfortunately the entire story felt lifeless. I know that Stuart Neville is well regarded, and since this is the first book of his I've read, I'll read another of his books in the future.

"When I begin reading a book, the only real expectation I have is that it will be good. I don't care how it gets me to the Land of Good, I just want that to be my destination. Unfortunately my train to the Promised Land was shunted off on a siding and never made it to the end of the line when I read The Genius.The Genius is more family saga than thriller. Criminal investigation in this book is not all glitz, glamour, action, and suspense. Here it's quite a hard slog to get to the answers. The premise-- who is the missing-- brilliant if eccentric-- artist named Victor Cracke is the one thing that kept me going clear to the end of this book. The only thing I really found interesting was the background information provided on the cutthroat art world. All the characters left me cold.When I finally learned the identity of Victor Cracke, I discovered that I'd been led in, through, and out of the (to me) tired story of a rags-to-riches family who covered up and denied much in order to retain its veneer of respectability-- at great cost to those who needed its love and protection the most. It was a story that I just was not in the mood for in any size, shape, or form. There are times when I have no patience whatsoever for the type of people Kellerman's story was all about. This was one of those times-- which means your mileage most certainly will vary!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CV1QF30G64DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IUTMDS#wasThisHelpful","R1CV1QF30G64DX","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a dedication that simply states ""To Rex, Julie, and Audrey"" it's easy to see that I'm not the only one who thinks of these actors when coming in contact with George Bernard Shaw's immortal characters. As a newcomer to this series, I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a wonderful blend of the Edwardian world and ""My Fair Lady."" The authors spoonfed just enough of the plot of the first book (Wouldn't It Be Deadly) to whet my appetite for it and to keep me from being confused.The writing team known as D.E. Ireland have created a lovely evocation of time and place. In Move Your Blooming Corpse, it's June 1913-- those last halcyon days before Europe shatters into World War I. The authors treat us not only to Royal Ascot Week, we also are able to attend the Henley Regatta. We move among the wealthy, the titled, the privileged-- and some of those wanting a few more privileges. With Eliza as an enthusiastic partner, we are treated to all the marvelous fashions, and we go deep into the heart of the organizations of women who are fighting for the right to vote. We also attend the races, walk the paddock area, take a look back at the stables, and learn about racing syndicates, bloodlines, and kidnapping. If that last part bothers you, don't worry. Although horse racing does play an important role in the book, it doesn't overwhelm the story. No need to bring out the feedbag or curry comb!Once all the characters were properly introduced, I didn't have a difficult time in identifying the killer, but as in all good examples of the art, whodunit isn't the sole aim of crime fiction. I luxuriated in the setting and was delighted by the interplay between the characters-- especially Eliza and Henry, and Eliza and her father. I can't say that I was much enamored of Madame Lafarge, but she certainly did add to the wit and humor in the book.This writing team is doing a marvelous job of taking well-known characters, making them their own, and placing them in a jewel box of a setting. Eliza, Henry, and the others are showing us facets of themselves that they've never had the opportunity to before. I suppose solving murders does have a tendency to do that....","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R289YBD6W3WO25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049369#wasThisHelpful","R289YBD6W3WO25","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zack Walker is the kind of guy who would undoubtedly drive me insane in real life. He spends way too much of his time ""borrowing trouble."" Fortunately I don't know anyone like him; therefore, I can laugh my way through his escapades in Linwood Barclay's wonderful books. There is indeed plenty of laugh-out-loud humor in Bad Guys, as there was in the first book in the series, Bad Move.One of the things that makes us laugh the most when reading about Zack is that most of his problems are caused by his own paranoia. He does B to prevent A, which creates C. C collides with A, making all Hades break loose in D, with no one in Zack's family talking to him or even wanting to look at him. If he'd just left well enough alone... but no, he can't, and he should just save time and build himself a dog house out in the backyard, complete with heating, air conditioning, TV... the works. He'll be spending a lot of time there. He just can't help himself. If he weren't so good-hearted and well-intentioned, we wouldn't love him so much as we shake our heads and laugh.Another fun thing to do is to pay attention to the things or the people Zack is introduced to and try to figure out how they're going to blend into the story a few chapters down the road. Because they will. Barclay has a very subtle way of shining a little spotlight on something that lets you know you need to pay attention. Whether it's a route to avoid paying parking fees, or a son who actually seems to like some creepy guy following his sister around, readers not only need to laugh when reading a Zack Walker book, they need to pay attention and to think ahead. Just think of yourselves as Sherlock Holmes to Zack's Dr. Watson.Now that I've laughed (and gasped) my way through Bad Guys (because Barclay knows how to write first-rate action scenes that scare the pudding out of us), I have to get my hands on the third book in the series, Lone Wolf. Linwood Barclay's Zack Walker books should not be missed!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABV03T027XVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553587056#wasThisHelpful","R1ABV03T027XVQ","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aline Templeton's Marjory Fleming series is one of my very favorite character-driven crime fiction series, and Dead in the Water is yet another strong entry. This is a book about mistakes. Mistakes people may have made back in 1985-- including Marjory's own father. Mistakes involving the ever-perfectionist Sheila Milne. And Marjory's own mistakes made both on the job and in her private life.Naturally once Fleming gets to work on the cold case, the local bad boys get busy so more work gets thrown on her desk. It's like kicking open an anthill. There's a stalker at the estate where there's a film shoot on location. An area thug who likes to use knives is busy. There are short-fused Polish laborers working for a couple with too much time and money on its hands. And when all of this comes to a head, Marjory's personal life goes into a tailspin. Yes, there are a lot of plates spinning in the air, but Templeton is an expert at keeping them all going, keeping them all interesting, and keeping them all from getting tangled up and confusing.She's also an expert at creating three-dimensional characters that readers really grow to care about. For instance, one of the decisions Marjory makes practically had me frothing at the mouth in agitation, and in fact I was talking out loud. Yes. Talking out loud. To a fictional character. I wanted to get hold of her and shake some sense into her. When I get this involved with characters, I know they're good-- and I know the story is good as well.And Marjory isn't the only character who could sit down at my kitchen table. There's her husband, her children, her mother, and Detective Sergeant Tam MacNee, he of the infuriating behavior and brilliant flashes of deduction. I can always count on Tam for a little comic relief when a situation becomes too deadly serious.After yet another satisfying ending to a puzzling mystery, I have to ask myself why I read these books so slowly. They are so good, you'd think I'd swallow them all whole, one after another. Ah-- but that's the reason why I read them slowly. They are ""go-to"" books for me. I know I can depend on them for their consistent high quality-- and you can, too. Dead in the Water reads well as a standalone, but if you like this type of mystery, I'd suggest you begin at the beginning (Cold in the Earth). You are definitely going to like Big Marge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RK9P892BH2OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3DDZC#wasThisHelpful","R2RK9P892BH2OO","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book by Scottish writer Gerald Hammond that I've read, and it won't be my last. Dog in the Dark is characterized by a well-plotted mystery, three fleshed-out primary characters that readers grow to know and like, and a simple, straightforward prose style that's like slipping into your favorite pair of flannel pajamas on a cold winter night.John Cunningham isn't your usual main character. He's hounded by a mysterious ailment that strikes suddenly and repeatedly, leaving him weak and in bed. He's smart and observant, and when he isn't solving the mystery, he's sharing lots of lore on dog training and breeding.Gerald Hammond's writing isn't flashy, and it's not going to make you sit back and murmur, ""Wow!"" It's not the kind of writing that wins tons of awards. But sometimes quiet is the best. Sometimes quiet slips a lot more past you. When I finished reading Dog in the Dark, I sat back and thought to myself, ""Now, I really liked that!

"I really enjoy Hannah Reed's Scottish Highlands cozy series, particularly for the setting. In Hooked on Ewe, Reed gives us a good look at a staple in the Highlands: sheep dog trials. Having seen them myself in the beautiful little village of Luss, I appreciated Reed's description. We're also treated to a bit of knitting, and Eden climbs aboard a boat and goes out into the Moray Firth.The mystery is a good one, involving quite a chase around the suspect list, and Reed applies a strong dash of humor-- especially in the relationship between Inspector Jamieson and Constable Stevens. Jamieson prefers working solo, and since Stevens annoys the stuffing out of him, Jamieson is always dreaming up busy work for the constable to get him out of his hair. Constable Stevens is coming into his own a bit because he has a particularly funny scene all his own.There's an added bonus in this series. Since Eden is an aspiring author, readers are treated to some of the creative as well as the nuts-and-bolts publishing processes in writing. However, as much as I enjoyed Hooked on Ewe, I did have a few problems with it. First of all, I cannot believe that any police force in Scotland would agree to give someone special constable status when she's on a six-month tourist visa that's half over. I was also a bit puzzled over the motivations of the dead woman, but I can't say any more because I'd have to divulge too much of the plot.The third thing that bugged me was a point of geography, which won't bother readers who haven't traveled extensively in Scotland. I have, so when I read that a character's sister, who was returning to Glasgow from a holiday on the Isle of Skye, decided to swing past Glenkillen to pick up her Skein-of-the-Month package, it just didn't add up. People in the UK don't tend to drive long distances. If you had to pay what they do for gasoline, you'd understand why. The drive between Glasgow and Skye is long enough on its own-- and Glenkillen is in the exact opposite direction by more than just a few miles. I know. I'm being picky!Geography aside, I enjoy the mysteries and the characters in this series. I look forward to my next visit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8ZMZY2C8WNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425265838#wasThisHelpful","RV8ZMZY2C8WNM","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to the too-brief Lomax and Biggs mystery series, you can always count on dialogue that snap-crackle-pops, and plenty of wit to make you laugh out loud. Team that with a smooth fast pace and a firecracker of a mystery, and you've got a book that won't let you go until you turn the last page.This is Mike and Terry's show, but that doesn't keep other characters from hogging the limelight. Mike's dad, Big Jim Lomax, is a law unto himself, and if you've got any sense, you won't eat one of Big Jim's Famous Cajun Cows on a Bun. Let his son Mike tell you why: ""The last time I ate one of your burgers it burned the hair right off my chest. From the inside. Hold the Cajun on ours."" See what I mean? I think I'll pass. I like spicy, not incendiary.In this fourth book, Mike learns a side to his personality that he never knew he had, and it's all due to a little girl named Sophie. If Sophie can't charm you, no one can. Trust me. I'm not necessarily child friendly, but Sophie turned me into a believer.I do need to temper my Lomax and Biggs Admiration Society tribute just a bit though. I did find that the final mile to the killer stretched the rubber band of my credulity until I got snapped on the end of my nose. What did I do when that happened and I was faced with a few too many plot twists? I dove right back in. If you're in the mood for funny, fast, and mysterious, you can't go wrong with Lomax and Biggs. You're in the mood? Good! Do you have to start at the beginning with The Rabbit Factory? Technically, no.

"If there is one thought I carried away from The Cadaver Game it's if the future lies in our children, we sometimes have reason to be very afraid. To say more would be to give away more of the plot than I care to do.This is my sixteenth outing with Wesley, his team, and his boss Gerry Heffernan. I've watched each character grow and enjoyed the way Kate Ellis blends a modern police procedural series (Wesley) with archaeology and history (his friend Neil Watson). It's always good to catch up with Ellis's characters, although I did notice that their private lives had a smaller presence in this book than in previous ones. I think I know why.The present-day police and archaeological work is interspersed with chapters from the diaries of two men who worked on the Catton Hall estate. Some readers may think that the historical details in this book are a bit fantastical, so I would urge them to read Ellis's notes at the back of the book.If there's a bit less about the characters' personal lives in The Cadaver Game, I think it has a lot to do with the excellent and intricate plot that the author has created. It's the very best sort of jigsaw puzzle in which most of the fun is in trying to put all the pieces together without bending the corners of any of them. I have to admit that I usually prefer characterization above all (not that I want a badly constructed story!), but once in a while I come across such a finely crafted plot that I just have to let the characters take a little holiday. Knowing Ellis the way I do, all her marvelous people will be back stronger than ever in the next book (The Shadow Collector), and I have it waiting for me. This consistently high quality series has been one of my favorites ever since I read the first book.(My copy of this book was purchased at The Poisoned Pen Bookstore.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K7QDMZ7VW2JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749953772#wasThisHelpful","R1K7QDMZ7VW2JQ","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always enjoy Chris Grabenstein's Ceepak and Boyle mysteries, and Mind Scrambler was no exception. Strong characters, a strong setting, and a strong mystery laced with Grabenstein's trademark humor. What's not to like?Although there is humor in the book, it's not as pronounced because the subject matter is serious and our Danny is grieving. Grabenstein knows how to write action scenes as well as strong characters and humor-- and he also knows how to tug on our heartstrings.There is one thing, however, that I wondered about all through Mind Scrambler. There are times that the tower of integrity that's known as John Ceepak is almost a cartoon figure with his exaggerated ""Just the facts, ma'am"" language and his unyielding book of rules. Once-- just once-- I'd like to see a scene of dialogue between Ceepak and his wife Rita when they're alone. Does Ceepak still sound like a stuffed shirt then, or does he actually unwind a little? It will probably never happen, but as I enjoy reading each book in this series, I can always dream.[My copy purchased from Book Outlet.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZTADDPV5Q015/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312382316#wasThisHelpful","R1ZTADDPV5Q015","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has become the norm to have a Montalbano mystery begin with one of the inspector's dreams. The Potter's Field is no exception, and Montalbano's dream is a lulu. The older he gets, the more wily he becomes, and it's a joy to watch him piece together all the clues he's gathered.The emphasis in any Montalbano mystery by Andrea Camilleri isn't exactly on the mystery. It's more of a triumvirate: the characters and their relationships to each other, a wonderful sense of humor, and a puzzle finally tracked to its source. The mystery isn't always baffling. Sometimes Camilleri allows us to solve it first so that we may sit back and watch Montalbano conduct his investigation.The Potter's Field is another enjoyable outing with one of my favorite policemen. Montalbano not only deals with multiple investigations, he also must face a betrayal from within, and his realization of Catarella's importance in his life brought a smile to my face.

"I read The Water Knife while seated in my swimming pool in Phoenix, Arizona. We've been playing Russian roulette with water here in the Valley of the Sun, actually believing that this stretch of desert can support over five million people forever and ever, amen. The hammer is about to fall on that last, loaded, cylinder, and Paolo Bacigalupi has painted an all-too-believable portrait of the End of Days for the city I love.It's not a pretty portrait. It's a brutal one. Life is cheap. Water is what has value. Neighborhood after neighborhood is dead because there is no water to fill the pipes running beneath the streets and up into the houses. China has arrived to build ""arcologies""-- tall skyscrapers that are marvels of recycling-- where the rich can live in the luxury of waterfalls, thick tropical foliage, showers, baths, pitchers filled with cool water.... The rest of the city has to fight to get enough to drink, and you can forget about being clean. That's a thing of the past.Bacigalupi places three main characters into this gritty, filthy, parched world: Angel, the Water Knife; Maria, the teenage Texas refugee; and Lucy, an investigative journalist who came to Phoenix and now calls it home. The one thing that they all must recognize is that it all boils down to water rights. Catherine Case knows this, and she's been successful in obtaining water rights for her city. However, Case is small potatoes to the real powerhouse in the fight for water: California. What are three of the ""little people"" going to do in this deadly fight? What chance do they have of survival?The Water Knife is cold-blooded and violent in its vision of the future, and the future is bleak indeed for anyone with old eyes. It's a story that made me feel guilty and uncomfortable and thirsty and in need of a shower. It's a story that I won't forget... even as I enjoy my swimming pool each and every day.[My copy purchased from The Poisoned Pen Bookstore.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOXILGRAW5OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352875#wasThisHelpful","R2JOXILGRAW5OY","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been passionate about Martin Walker's Bruno Chief of Police series since its inception. Each new book has been eagerly awaited and lovingly read. Walker is a master of portraying the history, culture, and food of the Dordogne in France. When I finish reading each book, it's a miracle that I don't speak with a French accent. I. Love. This. Series.If you felt that the above paragraph was leading toward a ""but,"" you would be correct. I've been noticing a trend in the last two or three books. A waning of authorial interest perhaps? For me The Patriarch felt rather lackluster.Walker usually enlightens readers about a little known segment of French World War II history that I normally find fascinating, but this time the plot thread involving a French flying ace in Russia and another character's Cold War spy shenanigans seemed hurriedly resolved and just didn't drum up much interest in me. The subplot with the animal rights activist and the hunters wasn't really resolved at all, although Walker did illuminate the entire situation and its repercussions well.Bruno has to face disillusionment on more than one front in this book. Once again he's at a romantic crossroads, but this time he didn't seem very interested in his own love life. Even the scenes filled with wine and food seemed perfunctory.Don't get me wrong. I haven't gone off this series by any means. What I perceive to be Walker's ""lackluster"" novel is still much better than many other writers' ""very good"" ones. If anything, it's a reminder of how difficult it must be for writers to maintain not only interest but quality in a long-running series. But when I pick up the next Bruno book, there will be a hesitation and a bit of skepticism that wasn't there before.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z8GFT9D7SBGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354177#wasThisHelpful","R2Z8GFT9D7SBGA","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our introduction to Brigid Quinn in the prologue of Rage Against the Dying is a memorable one. When prologue flows into first chapter, we know we are embarking on a journey with an unforgettable character. Brigid Quinn is fierce, uncompromising, and unflinchingly original. She is as far from being a normal ""woman of a certain age"" as the Earth is from Saturn. She's seen too much, and she's done too much; but what put me firmly in her camp come what may is the fact that this intelligent, strong woman looking sixty straight in the eye is an almost complete novice at relationships with other people. Every hero should have a flaw, and Brigid's carries the potential for a lot of damage.The man she's fallen in love with is a wonderful character, and although we see him through Brigid's eyes, we're given hints that he isn't quite the man she believes him to be. This fledgling relationship adds so much to the story!Speaking of the story-- it's completely engrossing. Once I started reading, I didn't come up for air until I'd turned the last page. The hunt for the killer and the killer's final reveal? Fabulous. When I was finished reading, I sat for a few minutes with my eyes closed, simply holding the book and savoring what I'd just experienced. What fuels me as a reader are characters and stories. Becky Masterman has delivered both in superb style. Now I'm an addict and getting my hands on the next Brigid Quinn book has become a necessity![My copy of this book was purchased from Book Outlet.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOSI4XRL0BPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250038162#wasThisHelpful","R3AOSI4XRL0BPX","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy McManus's Bo Tully mysteries. Even though they're played more for laughs than police procedure, I'd still like to get Tully together with my other two Stetson-wearing sheriffs, Walt Longmire and Bill Gastner. Tully is so busy in this one, that it appears that he's ignoring a woman who insists that her ex-husband has been murdered. Notice how I say ""appears.""McManus's humor is reminiscent of Mark Twain, and I loved how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together in this one. I recommend this entire series to anyone with a fondness for light-hearted mysteries featuring a good old-fashioned lawman who believes in using cunning and guile to solve crimes.

"Steve Hockensmith's Holmes on the Range series is one of my favorites. So much so that I make myself parcel each book out very slowly. There haven't been any new ones since 2011, and I only have one left to read now. (Horrors!)Hockensmith really gives us the flavor of the Old West in these books, and The Crack in the Lens is no exception. The trademark laugh-out-loud humor is also there. But there's a departure or two in these pages. For one thing the brothers actually have some money this time around, and hopefully the reason why will tickle you as much as it did me. Another departure is that, in this fourth book in the series, Old Red is the loose cannon and Big Red is the calm one. Odd how love can throw both Gustav Amlingmeyer and his idol Sherlock Holmes for a loop.The mystery is a good one, and the killer is hiding in my favorite spot: right out in plain sight. If you like Sherlock Holmes, the Old West, humor, and a good whodunnit, take my advice.

"Rebecca M. Hale's Afoot on St. Croix is even better than the first book in the series, Adrift on St. John. Who can beat the setting? Beautiful islands in the Caribbean... sea, sand, sky, lush tropical foliage. That alone is worth the price of admission, but to the setting Hale adds bits of island history and legend, and a cast of quirky characters who aren't always what they seem.Afoot on St. Croix is the best sort of puzzle to work because of that cast of characters. Charlie's daughter Jessie loves to terrorize her younger brother with stories about the Goat Foot Woman, but the more you read the more you wonder if those are all just stories. All stories have some foundation in truth... don't they? Charlie's wife Mira, an Italian opera singer and his two dachshunds, the old woman Gedda and her shopping cart; most of these characters start out looking a bit like caricatures, but Hale certainly doesn't let them stay that way. I found it fascinating to discover how all the pieces of this puzzle fit together, and am looking forward to my next trip back to the Caribbean.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GOUEBK6MN2FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425251950#wasThisHelpful","R3GOUEBK6MN2FM","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Plague Land, S.D. Sykes does an excellent job in showing how the Plague has turned everything on its head-- from political alliances to the attitudes of the poor toward their ""masters."" The Plague may have burned itself out, but everyone is still reeling in the aftermath. Entire families and villages wiped out. Land lying fallow because there's no one left to farm it.In this time of catastrophic change Sykes places a remarkable cast. Young Oswald has the advantage of his higher learning in the monastery, but his cloistered life also puts him at a disadvantage. He's ill-equipped to get reluctant, superstitious villagers to work the land. He knows extremely little of current alliances with the local gentry. He has a village priest who has his eye on more earthly prizes, and his mother and sister are worse than a thick cloud of midges. If not for the help of Brother Peter, chances are that Oswald would run screaming back to the monastery to beg for sanctuary.Oswald's investigation stumbles and bumbles, much as his management style at Somerhill Manor. But as he awkwardly goes about his business, readers see the rich tapestry of life and relationships in southern England after the scythe of the Plague has swept through. Food, customs, and the usual panoply of human emotions parade right before our eyes. Sykes had me living in the world she created.If you like historical mysteries that you can sink into and experience, Plague Land is for you. And if you like books with absorbing mysteries and jaw-dropping endings, then Plague Land is most definitely for you. I look forward to S.D. Sykes' next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQ2GBKIVCRYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144478577X#wasThisHelpful","R3NQ2GBKIVCRYV","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Francine Mathews writes excellent historical thrillers (Jack 1939, Too Bad to Die) that I always look forward to reading, so when a trusted source told me that she'd also written a police procedural series set on Nantucket Island, I knew I had to read at least one. After turning the last page on Death in the Off-Season, I know I'll be reading the rest of the series.What's to like? First off, there's the setting of Nantucket Island. Although I've always been curious about Nantucket, I'd never read a book set there, so I really enjoyed Mathews' descriptions of the landscape and the weather, as well as information on growing and harvesting cranberries. Since Merry Folger and her family have deep roots on the island, Mathews also includes a bit of Nantucket history and geneaology. None of this is done in a heavy-handed manner, and all of it combines to add a strong foundation as well as charm to the story.Something else to like about Death in the Off-Season is main character Meredith Abiah Folger. (How's that for a strong New England name?) She's smart, she's strong, and she certainly has good instincts. What holds her back is an overprotective father who also happens to be her boss. His desire to keep his daughter from harm not only makes Merry angry, it also causes her to hesitate, to doubt herself. Fortunately for her, Merry also has a wonderful grandfather who's loving, yet no-nonsense. He listens to her and gives her sound advice. (Now if he'd only set his son straight!) The only thing that appears to be wrong with Merry's grandfather is his tendency to turn their home into an episode of ""Hoarders.""Mathews' cast of characters is a very strong one-- not only Merry's family, but several townspeople and friends as well. In fact one of the townspeople on Merry's list of suspects may turn out to be of romantic interest in future books.Setting? Check! Characters? Check! So what about the story, the mystery, the whodunnit? I have one word for it: brilliant. The plot weaves people and secrets together in such a way that I never saw the identity of the killer coming. Plot? Check!Now you understand why I want to read the rest of the books in this series, don't you?","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJFGFZGY74X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380723344#wasThisHelpful","RDJFGFZGY74X4","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For my money, Kate Carlisle's two-book-old Fixer-Upper cozy series is her best. Readers get a beautiful coastal California setting complete with beaches, redwoods, a lighthouse, and wonderful old Victorian houses, as well as a strong cast, and writing tips from one of the characters. Combine all that with This Old Homicide's tales of shipwrecks and hidden treasure, and what's not to like?Carlisle doesn't forget that her main character has to work for a living, so readers are treated to regular visits to old homes being renovated. Shannon knows her stuff, so she's seen working alongside her crews, and along with renovation tips she shows us how to take care of scheduling, supplies, permits, and all that other ""fun"" stuff.Shannon's an endearing character, and I'm really enjoying getting to know both her and her best friends. I can even tolerate Shannon's nemesis because, while Whitney is an obnoxious cow, she's not over the top. I think Carlisle's giving Whitney a genuinely nice guy as a husband helps temper my reaction to her.Shannon's one lucky woman for she's been blessed with not one but two thoroughly handsome, smart, and funny guys. When this budding romantic triangle began to blossom in the first book, I was wary because one of the reasons I stopped reading Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books a few years back is because Stephanie refused to make up her mind-- Joe or Ranger? Unlike Stephanie, Shannon can make up her mind, probably because she runs a successful business. She also has a very strong sense of what's right. She knows she has to make a decision. I'm looking forward to seeing how Carlisle deals with the situation. It should be very interesting. Do I know which guy I'd pick? Yes, I do!Carlisle's mystery-- especially with the added bonus of a shipwreck and hidden treasure-- is a good one, even though I did think the identity of the killer was a bit obvious. For as most cozy readers know, it isn't just about whodunit; it's got even more to do with the characters-- and Carlisle's got both a winning cast and a winning series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NEI8BGITPVEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469208#wasThisHelpful","R1NEI8BGITPVEZ","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book that I'd managed to ignore for almost a year. When I keep seeing the same title over and over again on the book websites and blogs that I frequent, I tend to go into avoidance mode. Hype makes me suspicious. It wasn't until recently when someone whose opinion I trust recommended this book that I decided to give it another look. Am I ever glad that I did.A Man Called Ove runs the gamut of emotions: laughter, exasperation, anger, compassion, fear, love, loss. Those new neighbors of his force him to get involved in something other than his own tunnel-vision plans, and as Ove constantly gets yanked into the lives of others, his backstory is slowly revealed. That backstory makes all the difference in the world because we get to see Ove as a child, as a teenager, as a young man-- and we see why Ove became so mean-spirited.Some may dismiss A Man Called Ove as a simple ""feel good"" story. Yes, it does make the reader feel good, but that assessment sells this book short. It is a wonderful characterization and examination of a man's life. It just may get some of us to re-evaluate the curmudgeons in our own lives.I was stunned to learn that this is a debut novel because it certainly doesn't read like one. I could ramble enthusiastically for several more paragraphs, but I won't. If you've been avoiding Fredrik Backman's book because of the hype, stop. Pick it up and read it. My only warning? Have a family-size box of tissues close at hand when you near the end. You will be crying.

"I fell in love with the first book in this series, Murder at Honeychurch Hall, and the love affair continues with this, book number two. Author Hannah Dennison must enjoy writing these because a sense of fun shines through on each page. As she stated in a recent tour, every Honeychurch Hall book will feature a real threat to Britain's stately homes, so if you're a reader-- like me-- who enjoys those wonderful, beautiful, old houses, I encourage you to give this series a try.I also recommend them for the characters Dennison has created. Kat is an extremely likeable, smart, and caring woman who, as a former popular television personality, is still being stalked by the media. She also has a rather batty mother to deal with. Iris has always been a bit of a distant figure in Kat's life, tortured by headaches that would send her to her bedroom for hours at a time. However, Kat has recently learned that Iris was actually in her bedroom writing romance novels all those years, and she's the very popular author Krystalle Storm. Iris is a strange mix of wisdom and innocence. (Too many years hidden away writing bodice rippers?)In this book Dennison livens up the action with Kat's Uncle Alfred. Between Iris and her brother, Kat may wind up talking to herself... and arguing with her answers. Newcomers Angela Parks and Patty Gully are in the thick of it, too, and they both kept me trying to figure out what they were up to.The mystery in Deadly Desires at Honeychurch Hall is a good one that kept my mental gears whirring. I did manage to deduce part of the nefarious doings but had to wait until the reveal to find out whodunnit.Hannah Dennison's Honeychurch Hall series is an irresistible blend of wit, stately homes, mystery, and wonderful characters.

"The opening scene in Ellen Crosby's first Sophie Medina novel had me hooked, and I stayed hooked with her excellent story and pacing. When I learned that Nick was a CIA operative, I felt a twinge of unease because I am not a fan of spy thrillers, so I am happy to say that the espionage never went overboard in Multiple Exposure.Crosby's characters are another reason why i was hooked. Sophie is one smart woman, and she thinks well on her feet-- which is a necessity when you're being shadowed by spies, agents, oligarch's thugs, etc. Except for one slight glitch with a purse, Sophie doesn't do dumb stuff either. Her supporting cast is a strong one as well-- her stepfather Harry and her mother as well as her closest friends, Father Jack and Grace, add depth to an engrossing story. Even Washington, DC is a marvelous character. Throughout Sophie's travels in the city, I learned some fascinating facts about our nation's capital while I was being entertained.To story, pacing, characters, and setting, add two never-before-seen Faberg Imperial Easter eggs. I was in a little slice of fiction heaven, and I look forward to reading Sophie's next adventure in Ghost Image.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CVDJOEFKD6KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501103660#wasThisHelpful","R1CVDJOEFKD6KI","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you begin reading Innocence-- and I hope all of you will-- please do not skip the introduction written by Heda Margolius Kovly's son. These pages will show you that Kovly's own life was every bit as interesting as her book, and as each character's secrets are revealed, there is such an incredible ring of truth that it cannot be denied. Kovly was influenced by Raymond Chandler, but this little jewel of a mystery is far from being some slavish copy.The theme of innocence runs throughout the book, and what Kovly's own experiences taught her was that, in a regime like that, no one is really innocent. It's a horrifying thing to contemplate, but by book's end, readers will come to realize that it's true.  ""Vendy wiped away the rain sliding down his nose. Steep Street was like an empty auditorium after a performance, with Vendy the late-coming spectator who could only guess at what had taken place.""Kovly has a talent for writing one- to two-line descriptions of her characters that are tiny slices of perfection. So many of today's writers would take paragraphs or even pages to define each one of theirs. There are other passages in Innocence that are beautifully descriptive and psychologically insightful. By the time the mystery is solved and Kovly's story has come to an end, I felt emotionally brutalized-- and in awe. She distilled years of fear and horror and rage into this book, and as a result Innocence is haunting... and extraordinary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSRQWJPOB0NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954965#wasThisHelpful","R2QSRQWJPOB0NP","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for something new in the English village mystery line, I can recommend Marty Wingate's The Rhyme of the Magpie. This book has good pacing, a great ""voice,"" a setting that invites you to come on in and sit a spell, and an engaging main character......although I do have to admit that I wasn't impressed with Julia Lanchester at first. Her extremely childish reaction to her father's remarriage made me want to tell her to stop acting like a brat and start acting like a caring adult. Since I'm letting you know my opinion changed quite a bit, that tells you something. Marty Wingate's main character is definitely not static or two-dimensional.One of the things I enjoyed most was watching Julia's creative mind work on developing ideas to boost tourism in her village. It not only gave me perspective on what these places have to do in order to survive, Julia's plans made me want to participate and made me admire the way her mind works.The mystery in The Rhyme of the Magpie is a good one. Although I did deduce someone's identity quickly, I couldn't do the same for the killer. With all of Julia's plans to boost tourism in Smeaton-under-Lyme, I'm looking forward to a brand-new crop of suspects. One observation though-- Julia had better keep her assistant very happy indeed. She would be completely lost without Vesta taking all her shifts so she can play detective!Bring on the next one, please!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D49Z8U6CKGSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PEWTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3D49Z8U6CKGSL","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Insightful introductions by Martin Edwards guide readers through this collection of fourteen short stories written by some of the most popular crime fiction writers in England's golden age of mysteries (1910-1953). The theme of detectives on holiday provides the framework of the collection, and the stories take place in many vacation spots throughout the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland.Of the fourteen authors, I was familiar with only three: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Arnold Bennett, and G.K. Chesterton.One thing I remembered as I read each story was that, during this time, crime fiction was in its purest form. If something did not advance the story, the writer did not include it. If you're a fan of more contemporary crime fiction in which in-depth characterization and the story's setting usually take on very important roles, this collection may not be for you. But if you're interested in reading the work of other crime fiction authors besides Agatha Christie who were popular and have fallen into (sometimes undeserved) obscurity, Resorting to Murder is right up your alley.Of all the stories in this book, I enjoyed the ones by the two women most: ""A Posteriori"" by Helen Simpson, and ""Where Is Mr. Manetot?"" by Phyllis Bentley, due to their plots and for Helen Simpson's sense of humor. I also enjoyed the feeling of slipping back into the past to read the popular fiction of the day.I applaud the British Library Crime Classics series and its US publisher, Poisoned Pen Press, for bringing these writers and their works back to the reading public.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7PG0PZKA4TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146420375X#wasThisHelpful","R2U7PG0PZKA4TM","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In High Country Nocturne, Jon Talton's elegaic descriptions of the old Phoenix almost gives the book a hard-boiled feel, and that sad, cynical, resigned tone is perfect for this story. It's good to see Talton get out of Phoenix for a bit and take readers to places like Flagstaff and Ash Fork up in Northern Arizona. Even sections of Route 66 get a mention or two. In a tale of betrayal, murder, and a desperate search for the truth, the occasional sparks of humor he adds are as welcome as they are unexpected.Mapstone has been tested before in the course of this series, but not to this degree. Mike Peralta has not only been his boss and his partner, he's also been his closest friend, and to have him be the prime suspect in a diamond heist and murder is beyond belief. At this point, all he's going to want to do is prove Peralta innocent. However, everyone seems determined to stop him. FBI agents are crawling all over the place, making demands, asking questions, keeping an eye on him. The new sheriff insists that Mapstone comes back to work for him. Matters are made even worse by the deadly killer who's stalking him. What scares Mapstone the most is that the killer may not only target him, his wife Lindsey may also be in danger.When he does start piecing a few things together, he begins to doubt his friendship with Peralta. Just how much can he trust his partner? This is a fast-paced story that does make occasional references to previous books in the series, but it does stand alone very well.There are two authors who have series set in the Phoenix metropolitan area whom I always recommend. Jon Talton is one of them. High Country Nocturne is another strong entry in an excellent series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGK9EMXUKUI5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464203989#wasThisHelpful","RGK9EMXUKUI5E","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Question of the Missing Head is a story that I enjoyed from first page to last. Its convoluted (but not confusing) mystery was so much fun to follow, and it had a lot to do with the characters that Jeff Cohen has created.Samuel is marvelous-- at times exasperating, brilliant, startling, and downright funny. What I didn't find all that unusual is that I identified with him in a few things like ringing telephones and surprises. He owes a lot to the love and parenting of his mother, who has one of the best lines in the book. Cohen not only shows Samuel's strengths, he shows his weaknesses as well-- and I'm with Samuel on sudden, earsplitting noises that won't stop (although I don't react in quite the same way).Samuel is also very careful to clear up any confusion with television's Adrian Monk, which might help a few readers. His passions are baseball and the Beatles, and I love his theory that he can tell a lot about a person by discovering their favorite Beatles song. I even wonder what Samuel would tell me if I said ""In My Life""?Out-of-work photographer Janet Washburn is the perfect associate for Samuel. She doesn't overreact to any of Samuel's peculiarities, and the conversations she's able to have with him about subjects like his mother and the investigation into the death at the Institute are both illuminating and touching. These talks tell readers a lot about both characters.I was momentarily alarmed when Detective Lapides arrived on the scene because I thought the book was going to be saddled with the resident too-stupid-to-live cop. I should have known better. In Lapides Cohen has created a police officer who might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he knows his limitations. Lapides wants to do a good job, and he's willing to follow Samuel's good advice which many other detectives wouldn't have the sense to do.And because Samuel's priorities are different from most people's, he doesn't get upset at one point when the investigation starts to bog down. What's more important than the investigation? You're just going to have to read the book to find out.  This first Asperger's mystery got me hook, line, and sinker, and I look forward to Samuel's next investigation... err... question.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GU48J2BO96F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738741515#wasThisHelpful","R37GU48J2BO96F","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've just found a new cozy series to enjoy. Although DiSilverio's first Readaholics mystery could have used a bit of tightening, I just kept finding more and more things about this book to make me smile.Amy-Faye is just the sort of protagonist cozy mystery readers love. She's smart and funny and loyal-- and of course, she's not above a bit of snooping when she feels justice isn't being done. She's going to have to take care, however, or her sleuthing will have a detrimental effect on her event planning business.I'm not one to appreciate toxic parents. When it comes to the mysteries I read, I'd much prefer that-- if the parents are too obnoxious to live-- they be neither seen nor heard. I'm thrilled to report that although our heroine's are quirky, Mom and Dad are delightfully so (especially Amy-Faye's mother, the retired librarian-turned-book-reviewer), and I'll be happy to visit with them any time.Amy-Faye's also got a first-rate group of friends who all have varying backgrounds, talents, and personalities. This certainly bodes well for the future of the series, and I look forward to learning more about each of them as each book is released.And how about that mystery, you ask? It's a good one with a very well-disguised villain. I do like to be kept guessing! Unfortunately I don't enjoy being kept waiting, which is what I must do until the next time the Readaholics book club meets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZX6J6YZVHHD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451470834#wasThisHelpful","R2ZX6J6YZVHHD6","A2MF4TISBBQT5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF4TISBBQT5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With thermal underwear he stays warm yet doesn't feel and look like a marshmallow.These thermal underwear are perfect to stay warm. They maintain your body warm without feeling so layered. They're thin yet work well. My hubby doesn't wear them without boxers, simply due to preference, but they should be worn as underwear. They are fitted so your normal clothes fits  right over them.

"This is smaprogrammertable. It's also multi-functional. If you have a hard time sleeping,  you can use one of the 4 sounds that are pre recorded. You can choose the ocean sound or rainfall or 2 others. The sounds are very relaxing.Then, you can use it as a blue tooth speaker as well. I connect it to my iHeartradio  app and listen to my favorite songs. It pairs very easily. The connectivity is good. As far as sound, it packs a decent amount of volume. I don't hear static and the sound is clear.You can also receive calls on it. I don't use it much for calls, but the calls are clear and uninterrupted. I like that it rarely loses connection. Once paired via bluetooth, it stays programmed on my phone. The next time I turn my bluetooth on it automatically pairs. The battery life is good.

Besides being affordable I love how it completely transforms. I thought it was a little hard, but my 6 year old did in in less than a minute. I do agree, it is very simple in color. It's basically a solid blue color. The headlights aren't even the normal color. It's not a big deal though.

"I'm more into silver than I am into gold colored fashion jewlery, but this one stood out.  I'm glad I chose this color option. The gold color and the CZ really mesh well together. Upon opening the box, I noticed how much it shined. It doesn't matter what angle of lighting there is, is still shines brilliantly. It's dainty yet pretty.  It is about 7 inches and fits average sized wrists. I have a chunkier wrist and although it fit decent, I prefer it to be a bit more loose. The clasp is sturdy as well. I've worn it 2 days and have had no issues with it turning green or my skin turning green.

No one actually believes it's wood.This watch is made of maple sandalwood. I love the wooden smell. The color of the wood is light and very lightweight. The base is not too bulky or big. The watch displays time in analog version and even displays the date. It has the minutes en grained on the outside of the base as well which gives it character. This watch would be a unique gift idea as well. All in all, a great set to my husband's watch collection. Watch received at little or no cost for my unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36C31GMR1ZE2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168KYU3I#wasThisHelpful","R36C31GMR1ZE2Y","ATNFPO318511G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNFPO318511G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea of a watch being made of wood seemed almost unbelievable to me, but it's so unique. It's definitely not something I've seen before except from this seller. Not only is it unique, but they look  great.This watch is made out of bamboo and sandalwood which is a yellow like color and fine grained. I feel this is more of a man's watch due to the size of the case.The case is pretty large in diameter. If you're a woman and like big watches then you might like this. The numbers are easy to read. Setting the time is easy. It feels very lightweight and looks great.

" 1:18 MinsThis is a nice salt and pepper grinder set. It has a nice stainless steel top with a very thick glass bottom. The grinder is ceramic and you can choose how coarse you want your spices. Although it says it's for salt and pepper, you can grind more than that.  We love fresh spices as they tend to have much more flavor and of course are fresh. It has a wide mouth that makes refilling very easy and effortless. This set is very sleek and modern looking. They are the perfect size, not too small and not too big.

"If you make your own candles, homemade soaps like me, this book definitely comes in handy. It covers so much on aromatherapy and essential oils.

The section on home remedies include kitchen cleaners, shower cleaners, laundry stain removers and much more. It's amazing how much you can make with essential oils and they're medicinal properties.

"This is small, portable and easy to pair. I like the color and the fact it has a hook to hang anywhere. Yes, it has sticky pads which I thought were pretty neat. Paired with both my Galaxy Note and iPhone pretty quickly. The battery life is good. After 4 hours, it still has battery life. You can use an SD card to listen to downloaded music or can use music apps. You can answer calls from the speaker, adjust volume and skip tracks as well. It has good volume. It's affordable vs other speakers I've seen. These are all the features I found to be good.As far as little issues I found, here they go-- The sound is pretty loud and has bass,  but at it's loudest, it tends to sound like it is choppy at times, like it has static.-The voice comes out in a different language, maybe Asian or Chinese or something. I do hear an English voice, but I haven't figured how or when it chooses to come out in English.-It tends to lose connectivity sometimes as well. Not very often, but it has a couple times.-the sticky pads on the back are good for one time use because once I placed it on counter it was hard to get off.I really think the good features outweigh the bad and it packs a pretty good sound. I knocked off one star due to the features I think that can be improved, but I like the speaker. I use it mostly to hear my Bible online. Speaker provided at no cost for review purposes. I was not compensated in any way and from my review you can see I do note the good and bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYROCSGQS271S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016KHTCW8#wasThisHelpful","RYROCSGQS271S","ATNFPO318511G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNFPO318511G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is great to use either after using a pumice stone or for scrub. Can also be used without that. It is easy to use. Simply massage it into your feet. Love the peppermint in it as it leaves a tingling sensation. I massage it on my husband's tired feet and he enjoys the tingling.

" 1:13 MinsThis is an amazingly thick pie plate. I'm very impressed with that aspect. Along with being thick, it is a good sized and deep dish. Great for those dishes that require layers like shepherd's pie. I think it is similar to the Pyrex and Anchor glass plates. I love the decorative border. When you serve your guests, service get from the plate itself is nice. Borosilicate glass is known to resist high temperatures which is another benefit. Whether you're baking meals or desserts, it's a great pie plate. Washing is easy as well. It doesn't get caked on as much as aluminum pans do. All in all, I'm very satisfied with it and will be putting it to great use.

"During the colder seasons my feet tend to get dry. I am so sensitive from my feet. I always use scrubs, lotions and a pumice stone. This scrub makes my feet smell good and feel soft. The beads in it aren't rough in the skin, but help get rid of dry skin cells. The peppermint oil and tea tree oil provide an invigorating feeling. I also like that it's made of natural ingredients. I do suggest soaking your feet a bit first and then using this scrub. Leaves feet so soft and feels like a spa treatment.

" 0:49 MinsThis Tagital tablet is perfect for kids. My 5 year old daughter is using it to watch videos and play games. I have to say that we've had no issues with it. Let me start on its features...Resolution is decent. I'm not going to say it's the best, but good enough for her games. I'm not sure it would be too great for games with heavy, in depth graphics. Has dual cameras as well and the photos are pretty decent as well.Comes with several apps already downloaded on it. It also comes with Google Play store which is great since I'm an Android user and already have an account. It comes with the Zoodles app, which is great for learning kids. As far as downloading, it does take some time to download certain apps or games. I'd say that it's the only minor downfall, but again it's for my daughter and it's not too big of a deal.Surfing the web is easy and has decent speed (all depends on your Internet speed as well). We had no issues surfing the web or opening different tabs at one time. If you're downloading anything the surfing experience seems a bit slower, but not slow like a turtle. The sound quality is clear as well. The screen is very responsive as well.It is an 8GB tablet, but if you install a memory card it'll give you up to 32GB of storage. It's very lightweight. It charges fairly quickly as well and the battery life is pretty good. If she plays games non-stop she can get a good couple hours.Comes with a rubber case which is great and a plus if you have it for kids. It has fallen a couple times and nothing has happened to it. Offers great protection. Small, lightweight and great fir portability. It's a great tablet for kids.Product received at little or no cost for review purposes.

With winter coming and the weather getting cold, this thermal set is perfect as pajamas and even under clothes.First of all, I have to say that my daughter has meat on her body. She has thick legs and thighs. The shirt seems a bit short, but that's just my preference. The pants are the perfect length. They're not too long or short.

" 0:37 MinsMy daughter loves building things. She has always been a fan of LEGOS, but she really likes this set of magnetic stick n stack shape MAGS . It has  32 pieces. The great feature on this set is the magnets. Building get is so easy. Your child can mix and match, build and rebuild. The magnets are very strong. Just place each piece near each other and they stick together. They're very colorful too. She has been playing with then since they arrived. If it keeps her occupied, I'm one happy Momma. The clean up is do easy too and they're require very little storage space because they're flat. If you purchase other sets of these magnetic stick n stack sets, there's so much you can build. It was fun, even for me, helping her build different things. I think they're pretty neat and unique. No choking hazard either as the pieces are pretty good sized. Another plus for me.

"I can honestly say I've tried so many deodorants in my life. I was excited to try this deodorant because it's parade free, has no artificial fragrance  and no animal testing. More than anything, just curious about it. I actually found a great deal on it and ordered on kissmyface.com. I have to say, I'm disappointed.I really wanted to like it. It is a bit pricey so I thought it would work better, but it really doesn't work for me. I can honestly say I really don't sweat too much from my underarms and I don't have bad odor. This deodorant made me smell. It did not work for me. I know each person is different, but I my experience with it was not good. I've tried it many times and still get the same results.

I have long hair and it is pretty dry. The masque is more of like a trial size. I left it on for about 7 minutes. It did make my hair soft and did make it shine and it does deep condition, but it's not like exceptional. It wotkd and all, but there's not anything very special about it. It does smell really nice.

" 0:22 MinsMy daughter really likes this sweater. The design and pattern is nice. The seam work is good. It's a roomy sweater that sits a little below the thigh area.  Since she's so petite, it's a bit longer on her. It's nice to wear with some skinny jeans and some boots or dress it up with some heels and a nice blouse underneath. She did say it made her a bit itchy, but not too bad. It has a bit of sparkle to it too. She loves to wear it on those days when we're in the go. She simply throes it on with her jeans and it doesn't look like she was in a rush. It's perfect for this fall weather as it's not too thin or thick.

"This is a very thick and well made bracelet. I feel it's very masculine, but I actually like it for myself. I'm starting to really like stainless steel  jewelry as I've always liked silver and it has a similar look. Although it's thick it's not very heavy.

" 1:19 MinsIf you're a baker, then this is definitely something you'll use frequently. I love baking and even more in the cold seasons. I've always wanted a stand mixer, but they're so pricey. This GForce stand mixer is awesome. Has the quality of those high end stand mixers, but at a fraction of the cost. It's sturdy yet not too heavy. I'm loving my stand mixer.So many great features to state. First, you get 2 stainless steel bowls- a 2Qt and 4Qt. Sometimes I don't need such a huge bowl. You get 2 dough hooks, 2 beaters a whisk,spatula and plastic mixing bowl. The mixer comes with a built in scale that slides out. Very convenient and saves space. Perfect for precise measurements. It uses 3 AAA batteries and has an LED screen.Mixing is so easy. You get several speed options and even a turbo feature. I really like the turbo option. I love how easy it mixes and how fast it mixes. I don't have to sit and watch it. It does the work for me, unlike with my regular hand mixer.

" 0:24 MinsThis is a really great electric kettle.  Besides the fact that it's stainless steel, which truly stands the test of time, it's also very sturdy. It holds 1.7L of liquids. Whether you're a tea drinker, coffee drinker or just need boring water this kettle comes in handy.I really like how the base is the one that goes plugged in. You simply place the kettle on the base. This is great because you can serve yourself or guests without having the cord dangling. It has 1 simple button to power it on/off. When you power it on a blue LED light comes on around the windows on each side of the kettle. I timed it and it took 10 minutes to boil the entire kettle of water-1.7L. It also comes with a built in filter near the spout which is useful for loose tea leaves. When done boiling, the kettle automatically powers off. I love that feature. It's sleek looking, works great and heats up fast.Electric kettle received at little or no cost for my honest and unbiased review.

" 0:22 MinsMy daughter really likes this sweater. The design and pattern is nice. The seam work is good. It's a roomy sweater that sits a little below the thigh area.  Since she's so petite, it's a bit longer on her. It's nice to wear with some skinny jeans and some boots or dress it up with some heels and a nice blouse underneath. She did say it made her a bit itchy, but not too bad. It has a bit of sparkle to it too. She loves to wear it on those days when we're in the go. She simply throes it on with her jeans and it doesn't look like she was in a rush. It's perfect for this fall weather as it's not too thin or thick.

" 0:36 MinsDuring the cold seasons we drink a lot of coffee,tea and hot chocolate.  This electric kettle, although the title says it's an electric tea kettle, is good for so much more than that. It has great features along with the fact that it's pretty looking. The blue LED light on it is pretty cool.Besides the physical aspect, it's functionality is great. First of all, although the water boils, the kettle itself doesn't get extremely hot. For the maximum water lever of 1.8L it took a total of 10 minutes to heat up. That's pretty fast for me. It also has an auto shut off feature. Once it boils, it turns itself off. It has 2 simple buttons- one to over it on/off and the other to push the top open. Although you plug it in, the kettle itself has no plug. It simply sits on a base that's connected to the wall. The handle is slip resistant and offers a good grip.

"People have always said how important moisturizer is for your skin. Moisturizer can prevent wrinkles. You add Manuka honey and it's double the benefits. Manuka honey is good for many skin conditions and is supposed to help with wrinkles and fine lines. A great antioxidant for skin.I like it because of the moisture it provides.I mostly use this moisturizer before bedtime.  During the cold seasons my skin gets very dry. This definitely moisturizes my skin. I recommend only using a little because it is really moist and can make your skin oily. It does leave your skin really soft. In the mornings, my skin still feels moist and soft. I can't say it really has a scent.

" 0:32 MinsFirst of all,  I have to say that this is a cool watch. No, it's not the Apple watch, but has a lot of similar features and much more affordable. With that being said, let me get on to the features and my experience with it.I will admit, I'm not too tech savvy, but my hubby is. He has an iPhone 5, I have a Galaxy Note 3. He tried pairing it on iPhone and it paired, but I on the other hand, had a hard time. It wasn't until I read another review that mentioned  about getting into the watch settings and making sure the watch was visible.  Still, I had a hard time getting it to pair. It finally did and it worked just fine. I also downloaded a bluetooth notification app called MediaTek and now I get all my notifications on my watch. In order to use some features like Facebook and Twitter you need to insert your SIM card. I didn't try it as I don't like taking my SIM card from my phone. So, you need a SIM card for some apps, a BT notifier app to get notifications and a memory card for photos.As far as photos, it has okay resolution. The pictures come out decent. The sound quality is good both on voice recordings and on during calls. It has good volume. Sending texts is simple and fast. The screen is very responsive as well. The only downfall is the battery life. Good thing it comes with an extra battery for back up. Still, it's a fun and cool gadget.  Not your typical watch.Smart watch received for review purposes.

With this Macadamia oil, it helps with frizz news and adds shine.Honestly, if you have thin hair, don't use too much. It can make your hair oily. I use less than a dime size. Also, make sure your hair is damp and not wet. When I applied it on wet hair, it looked oily and weighed it down. When used on dry hair, it smooths it and eliminated the frizz. It has a soft, subtle smell. On the days I use this oil, I don't wash my hair with regular conditioner because it's too much for my thin hair.

If you don't have a scanner, you will have to download it. I downloaded it and then a message popped up saying it could be harmful to my device. I was skeptical so decided to try it on hubby's phone.

"This top really hugs your body. If you are expecting a loose fitting top, this definitely isn't for you. It is very soft to the touch and on the skin. It's made of rayon and spandex, so you know it is very stretchy. I chose the black color, but you have several color options.I like the 3/4 sleeve as it is good for fall or winter. The shirring on the side really touches all your curves. The neck line is rounded or what is called a boat neck. It's perfect because you can wear your necklaces without it touching the neckline. I like showing some skin, but not too much and this is perfect for me. I do recommend wearing an undershirt as you can see if you're wearing a colored bra underneath.  It looks nice alone or even layered. Great for casual or formal attire.Top received at a promotional price for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z4NSHB3ZTG9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01668OS84#wasThisHelpful","R1Z4NSHB3ZTG9I","ATNFPO318511G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNFPO318511G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're in the process of remodeling our restroom. One of the things I am most picky about is the shower head. I enjoy my long showers and baths. I couldn't wait to put this handheld shower head/wand combo seton. I like the option to shower hands free or with the wand.I have another shower head from this company and I love it. This is chrome plated, which I like. It's so easy to install. Comes with everything you need and no tools are required. It has a extender pipe and flexible stainless steel hose for the hand held wand. You have 3 settings to choose from-jet, waterfall, and massage. I love the massage setting. It's simple, does the job, looks nice and helps me enjoy my shower time.Product received at no cost for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWX47HCOKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01499OZBM#wasThisHelpful","R2TWX47HCOKE","ATNFPO318511G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNFPO318511G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great computer chair.  I spend a lot of time comparing prices, couponing and reading emails. Having an ergonomic chair really helps with the spine. To avoid developing or compounding back problems, it's important to have a chair that's ergonomic. I already have back issues, so this is great.First of all, I chose the high back as it feels more comfortable for me. You can choose a mid back chair. The back is made of durable mesh. The blue mesh with the black seat really stands out. It is a bit hard to sit on, but it takes time to break in( as with any other chair). No lie, it took my husband 8 minutes to put together. If you're not that handy, it's okay because you're provided with step by step directions with images.  My husband said, when putting on arm rest it's best if you put in the long screws (the ones that come with allen wrench) first. It's a lot easier that way. It also has gas seat-height adjustment which gives you the option of 17 or 21 inches. It's very sturdy, has good sized arm rests  and great for your back.Chair provided at a promotional price for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GV4DS85V76YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CO8798#wasThisHelpful","R2GV4DS85V76YJ","ATNFPO318511G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATNFPO318511G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is musicology behind this disc - reconstructing three different historical stages of the music setting of one of the Oracles of the Sibyl, the prophetess of ancient Greece and Rome, that apparently was much in vogue in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, as it was considered to have announced the coming of Christ: ""From Heaven a God will come for centuries to come, present in the flesh to judge the world"". Its original Greek version is also an acrostic, the first letter of each of the five first verses forming the Greek code word ICHTUS, ""fish"" but also Iesous CHristos Theou hUios Soter, Jesus Christ Son of God Saviour. Sibyls were actually very trendy in Antiquity throughout the Mediterranean area, and this one is attributed to the Sibyl Erythrea of Anatolia / Asia Minor. The Chant has been made part of the Christmas liturgy and, although it was banned from Christian liturgy by the Council of Trent in the late 16th Century, it is still in vogue in some parts of Mediterranean Europe, like Malta, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Sicily and other parts of Italy. Augustine gives a Latin translation (that he doesn't claim to be his) in City of God XVIII-23, which served as a basis to the versions current in the Medieval times. The French Wikipedia entry on Ichtus gives an earlier Latin translation by Emperor Constantine of Byzantium, from Oratio Sanctorum Coetus, side by side with what seems to be the, or ""a"" Greek original, but strangely, the English corresponding Wikipedia entry doesn't display the same document (see my upload). The text is incomplete but I've found another website which gives the complete Constantine poem in Latin, and Constantine's translation is interesting for extending the acrostic to form the words Jesus Christus Dei Filius Servator Crux (Augustine did the same only on the 15 first verse, which read JESUCS CHREISTOS), but when you look closely at the hard-to-decipher Greek text, it's puzzling to see that the third verse seems to fall out of sequence, with a Sigma that shouldn't be there. You can also find online (on ""Mystagogy"", the weblog of John Sanidopoulos, of all places...) an English translation of what seems to be the Constantine poem which restitutes the full acrostic of 31 verses, Jesus Christ Son Of God Saviour Cross: well done, Mystagogue John!Almost 30 years after this disc was recorded (1988), the Wikipedia entry on the ""Sibylline Oracles"" is far clearer than Savall's liner notes about the history and medieval posterity of these oracles: those in vogue in Medieval Europe had actually nothing to do with those of Ancient Greece and Rome. Let me quote: ""The Sibylline Oracles (Latin: Oracula Sibyllina; sometimes called the ""pseudo-Sibylline Oracles"") are a collection of oracular utterances written in Greek hexameters ascribed to the Sibyls, prophetesses who uttered divine revelations in a frenzied state. Fourteen books and eight fragments of Sibylline Oracles survive. These are a collection of utterances that were composed or edited under various circumstances, probably between the 2nd and 6th centuries AD, and are not to be confused with the original Sibylline Books of ancient Roman religion which are now lost. Some apocalyptic passages scattered throughout seem to adumbrate themes of John's Book of Revelation and other Apocalyptic literature. The oracles have undergone extensive editing, re-writing, and redaction as they came to be exploited in wider circles."" I've also found online an erudite article about the musical setting of this particular Oracle in the Middle Ages, more up to date than Savall's 1988 musicology, but in French only.Incidentally, speaking of the loss of the original Sibylline Books, we are all horrified to see the illiterate thugs of Da Esh destroy the remnants of pre-Islamic civilizations wherever they rule, but who refers that to the hundreds of thousands (no exaggeration) of pre-Christian documents kept in ""pagan"" libraries and temples that the Christians destroyed in the 4th and 6th centuries? There's a Wikipedia entry about that in French, German, Danish and even Latin... but, strangely, not in English. Mmmhh... I wonder if there are things English-speaking Christians would prefer not to remember. It starts like this: ""the losses of books in Late Antiquity (between the end of the 3rd century and the end of the 6th century) represent an irretrievable damage to the cultural heritage of Classical Antiquity. Through the loss of transmission of a great part of the ancient Geeek and Latin literature, the number of works that were kept until the Modern times is extremely small. Most of the texts that were transmitted were done so through medieval copies, and the original fragments of texts from Antiquity are in very small numbers"". By some estimations, only 1 out of 1000 pre- or non-Christian texts have been bequeathed to the future. The last great Library of Constantinople, when it accidentally burnt in 475, had 120 000 codexes (books); in 576, the first Christian library of Cassiodorus, the Roman councilor of King Theodoric the Ostrogoth in Ravenna, Italy, had 100 (""Cassiodorus also collaborated with Pope Agapetus I in establishing a library of Greek and Latin texts, which were intended to support a Christian school in Rome""). Yep, nothing changes, the actions and effects of illiterate and intolerant religious zealotry remain the same then and today, a brutal onslaught on historical memory. But you can say, of course, that it's not because we did it 15 centuries ago, when we knew much less, that it justifies them of doing it today, when they should know much more. Religious zealotry never learns.Anyway, Savall and his band present three different versions of, basically, the same Chant/Prophecy, the first in Latin (Augustinus' translation) from the 10th/11th century, the second in Provenal from the 13th Century, and the third from the Renaissance in Catalan (a language VERY similar to turn-of-the-millenium Provenal). It's not entirely clear from the liner notes which sources they used, apparently a combination. See what YOU make out of this:""Realizing today an historical version of the Sibyl's Chant supposes that we are in a dynamic perspective in time, as if we were trying to grasp its coming into being at one moment without interrupting the source of its essence and of its mystery. Our method consists of first cataloging in chronological order all the known versions of each chant in a way that allows us to proceed without a break for example from the first little ornamented chants of the tenth century to the more melismatic versions of the twelfth centuries without interrupting the continuity of the chant. It was clearly necessary to determine the selection of the different versions according to the character of the text for each verse.""Anyway, ultimately, it's not the musicology that counts. Much of it is very speculative anyway; is this how the music really sounded in the 10th/11th century, 13th Century Provence and Renaissance Catalonia? In truth, I don't think we know for sure, but it certainly matches our fantasy of how it might have sounded. What counts are the moods elicited, the first Chant austere, bare, with only, past its introduction with bells and a call of chalumeau (medieval oboe), a cappella chorus with drone for the refrain and an accompaniment of vielle for the soloist, still meditative and dreamy with its accompaniment of oud / Arabic lute in the Provenal second, and the third still meditative and wistful but also more grandiose, with its full accompaniment of viol quartet, cornet, sackbut, and drums and polyphonic chorus.And what counts is the angelic voice of Montserrat Figueras. This is a voice to send you high (even if - or maybe even because it is on a very uniformly meditative mood throughout).Another attraction, at least for the French-speaking listener, is the Provenal and Catalan languages, so alien and yet so resemblant to modern French.TT 54 minutes. A companion disc was later recorded, in 1996, on another label, Audivis-Fontalis, El Canto De La Sibila II: Galicia Castilla, which also reissued this recording, now become volume 1, El Cant De La Sibil-La I (Catalunya). Note also that the product photo on the present entry is the one of this later Fontalis reissue, which apparently bears the same barcode as the original edition, albeit a slightly different label number, ES 8705 vs E 8705 for the original edition. See my upload for the cover photos of the original edition. Both volumes were also reissued on Alia Vox, Savall's own label, in SACD version, El Cant de la and Cant De La Sibil.La 3 (no reason why it should be titled ""3"", it's in fact 2, although even that indication appears nowhere on the disc's front or back cover), and, at the time of writing, this first volume sells cheaper on the Marketplace in its SACD format than this original edition or the Fontalis reissue. But it is two later budget reissues by Nave, in non-SACD format, that right now sell cheapest, El Cant de la Sibil-la I: Catalunya - Montserrat Figueras / La Capella Reial de Catalunya / Jordi Savall and El Cant De La Sibil-La (The Song Of The Sibyl).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5ASYVTZXTO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000264IM#wasThisHelpful","R2E5ASYVTZXTO4","A3DDSAGWD0UN9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DDSAGWD0UN9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although Zelenka (1679-1745) is far from a neglected presence on CD, he is still not, I think, given the public recognition he deserves: quite simply, when it comes to choral/religious music (in which Zelenka very much specialized), based on what I've heard of his compositions, he is, in my opinion, one of the very greats of the first half of the 18th century, on a par with Bach, Handel, Vivaldi and Telemann.This Missa Dei Patri is a good case in point. Despite its small catalog numbering, ZWV 19, it is one of Zelenka's ultimate compositions, from 1740. It is part of a cycle which Zelenka intended to reach six such masses, but ultimately he composed only two others, the Missa Dei Fili ZWV 20 and Missa Omnium Sanctorum ZWV 21. Apparently he wrote them with no performance in mind (no parts exist, only a conductor score), and they weren't performed during his lifetime.Like its two companions, Missa Dei Patris is an incredible masterpiece, with an opulence that seems to point to the great masses of Haydn, choral numbers of explosive power and/or tear-wringing solemn beauty (the choral ""ascent to heaven"" at 0:30 in the Sanctus, track 15, is one of these moments) and often with surprising melodic twists, fugues that equal those of Bach, if not surpass them in their searing and sweeping passion (""Cum sancto spirito"", track 9, repeated on the final chorus, Dona nobis pacem, track 20), and a melodic writing for soloists that, like those of Handel and Vivaldi, is always distinctive and invigorating. Zelenka's orchestra is reduced to strings, with two oboes that are, here, unless I've missed something, never given a solo role but always double the strings, but there is nothing austere in his accompaniment, on the contrary he uses his ensemble in a highly colorful and virtuosic manner, as exemplified by the extraordinarily florid accompaniment in the Quoniam Tu Solus Sanctus (track 8) and even more of Et resurrexit (track 13). Truly, when I'm  listening to this extraordinary and breathtaking invention that is the Et resurrexit followed by the Et vitam venture saeculi, I don't know who else composed like that around 1740. In fact, I'm not even sure Haydn or Mozart composed anything of such furious power, fifty years later. And I'm thinking that Zelenka didn't reach much success and recognition in his lifetime, because he was too daring, way too much in advance on his own time.And yet, when you have zillion of performances and recordings of Bach's Mass in B, Handel's Messiah and Vivaldi's Gloria, this is only one of the two recordings of Missa Dei Patris represented on CD (there was another one in the LP era), and the situation is the same with the Missa Dei Filii and Missa Omnium Sanctorum. It was made in 1988 and was a pionneering effort, in a time when Zelenka was still very much a Czech specialty. Frieder Bernius, who made a great recording of Missa Dei Filii in 1989 for Deutsche Harmonia Mundi (Zelenka: Missa Dei Filii / Litaniae Lauretanae), recorded the Missa Dei Patri in 2000 for Carus (Missa Dei Patris). There are also only two recordings of ZWB 21, one by Bernius again from 1997 for Sony that wasn't even distributed in the US and isn't offered at the time of writing, Musik aus der Dresdner Hofkirche: Missa Omnium Sanctorum and ditto for the French budget reissue, Zelenka: Messe Ultimarum Sexta (Missa Omnium Sanctorum), Zwv 21), and one by the Prague Baroque Soloists under Adam Viktora, Zelenka: Missa Omnium Sanctorum, Christe eleison, Barbara dira effera.Although my comparative appreciation is tentative because tainted by the fact that I've listened to Bernius not from the CD but from the YouTube upload and hence probably in inferior sonic conditions, ultimately, if you have only one, I find Gttler's version preferable. His is an approach on a grand scale, with a sizeable orchestra (Bernius' Stuttgart Baroque Ensemble sounds more astringent and typically period-instrument) further magnified by sonics with a long resonance. Compared to Bernius, Gttler also has a somewhat thick and heavy continuo and oftentimes a heaviness of motion and lack of dynamism, especially at the beginning of the work (as in the orchestral introduction, or the fugue on the opening Kyrie track 1 at 2:21, the Domine Fili track 6, the Credo track 10). Some of the more funeral passages can take that approach (as the Domine Deus, track 5), but sometimes Gttler is also entirely up to the music, as in his exhilaratingly dynamic Gloria, track 4, much better than Bernius here. He is impressively powerful in Qui sedes track 7, in Crucifixus, track 12, Et resurrexit track 13, searing in the Cum Sancto Spirito fugue (track 9), and in the Quoniam Tu Solus Sanctus trio (track 8) he is suitably dynamic and there is little to choose there between him and Bernius. But, even when Gttler occasional plods compared to Bernius (as in the Credo, track 10), the choral moments are always grand and powerful and particularly well spotlighted by the sonics, more so than with Bernius whose chorus (with the proviso that this may be an effect of hearing it on Youtube) sounds smaller-scaled and less impressive. Although I've always found Ren Jacobs sour in tone, the soloists (which include Olaf Br) are fine. I had never heard or heard of soprano Venceslava Hruba-Freiberger, but she sings exquisitely. In the Benedictus (for baritone, track 16) and Agnus Dei I (for alto, track 18), it is Bernius who is more plangent and funeral, and excessively so I find, it bogs down the music: Gttler's more animated tempi are preferable here. The Mass is a huge work, running here 70 minutes. It is, as its companion the Missa Dei Filii, one of the great masterpieces of early 18th Century sacred music. Experience shows that it is possible to survive without knowing the music of Zelenka (or Bach, or Handel), but life is way more fulfilling and fulfilled when you do.The Dresden library, where hundreds of manuscripts of Zelenka are held, has done a tremendous and admirable job at scanning them and putting them online on the International Music Scores Library Project. It's very moving to see those manuscripts. Some - and it is the case with Missa Dei Patris - are in a dangerously tattered condition, and they are occasionally difficult to read, because hastily handwritten with nearly undecipherable indications, with compositional conventions different from those of today (for instance, the rhythms on the different staves are often not aligned vertically), sometimes in faded ink and on damaged sheets of paper. But in the case of Missa Dei Patris, for the info of anyone who'd be interested, like me, in listening to the music while following with the score, I must say that whoever did the uploading job made things particularly difficult for the reader, because some of the movements are a jumble of pages out-of-sequence. So you first have to realize that something is wrong (""why am I lost?""), then try to figure out what the problem is. It took me hours - which at least were hours spent with the Missa. For instance, the Gloria, which starts page 34 on IMSLP, gos in a sequence 34, 36, 35, 38, 37, 40, 39, 42, 41, 44, 43, 46, 45, 48, 47, 49 and from there back to normal. Things are even more complicated in the Domine Fili, because there Zelenka wrote on two systems, and obviously the score is to be read upper system page left to upper system page right, then lower system page left to lower system page right. But since the pages are loaded one after the other (and out of sequence) and must be scrolled vertically, you get a sequence of 58-1, 60-1, 58-2, 60-2, 59-1, 61-1, 59-2, 61-2 etc. In order to follow the Agnus Dei Aria for alto (track 18), you need to realize that it's written on three systems, so the sequence is 184-1, 185-1, 184-2, 185-2, 184-3, 185-3 and repeat with 186-187 (but I haven't found the four bars of coda on the manuscript). The final fugue, Dona nobis pacem, track 20, past its first page (189), is also written on two systems, so the sequence is 190-1, 191-1, 190-2, 191-2, 192-1 and so forth.The one that gave me the most trouble was the beginning of the Et resurrexit. Things go smoothly when the chorus enters, but I simply couldn't reconcile what I heard and what I saw during the extrarordinary orchestral introduction, tried to see if the first page of the movement had not been put out of its sequence but just couldn't find the page that corresponded to the music I heard.... until I realized that the first page (page 134 on IMSLP) was perfectly in its sequence... but turned upside down! Well, it is certainly music to bowl you over.And a P.S. from August 7: I mustered by best German and reported the problem to the Dresden library. They acknowledged receipt, explained that the Missa manuscript was a complicated case because it is one of the rare instances in which the manuscript is in the form of loose, unbound sheets of paper, and the page numbering is sometimes faulty, with recto and verso inverted. They'll fix it. Glad I could bring a very small contribution to the posterity of this great work.At the time of writing there's a cheaper offer than this: Zelenka: Missa Dei Patris.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35459MTXZSCXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000025UNA#wasThisHelpful","R35459MTXZSCXO","A3DDSAGWD0UN9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DDSAGWD0UN9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But since the pages are loaded one after the other (and out of sequence) and must be scrolled vertically, you get a sequence of 58-1, 60-1, 58-2, 60-2, 59-1, 61-1, 59-2, 61-2 etc. In order to follow the Agnus Dei Aria for alto (track 18), you need to realize that it's written on three systems, so the sequence is 184-1, 185-1, 184-2, 185-2, 184-3, 185-3 and repeat with 186-187 (but I haven't found the four bars of coda on the manuscript). The final fugue, Dona nobis pacem, track 20, past its first page (189), is also written on two systems, so the sequence is 190-1, 191-1, 190-2, 191-2, 192-1 and so forth.The one that gave me the most trouble was the beginning of the Et resurrexit. Things go smoothly when the chorus enters, but I simply couldn't reconcile what I heard and what I saw during the extrarordinary orchestral introduction, tried to see if the first page of the movement had not been put out of its sequence but just couldn't find the page that corresponded to the music I heard.... until I realized that the first page (page 134 on IMSLP) was perfectly in its sequence... but turned upside down! Well, it is certainly music to bowl you over.(And a P.S. from August 7: I mustered by best German and reported the problem to the Dresden library. They acknowledged receipt, explained that the Missa manuscript was a complicated case because it is one of the rare instances in which the manuscript is in the form of loose, unbound sheets of paper, and the page numbering is sometimes faulty, with recto and verso inverted. They'll fix it. Glad I could bring a very small contribution to the posterity of this great work.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24QCMKDK3YWME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Z5VD9U#wasThisHelpful","R24QCMKDK3YWME","A3DDSAGWD0UN9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DDSAGWD0UN9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although Zelenka (1679-1745) is far from a neglected presence on CD, he is still not, I think, given the public recognition he deserves: quite simply, when it comes to choral/religious music (in which Zelenka very much specialized), based on what I've heard of his compositions, he is, in my opinion, one of the very greats of the first half of the 18th century, on a par with Bach, Handel, Vivaldi and Telemann.This Missa Dei Patri is a good case in point. Despite its small catalog numbering, ZWV 19, it is one of Zelenka's ultimate compositions, from 1740. It is part of a cycle which Zelenka intended to reach six such masses, but ultimately he composed only two others, the Missa Dei Fili ZWV 20 and Missa Omnium Sanctorum ZWV 21. Apparently he wrote them with no performance in mind (no parts exist, only a conductor score), and they weren't performed during his lifetime.Like its two companions, Missa Dei Patris is an incredible masterpiece, with an opulence that seems to point to the great masses of Haydn, choral numbers of explosive power and/or tear-wringing solemn beauty (the choral ""ascent to heaven"" at 0:30 in the Sanctus, track 15, is one of these moments) and often with surprising melodic twists, fugues that equal those of Bach, if not surpass them in their searing and sweeping passion (""Cum sancto spirito"", track 9, repeated on the final chorus, Dona nobis pacem, track 20), and a melodic writing for soloists that, like those of Handel and Vivaldi, is always distinctive and invigorating. Zelenka's orchestra is reduced to strings, with two oboes that are, here, unless I've missed something, never given a solo role but always double the strings, but there is nothing austere in his accompaniment, on the contrary he uses his ensemble in a highly colorful and virtuosic manner, as exemplified by the extraordinarily florid accompaniment in the Quoniam Tu Solus Sanctus (track 8) and even more of Et resurrexit (track 13). Truly, when I'm  listening to this extraordinary and breathtaking invention that is the Et resurrexit followed by the Et vitam venture saeculi, I don't know who else composed like that around 1740. In fact, I'm not even sure Haydn or Mozart composed anything of such furious power, fifty years later. And I'm thinking that Zelenka didn't reach much success and recognition in his lifetime, because he was too daring, way too much in advance on his own time.And yet, when you have zillion of performances and recordings of Bach's Mass in B, Handel's Messiah and Vivaldi's Gloria, this is only one of the two recordings of Missa Dei Patris represented on CD (there was another one in the LP era), and the situation is the same with the Missa Dei Filii and Missa Omnium Sanctorum. It was made in 1988 and was a pionneering effort, in a time when Zelenka was still very much a Czech specialty. Frieder Bernius, who made a great recording of Missa Dei Filii in 1989 for Deutsche Harmonia Mundi (Zelenka: Missa Dei Filii / Litaniae Lauretanae), recorded the Missa Dei Patri in 2000 for Carus (Missa Dei Patris). There are also only two recordings of ZWB 21, one by Bernius again from 1997 for Sony that wasn't even distributed in the US and isn't offered at the time of writing, Musik aus der Dresdner Hofkirche: Missa Omnium Sanctorum and ditto for the French budget reissue, Zelenka: Messe Ultimarum Sexta (Missa Omnium Sanctorum), Zwv 21), and one by the Prague Baroque Soloists under Adam Viktora, Zelenka: Missa Omnium Sanctorum, Christe eleison, Barbara dira effera.Although my comparative appreciation is tentative because tainted by the fact that I've listened to Bernius not from the CD but from the YouTube upload and hence probably in inferior sonic conditions, ultimately, if you have only one, I find Gttler's version preferable. His is an approach on a grand scale, with a sizeable orchestra (Bernius' Stuttgart Baroque Ensemble sounds more astringent and typically period-instrument) further magnified by sonics with a long resonance. Compared to Bernius, Gttler also has a somewhat thick and heavy continuo and oftentimes a heaviness of motion and lack of dynamism, especially at the beginning of the work (as in the orchestral introduction, or the fugue on the opening Kyrie track 1 at 2:21, the Domine Fili track 6, the Credo track 10). Some of the more funeral passages can take that approach (as the Domine Deus, track 5), but sometimes Gttler is also entirely up to the music, as in his exhilaratingly dynamic Gloria, track 4, much better than Bernius here. He is impressively powerful in Qui sedes track 7, in Crucifixus, track 12, Et resurrexit track 13, searing in the Cum Sancto Spirito fugue (track 9), and in the Quoniam Tu Solus Sanctus trio (track 8) he is suitably dynamic and there is little to choose there between him and Bernius. But, even when Gttler occasional plods compared to Bernius (as in the Credo, track 10), the choral moments are always grand and powerful and particularly well spotlighted by the sonics, more so than with Bernius whose chorus (with the proviso that this may be an effect of hearing it on Youtube) sounds smaller-scaled and less impressive. Although I've always found Ren Jacobs sour in tone, the soloists (which include Olaf Br) are fine. I had never heard or heard of soprano Venceslava Hruba-Freiberger, but she sings exquisitely. In the Benedictus (for baritone, track 16) and Agnus Dei I (for alto, track 18), it is Bernius who is more plangent and funeral, and excessively so I find, it bogs down the music: Gttler's more animated tempi are preferable here. The Mass is a huge work, running here 70 minutes. It is, as its companion the Missa Dei Filii, one of the great masterpieces of early 18th Century sacred music. Experience shows that it is possible to survive without knowing the music of Zelenka (or Bach, or Handel), but life is way more fulfilling and fulfilled when you do.The Dresden library, where hundreds of manuscripts of Zelenka are held, has done a tremendous and admirable job at scanning them and putting them online on the International Music Scores Library Project. It's very moving to see those manuscripts. Some - and it is the case with Missa Dei Patris - are in a dangerously tattered condition, and they are occasionally difficult to read, because hastily handwritten with nearly undecipherable indications, with compositional conventions different from those of today (for instance, the rhythms on the different staves are often not aligned vertically), sometimes in faded ink and on damaged sheets of paper. But in the case of Missa Dei Patris, for the info of anyone who'd be interested, like me, in listening to the music while following with the score, I must say that whoever did the uploading job made things particularly difficult for the reader, because some of the movements are a jumble of pages out-of-sequence. So you first have to realize that something is wrong (""why am I lost?""), then try to figure out what the problem is. It took me hours - which at least were hours spent with the Missa. For instance, the Gloria, which starts page 34 on IMSLP, gos in a sequence 34, 36, 35, 38, 37, 40, 39, 42, 41, 44, 43, 46, 45, 48, 47, 49 and from there back to normal. Things are even more complicated in the Domine Fili, because there Zelenka wrote on two systems, and obviously the score is to be read upper system page left to upper system page right, then lower system page left to lower system page right. But since the pages are loaded one after the other (and out of sequence) and must be scrolled vertically, you get a sequence of 58-1, 60-1, 58-2, 60-2, 59-1, 61-1, 59-2, 61-2 etc. In order to follow the Agnus Dei Aria for alto (track 18), you need to realize that it's written on three systems, so the sequence is 184-1, 185-1, 184-2, 185-2, 184-3, 185-3 and repeat with 186-187 (but I haven't found the four bars of coda on the manuscript). The final fugue, Dona nobis pacem, track 20, past its first page (189), is also written on two systems, so the sequence is 190-1, 191-1, 190-2, 191-2, 192-1 and so forth.The one that gave me the most trouble was the beginning of the Et resurrexit.

"The Czech Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679-1745) was a near-exact contemporary of Bach (1685-1750) and he spent part of his career in Dresden, less than a hundred kilometers from Bach's Leipzig; both vied for some of the same honors, and it is known (from a later report from Bach's son Carl Philip Emmanuel) that Bach knew his colleague personally and held him in high esteem. So it is tempting to try and hear echoes of Bach in the choral music of Zelenka. But the temptation should best be resisted. Zelenka speaks very much with his own voice. Despite its small catalog numbering (ZWV 20), Missa Dei Filii belongs to Zelenka's ultimate trilogy (1740/41), together with the Missa Dei Patris ZWV 19 and Missa Omnium Sanctorum ZWV 21. It consists only of Kyrie and Gloria, without the three other parts of the ordinary, and it is not known if Zelenka intended it that way or just left his mass incomplete (but the fact that the two others are complete gives a pointer). Given that the mass as it is runs 42 minutes, one can only imagine its length had Zelenka written the rest. That Missa Dei Patris runs 70 minutes with a Kyrie and Gloria of less than 30 gives a clue. Apparently Zelenka didn't write those three masses with a performance in view, and they weren't performed during his lifetime: at least no instrumental parts have been found, only the conductor manuscript scores. Like its two companions, ZWV 20 is a work of extraordinary power and beauty, evoking less Bach than anticipating the great masses of Haydn. I can't start describing all the marvels of Zelenka's invention, the choral moments of extraordinary power and sweep (the Kyrie, the extraordinary Gloria, nine and a half minutes of lush and uniquely elaborate jubilation, for which little peers of that era come to mind, the imposing and almost funeral Qui Sedes ad dexteram patris over a nervous and panting instrumental accompaniment anticipating Gluck and Berlioz...), the beautiful melismata of the solo arias (Christe eleison, Qui tollis peccata mundi, starting with a five minute solo for soprano with florid violin accompaniment, then turning into an aria for the baritone, soon joined in duet by the tenor, for four more minutes, etc. Zelenka's ability to churn out irresistible arias seems not inferior to Handel's or Vivaldi's), the moods alternating between the grandiosely solemn, the deploratory and the jubilant. One often reads about Zelenka - and indeed in the liner notes - that he alternated, or even combined, old style and new style. But what's ""old"" about Zelenka's style? That he ended with a great choral fugue on the ""cum sanctus spirito"" verse? But Zelenka's concluding fugue doesn't sound in the least ""old-style"" or stern or cerebral and astringent: it develops extraordinary sweep and warmth and sounds like the greatest homage the mind of a musician can pay to his Lord, on the words ""with the Holy Ghost in the glory of God the Father"".I'll be shorter on the Litany of Loreto ZWV 152, only to say that, with its companion the Litany ZWV 151 it is also part of those ultimate works of Zelenka (1741/4), and that it is a masterpiece of equal stature as the Mass. For those interested, the online International Music Scores Library Project (IMSLP) offers these works (but for some reason their copy of the Litanies is limited to the first two movements) and possibly a hundred more scores of Zelenka - and all scans of the autograph manuscripts, miraculously escaped from the World War II bombings (they had been sheltered in the cellar of the Japanese embassy!) and now kept at the Dresden Library: bless these people for having taken the time to scan all these invaluable documents and made them available to all. Those manuscripts are not always easy to follow and some pages are in tattered condition, but I find it incredibly moving precisely for that: it's like having the composer's ghost right over your shoulder.Given what extraordinary masterpieces these are, it is incredible, and somewhat depressing, to think that they were so seldom recorded. So far as I could establish, with the help of the great Zelenka CD-discography featured on jdzelenka dot net and various other researches for LPs, this was the premiere recording of both pieces, and it remains to date, more than a quarter-century later, the only recording of the Litany, while only one more has been added to the catalog of Missa Dei Filii, in 1997, by the Dresden Chamber Choir and Baroque Orchestra under Hans-Christoph Rademann, on the obscure label Raumklang, Miserere-Missa Dei Filii.If you want to look at things positively, you'll say that it's because this version by Frieder Bernius was so perfect to start with that everybody felt they had nothing better to say. If you want to look at it less positively you'll say that, in view of the zillion recordings of Bach's Mass in B, Handel's Messiah and Vivaldi's Gloria, it shows how badly discographic posterity errs in the way it treats the great masterpieces of the past. The good thing about it is that you don't need to break the piggy bank to acquire all the extant recordings of these two masterpieces.Not that it's necessary to do so either. Experience shows that an interpretation can always be bettered, but here it is hard to imagine how it could. Bernius conducts with passion and boasts some of the best early music soloists of the time (1989), Nancy Argenta, Michael Chance, Christoph Prgardien, one of the best period-instrument ensembles (the Canadian Tafelmusik Baroque) and his own vocal ensemble. That said, in the absence of comparison, you can never be sure. Well, I have purchased and listened to the other version of Missa ZWV 20: see my review of the other disc for the complete details. Suffice here to say that it confirms the excellence of Bernius' version, not because it is inferior, on the contrary, because it is also excellent, almost as good as Bernius' and in some details or individual movements even a touch better, but that it is in fact so similar in interpretive approach to Bernius that it's not really a complete necessity to add it to your collection, unless you are a diehard Zelenkite.That said, this is the budget reissue of a recording whose original edition can be found under Missa Dei Filii Litaniae Lauretanae and, at the time of writing, sells much cheaper on the marketplace that the one offer of this supposedly budget reissue. So leave this one aside and go to the original, but don't miss this. On the basis of these works and others of Zelenka that I've heard, he is one of the major composer of choral/religious works of the first half of the 18th century, of equal stature with Bach, Handel, Vivaldi and Telemann, and among all these, the one who remains still today badly and unfairly under-recognized. As with Bach, a life spent without Zelenka is liveable, but not as worthwhile and fulfilling as a life spent with him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LG93BTU334W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001HQ2UO#wasThisHelpful","R2LG93BTU334W4","A3DDSAGWD0UN9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DDSAGWD0UN9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Suffice here to say that it confirms the excellence of Bernius version, not because it is inferior, on the contrary, because it is also excellent, almost as good as Bernius and in some details or individual movements even a touch better, but that it is in fact so similar in interpretive approach to Bernius that its not really a complete necessity to add it to your collection, unless you are a diehard Zelenkite.That said and done, whether you buy this version or Rademanns or both, dont miss these extraordinary works of Zelenka. Based on these and other works of Zelenka that I've heard, he is one of the major composer of choral/religious works of the first half of the 18th century, of equal stature with Bach, Handel, Vivaldi and Telemann, and among all these, the one who remains still today badly and unfairly under-recognized. As with Bach, a life spent without Zelenka is liveable, but not as worthwhile and fulfilling as a life spent with him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BSKYG18C8Z6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HQWQOI#wasThisHelpful","R2BSKYG18C8Z6U","A3DDSAGWD0UN9H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DDSAGWD0UN9H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Czech Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679-1745) was a near-exact contemporary of Bach (1685-1750) and he spent part of his career in Dresden, less than a hundred kilometers from Bach's Leipzig; both vied for some of the same honors, and it is known (from a later report from Bach's son Carl Philip Emmanuel) that Bach knew his colleague personally and held him in high esteem. So it is tempting to try and hear echoes of Bach in the choral music of Zelenka. But the temptation should best be resisted. Zelenka speaks very much with his own voice. Despite its small catalog numbering (ZWV 20), Missa Dei Filii belongs to Zelenka's ultimate trilogy (1740/41), together with the Missa Dei Patris ZWV 19 and Missa Omnium Sanctorum ZWV 21. It consists only of Kyrie and Gloria, without the three other parts of the ordinary, and it is not known if Zelenka intended it that way or just left his mass incomplete (but the fact that the two others are complete gives a pointer). Given that the mass as it is runs 42 minutes, one can only imagine its length had Zelenka written the rest. That Missa Dei Patris runs 70 minutes with a Kyrie and Gloria of less than 30 gives a clue. Apparently Zelenka didn't write those three masses with a performance in view, and they werent performed during his lifetime: at least no instrumental parts have been found, only the conductor manuscript scores. Like its two companions, ZWV 20 is a work of extraordinary power and beauty, evoking less Bach than anticipating the great masses of Haydn. I can't start describing all the marvels of Zelenka's invention, the choral moments of extraordinary power and sweep (the Kyrie, the extraordinary Gloria, nine and a half minutes of lush and uniquely elaborate jubilation, for which little peers of that era come to mind, the imposing and almost funeral Qui Sedes ad dexteram patris over a nervous and panting instrumental accompaniment anticipating Gluck and Berlioz...), the beautiful melismata of the solo arias (Christe eleison, Qui tollis peccata mundi, starting with a five minute solo for soprano with florid violin accompaniment, then turning into an aria for the baritone, soon joined in duet by the tenor, for four more minutes, etc. Zelenka's ability to churn out irresistible arias seems not inferior to Handel's or Vivaldi's), the moods alternating between the grandiosely solemn, the deploratory and the jubilant. One often reads about Zelenka - and indeed in the liner notes - that he alternated, or even combined, old style and new style. But what's ""old"" about Zelenka's style? That he ended with a great choral fugue on the ""cum sanctus spirito"" verse? But Zelenka's concluding fugue doesn't sound in the least ""old-style"" or stern or cerebral and astringent: it develops extraordinary sweep and warmth and sounds like the greatest homage the mind of a musician can pay to his Lord, on the words ""with the Holy Ghost in the glory of God the Father"".I'll be shorter on the Litany of Loreto ZWV 152, only to say that, with its companion the Litany ZWV 151 it is also part of those ultimate works of Zelenka (1741/4), and that it is a masterpiece of equal stature as the Mass. For those interested, the online International Music Scores Library Project (IMSLP) offers these works (but for some reason their copy of the Litanies is limited to the first two movements) and possibly a hundred more scores of Zelenka - and all scans of the autograph manuscripts, miraculously escaped from the World War II bombings (they had been sheltered in the cellar of the Japanese embassy!) and now kept at the Dresden Library: bless these people for having taken the time to scan all these invaluable documents and made them available to all. Those manuscripts are not always easy to follow and some pages are in tattered condition, but I find it incredibly moving precisely for that: it's like having the composer's ghost right over your shoulder.Given what extraordinary masterpieces these are, it is incredible, and somewhat depressing, to think that they were so seldom recorded. So far as I could establish, with the help of the great Zelenka CD-discography featured on jdzelenka dot net and various other researches for LPs, this was the premiere recording of both pieces, and it remains to date, more than a quarter-century later, the only recording of the Litany, while only one more has been added to the catalog of Missa Dei Filii, in 1997, by the Dresden Chamber Choir and Baroque Orchestra under Hans-Christoph Rademann, on the obscure label Raumklang, Miserere-Missa Dei Filii.If you want to look at things positively, you'll say that it's because this version by Frieder Bernius was so perfect to start with that everybody felt they had nothing better to say. If you want to look at it less positively you'll say that, in view of the zillion recordings of Bach's Mass in B, Handel's Messiah and Vivaldi's Gloria, it shows how badly discographic posterity errs in the way it treats the great masterpieces of the past. The good thing about it is that you don't need to break the piggy bank to acquire all the extant recordings of these two masterpieces. In fact, I just bought two more copies of the Bernius recording, to offer - I can't even say that it's putting my money where my heart is, given how cheap the disc sells on the marketplace.Experience shows that an interpretation can always be bettered, but here it is hard to imagine how it could.

"There are many different entries for the Lenovo G50 laptop and apparently many different versions, so to make things clear, i have G50-70 with 4GB RAM and 931 GB hard drive capacity, and Intel processor 1.4 GHz.This would be, I guess, as good a laptop as any other... if it wasn't for a truly infuriating glitch with the touchpad.

While you do, the cursor just jerks around uncontrolled, and infuriating things start to happen: screen zooms in or out, you jump from your working window to any other one that was opened in the background, if you have the misfortune of sending the cursor just near one of the icons in your lower toolbar it will load some software that you want to keep closed, etc. It's infuriating. After a while - maybe a minute or two - things return to normal - but not my level of infuriated adrenalin. The mouse on the other hand works no problem, and apparently when the touchpad goes crazy, just regaining control of the cursor with the mouse will - at least temporarily - solve the problem with the touchpad; but, sorry Lenovo, I don't find practical to work with the mouse, if only because when on the sofa or on my bed there's no support at my right-hand side, and I resent that you should force me to use the mouse: I should be the one making the choices, not you.

"Great book!  It brings great perspective to the area, the war, the people and their lives.  I haven't had a chance to get to Afghanistan, but I've managed to get some ideas about how these wars start and how education gets neglected - and even outlawed - from living in Jordan and paying attention to Syria.  But even with some small experience, it's difficult to make tangible without books like this.  The writing is excellent, the views rational, and the subject matter both depressing and inspiring at the same time.

"I like this book a lot, especially because it can bring some history to life for me and help me understand some of the moods and ideas of the time.  On paper I know what happened during this era, but it's hard to put it together and really get how it all came together and over what types of time periods, etc.  Although there's plenty of depressing stuff about the book, none of it gets you down.  The tone is easy going, and it's easy to read through, even relatively quickly.The author's style is relatively unmentionable, with the occasional strange phrasing used that sort of reminds me of old movies; maybe ""nostalgic"" is the right word.

I have an indexable nail puller that I really like and that has come in handy numerous times, so I figured this would inevitably come in handy at some point as well, being more suited to prying tasks.  Sure enough, it came in great handy to pull up the boards beneath some old steps recently, the tool helping me to not bang and cut my hands.It seems very strong.  Undoubtedly, the weak point must be around the indexable portion of the head, so when I'm doing seriously heavy work, I will use a normal bar when possible, but I don't see this breaking easily in any case.

"I also have an Alienware 17 with GTX 880M GPU.  Comparisons are somewhat unfair considering the nearly $1000 price difference, but I believe they may be helpful to a prospective buyer:You can look at specs and framerate comparisons of the GPUs all over the web, but my experience is that both deliver seamless perfection in the newest games.  If I'm dropping some frames with either, I don't notice, but I often like to play on my TV, and I know I lose something there.  I am also not obsessed with gaming like some, so I'll concentrate on some of the other factors.The displays themselves are both fantastic, and I cannot distinguish a huge difference there.The GTX970M included with this machine does make a noticeable difference in terms of power consumption, as this machine is much thinner and lighter than the AW.  At the same time, it feels slightly less robust because the entire chassis is not metal.I don't like the CD drive placement on this machine, as I keep popping the slot open from time to time.USB 3.0 is on only one side of the machine (2.0 port and card reader on the other side).  AW has two ports on each side.What I really like about the AW is that it has a second full size HDD slot for added versatility.  It's the only laptop I've ever seen with that.There are no obvious annoyances with the touchpad or keyboard as far as accidental hitting a key or something not working correctly, which I've seen with other laptops.  I am not thrilled with the placement of the delete key on this laptop, and I don't really like the fact that the arrow keys are scrunched up with the numbers and other keys, either.  By contrast, I believe AW got their layout perfect, including their four programmable keys.Lights.  The keyboard by itself may actually look cooler on the Apache because the lights are in the height of the keys.  BUT, there are only three zones, compared to AW's four, plus multiple chassis zones.  I really love the light-up touchpad on the AW.  What really annoys me about the lights on this keyboard is that despite the controller software that allows lots of per-key and per-game customization, there is no setting that allows the keyboard to turn off at the same time that the screen goes blank (or any time for that matter; you have to wait until the computer goes to sleep).  I have it rigged to change from one profile to a dark profile when I press the special command button, but that's not seamless.Windows 10.  Actually, I love that I got the AW at the time when they were still loading Win7 (Win 8.1 was out, but nobody wanted it).  I'm still not thrilled with Win10 due to their moving some settings out of control panel and into settings, getting rid of other settings altogether, still having a ridiculous start menu, and wanting to control your life as if you're some dumb tablet/phone user.  I installed Classic Shell to get my start menu back, messed with the control panel and settings for a long time, turned off everything they were ""offering"" me, and I have this working just about as good as a Win7 machine.  Oh yeah, and I ditched MS Edge; God, what was wrong with Explorer?  Anyway, if we're stuck with it, may as well make the best of it.Very little crapware on this machine.  On most computers, I disable even the proprietary controls since most of them do nothing.  This machine has a System Control Manager that doesn't do anything that Windows Power settings cannot do, but it confuses things and messes up my settings, so it will be turned off.  The other stuff seems harmless so far.I was telling someone that computers like this are a status symbol to some people (like cars are to some people).  And it came with a key fob, like a car...  Oh yeah, this and the AW both come in fancy packaging, including a suitcase-style box that you'll be tempted to keep, but practicality keeps me from doing so.  However, you may want it if you frequently transport your machine.  Also comes with the largest - but not softest - microfiber cloth I've ever seen (the size of the screen).In conclusion, you can see that there are a few minor things I prefer about the AW.

"This is a pretty good book serving its purpose.  There does seem to be a bit of filler, however.I like the tech tip sidebars a lot, but it's unfortunate that they end up repeating many of them.  An exclusive for each page would be appreciated.  The first couple chapters are sort of the same thing any such study guide would say, but the tests themselves have questions that I believe to be very similar to what may be on a test (for example, I have a math minor, but find some of the math questions tricky simply because they are different or include industry knowledge).  The answer keys definitely take up a lot more pages than they need to.I am an EE who has studied enough of this stuff to put in a home HVAC system (very well).  I was hoping to gain some more knowledge from this book.  While I can gather some new information from this book, they often leave big holes wide open if you don't already know something.  This is not particularly bad for the book, as most readers are already well versed in the industry, but it would be very frustrating if you did need a good brush-up and you were lacking other resources.If you are particularly concerned about one of these certification tests and test taking is not your strongest suit, then this should be a worthwhile guide for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAP6L3IL22DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979740304#wasThisHelpful","R1GAP6L3IL22DD","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While these definitely take some getting used to and you'd probably never pick them for comfort over a pair of snorkel-type goggles, they do fit well and seem to have the correct holding mechanism and strap for their lightweight, low-drag intended purpose.

"At the time of this review, there is not a regular Amazon page on this product, but it appears to conform to VESA sizing D, with both 75mm and 100mm square hole patterns.  Manual says it is rated up to 25 lbs.When mounted properly, this thing is extremely sturdy, professional looking, and versatile.  You will be able to adjust your monitor or TV in any way you can imagine, including fixed or dynamic switching from landscape to portrait.  To mount properly, you do need a stud if mounting to an interior wall.  They also supply anchors for masonry mounting.The top cover for the wall plate says Amazon Basics, which actually makes it look less generic, although I am sure some people don't want any extra color or logos on their walls.  You can leave this off, but then the hardware will show (in black).  The upper arm also has a discreet logo.  It has a medium flat black finish that looks high end (as usual, I think Amazon's stuff looks better than ""basic"" does justice).Both arms are approximately 10"" from pivot point to pivot point, so you can get at least a 20"" reach in any direction, or sit the monitor pretty much flat against the wall without any hardware showing.The lower arm has a roomy chamber for cables that can probably hold 8 RG-6 sized cables, or at least four larger cables.  Unfortunately, the upper arm has no room for cables, so you can only do as good as using the included black tie wraps to keep them in place.  If all your cables are black, it won't be much of an eyesore.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UH3GUZ8CP0W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QZCT5W#wasThisHelpful","R2UH3GUZ8CP0W3","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two other Contigo bottles that really impressed me.  Like, impressed me more than I ever expected a reusable bottle could.  And this one is the best yet, at least in terms of styling and confidence that it won't leak.The bottle actually has internal threads for a sleek look, but the entire mechanism increases my confidence in its ability to never leak.  It has a removable piece meant to allow for the addition of ice and to easily clean the bottle:  this is not as effective as another Contigo bottle that splits right in the middle at the thickest part, but again, this seems to be an even better seal (not that I ever had problems with the other one).The other thing less perfect is that it should not be used in the dishwasher (also not in the microwave, and it should not be frozen).  BUT...it is a seriously nice looking product, so the tradeoff is worth it in my opinion.  Mostly, I'll only be using this for water, so it'll mostly just need a rinsing now and then anyway.

"The packaging says that you're getting 77% more sheets because they've crammed in 85 sheets to a roll.  Yes, they tell you the size, but they expect you don't know that they're 25% smaller than sheets you're expecting if you're used to at home paper towels.  That kind of gimmick really annoys me, but I'm so used to it I never pay such statements any heed.  They seem like small rolls, and the absorbency is average for non-premium brand towels but, frankly, if you're buying them for the break room, they're good enough.  And the size will hopefully mean less waste.  Even if you were using them at home, the size could be a happy median between regular and half-sized sheets.

But that doesn't change that now I NEED to find my phone, unlock it, turn on the bluetooth, wait for it to connect, run the app (or download it again if I have a new phone), and then do all the other stuff associated with taking my temperature every time I want to see if my temperature has improved or worsened.

Further, it does not support Blackberry, Windows, or any other devices besides Apple and Android, which I find extremely short-sighted.I understand that some people just love to show how they can use their phones for anything and everything, but you're not using your phone INSTEAD of something else, but rather in addition.

"I like this thing a lot, but it could be better in a few ways.The current picture makes it look like a standard box cutter, but it is actually more like a pen knife, like it says.  I enjoy that aspect of it.It's thin at the top and wider at the bottom, which makes it larger than it has to be.  In fact, it wouldn't have to be as long as it is, either.  Seems like a pen knife should be as close in size to a pen as it can be because people are probably carrying it around in their pocket.  The tapered size does actually feel good to hold, but not as much in my jeans pocket.It makes sense to pick this over a standard box cutter depending how you carry it, but I'd venture to say that if you keep it in a large pocket, like a jeans pocket, you may be better off (just slightly safer) with a folding box cutter.  This would be the kind of thing I'd keep ...well obviously, where a pen would better fit.While I have no problem with razor blades under most circumstances, I imagine steel blades small enough to fit in here would break easily.  So in this case the ceramic cutter makes sense.  I'm not sure it is as effective for heavy duty use like for some of my DIY construction jobs simply because I don't want to pay for as many blades as I will break in that way, but I do think it will last longer for stuff like cutting boxes.  Mine, by default is probably going to stay by my mail area, as I am an Amazon junkie with plenty of packages to open.The slide button does not protrude much, but just enough to keep it from rolling off whatever surface you put it on.

It is for this reason that you don't get a huge surge protector, but in most instances, it is worth it for the size trade-off.

"This 8.5 watt bulb appears to be brighter than any of the 65 watt incandescent and (equivalent) CFL bulbs I have in my basement.  Since I have all recessed lighting in my basement, and I need quite a few bulbs for it to light up brightly, it is especially nice to use lower energy down there.  This is a very cool-running bulb and it looks good and appears to be great quality.  I also particularly like LED for recessed fixtures because you're not getting even close to the heat rating on the insulation-rated fixtures, so you can go brighter with peace of mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DECZ1PQFIPH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UX9H920#wasThisHelpful","R2DECZ1PQFIPH6","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent shaver, with all the bells and whistles (some of which I didn't even know existed).  It is extremely nice to be able to shave with the shaver wet, and even better to be able to use it in the shower.

You can pull off the head and run water over the inside instead of using a little brush like with some other shavers.I like that it has a docking station, but I'm not necessarily thrilled with it because it's so big and because it's a little awkward to make the power connection, as opposed to just setting it on something with properly placed contacts.The travel case is nice to have, as well as the included beard trimmer.

"I'm replacing my Sony STR-DE998 7.1 120w/ch. receiver with this (approximately 10 year newer) model from what I believe to be the same price class.  Were this my first receiver or if I were upgrading from a cheap unit, I would probably give this five stars.  But when you get a newer and/or better model of something from the same brand, you expect to get everything and more.  I found myself giving up a few things, which in some cases requires a work-around.  I'll list some of them here to give you an idea:NOTE:  I have a lot of good things to say after all these minor negatives, so don't get too pessimistic.  I love Sony products, but that just makes the minor negatives stand out to me more...1 - The biggest thing is that the extra two channels you may not use if you only have 5.1 around your TV (in my case, due to a smaller space and not wanting to be ridiculous with how many speakers I have one of the main rooms in my house) cannot be dual-zoned.  Yes, you can do the A/B/A+B front speaker thing, but now you cannot have a separate source playing out in the kitchen (zone 2), whereas I could with my previous unit.  And then, if I ONLY want to play what used to be the second zone (my kitchen), I have to switch it to a mode that doesn't use the rear speakers, lest I annoy someone in the primary zone not using this device.Worth noting is that the previous unit had a really clunky interface for zone 2, and I'll probably be able to streamline this new switching a little bit thanks to the three custom preset buttons on the remote (of course, I'll probably have to use all three, leaving none for other applications).2 - Fewer audio-based inputs.  Yes, you can change some inputs in the main menu to show up in your ""watch"" or ""listen"" categories, but if I want to LISTEN only to something on the ""video"" input (which is one of only three RCA inputs), then it's a crapshoot to get to it with only the remote (i.e., it was expected you'd have your TV/monitor on to get to this input.  This is because there are buttons on the remote to take you directly to some sources, but not others, and no single button to switch through them all (However, with my Sony TV remote, I can actually switch through them all).3 - Speaking of remotes, I love the remotes of all my other Sony equipment.  Why is this one so ""un-commanding""?  Not only is it smaller, less attractive, and with less buttons than what I would expect, it doesn't even attempt to be the one-size-fits-all solution to your  AV needs.If you do have all your inputs going through this (which I don't, actually:  I still like to be able to watch TV or anything else without having to turn this on, so I route through my TV) and you do have a TV that can control your cable box fluidly (good luck with that), and you do have a Sony TV remote that can switch over to control your amplifier pretty easily, than you may be able to get away with one remote.  But that's a lot of ""ifs"".  This remote doesn't even have channel +/- on it, so it won't be helpful at all.  Luckily, I can mostly control this amp with my Sony TV remote.That's the other thing - unless you have all those other minor compatibility issues - some mentioned above - resolved, you're still not getting a seamless solution that makes you want to keep this on every time you're watching or listening to anything (I cannot stand how some channels up the volume of commercials, and I find them all to sound particularly obnoxious coming from all speakers).  I don't have cable, for example, so I always need to switch TV inputs to get back to watching TV.4 - It has network capability, including DLNA, but it does not run apps like Pandora locally.  It doesn't do any video over the network.  My first-gen Smart Sony TV doesn't play *.mkv files natively, so this would have been the perfect gap filler.  It's an AVR, so why not fully do the video?5 - No more switched power outlets.  No AM.  No 75-ohm coax for FM.  Seems like less inputs in general (I have three analog audio sources, so now there is no place to hook up my old 400-disc DVD carousel via digital coax since the digital coax can only be assigned to those otherwise analog inputs).6 - Neither unit has a wired IR input port, which matters only if you want to hide all your components or keep them in another room.  I don't really need it, but you'd think it would be included.OK, lets talk great things now:1 - Fantastic sound.  More power than you'll probably ever use if you value your hearing.  Even if I had a full-out home theater room, this would be good enough, with all its adjustable speaker configurations.2 - I love its wired network interface (it only has a 100mb connection because it knows it won't pull video over the network anyway).  Yes, it can also be used wirelessly.Here is where I note that I hate wireless except where absolutely necessary.  Beyond my opinion (moving toward fact) is that I have noticed the Bluetooth on this does not have the same distance as some other connections because I have it in a credenza.  I expect similar issues with wireless, especially since you put this with a bunch of other electronics and they all create EMI as well as clashing radio frequencies...I have no problem pulling audio from a Win7 machine, even without having purposely set up a media server on it.3 - With this, though, I do very much appreciate the Bluetooth, both Tx and Rx.  I have wanted that for a long time.4 - One of the best things is being able to set all the options on the TV menu.  That was so horrible trying to navigate the menus on the device before.  You can still do them that way with just the device and the remote, but in most cases you won't want to.  Most of the settings are set and forget.  They're also a lot easier to set up, especially since the unit will do it for you with the included mic (that it knows where my speakers are is pretty impressive).5 - The unit itself looks great with its classic 17"" width and sleek design.  The LCD is only dot matrix; could be fancier, but it's okay.In conclusion, I do actually love the unit.  I take most receiver/amp features for granted, so I didn't list every little thing as a positive.  I was slightly disappointed in a few instances, but the unit still has all the important basics of functionality for audio/surround sound.  My incessant yearning for more is perhaps my own problem.If you've looked at the inputs and features on this machine and it does what you need it to, then I would definitely recommend it.  You will not be disappointed in the sound or quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ERF2EYX5IPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNH98IY#wasThisHelpful","R27ERF2EYX5IPY","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent machine for the current price of under three hundred dollars.  Thinking of someone who just wants a basic machine for web browsing and common computer tasks (I'm thinking of my mother here), they included all the things I would have included, and I understand where and why they made their cuts.It is thinner and lighter weight than most entry models, and while it doesn't look like a three thousand dollar machine, it is sleeker than I expected.  I like the full keyboard with number pad and basic touchpad.  The HDMI port allows watching full HD videos on your TV as applicable, while the included monitor is roughly (the computer version of) 720p.There are three USB ports, but only one is USB 3.0 (on the front of the right side).  So get used to using that one for removable drives, and leave any permanent low-bandwidth devices in the others..  The SD card slot (front of machine) is not spring-loaded, so you just shove it in there, and it sticks out halfway, so don't intend to store one in there permanently.I don't want to lose myself pontificating about Windows 10, but we can all thank God MS isn't sticking with the Win8 atrocity.  Windows 10 still really wants to control your life like Google and Apple, pushing things on you that you never wanted and trying to get you to sign up for all kinds of crap that will track you, control your life, and make it ""clickably"" easy to spend money, but through the control panel (which does still exist if you search for it) and the phone-style settings, you can turn everything off and make it more or less tolerable.  It is still sort of the two operating systems in one thing, but at least it's mostly back to normal (I still sort of miss Win7, which was so nice).Speaking of making your computing more tolerable:  this is slow if you're used to solid state memory and more RAM, especially since the operating system is a real resource hog.  Take some time to turn off all the crapware that comes on this machine, i.e., all the software put on not to help you, but because the companies paid MS and/or Toshiba to push it on you.  There are a lot of wasted resources right off the bat (as with almost any new computer, sadly), but getting rid of it all really makes a noticeable difference, especially in this case.Adding RAM would be your best upgrade to this, but I'm guessing they include 2 chips of 2GB, so you'll have to throw them both away if you wanted to upgrade to 8GB or more.It's missing a touchscreen and that crazy gesture reader they were trying to get consumers to desire.  Frankly, I don't want these things on a laptop, and I recently told my dad that these gimmicks (particularly the gesture reader) were a waste of money, and that's the last thing you want to pay extra for in a laptop (unless for some reason you really think you need them).  Kudos to Toshiba for offering a machine without these things and passing on the savings.I will say that you can hear it working all the time.  Just Windows Defender keeps this thing busy.  It's just a testament that computer speeds and specs need to keep growing if the operating systems and software keep becoming more greedy.Overall, I think that you can now get a decent machine for 25% less than you could previously.  And no Windows 8!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F19T0PD07VBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZD8Q7OC#wasThisHelpful","R3F19T0PD07VBE","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when I was younger, wearing Skate clothes, finding it ironic that these guys were using their funny name to try the switch from work clothes to ""cool"" clothes.  Years later, having not thought about it once except to giggle at the name, I see they have made it full circle to the fashionable market.Seems like they're doing a good job.  These jeans are clearly of good quality, have a great color (slightly darker in person than the current picture), and are in line with what I see dudes wearing today.Be aware that these are what I would call ""Skinny Jeans"" - the type that chicks can pull off only if they have the appropriate body type, and very few dudes can pull off without looking weak or silly or girly - more than ""slim straight"".  I expect slim straight to be just that, but these (32x32) are fine around my waist but tight around my calves, tight enough that they feel different (uncomfortable a little, but just because I'm not used to that).

"I liked this book a lot.  It manages to give some good insight through localized stories not captured in most books or news, while at the same time offering a broad history of the region that so many other books on Israel I've read have managed to leave out, assuming the reader already knows about those items.  I really appreciated this because I have read a lot of books on Israel since having lived in neighboring Jordan, but I managed to miss out on some of the basics along the way (my pre-college education was poor and my college was very dominated by Engineering).But that's not to say it is all-encompassing.  He talks about checkpoints, walls, the Palestinian Authority, and all this stuff without much explanation.  I specifically remember not understanding what the deal was with all that before having visited Israel myself and looking closely for the answers I needed.Anyway, I really enjoyed following a few diverse families on this street and their versions of what happened through these minor historical events, most of which will not be captured in history books or other offerings.  One of the eight chapters - the one with the foreigners - was starting to annoy me for some reason.  I guess I was just tired of hearing about them, but really, it makes sense to hear ALL sides, even if that means throwing in some Americans' points of view.Easy to read, even with a lot of quoting and the poor language skills - primary, secondary, or not - that come with it.  I find all those quotes work for this book, to really get a feel for and understand what it might have been like to live there over the years.  However, from chapter to chapter and even within some chapters, it's sometimes hard to keep the chronology of everything straight.Overall, a very enjoyable book","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEL78LA78Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072948#wasThisHelpful","RXEL78LA78Y7","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice extra to have, but it is unfortunate that it is an add-on rather than thought up and manufactured at the same time as the tool.  That is because it uses the same holes to mount as the blade itself, meaning you have to use the included (flathead screwdriver-using) hardware in lieu of the nice thumbscrews that came with my Hayate.  This is unfortunate because now you need to carry the screwdriver AND the thumbscrews if you think you will want to remove this at any time - and you may want to because it makes it harder to maneuver the pole in tight spots.Otherwise, it is well made and a thoughtful idea.I assume the other screws are for the other poles it fits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGZIX43W0WM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014CA44A#wasThisHelpful","RPGZIX43W0WM3","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is totally awesome.  Seriously.  I spent about four hours trimming my fully mature black walnut tree with it the other day.  First I did some branches off my second story balcony, with the pole fully extended and just 20-30 degrees from horizontal.  At one point, I got my blade stuck and it was flexed so badly that I was afraid I ruined the blade.  But no...it's perfect.And then I did a bunch more branches from the ground.  I hate how they say this thing is 20' long, but gives you a 25' reach, depending on your size.  I was out there with just the tip of the butt in my fully extended arms, completely vertical at times, sawing by going from tiptoe to flat and back, giving me approximately a 28' reach, and more like 32' once I stood on a wooden structure.I also did some branches that were sticking straight down just by angling from underneath.All this went surprisingly smooth.  Yes, it is easiest to go at a 30' angle from vertical, but I was comfortable the other ways as well.  Some muscles were tired afterword...It may seem extreme to buy this for one large tree, but it would have cost more to have a ""professional"" come out for the afternoon.  And I am a man who appreciates perfection in tools and the ability to go trim some more on my own time, anytime I like.BTW, Japan has so many amazing things that haven't made it over this way.  I was always fascinated to find these treasures while I lived over there, and I'm continually impressed with their traditional woodwork and the fact that they often use manual saws even for fine woodworking and architecture.  On this saw, I think even the pop-up buttons are more than meets the eye:  I noticed they don't function as you would expect unless you unlatch all the latches, as per the instructions (which come in English).Really fantastic tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AOG8VCAY12T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014C7Y6G#wasThisHelpful","R9AOG8VCAY12T","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never in the past given astrology  a second thought or cared much about it, beyond thinking it was the work of Satan as a youngster thanks to my mother's brainwashing ""not for profit"" church.  I saw this book, and thought it would be interesting, as I am a Scorpio.  It helped me to give astrology a second thought and, indeed, I believe there is something to it.  Not sure I'm on board with psychics and all that yet, but the signs and their associated personality types certainly seem fitting.So it's a very interesting book, and easy to read.  The writing is fine, but it is her second job, so it is not sublime.  I know she does it to keep track of who is who, but she keeps calling you, Aires, by your sign, which seems a little forced at times.  Also, there are sections for each sign on how to deal with Scorpio, which means a lot of repeat (yes, yes, always enjoy sex with Scorpio, and don't critisize him) reading or - if you're not interested in how the other signs need to interact with Scorpio -  a bunch of unused/unread material.She does a pretty good job of cluing you into the basics of astrology, although I missed the part in the book where it tells you what sign is born when, so I had to look that up; that part seemed like an oversight.All in all, worth a read if you're interested.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAYO9Q6BBZUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624141536#wasThisHelpful","R1GAYO9Q6BBZUG","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought some smoke/CO alarms in Jan 2015, the earliest of which were manufactured in July and Aug of 2014.  They all came with Duracells with a ""guaranteed charge holding date"" of Dec 2023.  I've since found some Energizers in my house from at least two different products with dates of Mar 2023.  These green/yellow batteries, ordered in Aug 2015, came with ""guaranteed charge holding dates"" of December 2021.  This matters pretty much when you're buying a large pack like this.They work, and are fairly inexpensive in this large pack.  It's nice to have a large pack of AAs, even though I try to not buy stuff that needs batteries when possible.Batteries aren't good for the environment, especially when they end up in the fire, trash, or enhancing some third-world addict's beer.  I really don't want to sacrifice expense or quality to be green, nor do I have the ability to tell what - if anything - is actually ""green"" about these batteries.

"This is a good, inexpensive helmet that reminds me a lot of my clear Uvex face shield in its adjustability and weight.  It has the Z87 polycarbonate piece on the outside protecting the filter, both of which can be removed and replaced.  Despite the Z87 rating, the manual still asks you to wear safety glasses underneath, which seems to be a standard request.You can also replace the lens with one that is auto-darkening, but I suspect in that case, you might instead consider an all around higher end helmet.  The filter is not appropriate for oxy-acetylene welding or plasma cutting, and if you replace the lens with one that is auto-darkening, you need one specifically designed for that use.The headpiece is similar to a (decent) hardhat, with the plastic band, padded front, turn-knob tightening, and very adjustable (to include angle and closeness to face, in addition to typical hardhat adjustability).  As another reviewer mentioned, you can tighten/loosen it just enough that you can make it drop with a quick nod of your head.If you want to wear it with a hard hat, you need an accessory, sold separately.  Even with a hardhat, it is not suitable for overhead welding (because no splatter protection).Overall, it feels safe and not at all a bad choice for the occasional hobbyist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17L7U7G4B8OLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009I2Y3E0#wasThisHelpful","R17L7U7G4B8OLI","A1MZL91Z44RN06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MZL91Z44RN06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is too tall to get under my '97 3er BMW.  But I have a floor jack for that.I used this multiple times over the past two weekends to replace columns on my porch.  I put a piece of 2x8 on the end of a 4x4, drilled a 1.125"" hole on the other end to fit over the head of this thing, and got to it (put some plywood or other boards underneath to distribute weight and keep the metal from marring surfaces).  The 1.125"" hole was extremely helpful at keeping my 4x4s in place during the process.This thing is awesome.  It was worth the twenty bucks just to not have to haul my floor jack out from the garage to the porch, put all that extra weight and rusty wheels on my new PVC porch that I was at first concerned about, and deal with the lateral movements you get with a floor jack.I had no problems getting the piston to retract.  I just push down on it lightly with my hand while turning the release valve.You can top this thing off with oil if need be, so I suspect it should always work as long as you don't actually break it open or let it rust away.

"A very different type of bib, this one is made from 100% food grade silicone and designed for age 6 month plus.  The silicone is very soft and it is designed to hook around baby securely, more like a vest, and without neck strain.  The silicone is easy to wipe and reuse and it provides a built in crumb catching tray.Nice idea, very soft and flexible, the pink is a bright pink with a cute little bear stamped on the front. Bib coverage area is about 7 inches long X a graduated 5 3/4 X 7 inches wide.  Sid to be anti-microbial safe silicone, and more comfortable for baby (because it comes across the shoulders instead of around the neck), it can easily be cleaned under running water.

"I love this series.  If you haven't seen it, you really need to start with Season 1 and work your way through.  The show is now in its 11th year for a reason....it's GREAT!  Sam and Dean Winchester are brothers, traveling the country and fighting demons.  The series began with Dean as a young boy and Sam as a baby, when their mother was whisked away by a demon.  Dad went demon hunting, Dean looked out for Sam, and the show began.  The boys grew up and followed in Dad's footsteps.  Even into the 11th year, there are still plenty of demons to fight and enough variety to keep it all interesting.In Season 10, especially with the awesome blu ray clarity, Dean and Sam, along with Angel Castiel, continue to fight demons, while searching for a cure for Dean's Mark of Cain.  Season 10 continues with the same quality as before. Crawley, Mama Witch Rowena, Metatron, and many others travel in and out of episodes.  23 episodes on 4 CDs provide many hours of scary entertainment, even a confrontation with Cain himself.  The Winchester boys have also developed their own distinctive personalities.Whether you believe in demons or not, this series is well done in a believable way in that the characters have emotions and display lots of ""human qualities"".  Special features include:  3 episode commentaries, a memory share from seasons 1 - 9, a preview of season 10 from 2014 Comic-Con, behind the scenes for the 200th episode, (200 EPISODES and counting!), a piece on the Mark and the Blade (a special killing blade goes with the Mark), a piece on Supernatural fans, unaired scenes, and a gag reel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QB6ZDXFWYY83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5D4QIA#wasThisHelpful","R3QB6ZDXFWYY83","A3FY3H6F4249E0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FY3H6F4249E0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very well-written book of Della's personal tragedy and how she coped, and continues to cope with the death of her 29 year old son.  It is NOT just a meditation book, as the cover might suggest.  Interwoven within the story are meditations to use as tools to help with the grief.  This is a very nice book for someone who has lost a loved one.Della's son died as a result of an auto accident.  One minute he was there, so full of life, the next he was gone.  This book touches on the spiritual aspects of death and provides practical meditations, using visualization techniques, to help one ground and center.  Della's studies in psychic awareness have obviously served her well and what she learned was there when she needed it the most.These are excellent meditations and I am in complete agreement with her perspectives.  Your loved ones are closer than you might image.  Many folks have experienced hints that their loved ones are still around.  It is so, if you open yourself up to believing.I highly recommend this book for someone who is grieving the loss of a loved one.  If you can get this book to them early on, all the better, especially in the first months of passing, when they feel the loss so greatly.  Della's story should make a lot of sense to the reader and provides practical advice and coping tools.  And, yes, you MUST grieve to release those feelings, but there are practical ways to grieve.Thank you, Della, for sharing your personal story to help those in pain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BFCZLJ8S7W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996387803#wasThisHelpful","R39BFCZLJ8S7W4","A3FY3H6F4249E0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FY3H6F4249E0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a great buy these scissors are!  They are so nice that EVERYBODY should have at least one pair in their home. If you have a camper or boat, I suggest another pair.  The scissors are a heavier weight, have many functional uses, and can be easily taken apart to clean, and put back together, with a simple twist.  The ergonomic soft-grip handle makes them easy to hold and use.  They come with a hard-plastic, magnetic shield holder, but the magnet is not strong enough to hold the scissors up, but you can arrange the shield to hold them at the base of a magnetic unit.These scissors would also make an excellent gift for the person who has most everything. They open bottles, scale fish, crack nuts, peel vegetables, separate into 2 slicing blades, has screwdriver blade. Made of stainless steel.  Website and email for support.

Inside the case are 4 slots, one for ID and 3 for credit cards. Pocket behind the cards can hold some folding money.The multi color, block leather pattern is pretty. There is also a small metal ring reinforced hole at the top for a key ring.  Stitched leather wallet comes in a heavy black cardboard box suitable for gift giving.

"It's difficult to give a review of a supplement purchased over Amazon, but I've been taking CoQ10 for years since I took statins over a decade ago. When you take cholesterol-lowering drugs like Lipitor or Crestor, it depletes your body of an essential hear nutrient. That would be CoQ10. There are a multitude of other reasons to take CoQ10 and this one is VERY well priced compared to what you get in stores.

"I'm not preparing for the AP exam, but am an American history buff (I was a Political Science major in college with lots of history classes). So I was intrigued to check out the latest information being taught to students about U.S. History and got this book. As you can imagine, this book gives a lot of assistance on taking the test itself, including LOTS of practice test questions, which could be useful for students needing to pass the exam. The companion DVD gives some excellent instructions on improving your ability to score well on the test.The only downside of the book is that it doesn't go into great detail on any particular part of American history. Important dates, events, and other items of historical significance are mentioned but not detailed. Perhaps that is by design to prevent this from being a 100-volume encyclopedia but anyone can easily Google these to learn more. The chronological and thematic organizing of the information is especially helpful to know what happened in what order. As for the information's accuracy, it's okay. I'm sure there will be people who have certain opinions about what happened in our nation's history. But the facts are the facts and they should speak for themselves without any editorializing. All in all, not too shabby a book to learn about American history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3365O2INF9N7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162523144X#wasThisHelpful","R3365O2INF9N7B","A1J6B00Z1D6PS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6B00Z1D6PS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been having trouble sleeping with the sunlight coming through the blinds at 5:30AM. So I've tried investing in a good sleep mask to give me blackout from the light. The problem with most is they are incredibly uncomfortable on the face. So when I saw this one made of silk, I was super excited to try it. And the mask itself didn't disappoint with silky smooth softness. My main problem with this mask is the strap that wraps around the back of your head. That also needed to be made of silk or have a silk cover around the elastic band because it cuts into my large ears.

"You may have heard the term sustainability in the context of the food supply and healthy living in the past few years but didnt quite know what it meant. But the author of this book is a Boston, Massachusetts-based RD-in-training and organic animal and vegetable farmer named Diana Rodgers. She's a highly-respected Paleo health blogger from [...] who has made it her personal mission to spread the word about how to attain optimal health by focusing on nutritious and delicious eating with humanely-raised animals, organic vegetables, and being willing to get your hands a little dirty to reconnect with your food again. This new book reveals the passion she has for helping others do just that.THE HOMEGROWN PALEO COOKBOOK is so much more than a book of recipes. I'd say it's more of a primer for how food is supposed to be, why the way the food supply is done in modern times is so far removed from what life was life just a half-century ago, and what we can do to return to the old template of living and eating. Diana pours her heart and should into the pages of this book that discusses the key role of sustainability and real food in the future of how we live.

Unfortunately, that's not what this was.The author Dr. Charles E. Dodgen, PhD is a clinical psychologist working with the elderly patients he features in his book. But his publisher really should have encouraged him to take off his professional cap and connect these stories on a more emotional level with the readers. It's all well and good to share about these amazing human beings as he does throughout the book so we can glean from their life experience and, as the subtitle suggests, find ""inspiration"" from that. Unfortunately, the reader is left to imagine that connection through the stuffy vernacular used to paint the narrative throughout the book.The difference between a good book and a great book is all in the presentation. So many things could have made Simple Lessons For A Better Life better than just a below average read for the intended target audience of the general public looking for uplifting prose: direct stories from and about the people featured rather than curt second-hand psycho-speak about them; a more positive tone in the presentation of the words of wisdom than a drab, methodical, clinical recount; and perhaps a recap in a nutshell of the overall intended message attempting to be conveyed at the end of each chapter instead of leaving the reader to wonder on his own what it is.SUCH high hopes...but sadly it fell so short. Let this be a lesson learned for the next book if you're given that opportunity again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRZQWAK4CABC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880168#wasThisHelpful","R2XRZQWAK4CABC","A1J6B00Z1D6PS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6B00Z1D6PS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always game to try new toothbrushes when they are available. This Colgate Sensitive Enamel Health Toothbrush looked really nice and so I decided to give it a try. Promoted for people with sensitive teeth and gum pain, it had such potential. And while it seems to have the ""cool"" factor with the hidden compartment in the bottom of the brush for hiding the Sensitivity Relief Pen, it all just seems a bit too fake for a $14 toothbrush.There are other numbing products on the market that cost less than this and it seems silly to fork out that kind of money for something you can get cheaper elsewhere. Furthermore, I understand Colgate is targeting people with sensitive teeth and gums, but these bristles are way too soft to adequately clean the teeth.If their goal was to give you a super-soft toothbrush and a numbing agent to give you the illusion that your teeth would be thoroughly cleaned without pain, then mission accomplished. But the reality is this is just another product attempting suck in innocent people to slick marketing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LW8U2H7HR7O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCW6NR2#wasThisHelpful","R1LW8U2H7HR7O2","A1J6B00Z1D6PS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6B00Z1D6PS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lesson in being very careful about what you order on Amazon. When I saw this product available, I was immediately drawn to it as a great heater for my front porch. So I ordered it. When I received a very sturdy, bulky cover for the heater in the mail, I remember thinking this had to be a very nice heater if the cover came in a separate shipping.After waiting a few days, I came back on to realize my boneheaded mistake--I ordered the cover! Oops. Well, lesson learned in being very certain of what you're buying and it's not the fault of the Classic Accessories manufacturer that this happened.The cover itself is very professional, thick, and would withstand pretty much any weather that might potentially cause harm to your heating unit outdoors. It's like a permanent raincoat to protect your investment so that the heater will work when you need it to. If you have a pyramid heater, there's no reason why you shouldn't own this cover.

"With the rise in popularity of Greek yogurt, it was only a matter of time before a product like Jarrow Formulas Greek Yogurtein Coconut Cream product was created. The front packaging boasts of being hormone-free, high in fiber, gluten-free and lots of various proteins. They also claim that it tastes great and mixes easily and I have no doubt that's true. They instructions recommend you mix two scoops of this product with water, milk, almond milk, rice milk, soy milk, or your favorite beverage. Okay great.But looking at the ingredients and Nutrition Facts in this ""health"" product, I was appalled! While it does indeed have Greek yogurt powder and whey protein in it, the so-called VitaFiber concoction as this ingredient called isomalto-oligosaccharides which is a really nasty, cheap sweetener product known as a sugar alcohol that can impact your blood sugar and stomach issues. And the coconut meal has a HUGE amount of sugar from sucrose, fructose and even the corn-based maltodextrin. There are several other sweeteners, proteins and flavors in this product to make it what it is. Incredible!The product has more carbohydrates (17g) than protein (15g) and there is virtually no healthy fats in the dry product. Adding in their recommended liquid besides this product adds in even more carbohydrates making this very dastardly on your blood sugar and insulin levels as well as increasing inflammation.

"When I got this Conair YOU Pro Cordless ThermaCell hair straightener in the mail and gave it to my wife, she looked at me with excitement about a product we could use on cruises and while traveling. We had high hopes it would be a great way to take care of her hair while on the go. But reality quickly sunk in when attempting to put the wacky battery into this thing became a huge ordeal. It's not exactly user-friendly. Once we finally figured it out (the instructions were not very clear at all), my wife let this thing warm up to try it on her hair. Completely and totally useless! As others have noted, it doesn't get anywhere close to being hot enough to straighten her hair.

"The Seek Thermal UT-AAA Thermal Imaging Camera is very small and plugs into the port at the bottom of your phone.  There are no batteries to charge, no special cables to use, nothing like that--that's a good thing.  All that's needed to get started is to install the Seek Thermal app from the Google Play or Apple Store. As the app was downloading, I could help but imagine what would happen if I dropped my phone with the camera attached. No doubt it would be toast!The software itself is not user-friendly at all. Despite being pretty technologically savvy, it took me a long while to understand how to use it once I downloaded the app. It does take photos, record videos, has various colors to choose from, includes a spot meter function that is supposed to display the surface temperature of whatever you're pointing the camera at, and a few other options.  But I wasn't impressed with the resolution of the images and here's why. The Seek Thermal website claims this device has a ""206 x 156 Array"" and ""32,136 Thermal Pixels.""  Given those numbers you'd think the Seek Thermal camera would produce a much better image, but that's definitely not the case.I can't help but wonder about the validity of judging an IR camera by the resolution. Thermal sensitivity seems like it would be a nice metric to use, but I can't figure out what the sensitivity of the Seek Thermal camera is. I wished they would have provided a second optical lens option which blends optical images with infrared images to give an easy-to-understand hybrid image that outlines the high contrast images. Unfortunately, the Seek Thermal camera doesn't have that option.My bottom line thoughts about the Seek Thermal UT-AAA Thermal Imaging Camera is that the images don't look nearly as good as I they should. While the camera on my smartphone takes 13 megapixel photos, the photos on the Seek Thermal aren't nearly as nice as the photos I take with my camera set to a lower resolution than this device. In my opinion, the Seek Thermal isn't a substitute for a dedicated infrared camera. This is a device to buy if you want to play around your house or to find a quick fix leak or use it as a handyman tool around the house to have.If you're in the market for an infrared camera for your phone, I think there are MUCH better infrared devices that are worth paying the extra $50 simply because of the MSX technology that makes the images look so much better than the Seek Thermal. I hope this review helps you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7TPRSOPIURK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYWAHHM#wasThisHelpful","R2F7TPRSOPIURK","A1J6B00Z1D6PS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6B00Z1D6PS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm the host of a top-ranked iTunes health podcast called ""The Livin' La Vida Low-Carb Show"" and a frequent public speaker for a living. I have long been looking for a portable device that would provide podcast-quality recordings without a lot of complicated software or smartphone app gadgetry. I've finally found it at last--the Esky VR-01 USB Flash Drive Digital Audio Voice Recorder!When I first got this thing, it just looked like any other USB Flash Drive. And it certainly can function as a USB stick if you want it to. But the real magic happens when you simply slide the button to the ""on"" position and start talking. I couldn't believe how incredibly crystal clear the audio was and you don't even need to put it close to your mouth (in fact, if you put it too close the sound becomes distorted).All I needed to do to create a recording is sit at a table, place this device in the middle between me and my guest and slide it to the ""on"" position, and have a great conversation. This lightweight device picks it all up for as long as the interview lasts (up to 15 hours--but none ever last that long!). There's plenty of room to record whatever you need.When I'm finished recording, it's as easy as sliding the button to the ""off"" position, plugging it in to the USB port on my Macbook Pro, and opening the file up in my recording editor Audacity to make any appropriate edits to export as a WAV file. Then it's ready to upload to my producer's DropBox and it's ready to roll. At just $25, this could quite possibly be the best investment for any podcaster, student, or anyone who wants a handy dandy quality audio recorder that fits any budget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GAAATDLEQ6TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7F1NXI#wasThisHelpful","R3GAAATDLEQ6TU","A1J6B00Z1D6PS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6B00Z1D6PS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been on the lookout for a quality Bluetooth speaker to use with my Apple iPhone and iPad for listening to music, podcasts, and any other audio from my devices. For all the functionality these offer, the one thing that has always been severely lacking is quality sound. That's why I was happy to find the iClever speaker to amplify that sound in a very natural way. And boy does it ever do that!Within 10 seconds of taking it out of the box from Amazon, I had synced it with my iPhone and started playing Pharrell Williams' song ""Happy."" I placed the speaker in the center of my 1000 square foot house and could hear it loud and clear from wherever I stood. Unlike some other speakers, it really gave you a surround experience with the audio and not a muffled sound from being turned in the other direction.And because it is small enough, this speaker is discreet and not an eyesore wherever you choose to put it. But don't let the small size make you think it's not powerful--you get a nice booming sound that is appropriately balanced between treble and bass for an authentic audio experience. The fact this thing costs less than $30 makes it a no-brainer because it's easily worth at least double that!

"If you have penchant for compelling storytelling, then this it the book for you! Christopher McDougall is a skilled journalist with an eye for getting to the heart of a story to discover the meaning and purpose of events as they are unfolding. It's one thing to simply report on what happened in a very dry, stoic manner that shares the bare minimum facts of what happened. But McDougall has that special knack for taking the ordinary and looking for the extraordinary that happened in the who, what, where, why, when and how. That formula is all over NATURAL BORN HEROES.Reading through all these amazing stories, one thing is certain--all of us have what it takes to go from misfits to masters at whatever we choose to do in life. While this book specifically examines strength and endurance since the author is already very well known for this from his bestselling book BORN TO RUN, it really has application to anyone desiring to be and do whatever it is they set their minds to being and doing. I think deep down inside most of us know we are capable of so much more than what we are currently doing. We just need that gentle nudge to push us in the right direction and give us encouragement that we will succeed. This book is just the nudge you've been looking for.Since I am primarily a nutritional health blogger and podcaster, I was especially enamored by Chapters 32-36 where McDougall brought out some incredible information that is spot on about diet, exercise performance, and healthy living. Sugar and other carbohydrates aren't the great fuel for running that they have been made out to be. Shifting over to utilizing fat for fuel instead of sugar is a much more efficient way to keep your body healthy while performing at optimal levels. Even world-renowned running experts like Tim Noakes from South Africa had to change his views on carbohydrates in preparation for running a race. WOW!Noakes also noted the error in telling runners to load up on water beyond the signal for thirst and says that doesn't make any sense from the standpoint of how our ancestors survived. The brain and body doesn't lie and you should rely on the signals they are giving you about when to drink and how much. There are so many riveting nuggets of information like these within the pages of NATURAL BORN HEROES that you'll feel like you're in a movie.My favorite quote in the entire book is this: ""It's an inconvenient truth, but a truth nevertheless: animal fat made us who we are."" And in our modern-day, fat-phobic society, that sounds incredibly strange and foolish to the uneducated. But the story we've always believed was unassailable was all predicated on a series of lies and misinformation that people like Gary Taubes, Phil Maffetone, Tim Noakes, and others are now exposing for all the world to see. And add Christopher McDougall's name to that list now as well who lays it all out clearly in NATURAL BORN HEROES. Kudos!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GXNZNDLE21H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594963#wasThisHelpful","R2GXNZNDLE21H6","A1J6B00Z1D6PS4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J6B00Z1D6PS4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the most misunderstood chronic health problems of our day has got to be autoimmune disease. And because it manifests itself in a variety of ways, conventional medicine chooses to examine each condition on the autoimmunity spectrum individually, including Graves' disease, Psoriasis, Fibromyalgia, Lupus, Celiac disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis, Multiple Sclerosis, Scleroderma, and Type 1 Diabetes. But Dr. Amy Myers is a medical doctor who actually understands all the intricacies of autoimmune disease because she sees the worst of the worst day in and day out in her functional medicine clinic in Austin, Texas.Now Dr. Myers has taken all those years of experience working with real patients and put it into book form for automimmune sufferers to glean from her wisdom and help them get on the road to recovery after years of frustration working with the ineptitude of mainstream medicine. THE AUTOIMMUNE SOLUTION isn't about some quick fix, but rather identifying the methodical steps (referred to as The Myers Way) it takes to heal your body from what ails you. She has successfully used this approach with thousands of patients and seeks to share what she has learned in an easy-to-understand program that anyone suffering from this can begin implementing immediately.The Myers Way consists of four primary components:1. Eliminating toxic and inflammatory foods.2. Adding in foods and supplements to repair the damage to the gut and body.3. Identifying and eliminating culprit environmental toxins from your household products.4. Removing any infections and dispelling stress that would exacerbate the immune system.For people familiar with the Paleo diet, The Myers Way uses this way of eating as the nutritional basis to help optimize overall health. THE AUTOIMMUNE SOLUTION provides so many other elements in this process that can make a real difference in your pursuit of beating your autoimmune condition. Dr. Myers herself overcame an autoimmune condition and has seen her method work well for all kinds of people.

"I really didn't know what to expect from this AYL StarLight 330 camping light, but it looked cool enough. When I got it and I saw how small it was, I didn't think it would do a very good job of providing enough light to see in the pitch black that happens outside at night away from the city. But I was wrong. The brightness was surprising widespread, but not so overwhelming on the eyes that it was difficult to see. There's a fine line between visible and blinding light and this product strikes the perfect balance. I gave it a 4-star review because of one issue I had with the setup of this thing--the batteries. I spent over a half hour trying to get them in the perfect order, flipping them back and forth, desperately trying to get them to go where they needed to go. Now, perhaps they shared this info somewhere, but I couldn't find it. Thankfully I finally figured it out but it was a bit frustrating at first.

"These Bear Naked Real Nut Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Energy Bars sound like they could be a healthy option for people wanting a snack. The way they are marketed as 100% natural (which means absolutely NOTHING by the way) with no high-fructose corn syrup, no artificial preservatives or flavors, no hydrogenated oils (trans fats), no cholesterol (meaningless!), and ""no monkey business"" (okay, whatever), you'd think these would be good for you. But you'd be wrong.There are so many pro-inflammatory, blood sugar/insulin raising ingredients in this bar, including whole grains, peanut butter (a legume, not a nut), sugar, three different kinds of inferior soy, brown rice syrup (more sugar!), and crisp rice (more grains and sugar). That adds up to a whopping 31 grams of carbohydrates (aka 8 teaspoons of sugar!) in just one bar. WHOA!Come on guys, the consumer deserves better than THIS in a health bar.

"Disclaimer: I was provided this unit in free in exchange for an honest review.The question you're probably asking yourself right now is: how does this compare to Apple's official charger, which costs $30 more?Well, after two weeks of thorough usage, I've only noticed two differences:1) The cables aren't quite as thick / rubbery. They're close, but they don't ""bounce back"" quite as much as the more rubbery official cables. That being said, this isn't necessarily a bad thing - I've always thought Apple's cables to be a bit too thick, to the point of being frustrating / impractical. But, this is mainly a matter of personal preference - not necessarily something to hold against ClawTech.2) The red ""charging"" light is dimmer / more difficult to see. The green ""fully charged"" light works as expected, but a couple of times I've had to do a double take because it looked like it wasn't charging / I couldn't see the ""charging"" light.Since both of the above points are fairly small, I'm happy to say that I believe the ClawTech adapter to be worth the $30 you'd save off the official adapter. That being said, it's still a matter of personal preference - if you absolutely must have the best, or if money doesn't make a difference (ie if your work will cover the purchase), then $30 isn't that much more for the peace of mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GOXXGLP6FVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNE7GU8#wasThisHelpful","R23GOXXGLP6FVE","AXKOFQ3C2H0L1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXKOFQ3C2H0L1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Full disclosure: I received a free copy of this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.My biggest skepticism from years past when it comes to 2-in-1 cables is that they just don't work / can't do everything regular cables can.

Who knows, some sort of magic - but it finally works.Once I got over my initial excitement and started using the product regularly, I found one issue: the capping system is a little awkward (the connecting cable is thick and rubbery like the rest of the cable), but I can't think of a better way to do it that still makes it impossible to lose the cap.As a side note, this cable is great for travelling - half the cables!

"When I first considered buying this flash drive, my biggest concern was ""Where's the USB 3 port?"" - as it turns out, one side of the flash drive is micro USB... and the other side is USB. There's no cap, because the entire end of the flash drive fits INSIDE of a USB slot. Yes, this flash drive is THAT small. Which is a pretty big game-changer: these days, flash drives are becoming more and more optional / ""in case of emergency"", so size and convenience has replaced performance as my primary concern.That being said, as a USB 3 device, performance is still pretty good. I achieved 16MB/s sequential writes (vs 30MB/s for my previous, high-performance flash drive: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KT7DXIU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KT7DXIU&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=SZIXX34MIKDAXAVMIf you need fast read and write performance, the above SanDisk Extreme is a great drive, and only slightly more expensive.

"Full disclosure: I received a free set of baking mats in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.I've always thought it was silly to throw away a sheet of aluminum foil every time we put something in the oven - but before coming across these baking mats, I had no idea there was an alternative.Having used these for oven cooking three times now, I can say that these work. I was a bit skeptical that they would, especially after taking them out of the package to discover that their unusual texture (which I can only describe as ""slightly sticky rubber""). But, work they do, and we've had no issue with baked goods sticking to them, even without any sort of cooking spray!So, if they work, the big question comes down to value. When I first received these for review, they were $30 for a set - at that price, it would take a /long/ time to save $30 in aluminum foil. But, now that their price has fallen to $18, the bet is much less risky. If you cook in the oven on a regular basis, you'd likely pay these off in about a year. Plus, you don't have to use oils to keep food from sticking to the aluminum foil, which is better for your health.The last point that I would like to mention, and the only real reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 at this price point, is that you /do/ still need aluminum foil in your kitchen. With these baking mats, you won't need it nearly as much - but there are still times you need it for wrapping, grilling and covering. Which makes it slightly less of the ""kitchen miracle"" that the marketing claims it to be - but, hey, that's marketing.I hope you found this helpful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FD5AIEKD9TAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZFA500#wasThisHelpful","R3FD5AIEKD9TAM","AXKOFQ3C2H0L1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXKOFQ3C2H0L1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even though I do not plan to enter the Amazon liquidation game, some of the tips he shares are applicable to a wide variety of businesses.Worth the read and the affordable price, especially if you're looking for a new side project / way to expand your income.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R125QKY7FXLGTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TITYHCG#wasThisHelpful","R125QKY7FXLGTQ","AXKOFQ3C2H0L1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXKOFQ3C2H0L1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned both versions of this wallet (v1 and v2). Many of the concerns other reviewers have had (mainly the cards falling out) have been solved in version 2, which is what you're buying here.To put it in perspective, this wallet weighs as much empty...as a single sheet of paper.At present count, I have 5 bills and 10 cards in my wallet, and it's barely thicker than my phone. If you have tiny pockets - or just don't like having a bunch of huge things in your pocket - this wallet is for you.It's also incredibly durable. I've had my current version for over a year, and there's absolutely no signs of damage (even if there was, they're only $12!)Which leads me to the only con - some people might not like the appearance. It's sleek and modern, but it lacks the ""executive"" feel people usually look for in leather wallets. Depending on the color you get, dirt can also be fairly visible on it. Of course, since it's just tent fabric, it's easy enough to lightly wash.So there you have it - an absurdly light, thin and practical wallet whose only drawback is that it doesn't look like you spent several hundred dollars on it... because it only cost $12.I hope you found this helpful!

"I own both this and the DJI Phantom. When I bought it, the Walkera was slightly cheaper than the DJI Phantom. Learn from my mistake, and just get the Phantom! (Actually, the Phantom 2 looks even better, especially the one that includes the gimbal: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JD4TQ8Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00JD4TQ8Q&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=BN77OD53AMBBC7CDPros of the Walkera:- With fewer safety features, it's easier to push this quads to the absolute limits. It's kinda like driving a manual car, in the sky.- Uses a slightly larger battery than the Phantom 1, and thus has ~15 min flight time instead of ~12 min (note that the Phantom 2 mentioned above has way better flight times than either of these)- Fancier looking controllerPros of the Phantom:- All the safety features make it easier to control and harder to crash- If you do crash it (as I have), spare parts and repair guides are much easier to come by- The Zenmuse gimbal you can get for the Phantom does a much better stabilization job (if you're going the filming route)Things that neither of them have:- No telemetry. The battery indicators are /on the quadcopter/ which is pretty much useless unless you plan on flying within 10 feet of yourself. You'll want to set a timer on your phone / watch so that you know when to start bringing it in.- No collision avoidance. Some research labs are prototyping collision avoidance for quads, but right now, it's still /really/ easy to accidentally hit a tree and do some serious damage to your quad. Have a friend spot you!If the Walkera were $100 cheaper than the Phantom, I'd label as a good beater quadcopter. Not a good beginner quad, because it's so much harder to fly, but one that you could throw away for crazy stunts.But, at the same price as the Phantom, the Walkera really brings nothing to the table. So what are you waiting for, go get the Phantom 2!(But good on you for doing your research first!)","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V77ZE0C6KEJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEB4S3A#wasThisHelpful","R3V77ZE0C6KEJW","AXKOFQ3C2H0L1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXKOFQ3C2H0L1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you're still on a USB 2.0 reader, the 3.0 speed boost is well worth the small price.DESIGNWith similar designs, the winner is down to the details. This one is slightly smaller in all dimensions (it's small enough that I leave one in my camera bag), and the paint coating on it is less glossy, which means it handles scratching and normal wear & tear better.This one also include a cap to protect the USB slot. However, there's nowhere to attach the cap while it's in use (you can't stick it on the end like a marker cap), so I ended up throwing it away, as it's not really needed.PRICEAt time of writing, this one was $2 cheaper ($7 vs $9)OVERALLI'm happy to say that both products worked well - they were fast, small, and did their jobs. The slightly better design and lower price make this one the clear winner, but I still recommend checking the price on both - at the end of the day, they're so similar that I recommend buying whichever is cheaper.I hope you found this helpful!

"I've been through several tripods in the past few years. I finally came across this one after being recommended by the Strobist blog. In short, I am extremely satisfied with the diminutive size, ultralight weight, and durability of this tripod.In long, here's a bit of a comparison of the tripods I've used over the years (and why the Strobist's recommendation to just start off by buying a really good tripod holds true):When I first started with photography about four years ago, I purchased the cheapest tripod I could find, the $25 Vista Explorer: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V7AF8E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000V7AF8E&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=OOAE2WZGH75GOMM3It's light, has clamp locks and a level and an adjustable center column. Features check. What it didn't have was strength. If you wanted your camera anything but level, its plastic clamps would slowly slip (shooting on an intro-level dSLR - would probably be fine with a point and shoot). It was a great tripod....until I started taking photographs for real, and needed a tripod where I could let go of my camera for more than 5 seconds. Also, no ability to pan the camera!So, I got the $70 Dolica Proline: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DIKUYE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001DIKUYE&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=K3PYY4E3AAHTRKT4Better. This tripod lasted me for a solid year of trustworthy functioning - until, one day, it got blown over in a wind storm, and the legs bent. Did I mention this one was still made of plastic? It was also awkwardly designed, with the pan handle extending out of the carrying bag (unless you really wanted to unscrew it every time you put it away)Fast-forward to this Mefoto, whose durability has survived drops and falls, and whose portability lets me stick it in a backpack and ditch the extra carrying case. It's made of metal, so I'm expecting it to last much longer than either of my previous tripods...It might cost twice as much as my Dolica, but it's on track to easily last at least twice as long!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H39LD8TTG7O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BETIVUM#wasThisHelpful","R3H39LD8TTG7O9","AXKOFQ3C2H0L1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXKOFQ3C2H0L1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've tried it in other controllers and a friend's ps4 with similar results.Update: I noted that they are lumping all of the reviews together under one listing... lovely...2/5 stars: Level 5+ is the most overpriced and the one that has the feedback and static issues.4/5 stars: Level 3 is a solid mid range headset - I think this is the best version since it has less bells and whistles and is a simple, two earpiece headset.4/5 stars: Level 1 is a great budget set with one earpiece.For a wired headset, it behaves a lot like a crummy wireless set.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ICF62TEJKVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJEMT88#wasThisHelpful","R11ICF62TEJKVZ","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically this is a USB charging hub.  It plugs into the outlet via a cord, so it can be taken on trips or used at home or at the office.  It does not require mounting (the title makes it sound as if it 'should' be mounted).  The plus for the Belkin brand is that it charges four devices simultaneously - some devices with multiple USB charging points can only charge one at a time.It fits standard USB - so you can put aside the clunky Samsung, Apple, and Motorola chargers and just unplug the USB to (insert proper phone connecting point here - USB, lightning, micro USB, etc...)Overall I am pleased with the device and the quality.

"These are very easy to put together - just a screwdriver and wrench or pliers (to hold the nuts).  One person job, but easier with two.  The only drawback is that it takes a little while to put together with just one person. Also, the little plastic feet don't stay on very well - but if you're putting the shelf on concrete or wood (storage shed, garage, etc...) it shouldn't matter.The good?The shelf is decently heavy, but not too heavy for one person to move when it's empty.The shelves are easily adjustable.It does fit through a standard door when assembled.Instructions are actually decent for IKEA style picture instructions.Overall I am satisfied and would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EAESOUV4VGPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I2GRBW#wasThisHelpful","R3EAESOUV4VGPL","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We play a lot of Euro style board games in the style of Catan, Agricola, Kingdom Builder, and others.  This is what I would consider a VERY light Euro style game, or a mid level family style game.  It is appropriate for a wide age range.To sum the game up, you attempt to slay a dragon, but if you have help, you have to start a 60 second timer and negotiate as to the division of the spoils or nobody gets any of the treasure.  It's a neat twist on classic game play, but it is really focused on the negotiating side of things.  This is why I hit a four star rating.  It really depends on how the other players are negotiating and how much fun folks are having.  Sometimes you play with a person who is kind of a jerk and it can take some of the fun out of it...  That's the real only negative aspect.  And replay can be dull after awhile since it consists of a similar lather, rinse, repeat style of play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD1EY44RE5OEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","RD1EY44RE5OEJ","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been playing Destiny on the PS3 and figured this was too nice to pass up.  The system has a wonderful theme: polar white with gold and silver map / logo accents.  The controller is also polar white and matches nicely.What the system includes:-One DualShock4 Controller-One HDMI cord (I used a better one from AmazonBasics)-One earpiece microphone (a very basic setup)-One power cord-One controller charging usb to micro usb cord-One month free Playstation Plus-One hard disc copy of Destiny The Taken King Legendary Edition (all DLC to date)Note: You need a good Ethernet Cable if you are using a hard line for the PS4 (highly recommended).  It does have built in Wifi.UPS was a bit late in delivering so unfortunately I had to wait 6 hours for the content to download from the servers.  In the meantime, I downloaded Sword Art Online Hollow Fragment and played that while the download ran in the background.The media interface takes a bit of getting used to with the PS4, but it is more set up to be a multi media powerhouse than a 'game system'.  The light on the system is subtle and shows when the system is running or in rest mode.One BIG annoyance however: the damn light bar on the controller.  Even changing the settings to the dimmest possible it still shows a glare on the TV when playing games.  Plus, I often play with the controller laying on my chest, so the top of the controller faces my face: annoying light in my eyes if I do this.  Time for some electrical tape!The PS4 is a great step up from the PS3.  It really shines on the newest HDTVs.  And the potential for the future is huge.  Developers have barely pushed the hardware on this system.  It is probably a ten year system - and costs about half what the PS3 cost when it was new!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24AQHZ5WW67R3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012UGC9F0#wasThisHelpful","R24AQHZ5WW67R3","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid, high quality electric razor produced by Philips Norelco.  I've owned many of their products in the past and have been pleased with several of their trimmers and razors I have tested and reviewed.  There are so many wonderful things about this electric shaver but I will point out the one obvious hiccup: this sucker is expensive!If price is no object however, then you will be looking at one of the best, most comfortable oscillating electric razors out there.  Some of the pros:+ Quick charging (1 - 2 hours for a full charge)+ Long battery life (holds a charge for days with regular use)+ Lightweight and sturdy+ Trimmer attachment for beards (more on this)+ Quiet - won't wake up the missus (or mister)There should be three +++ for me for the trimmer attachment since I sport a short beard year round.  Typically I have used those standard beard trimmers, which are horrible for trimming the beard around the ear (finishing my neck with a blade).  This setup does wonders around those tricky areas.  Now I can use one tool for both a close shave on my neck and a short beard trim.  I've even used it on my head and it does a pretty good job - though nothing beats a blade for those baldies like me!Bottom line: this is a great razor.  If you have a guy in your life who needs a new electric razor - this is a GREAT gift!  Or if you're a guy (or very hairy woman - equal opportunity here) who wants to treat themselves to the very best - this is one of the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R75LWF8E4ZNNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VL5TB0#wasThisHelpful","R75LWF8E4ZNNT","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tiger makes some of the best rice cookers on the market. There are a few minor problems I personally have with the cooker, but none of the issues affects the main function of the cooker. The cord really needs a little loop on the back to wrap it around. Also, the instructions are good, but confusing at times. Often the book says to go to a different page, then that page again says to go to another page... So lots of flipping around.On the positive side, the machine is very solid. The inner receptacle is very study metal, and a lot heavier than our Aroma brand (our little cheap ish cooker). Also, the measurements for rice and water are on the inside receptacle. The cooker has a lot of functions and can be complicated to use, but I'm happier with the numerous functions sacrificing ease rather than the opposite.Bottom line though: I've never had better, fluffier rice from the cheaper cookers. I highly, highly recommend this product for anyone coming rice or other starches on a regular basis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLTAZPOJ79OHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLSIINU#wasThisHelpful","RLTAZPOJ79OHQ","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: this is a review for the novel - I think Amazon is lumping both the manga and novel reviews to the same page)SAO Progressive 1 had a couple of short stories / novellas about the first and second floor of Aincrad.  This volume is a bit different since it contains one longer story focused on the events of floor 3. I won't reveal too much since there are spoilers galore, but the story centers around Kirito and Asuna (of course) and a mysterious NPC elf who seems to be more than just any regular NPC.  Their journey takes them through the massive forests of the 3rd floor and they meet and interact with the other 40 odd front line players who are starting to organize into guilds.  Kirito and Asuna have tough decisions to make, decisions which will impact their relationship and their future in the world of Aincrad and the game of death.Though I enjoyed having a couple of stories in SAO Progressive 1, I really did like the single story format of this light novel.  The reader really gets to know the secondary characters, so things have much more dramatic impact when some 'events' transpire.  Overall I highly recommend this for fans of SAO - even more than the manga versions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU82959UZADZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316342173#wasThisHelpful","RJU82959UZADZ","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting and fun game for players of various skill levels.  Each play through takes 30 - 45 minutes depending on the number of players.  It plays decently well with two players, but really shines with three or four people.+ Good quality components+ Easy learning curve+ Fun theme+ Enjoyable for players at various skill levels+ Good two player variant- Repetitive- Leather dice cup (it smells a bit)So a minor quibble: The game does get repetitive.  Though you are expanding your meeples, acquiring resources, and gaining points; each turn has a similar theme: take something or do something from one of several options.  This can get repetitive, but it is also nice for those who are not very good with complex Euro style games.  Having fewer options makes it easier for those folks to stay competitive versus experts.  Also, a little common sense strategy goes a long way.  I've been beaten by first time players mainly because they've used common sense to determine the best courses of action, thereby robbing me of my next action!Though the game can get repetitive after a dozen or so plays, it is a bit fresher when introducing new players.  There is always a little bit of variation depending on what resources you are after.  Basically you acquire workers (via the love hut as I call it!), acquire resources, use resources, gain assets (huts, etc) and gain victory points.It is a classic worker placement style game with a fun prehistoric theme.  We typically have a lot of fun by making caveman noises and such.  Because it's fairly straightforward, this is a game with good opportunity to socialize - you aren't going to lose the game completely by making one or two bad decisions.Overall I highly recommend this for entry level to mid level players who want a fun, easy to learn game with lots of socializing opportunity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR3G7JK8HNAHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF4G7OW#wasThisHelpful","RR3G7JK8HNAHA","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wil Wheaton called this the most 'Zen' game he's played... and I would say artistically yes - but it can get pretty cutthroat - especially in the 3 player games.  In this game, players travel the ancient Tokaido road from Kyoto to Edo (or the other direction in variant games).  Players will take in the sights and scenery, purchase goods, eat a variety of food, meet diverse people, stop and work at farms, and donate to temples.  The player with the most victory points, usually the player with the most variety of acquisitions, is the winner.  Here is the summary:+ Gorgeous artwork.  Did I say gorgeous?  I meant GORGEOUS.+ 2 - 5 players and fun with any number (though 3 is the sweet spot)+ Lots of variety of play based on your selected character+ Unique movement style where player in last spot goes next+ Some quality components (board, meeples, coins, character cards)- Steep initial learning curve- pretty unhelpful instructions- The cards are very small and hard to shuffleThe game has a STEEP initial learning curve - and the instructions do little to help.  Instead search for 'Tokaido how to play' on Youtube for some instructional videos (I have no affiliation with any of them, but 'Watch it Played' had a very helpful tutorial).  I won't get into the rules or gameplay in too much detail because it would probably serve to confuse readers more than anything.  Also, the cards are small, so you should probably shuffle them by swirling them about on the table rather than trying to shuffle normally (I tried and promptly bent several cards...)So the game. Basically (as mentioned above) you attempt to collect various items and gain points for most things instantly.  Donating coins to temples, completing panoramas, collecting a variety of merchandise, and meeting people all give points.  Many things cost money, and coin is hard to come by, so balancing is key.  You want to make sure you have some money each time you visit an inn, because food gives 6 points - but only if you have enough coins to buy your meal.Overall the replay value is moderate - having ten different characters to choose from adds a lot of replay value - but you often keep trying for the same goals.  There is a bit of cutthroat gameplay - mainly you can land on spaces you feel other players are trying for.  So if you have someone trying to gain the end game bonus for hot springs, you can try and hit more hot springs than them - especially if they are zooming ahead, giving you one or more turns to catch up.Despite a few minor quibbles, this is a terrific game and a must have for any fan of Euro board games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RV3UVTP16T7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADNLT8G#wasThisHelpful","R2RV3UVTP16T7J","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kingdom Builder has won many awards, but looking online, I noticed a lot of 'meh' reviews.  Still, we picked up a set when it was $35 during the board game Gold Box deals day.  I am happy to say that we absolutely love this game.  We'll give you a quick overview then discuss the reasons for the pros and cons of this game designed by Donald X. Vaccarino of Dominion fame.+ Amazing design and lovely art+ High quality components+ Variety of goals to accomplish+ Several map boards can be interchanged+ Very fun with high replay+ Scoring at end of game rather than as game flows- Less freedom of placement- Less head to head gameplayNow let's explain:  In Kingdom Builder (KB from here out), the goal is to settle the map and gain gold (victory points).  Players assemble a map from four of the eight included map boards.  Each quadrant has a castle or two and a location or two.  They also contain grassland, canyons, desert, forests, flower fields, mountains and water.The players will then draw three cards from the mission or goal cards.  These cards tell the players what they must accomplish in order to gain gold (VPs).  These tasks will be completed and added up at the end.  Some tasks include having the most settlements in a quadrant or having a lot of settlements on one horizontal line, or gold for settlements next to water tiles or mountain tiles: there are ten in total and three are used each game.Players will draw one card from the terrain cards.  This card tells players where they must play settlements.  Each player MUST play three settlements on their turn onto the depicted terrain (in a rare instance where all those terrains are full, they draw a new card - we've never encountered this though).  The real trick here is that settlements MUST be played adjacent to existing settlements - if this is possible!  So if you have settlements on forest only and draw a desert card, you will look to see if any of your forest settlements touch desert hexes.  If so, you have to play the new settlements starting with the desert hex touching the settled forest hex.  If you draw a card and there are no settlements in or touching that terrain type, you can play anywhere.There are two interesting things that happen when you eventually settle next to a castle or location.  If you put a settlement next to a castle, you score 3 gold at the end of the game (don't score immediately, because you CAN get a location tile to move settlements).  If you place a settlement next to a location tile, you gain the extra move associated with that location and collect one of the two tiles on that location.  You can only gain these once per city / location no matter how many settlements touch either.  It is possible to gain two different location tiles if you settle next to two different locations and they have a tile remaining - but you cannot take two from the same.These location tiles offer additional, optional moves, such as placing an additional settlement on any grass hex, placing adjacent if possible and so on.  These are optional moves and do not have to be completed.  Also, they can be done before settling your three mandatory settlements - but you must reveal your terrain card first (since several optional moves have terrain specifics depending on your card).  Once you have taken mandatory and optional moves, you end your turn by drawing a terrain card and keeping it secret.  This way you can look over and plan your next moves while the other players are placing their settlements.  If the terrain draw stack is depleted, reshuffle (this is common and we found usually we shuffle once per game).The game ends when a player places their last settlements and all other players have taken one more turn afterwards.  Therefore it is possible to end the game with a lot of settlements unplayed - though this is not a good thing!  Score is tallied by adding gold acquired for each goal.  The cards specify how much (you might get one gold for every two settlements..., or one gold for each settlement..., and so on).  Then you add 3 gold for each castle a player has at least one settlement next to (so even four players can gain gold for one castle if they each have a settlement touching it).The game is fun with any number of the players from 2 - 4.  Granted, it gets a bit more confrontational with more players since players will be vying for more limited space.  With two players, it is a more peaceful game and typically players will be going for the goals in separate parts of the map.  We found that there isn't really any best number of players since it plays differently with each number of players.The complaints I hear are that the game limits your options: and it does to a certain extent.  Often you are forced to settle in one specific area due to the 'adjacent' rule.  But then there is strategy where you might avoid placing settlements touching another terrain type, so that you can move anywhere on the map (when the adjacent rule doesn't apply, you can place settlements on any terrain matching the drawn card).  Also there is a lot of strategy once you have the location tiles.  I found often that if I had one that allowed me to play something not using the adjacent rule, I could do that before playing my mandatory actions and therefore open up a new area for settlement.  In terms of Euro games, it is a medium to light game though since your moves are restricted.  Though this also helps to level the playing field somewhat for those who are not too accustomed to these types of games.I've found the game is a lot of fun.  There is a lot of variety, especially since you can mix up the maps and each map section having different location tiles with different optional moves to acquire.  Also, having three unique missions to compete for in each game keeps things fresh.I highly, highly recommend it for both those new to Euro games and those with a moderate level of skill in Euro games (or advanced players wanting a game with a level playing field for all skill levels).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4JSC7QKMACT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005COHOM6#wasThisHelpful","R4JSC7QKMACT","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use Avery labels for most of my shipping needs - typically the half sheet labels.  The large labels are almost too large for shipping, but they are great for other uses.  You can use the Avery template online, or just print from Word or a similar word processing software.The other thing I figured out: If you are printing shipping labels - from Amazon for example - you can print two labels on one sheet and then just cut the sheet in half after printing.  Tougher to do if you are only printing one half sheet label at a time!Good quality and the adhesive is very good, not gummy, just very secure.

"I've only ever watched tutorials and reviews for the original Agricola, owing to the fact that my girlfriend and I typically play two player Euro board games.  It was with utter joy and delight that we discovered the two player variant of this game.  As I understand it, this is a MUCH simpler and MUCH faster version of the game - though it is NOT an easy or shallow game.  There are no crops to manage - no families to feed either.  Instead the focus is on livestock.  Also, there isn't much random chance: most everything is determined by your personal strategy alone and your selections.In this game, players compete for victory points which are earned by raising the most livestock and building the most valuable buildings.  You make decisions each turn to: collect building materials, collect livestock, expand your farm boards, build structures (stalls, stables, food troughs, buildings), lay out fences to create animal pens, move livestock, and pick up goods.  The game lasts exactly 8 rounds - when the yellow borders in the general supply are exhausted the game ends.There are a lot of decisions to make, and different strategies.  There are ways of 'cheating' your opponent but collecting items on the board before they can, since some of the items are not added unless an item exists in the space already (like the space with 1 reed having a sheep added during the refill phase if there is already a reed in the space).The rules are very well explained in the manual - and there are tons of online help tutorials - as well as terrific customer service from Z Man games.We highly recommend this game to fans of good two player Euro board games.

"This is a fairly easy game to get into and learn, but one that rewards strategy.  I picked up a copy of this game at Guardian Games in Portland based on an employee recommendation for an outstanding two player Euro style game.  We were not disappointed.The premise is simple: collect and cook mushrooms and gain points to win.  Each type of mushroom yields different points, but they have to be collected in amounts of at least 3 before being 'cooked'.  If you have more mushrooms of the same type and either butter or cider, you can cook them to yield more points.  You always need a pan to cook mushrooms, so this makes it interesting as well.The instructions are fairly straightforward.  The real strategy involves determining whether to wait for higher numbers of mushrooms (using baskets to increase your maximum hand size) or playing mushrooms right away.  You also have to watch out for devouring angels, which can hurt a lot if you pick one up from the decay stack.  You can also grab the moon cards which allow you to draw from the night deck (more points).  Instead of drawing a card or cooking mushrooms, you can sell mushrooms (at least 2 like type) for foraging sticks which allow you to pick up cards further up the tableau.A few pointers: I've found that sometimes grabbing a really good decay pile early on - even with a devouring angel - can be rewarding (if you have the hand limit for it).  You can't pick up the decay if it puts you over the hand limit - note this rule when picking up a decay with a devouring angel since that reduces your hand size immediately!  Also, watch for the number of certain mushrooms going into the discard or being cooked by another player - you might be trying to collect porcinis for example, only to realize that the two in your hand are the last two!Also, pay attention to the pans.  I have had some really great hands near the end of the game only to find I missed out on collecting that last pan.  Nothing really burns as much as having three Morels and not having a pan to cook them!  (18 points down the drain!)My girlfriend and I play mostly two player games and this is one of our new favorites.  We also recommend the following with good two player variations:Rivals for CatanLord of the Rings The ConfrontationSmallworldSamuraiCarcassonne (we like the Android app - MUCH easier scoring!)Ticket to RideAgricola Creatures Big and SmallAnd I'm sure there are others - comment if you have any other recommendations: we have at least 30 Euro board games, but we're also interested in others!

"Do you want a burr grinder?Do you want an inexpensive yet functional model?Do you need the grinder to be portable and require no plug in?If you answered yes to these three questions then this is an ideal burr grinder for your needs.  The Tanors grinder is designed in Germany.  Customer service goes through the American importing company.While there are several manual grinders in this price range (Hario makes an excellent model), this fits the bill and I have had no issues yet.  It takes about three or four minutes to grind enough beans for a large single serving.  You can adjust the grind size manually so you can have coarse (French Press) or fine (Aeropress).  It does an excellent job, but I recommend buying a more expensive electric burr grinder if you make a lot of coffee and do not need portability.I will say that this is great for camping trips!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GO0G12FJYG5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R1GO0G12FJYG5P","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed the stories contained in this wine documentary.  I especially enjoyed the information about Carlisle and Brooks, two wineries I regularly purchase.  I've been to Brooks Winery down the road from me and it is a terrific winery with a sad but determined history.The only real problem I noted was the editing.  The narrative jumps around quite a bit and there isn't often a clear reason as to why.  I think the folks who made this documentary wanted to keep Jim Brooks' death a secret until closer to the end (for a more dramatic reveal), but this isn't a TV drama and I think that was a poor choice in setting up the timeline.I did enjoy hearing about the Virginia winery (nice to get a viewpoint from outside the main growing regions of the west coast).  I would have liked either a couple more producers, maybe something in Washington or Finger Lakes New York?I would have enjoyed it better if the story had focused on each producer in more depth at a time (less skipping around) or even just stayed with each story a little longer before jumping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LL4P9BX7MTUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6ZGN8C#wasThisHelpful","R2LL4P9BX7MTUW","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first SAO novel was intended to be a standalone novel that was submitted for a writing award program in Japan.  The novel became a huge hit and Kawahara decided to follow up with a collection of stories filling the gaps in the story.  Most of these stories were alluded to in the first novel.The Black Swordsman: this story revolves around Silica and her quest to restore life to her 'pet' dragon, Pina.Warmth of the Heart: Lisbeth the smith is tasked with making a great sword for Kirito and they join together on a quest for a rare ingot.The Girl in the Morning Dew: Kirito and Asuna discover a young girl that appears to be neither a player nor an NPC.Red-Nosed Reindeer: Set earlier than the previous three stories, Kirito joins a low level guild but keeps his identity and level secret from the group.These stories help fill in the gaps, but the newer releases of Sword Art Online Progressive (also by Kawahara) go floor by floor through the Aincrad arc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5JHMM2VLQZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316376817#wasThisHelpful","R3T5JHMM2VLQZV","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've viewed the anime, and loved the Aincrad arc.  The Alfheim arc just doesn't quite live up to the first bit in terms of the game or the real danger and tension.  Instead Kirito faces enemies with his same reckless abandon, but there isn't any real tension as a viewer since the only penalty for 'death' in the new game is respawn at the last town and an experience penalty.This novel follows the story started in volume 3.  Kirito is travelling to the World Tree to discover if Asuna is actually being held captive within this new game.  The reader has already discovered early on that this is the case of course.If you are enjoying Kirito and Leafa getting to know one another, then this will be an enjoyable conclusion.  In my opinion, their relationship takes awhile to go anywhere and then when they finall discover they are related in real life - things just get weird again.There are a few moments with very good 'action', but these moments are few and far between.  The reader spends more time hearing of the political lay of the land.  This is of mild interest since the end purpose of Kirito's journey is to save Asuna.  It actually doesn't make sense that he would take time from travelling to the World Tree to save envoys of two races in Alfheim from a third.  Though this actually makes things go more smoothly later on - it still doesn't suit Kirito and his single minded resolve to rescue Asuna.Still - it's a quick and easy read and I gave it four stars, the same as volume 3.  I am looking forward to the Death Gun arc - even though I am not a Sinon fan, the story (at least in the anime) was terrific.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIZCIZREP0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316296430#wasThisHelpful","R2OIZCIZREP0S","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The series revolves around a character who has the distasteful job delivering 'Ikigami'.  Modern society injects random citizens with a capsule that causes death at a certain date and time.  The people who have the capsule are unaware since they are randomly distributed during mandatory vaccinations.  The end result is so that citizens 'appreciate' life and live life to it's fullest.  In reality it is a form of behavioral control since 'miscreants' and social 'outcasts' are 'corrected' by being injected with a capsule immediately.  All it takes is a formal citizen complaint of non-compliance to start a brief investigation resulting in the person's death.It's a system that is completely unrealistic - but the stories contained in the manga are what really shine.  Each person is given 24 hours notice via 'Ikigami' in order to spend the last hours with family or finishing up projects, tying up loose ends, etc...  The family is then given a stipend from the government after the victim does their duty and does not descend to criminal acts in the last day.  The first story arc is a story about such an individual seeking revenge on those who bullied him in his past.The individual stories are great - but it's the art that really pulls everything together.  Mase-san using shading VERY well.  The use of contrast works very well.  The entire series has a lot of dark areas which lend to the overall mood and theme.Overall I give the series a five star rating - it has been a very interesting read.  I highly recommend checking out this great manga.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R121PDYY8PF8ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421526786#wasThisHelpful","R121PDYY8PF8ER","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are decent enough treats.  However, there is no indication of source of ingredients.  I was sent these via Amazon Vine and read the ingredients in the description - which didn't list any poultry or red meat - but when I received the box: chicken liver.  My dog is on a healthy pescatarian diet (he's never been healthier) and I don't want to introduce meats his body isn't accustomed to.  So I split these up and gave them to friends with dogs who didn't mind the meat.2/3 of the dogs enjoyed them while the other didn't fare so well (loose stool, etc...).  Hence my 3/5 rating - minus one star for the dog that didn't like them and -1 star for deceptive labeling, no source of origin of ingredients.For dog treats I typically go with Fruitables - they are pretty much safe for human consumption (though I've never tried them) and most are vegetarian.

"I wasn't expecting a perfectly made wicker storage container for $50 - but I was impressed that this is a sturdy container with a pretty heavy weight and heft.  The lid is decently heavy so it does stay down securely.  The little clasp is good, but probably wouldn't stand up to a larger curious dog.  The strap is faux leather, so the pup does not want to eat it!I use this in the downstairs bathroom and keep it open most of the time so the dog can select toys at whim.  It's great for when I have company because I can stuff the toys inside and close the lid, keeping all the chewed and frayed items out of sight.For $50 the medium size is a great purchase.

"I'm a big fan of procedural mapped RPGs (or rogue-like if you will).  I have the Super Famicom game 'Fushigi no Dungeon 2: Frai no Shiren' on my phone and play it regularly. So knowing that this game was co-produced with ChunSoft (who is mainly responsible for the Fushigi no Dungeon games), I was highly anticipating this title.  It is fun, but flawed.First off is the atrocious player AI.  First - you must use a party when delving into the dungeons - or you will die quickly - likely from lack of food before anything else.  Well, the rest of the party inexplicably splits off on their own at completely random times.  You can switch to their character and try and rally them together... but often you are controlling the character in the middle of a battle or grabbing something and notice the other character just rushing off in some random direction and that they've strayed a bit too far already.  I understand the party system... but I think they should have balanced the game for two character parties.  That way you have an additional backup person.  Most of the Mystery Dungeon titles I've enjoyed have had one or two characters.The other little complaints are rather minor.  One quibble is that you level up your characters and keep your experience.  This seems like a normal thing for an Etrian game, but it isn't a regular Mystery Dungeon theme.  Typically you have a character that completely resets if you perish losing all experience, all money, and all equipment (minus what you send to your storage).  But losing all of you experience would certainly make this game unbelievably irritating since you spend a lot of time choosing skills and organizing your character.Also, the FOEs (DOEs in this game) attack the town and can shut down establishments, making it harder for the player to accomplish tasks.  The way to prevent this is to build forts - which is another part of the game I was not crazy about...The other minor quibble is only having one save file.  So if a friend or significant other wants to play - they have to use your character and risk setting you back quite a bit if they blunder badly enough.  Two files would have been good.I played the game for a few hours and had an alright time - but not enough to rush out and buy it at $39.99.  I'll wait for it to dip to $19.99 before pulling the trigger.  In the meantime I'll enjoy the rest of the Etrian titles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15NTF9947L5G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QLWZWMW#wasThisHelpful","R15NTF9947L5G6","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This tea is inspired by the Kyoto Sakura-hana matsuri (cherry blossom festival). Traditionally the sencha brewed during the festival is flavored with the addition of rose petals and often cherry blossoms. I searched for this tea locally for a long time (having it in Houston, Texas previously) but only recently was I able to find some in Portland, Oregon (Peet's Coffee of all places!).The tea is best brewed at a temperature around 160 - 170 degrees, in order to retain the freshness of the ingredients. Average steeping is about one minute for the first steep (you don't want to oversteep sencha) and about 30 seconds to a minute for a second steep. Further steeping requires longer times and results in a harsher flavor. As always - personal preference dictates the individual preparations.The flavor is sencha style green tea at the core with a floral, slightly sweet finish (impression of sweetness - not actual sugar). I STRONGLY recommend brewing this as is - no additions of cream, honey, sugar, or milk.The one thing I can't deduce: if the green tea is authentic Japanese Sencha or if it is a Brazilian imitation sencha (which is where local company Stash Tea sources their 'sencha')... maybe somebody can shed some light on this in a comment?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RS978W7ASJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBI3UKW#wasThisHelpful","R39RS978W7ASJV","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel makes a great re-entry point for fans of the Shannara series who might have not returned to this series for awhile.  It also makes for a great starting point for new readers.  I've been a fan since the first book in the series (Sword of Shannara), but I really felt that the 'Scions of Shannara' series was the best.  I lost interest somewhat in college (not much time for recreational reading), but picked up a couple of the newer novels from Powell's and had some Vine offers, and I am pretty pleased with the newer stuff.Brooks has a great style and a good 'voice' for fantasy fiction.  His novels are the type that fans of full fantasy enjoy: diabolical villains, archetypal heroes, a pretty good line between good and evil (though it blurs sometimes!).  This isn't political fantasy (think Game of Thrones) but neither do the novels veer towards the overly mystical (gods and prophecies and such).The recent novels show a trend with some of the current fantasy authors: standalone novels set in a greater fantasy world.  This novel contains several recurring characters and also features the 'wishsong' which appears regularly in the Shannara novels - but newcomers won't be confused.  This is a great standalone fantasy novel for fans of the genre.  Read it and become hooked - then start at the beginning - but make sure to read the Scions right after 'Sword...', 'Elfstones...', 'Wishsong...'","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JPGFX7YH0P3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540794#wasThisHelpful","R2JPGFX7YH0P3E","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We love Champagne and drink it regularly.  I was excited about this documentary but it fell slightly short.  The main reason is that I felt 'A Year in Burgundy' showed a wider variety of producers and different viewpoints.  This documentary does focus heavily on Bollinger and a couple of small producers (and Gosset was thrown in almost as an after thought).  I would have liked a little more time spent on some other producers, perhaps even adding this to the special features. Speaking of: they were pretty minor - though there is an e-book of sorts about Champagne but reading on the TV is hard to do and there are four deleted scenes and a brief biography of the filmmaker.In my opinion, this is a DVD geared towards those interested in but not knowledgeable about the specifics in production and style of Champagne.  Never once was there a mention of various styles such as Brut vs Demi-sec or even what really made a 'vintage' Champagne special.  Instead we have a few winemakers talking about it and mentioning that it is special, but we don't really get a picture of non-vintage vs vintage vs Tete de Cuvee.  I was happy however to see a nice segment on the disgorging and bottling of this beverage.If I hadn't seen 'A Year in Burgundy', then this would probably rate five stars.  We did watch 'A Year in Burgundy' between watching this twice.

"The only three drawbacks I noted:  the price is a bit high, the card/ cash holder is not very discreet (could have used a little more material or something else to partially cover it - I feel like I have to be wary of setting it on a table or the bar, even if I'm nearby), and the kickstand - while ingenious in a way, is kind of a disappointment and not at all sturdy.I do recommend this for folks who are travelling light and don't want to carry a wallet or purse but want an ID and a couple of credit cards.  It is durable and it fits on the phone very well.  The texture is good for grip.I didn't lower the rating for the drawbacks because I felt they were minor.

"If you aren't trying to take this book too seriously, then you'll have a blast.  Mathew Inman (aka The Oatmeal) illustrates much of this book.  It has a lot of fun infographics and charts but it is not a reference book.

"This is a good Bluetooth headset.  The sound is very good.  But the four star rating is due to the fact that this really is just a slight redesign of the previous generation model and doesn't offer anything dramatically improved for those who already have the HBS 730.  If you already have the 730, then this version is probably not enough of an upgrade to warrant a purchase.  If you do not have a previous generation version, then this is a very good, high quality headset that is ergonomic, comfortable, and easy to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11YO74F0YQIDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2CRXKI#wasThisHelpful","R11YO74F0YQIDN","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Runs a little big, but not big enough to be considered a size up.  More than enough room to add a layer underneath without looking like a stuffed doll.There are a few little details which make this very nice and attractive.  There are two seams down the side which are placed very nicely to help keep the fitted shape and give an appealing, slim look.  Two seams down the front accomplish the same while providing reinforcing, especially when the jacket is unzipped.The entire jacket and hood is lined with a soft, durable felt except the sleeves which have a soft mesh-like liner.  It is perfect for colder days and evenings, probably recommended in the 20 to 50 F range.  It is water resistant as well.  The collar is high and the hood pulls nicely low creating a nice barrier from the elements including wind and rain.  There are two zippered outside pockets and two inside open pockets as well.Features an adjustable hood which has a 3 piece design and looks good when worn up.  The 2"" droptail hem has a drawcord to prevent rising up.  Purchased 2/4/2015 from Amazon directly with an automatic promotion for $63.

"Season 4 had some ups and downs.  Most of what bothered me was particular characters acting out of character (it happened with Tom, Granthom, Mary, and others).  This season sticks true to the characters and tones down the 'soap opera' style of storytelling from the previous season.  The only big dramatic event is the investigation into the death of Mr. Green (which gets old quickly, but it comes in spurts here and there, so it's not too disruptive).The main things we see in this season (no major spoilers) are things such as the planning and erection of a monument to the soldiers killed in the Great War, Tom's struggles with his lifestyle and views and his acceptance of his 'family' at Downton, Daisy trying to get an education (you go girl!), and Mrs. Crawly finding not one, but two interested suitors!  Mary has her usual ups and downs with the 'dating scene' but they are more entertaining in this season.  Mrs. Patmore, Carson and Mrs. Hughes all speculate on real estate investment while Molesly quiety pursues a love interest while showing he's quite the scholar (in a sense!).  Rose pursues marriage and this story dominates more of the 5th season than others.  And I for one love the 'new' Rose - much more down to earth and loyal to the family than before.I think it boils down to the writers going for what is best for the wonderful characters they created as opposed to squeezing in every little bit of history of the time that they could (such as in four).  The writing is top notch and I am happy to say this is probably my favorite season of all.  And a little something happens at the very end of this season which I have been waiting and hoping for since the very beginning!!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1FJBUUVIRT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO21WUE#wasThisHelpful","R2F1FJBUUVIRT6","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased this due to an employee recommendation at Guardian Games in Portland, Oregon.  Big hug guys for the great recommendation!!!The very first thing one should note is the designer of this game: Reiner Knizia (Ph.D in Mathematics).  He has designed such terrific games as Lost Cities, Samurai, Tigris and Euphrates, and many more.  Every game he designed which I have played combine a wonderful mix of accessibility and long term strategy.  Much like Carcassonne, the strategy in these games is not quite obvious at first, but with time, one learns that there is much more to be learned while novices can still play an expert player and present a challenge.This is a two player game.The setup time is minimal (less than 5 minutes).The game time is between 10 and 20 minutes each round.Short learning curve, lots of additional strategies to learn.The game plays out as follows: the players choose their side - Fellowship or Mordor.  Each side has strengths and weaknesses.  The Fellowship wins if Frodo enters Mordor or if no Mordor characters remain.  Mordor wins if Frodo is defeated or if three Mordor players enter the Shire.  The Fellowship character abilities focus on defeating particular Mordor characters or fleeing battle in various ways while the Mordor characters tend to rely on overwhelming strength or additional movement bonuses.Each player takes turns moving a character.  The characters are set in plastic holders so the opponent cannot see which they are until they are engaged.  When an opposing player advances into a realm held by the other player's character a battle ensues.  Unless there is an ability resulting in automatic defeat of another or retreat, combat ensues.  Each player chooses an attack card, reveals it at the same time and players modify battle based on the text or the strength number of the revealed card.  The character with the higher strength wins the battle, though there are cards which end in other results such as Noble Sacrifice which the Fellowship can play to end in defeat for both characters.  The cards are discarded after use.  Play continues until a result ends in a win for either side.What makes this game unique are the variations in character abilities, card abilities and other little factors (such as the Fellowship characters able to use the Anduin River or the Mines of Moria to bypass certain regions).  The Fellowship characters tend to have a bit better luck if they don't press the attack on the forces of Sauron, many abilities are used when defending against attackers and others have skills which defeat certain characters which makes it a bit foolhardy to randomly attack Sauron characters until you know who they are.I typically recommend playing once as each side in a sitting.  There are also a few tweaks which can be used to make the game easier or more challenging including a variant game.  You can leave your discards facing up in a row so the opponent can see which cards you no longer have, or you can discard face down relying on their memory.  Same goes for characters defeated in battle, you can leave them exposed or turn them upside down.There is a lot of strategy and cunning - very similar to chess in a way.  I won once with only two characters left, but my opponent rushed in and attacked Frodo who escaped sideways allowing a straight shot into Mordor but no opposing characters could attack him on the way to Mordor.  Other things can be interesting and fun, such as putting a Mordor character on Caradhras and watching the Fellowship player squirm wondering if it is the Balrog or a different character who doesn't auto-kill anyone passing through Moria.It is simple on the surface, quick and easy to learn, yet complex and fun to play over time.  This isn't a game that gets old quick.  Each game is a little different due to different character placements and different strategies.  I recommend this for players 12 and up, or perhaps some younger players with adult guidance.Fun: A+Learning Curve: B+Setup: A+Replay: AIf you like fun 2 player games check out Rivals for Catan, Race for the Galaxy (incredibly complex), or Samurai (by Knizia also).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ZBROMJWBIPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616614803#wasThisHelpful","R12ZBROMJWBIPV","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a curious product in many ways to me.  It seems to be a more stripped down version of the Vega One, but the actual nutritional benefits for each are very similar.  This product has fewer calories than the Vega One (110 compared to 160), but they have equal amounts of plant based protein (20g).  The Vega One shakes have 6 servings of greens while this has 2 servings.  Vega One is also non-GMO Verified, while this one claims no GMO ingredients but is not verified through the non-GMO Project.I mix them with unsweetened vanilla almond milk (Pacific Foods or 365 Brand).  Typically I use a shaker bottle.These are all very minimal gripes, but what it comes down to is the flavor and quality of the Vega One is better for the price in my humble opinion.

"This seems like a book which would cover a lot of current Japanese society, and while it does somewhat, I felt the entire book was too heavy on the current political framework of the country.  Politics are important in shaping a society, but this book really spends a bit too much time on the current model including current political parties in power and recent political moves and laws.This would be beneficial to someone really studying Japan as part of a major course of study, or someone interested in international law and politics, but for someone interested in learning a bit more about Japan and the current culture, I recommend Japan: From Samurai to Sony.

"This text covers sparkling wines from every major wine producing country in the world.  The bulk of the text does cover Champagne, and there are large sections devoted to Sekt, Cava, and Italian sparkling wine (Franciacorta, Asti, etc...).  The text has a broad overview of sparkling wine production, then each section has a preface with information pertaining to said region.  Within the regions, the text has individual producer entries.While this isn't something that one would necessarily need for passing WSET or CMS exams, it is a handy reference for broadening knowledge of the producers of sparkling wines.  Each entry also has a score indicating quality and potential.  Champagne houses seem to have the edge, which is natural, but the authors have given some good scores to producers outside the classic region, though with a lower overall average.  And while many folks may agree or disagree with the scores, it nonetheless makes for a good barometer for those navigating the thousands of producers in this book.Also of note, Champagne producers are listed with the type of establishment they operate: RM, NM, and so on.  This can help readers determine which producers grow their own grapes and which purchase grapes (though it is generally not a quality indicator).If you have someone who loves Champagne and gets really geeky about individual producers, then this is a great gift idea.  It can be quite technical, but the information is heavily researched and well laid out.  For those more interested in the drink but not the technical information, there are some books which discuss more of the history and have less technical information.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FERP35XZ5K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402772246#wasThisHelpful","R14FERP35XZ5K8","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have researched this brand and from what I can tell they are accurate in their claim that they do not use any additives or concentrates.  They do pasteurize the product when in can for up to 5 minutes at 120 Celsius.  There is also no guarantee that this is organic either.But compared to the mass market, secret scam brands Zico (Coca Cola), Vita-Coco (Anheuser Busch), Naked (Pepsi), O.N.E. (Pepsi), these guys seem to be at least open and honest about their product.  C2O at least seems to be a startup based out of Long Beach, California and they seem to be a local minded company, which is refreshing in a market being dominated by a few big brands with deep pockets.  Other brands like Goya, don't even make an effort to hide their production being from concentrate, inorganic, and with added sugar.The main dietary factors to note: 12g sugar and 50 calories per serving with 2 servings per can.Overall this is a bit sweeter than I would like, but it has a very pleasant taste.  I would recommend the high quality organic brands if you can find them, but if you cannot locate one of the better brands, C2O is better than the aforementioned brands.  I would also recommend Munkijo, Taste Nirvana, and Amy and Brian for national brands (these available Amazon and Whole Foods) and the 365 brand at Whole Foods as a good middle of the road option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7R6FR4IXG4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM9HN0#wasThisHelpful","R2F7R6FR4IXG4M","A30JPZ9TZ7I61U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JPZ9TZ7I61U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If End of Eternity 1 left you feeling hot for a sequel, then End of Eternity 2 is the answer to your prayer, although Im somewhat on the fence about how satisfying it really is. Because, as you may see, author Loretta Lost has this uncanny ability to craft a story that keeps you wanting for morethis second book will only want you to crave for Book 3and I mean that in the best way.In this instalment, Carmen takes the path of self-discovery, vis--vis discovering things about her husband and his motives and reasons for leaving the world so tragically. Carmens emotional unravelling is not easy to behold, especially with the twists and turns the author tosses in her path. But like a trainwreck, you cannot turn your eyes from heryou will want to walk beside Carmen as she wends her way around the minefield that is her husbands past, and how it haunts her present and puts storm clouds over her future.A sequel that must not be missed, End of Eternity 2 is one of those books that will deeply emotionally resonate with you, regardless of what kind of relationship youre in now.

"This latest instalment in the I, Human series is definitely a significant step up in the tension. Having read and savoured the previous book, I am very familiar with the characters and the sense of sinister danger that simmers just underneath their interactions.In the Malevolence of Evil, there is a nagging sense of suspicionfrom Scrollos the homo superior to the darkness that seems to overcoat the universeor at least, that part of the universe that the Veda explores. Because Scrollos presence is utterly suspicious, the Captain and the crew, despite their grudging tolerance for Scrollos presence, must try to work things out despite their fear of betrayal (is Scrollos a Trojan horse sent by homo superiors?). Moreover, aside from this political intrigue and the Damoclean Sword that seems to hang above the heads of Captain Magnusson and the crew, author Vito Veii even manages to slip in an intriguing sub-plot: the ship Vedas computers have growing feelings for the Captain.There is a lot of expansive exploration that any hardcore science fiction fan will love. What I like about the authors writing stylewhich others seem to disparageis his narratives preference for the slow burnthere are many areas in this and the previous book that palpably remind you of those moments in Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey when nothing seems to be happening and the only sound you hear is the breathing of the desperate astronauts who are trying to fix the ship. In this book, the minimalism (like a space-age version of Hemingways) can often be misunderstood, but it hits the right spot for those who actually understand it.Overall, an awesome sequel to what is perhaps destined to be a science fiction classic. I, Human: the Malevolence of Evil must be read slowly to appreciate the full spectrum of its literary power. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z100RCEEGM38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF8H0M0#wasThisHelpful","R1Z100RCEEGM38","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whenever I read a JC Ryan book, I keep thinking about the visualshow would this scene or so look in HD or even 3D. Sure, the budget would run to a hundred million dollars, but from the 10th Cycle to The Skywalkers, it would be all worth it.Having said that, the release of JC Ryans latest book, The Skywalkers, was met with a great amount of anticipation. I was not disappointed, because right at the get go, the mere mention of the Prophet got my juices flowingits not long before I lost track of time reading and stopping my heart from lurching for the sake of the Rossler Foundations team. Theres quite an intense amount of fun and the integrated verisimilitude made even the books most astounding technology feel as real as the smartphone youre holding.Moreover, the Skywalkers ending presents a cliffhanger that leaves your jaws dropped on the floor, and it could either be good or bad: it would be GOOD if the next JC Ryan book that follows this is released as soon as possible, like TODAY; bad if the sequel takes several months to arrive and the excitement created by The Skywalkers ending dissipates and deteriorates into frustration. Im not a huge fan of cliffhangers, but I dont really dislike them, either: its one of those literary devices than can add more fun in the whole reading experience.  But in the long runin the future when readers could buy a boxed set of JC Ryans Rossler Foundation books, which might include The Skywalkers and its immediate sequelthen the said ending wouldnt bother us and would even feel like just the right ingredient stirred into the pot at the exact crucial moment.The Skywalkers is an enjoyable bookit continues the Rossler Foundations uncanny ability to invite us to wonder about those mysterious unanswered questions and could-have-beens, but it also never loses its action-y and edge-of-your-seat thrill. Theres never a boring moment reading thisit took me a day to finish the book, and that was because I tried prolonging the reading experience by dwelling in certain chapterssuch as the implications mentioned in Chapter 6and when I finally finished reading, it took me a few moments to ponder the fact that Im facing what may be a few months before the next JC Ryan book. But then again, I could just reread the previous books to relive the experience.

"A treasure trove of intellectual and philosophical musings, Yuehai Xiaos Crossing the Seas: a Diary of my Thoughts is perhaps one of the most uplifting books Ive read. Yuehai has a knack for making sense of even the most unfathomable concepts, and he fleshes it out in the simplest ways. The result is a book that will blow your mind away.Crossing the Seas may be unconventional in the sense that it is epistolary in formatthe chapters written as diary entries that span years, starting sometime in 2010. The format, of course, does the book wellit makes the book much easier to read, with Yuehais morsels of wisdom much easier to imbibe on. Yuehais vigorous intellect shines through every pagereading the book is like listening to a wise old man, and you emerge from reading it as if warm rain has gently washed over your soul.Overall, I love Yuehais Crossing the Seas to shreds. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take an intellectual shortcutfrom confusion to complete understandingregarding so many of the things that matter in our lives.

"No matter who or what you are, if youre trying to get the dating scene in LA, Dylan Thrashers book is the best guide there is. Its a brutally honest fleshing out of LAs culture, encompassing its economic and social aspects to zero in on what it takes to find a partner worth keeping and standing by with. But more importantly, the book goes to great lengths in defining its boundarieswhat exactly do you mean when you talk about Los Angeles, and is everything you know about LA truth or myth?Make no mistake, Thrashers discussion of the kinds of people looking for love and everything else in LA is spot-on, if not uncannily, refreshingly poignant. There were quiet moments when I felt bad for all the people who were doing all the wrong things in their desperation to find the right thing. There were moments when Id scratch my head or chuckle or laugh or nod in assent. There were moments when I realized there are passages in this book Id be quoting to friends long in the foreseeable future.Dating in Los Angeles is something you must read even if youre not actively looking for someone. Its an astounding eye-opener, written by someone who comes from both sides of the table. But before you end up despairing over the hopelessness of finding someone real in the vast fakeness of a Hollywood-overshadowed LA, you can take comfort and assurance from Thrashers learned discussion of everythings thats wrong about the whole gameso that the next time you meet someone, you can make better informed decisions. And hopefully less mistakes. A book worth keeping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBC6UL745Z1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VCHR6H0#wasThisHelpful","R3MBC6UL745Z1M","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its incredibly amazing how author Loretta Lost has written the Clarity trilogy. Its rare to find an author who writes something that is both beautiful and still leaves you feeling drainedas though for the few hours youre reading her book, youre uncannily in the shoes of Helen Winters, saddled by emotional trauma and her physical disabilities, unable to live a normal life.Clarity 2 immediately follows in the hot wake of the previous bookif youre like me who read it and couldnt move on from the cleverly crafted cliffhanger, then reading Clarity 2 is like finding an oasis in the middle of the desert. I was that thirsty. And hungry. And aching. And I consumed Clarity 2 with such fervour, Im still reeling from it.Make no mistakethis is both an easy and hard read. Easy because its essentially a love story blossoming amid difficultif not impossiblecircumstances, and who would not find inspiration in that? Hard because, as Ive said, its not easy to watch Helen recoil from every disappointment, quiver from her fear (real or imagined) of reconnecting with another person, even if its as honest as Liam.Clarity 2 did not disappoint. If youve read the first book, this continuation of Helens story will make the afternoon disappear.

"This book is shaking the business world to its very core, and for good reason: it exposes the real dynamics within corporate and even governmental leadership, and shows us why despite monumental failures, nobody was severely punished in the financial disasters that have been unleashed in the world in the past decades or so. If youre like me who have been grumbling about the blessings that are being given to those who are perceived to be less talented or skilful, then read this book and finally get it. And once you understand how it all works, you can proceed to the next step: take advantage of what you learn.I absolutely love how Vandell used a semi-fictional approach in fleshing out the theory with the use of characters (Charles, Dave and Bill). I have met a lot of Dave, Charles and Bill in my life that I found myself nodding in assent as I read the book. This is one of the hallmarks of Vandells workit is never highfaluting, always striving to make everything as plain and simple, yet it never fails to astonish. Even the simple headline how to create your unfair advantage made me do a double-takethese are business principles turned on their heads, and they make sense.This book is an absolute must-readfrom students, to bankers, to managers, to rank-and-file employees. If you want to see how the world is really run, understand the principles that are used by people to create (or simulate) value and indispensability, this is the book for you. Theres no going around it. Get it now. I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZL5STF67F0V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBRHU4W#wasThisHelpful","R1ZL5STF67F0V3","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its hard to read My Oil of Joy for your Mourning without occasionally stopping to savor the emotion or to let some of the tears to run down. Author Traci Wooden-Carlisle is amazing at fleshing out these highly emotional moments without departing believability. She is, as she demonstrated in My Beauty for your Ashes, a master in the art of emotional build-up.I could deeply relate with the character Mason the mostlike him, I lost a loved one, and his death changed the trajectory of my life and set me out on a path I never thought Id take. But that is only one aspect of what is very likeable about this novel. The lives of the four main characters interconnect and intersect in such a way that shows you the terrifying complexity and beauty of life and relationships, especially in the context of living with God.A perfect gift for loved ones and friends, My Oil of Joy for your Mourning can be life-changing for the right person.

"My head is still spinningThe Britannia Contagion messed up with my brain like no other book canand I mean that in the most positive sense. If theres anything I love most, its historical fiction. But Peter C. Middletons sequel to the much-beloved The Britannia Conspiracy is much more than a simple historical fictionits historical fiction on steroids.Having read Middletons The Britannia Conspiracy, I expected a lot from the sequeland Im delighted to report that I was not disappointed. And morethe language in this second book is much surer, as though the author has found a comfort level with his literary power and gleefully wields it to full satisfaction. The result is a book that will keep you speechless throughout reading itI know, because my mouth was practically hanging open during the hours reading it.I love the juxtaposition of the 1664 era with the present daythe strategy fleshed out the stark differences between the two timelines, yet it also shows you that the human condition remains essentially the samethat life and love and terror strike us in equal measure, regardless of the existence of modern trappings and what-not.If you love the kind of suspense that will literally keep you on the edge of your seat, then get a copy of this book. The Britannia Contagion is a keeper. I highly recommend it to the most discriminating reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UGVJ43R442LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE3PJ0K#wasThisHelpful","R1UGVJ43R442LS","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive never read a book as jarring yet so seductive as Loretta Losts End of Eternity. Seriously, try reading even the first few pageswhere Carmen Winters comes home to the gruesome sight of her husband hanging from the chandelierand see if you cant be helplessly drawn in, Especially with the authors powerful sense of juxtaposition: for example, the dead body of her beautiful husband vis--vis the crystals of the chandelier, beauty and madness, structure and insanity placed side-by-side together is just touch.Worse, Carmen is actually pregnant, which only adds to her fears: if her husband suffered from mental problems, would her child also be afflicted with the same mental illnesses? In that context does author Loretta Lost deftly sinews the story, which proves to be a rich ground for complexity when men like Brad or Owen pops up in Carmens life.Whats more, End of Eternity is only the first book of what we learn is a four-part series, so theres more where this story comes from. Highly recommended to fans of contemporary romance, End of Eternity is a deeply entertaining read that will leave you craving for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4OW8WHBHP4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6UJOWY#wasThisHelpful","R3L4OW8WHBHP4U","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a long-time fan of Pat Hatts books for children, I am always on the look-out for any new book coming from the author. Needless to say, Theres a Goat on my Boat is a must-haveit has that distinctive Pat Hatt humor that kids and their parents will get.Hatts words have that melodic quality about themit feels like some tongue-in-cheek teasing, but you cant dismiss it because the whole cadence carries meaning. Whats more, the book ends with a delightful surprise, a little lesson on friendship and social harmony that youll love to impart to young readers.The illustrations in Theres a Goat on my Boat are note-worthy, tooI loved the facial expression and the way the illustrator captured the emotion of the main charactereven the little goat drew chuckles and giggles from the kids.Overall, another great addition to your Pat Hatt collectionand a little suggestion: order the paperback version if you can, you will love lending it to as many young readers as possible.

"Months ago, I had the pleasure to read Mike Kilroys Nine Mealsan intriguing, breath-taking post-apocalyptic yarn that practically grabs you by the throat. Thats why when I found his latest book, Solo, on my book reviewing plate, my expectations are through the roof. And Im happy to report that I was not disappointed.Now a Kindle best-seller, Nine Mealsin hindsightset the stage for readers expectations of what the author can wreak. Solo is more or less in that same threadalthough this one ups the ante even further. In Solo, author Kilroy does what he does bestthrow us into a cesspool of intrigue by deftly selecting what he wants to show, one chapter at a time, until were practically dying to know more. The main characters memory and sense of self is almost non-existentthe few things Solo remembers either buries him deeper in the pit of despair or leaves him more confused. For Solo, life is divided into two places: the Before and the After, with countless snippets of memories and pseudo-memories to add to the muck that is his mind. What aggravates his condition is Tom, his supposed best friend, whose intentions are shadowy and add only to the sense of overall mystery and mischief.Solo reminds me strongly of Christopher Nolans old film, Mementobut only in a certain sense. Kilroys book does not disappointlike always, the author offers something much more beyond the surface thrill as Solo leads us to ask deeper questions about the human condition, what makes us human, and at what point we can be considered inhuman. This book is a highly recommended mind-trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XM80AMVHWIKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RE7K0X4#wasThisHelpful","R1XM80AMVHWIKL","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a long-time fan of this mysterious author named Holy Ghost WriterI have bought and read a good number of his books in the past, mostly around the theme of the Sultan of Monte Cristo. This book, however, is admittedly different and intriguingly creative: who would have thought about writing an actual ghost story featuring no less than the late great King of Pop himself, then succeeding in making it an enjoyable read?The Afterlife of Michael Jackson is not only for the true hardcore Michael Jackson fanespecially those who have been missing himbut this is also for anyone who likes to read something that enthralls them for a change. The books premise is a million-dollar what-if: What if Michael continues as a spirit in this world, what would he do? The possibilities, although initially might seem endless, are deftly narrowed down by author HGW into a few plausible and entertaining threads. Whats surprising about this story is the stark juxtaposition between Jacksons life and Jacksons supposed after-life: when he was alive, Michael was almost always in the middle of some nasty controversyhe was rarely beyond the glitz and glamour and, ultimately, shallowness of his stardombut now, as a spirit, his mission is to help people find their own miracle.Needless to say, this is a heartwarming and deeply touching book. The Afterlife of Michael Jackson is that kind of book you will love giving out to friends who also love the later pop star. And the great thing about it is we gather that theres a full-length novel the author is currently completinggood news for those of us who liked this book and would love to read more.

"Having just finished reading Derek Swannsons latest literary offering, let me just toss this out there: if youre looking for an incredibly absorbing page-turner to read during the holidays, then get a copy of The Snowden Avalanche. And Im pretty confident that anyoneregardless of age or genderwill simply love this book.The Snowden Avalanche could not be more relevant in our day and agein the wake of the real-life leak of what the NSA has been doing, the issue was just begging to be dramatized and written. And a topic such as this could not be better handled than by a seasoned author like Swannson. In the novel, the author crafts a devilishly absorbing tale, an extrapolation of sorts, of the possible what-ifswhich is much more chilling when you realize the what-ifs are not entirely implausiblethis could be happening right now, as I write this.In the novel, Sabina has one job: to manage the public reputations of the rich and powerful in the wake of the NSA leaks, whose unsavoury secrets (apparently, the richer you are, the uglier your secrets become) have been unceremoniously spilled out into the open. Anyone who has a good sense of understanding Maslows hierarchy of needs will understand how desperately the disgraced rich will want to bring things back to normala fact that the likes of Sabina exploit to such grace and panache that it makes her very wealthy. That is, until she meets that one job that could wring her through the proper meat grinder: billionaire and walking enigma Wes Bramley. But before you toot the horns and declare this is just another formulaic romance, consider this: Wes and Sabina are not gallery cut-outs, but cleverly and intricately rendered characters whose interactionsfrom discussing philosophy to their intellectual and sexual parleyswill make your jaw drop to the floor. And thats only for starters.Moreover, what has struck me deeply and has shaken my to the core of my being (the last time I felt like this was when I first read Alvin Tofflers Future Shock many years ago) is how Swannsons novel made one thing very clear: how even something as privacy could be commoditized, and at such a high price at that, which makes it accessible only to the moneyed few.Now, I have read author Swannsons previous Crash Gordon books and Ive gotten used to the authors distinct way of spinning a good, irresistible yarn, but The Snowden Avalanche represents him upping his ante, so to speak. This is one book that will entertain you from start to finishand its a recommendation I dont give out lightly.

"Author Brian Barton knows what works in the romance departmenthe can sweep you off your feet even in the first few pages. Hes no stranger to formulahe knows very well how to take it to its most effective fulfilmentyet hes adventurous and audacious enough to pierce through the ceiling of convention. And the result is a deeply engrossing bookBrooklyn Girl Dont Cuddlethat you will love reading on the bus, on the subway, at some beach. You will talk about this book to friends and strangersand heres why.Brooklyn Girls Dont Cuddle is set in New York, a place where finding the right one can be more difficult than sifting through a haystack for that proverbial needle. Nevertheless, youll find music journalist Buzz Vreelander hoping for that very thing. Like Elton John signing in I Want Love, Buzzs desire and longings catapult him to a trajectory that allows him to touch lives and discover a deeper part of himself he didnt know existed. I love how author Brian Barton has created believable characterthese are actual people, you mutter to yourself as you read along, and these are very real problems. I love the comic relief offered by Deke, which counterpoints to a satisfying level Buzzs intentions for the impossible-to-have Radha. Or so it seemsyoull have to read through the chapters to find out. But let me spill out the beans a little more: the twist in the end is surprising, yet deeply emotionally satisfying, like a warm embrace.I dont know, but Brian Barton feels like the male version of Sophie Kinsella, or if Sophie and Nick Hornby (of the Juliet, Naked frame of mind) made love, Barton would be the offspring who guns for filling in the middle genre of this wide gappy expanse we take for granted as romance fiction. Bartons book is a laidback, easy-to-read, and oh-so-satisfying ride on a rollercoaster thats set to run on cruise mode. Let me suffice it to say that Brooklyn Girls Dont Cuddle is a deeply entertaining bookit pushes your buttons in all the right places, at the right time, leaves you hanging for more, then gives you what you want in the endand youre left sitting there feeling good and wondering what just hit you.Theres only one thing Id love to see more: a sequel. Buzz Vreelander is a likeable fellow whose romantic sensibilities emotionally resonate not only with those people living in New York, but everywhere. Brian Barton has written another classic hereI give it five stars. And, I believe, so will you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJ62T2AIXH0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9J38CO#wasThisHelpful","R1NJ62T2AIXH0L","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"JC Ryans new book, The Sword of Cyrus, is as deeply riveting as his previous three thrillersalthough having read (devoured is perhaps the better term) the authors previous books, I get the strong sense that the Rossler Foundation Series just keeps getting better and better. And here I speak as someone who does not make unnecessary high praise lightly. JC Ryans latest book is astonishingly well-crafted, the layers of meaning cleverly interwoven and meticulously built up so that by the time youre reading the last few chapters, it all feels as satisfying as a desperate embrace.In The Sword of Cyrus, author JC Ryan quite cleverly stabs a finger into the open wound of the old tension between the US and Iran. However, Ryan ups the anteand in quite a breath-taking literary fashion at thatby making the threat real and palpableespecially when you have a determined villain who takes his cues from Biblical prophecies. Especially when you have a villain who is in possession of the worlds most powerful, hitherto unimagined weapon: a bomb so small and portable yet so powerful that it can level multiple cities and annihilate countless millions. The target? The American heartland. Now, it is up to the men and women of the Rossler Foundation to counter the threat. If they fail, the consequence is unimaginable.It is worth noting that, like any other good book, the plot of The Sword of Cyrus is driven by an emotional gravity that anyone can relate with. Sure, Dalir Jahandar maybe someone you can easily hate or fear, given the current world events and the rampaging onslaught of a group like the ISIS. But dalir is also coming from a place of incredible loss, and his thirst for revengewhich makes him blind to everything else and sets his path on fireis utterly believable. On the other hand, the Rosslers are awesome, yet vulnerable in certain aspects. And it is this vulnerability that makes Ryans books such a joy to follow and inhabitthese novels literally leave you clutching the edge of your seat.This is the fourth book in the acclaimed Rossler Foundation Series. And these are full-length novels, not one of those novellas others keep on churning for the sake of a quick buck. The qualityand the delicious lengthof Ryans books always make any book he releases such an enjoyable literary treat. And yes, although this is the fourth book in the series, it can stand on its ownyou get a good sense of what the Rossler Foundation is, anyway, and what its agents do. But then again, as a highly recommended modus, I suggest you pick up a copy of the previous books (The Tenth Cycle, Ninth Cycle Antarctica and Genetic Bullets). In any case, youll meet familiar characters (the Rosslers, of course), and a few new intriguing additions that add a deeper dimension to the story.Most importantly, I have said this before and Im saying it again: JC Ryan is a literary alchemist: he has the knack for crafting a blend of archaeological facts and scientific knowledge and transforming them into literary gold. There is not a page wasted in The Sword of Cyrusevery moment as tight and gripping as the next one. Read even the first few pages of The Sword of Cyrus and youll see what I mean.Get a copy. Techno-thriller fans who actually love well-written suspense books that will take you on an unforgettable rideyou will love this book.

"Theres something about M.K. Theodoratus novel that grabs you at the get-go and compels you to read through, no matter what. Crossings is a tale that hits you where it matters most: the heart. Its a tale that reminds us all that redemption can come from even the unlikeliest of circumstances.At the heart of the story is Ebe Brown, whose burning desire to achieve self-respectsomething he had lost long ago for committing an unforgivable mistakeis beset not only by extraordinary challenges, but also by even the most mundane truths.  For instance, the town where he lives, Crossings, set in a fantasy world called Andor, seems devoted to resisting change. But everything that the locals of Crossings value is thrown in disarray when a group of dog farmers set up their business, sowing disquiet with their disruptive way of life and business, not to mention their dogs. Even at the get-go, Ebe suspects Rabler, the dog farmers main trainer, is hiding something sinisterespecially when questionable events begin happening around town. Worse, despite growing evidence that the dog farmers are up to something bad, the local enforcers could not or would not touch themfor some reason, theyd rather turn a blind eye than heed the complaints of the townsfolk.It is in this scenario that someone like Ebeelderly, unassuming, and not the type youd think to rise to the occasionactually rises to the occasion. But when his initially feeble attemptby asking the help of the herb woman Nanceends up really badly for Nance (despite her powers), Ebe finds himself compelled to throw all that he has on the line just to right this incredible wrong. And there, let me suffice it to say, is the rub: how and why Ebe does what he does in the story, with the help of the towns array of characters, will drop your jaws.Delicately crafted and written by an author who certainly has an uncanny knack for prosody and verisimilitude, Crossings is an entertaining read . if youre looking forward to a weekend curled up in a corner reading a good book, choose this one.

"Whenever I look at a dog, I dont see an animalI see a gentle soul just looking for love and affection and their little place in this cruel world. I have half a dozen dogs, and I know. Thats why Irvin Cannons book, For the Love of Dog Tales hit me where it matters mostat the center of my heart.I found Cannons book right after I finished reading Garth Steins The Art of Racing in the Rain, and I was in that frame of mind in which I need to read more books about dogs, written by a skilful author who has the uncanny ability to get under their skin. And if youre like me who read and loved Steins book, then perhaps its fair to say that you will love For the Love of Dog Tales even bettereven at the risk of comparing apples to oranges, Id still say Cannon has that rare power to make you cryand I mean that in the most positive senseas Cannon weaves each of these stories like they were a giant hand that sweeps you away and throws you into your emotional depths.Its not easy to review a book like this because the emotions get in the way, but let me point out a few important aspects. One, author Cannon has successfully captured the essence of being a dogyou almost see and feel each individual, from Brisk to Robbie, their personalities distinct, their respective issues fleshed out carefully, meticulously, and with more than enough emotional gravitas to leave you teary-eyed. Brisks story, for instance, is enough to compel or move you to keep reading and is simply the perfect opener for the bookit is a tragic-heroic tale that dropped my jaws and helped me recall the many times I observed a similar behaviour in my own dogs. But thats just for startersthis is a full-length book, not a hastily written thing you commonly find these days, and youll soon discover that each of the story will touch your heart in its own wayfrom German Shepherd Helenas story of struggle amid a male-dominated world to Robbie the mutts story of love and compassion.Overall, For the Love of Dog Tales is a book that is simply unforgettable and unputdownable for its depth and scope and the uncanny way the author has given our canine loved ones their voice. If you love dogs, or if you know anyone who loves dogs, read this book or send this as a gifttruly an astonishing literary treat. One caveat: if you easily get teary-eyed, better read this somewhere private.

"Marc Sechhias Aranya is a rare fantasy treat. If youre like me who constantly scoured the virtual bookshelves of Amazon just to find that one great book that will haunt me for daysand they come so far and few betweenthen you understand why Im completely bawled over by a book like this. Fantasy fans will sink their teeth in March Secchias bookand I mean that in the most possible way. If you end up wildly recommending this book to like-minded friends after reading it, then dont say I didnt warn you.Even the first few pages are starkly beautiful and hauntingthere is something so profound about the opening scene, for example, where Aranya watches the oncoming onslaught of Dragonshipsdirigibles from another kingdom whose ruler has one goal in life: to be the boss of everyone else. Aranyas worldthe Kingdom of Immadia, for startersis so sinuously woven, so culturally authentic (its like these people actually exist!) that the suspension of disbelief happens so smoothlygive the first ten pages a chance to drop your jaws, and they will.Secchias writing bears the mark of a seasoned wordsmithhis phraseology, his prosody has none of the occasional awkward turns or the face-palm-inducing verbosity that plague so many other books by new authors. In fact, you feel like youre reading, say, the work of the offspring of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (if such a hypothetical copulation could make sense)only this ones actually better. Let me suffice it to say that Secchia has created in Aranya a bracingly sturdy character, amid an intriguing gallery of fantastic beings and incredibly nefarious villains.Aranya should be winning a literary award somewhereor optioned by Hollywood. And thank God this is only the first book in a seriesif the next one comes out, I will buy it in a heartbeat. Get a copysee the first few sample chapters and see what Im talking about.

"Great fantasy novels are difficult to write because even if youre writing about events or characters that never happened or existed, there is still the readers demand for believability and verisimilitude. But Michael Diack, with his Shadows in the Sand, has fulfilled those demands in a flourish: this is a book you will devour and whose sequel(s) you will watch out for. Heres why.Shadows in the Sand is a post-apocalyptic tale about the remnants of mankind who manage to thrive and survive after a devastating cataclysm. And like how human beings lived in the past, this small, vulnerable community of survivors in a city called Nimar live near a water pool, on which they depend on for their meagre nourishment. But the water pool happens to be drying upin a few weeks, the water would be gone. Desperate, the humans send out search or exploration parties everywhere to find an alternative water source, despite their fear that there might not be any. This post-apocalyptic situation sounds familiarbut in Shadows in the Sand, the humans have allies and foes that come from the fantasy genre: elves, trolls, giant insects, mermen and mysterious immortal beings called the Ovites. And if the water problem isnt enough, the humans also face a formidable problem: the murderous onslaught of the Sanghouls, beings whose main mission in life is inflict death. Fortunately for the humans, theyre not alone: an elf prince offers alliance and military helpand a chance to survive the Sanghouls: using the long lost seven stones of light as weapon. Theres only one little problem: as Ive said, the stones have been lost a long time ago, and nobody knows where they are.And thats only for startersas you may realize, this is an epic fantasy tale that shall span multiple books, as indicated by its sheer scope. But if this Book 1 is any indication, then the entire series is set to become a well-loved classic. Author Michael Diack has a way with words that compels you to keep on turning the pages and drops your jaws when you least expect it. He paints a rich, vivid, and evocative backstory that supports the tales present, giving us more than enough emotional gravitas to feel with the main characters.Overall, an exceptional fantasy tale that will delight both fans and nonfans of the genre. Get a copyor send as a gift to like-minded friends. You will love every page of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OR250LVO649Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5DNPY6#wasThisHelpful","R2OR250LVO649Q","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mendy Hopkins Utopian Hell is provocative, gritty, and deeply entertainingthe author succeeds well in crafting an unforgettable tale around a scourge that even now remains without a clear cure: AIDS. But make no mistake: this book exquisitely written, and will keep you turning the pages for more. Here are the reasons why.As you know, people regarded AIDS in the 1980s as a disease of gay persons, what with the many high-profile deaths of gay celebrities. Nine years ago I saw Tony Kushners Angels in America and that was when I realized the scope and depth of the social implications arising from the disease, striking at the heartland of an otherwise vibrant gay lifestyle. But this book, Utopian Hell, gives the other side of the story: young women contracting the disease at such an inexplicable rate that its only a matter of time until someone clever figures it out.In this picture enters the sultry female detective Sandy Sommers, whose mission is to find out whether there is credence behind the allegation that some shadowy figure is infecting young women. Normally competent and laser-focused, Sandy somewhat struggles between maintain her lovelife with fianc Brad and finding the truthand as you read and as the story ascends toward its gripping conclusion, you cant help but ask the same questions Sandy is asking: can she solve the case without putting her love and her life on the line?Utopian Hell is a deeply satisfying read, a romance that excites us on many levels. It slakes our thirst for mystery, and also for romanceauthor Mendy Hopkins kills these many birds with one stone, so to speak. A must-read, this book will stay with you days after reading it.

"I have read some of Paul Huhns past works, but Ive gotta say The Book of Meaning is the one that struck a deep cord within me. Ever since I encountered Albert Camus works 20 years ago, Ive read and combed through all his works, even the derivative discussions of them. And for a simple reason: Camus was the first writer who struck me in the head with some fascinating, yet uncomfortable, truths about human existence.I have perhaps fleshed out the myth of Sisyphus in half a dozen of my early poems. But Camus aside, Paul Huhns uncanny knack for seamlessly putting these thoughts about meaning from some of my favourite thinkersfrom Camus to Viktor Frankland transform them into a solid, life-changing discussion of where meaning arises is what makes this book a must-read.But most importantly, Paul brings down these otherwise complex philosophies to a level the layman will not only understand, but also deeply feel. In not so many words or pages, the author manages to drive home a powerful discussion of what meaning is in human life, where do we derive it, and how it propels us not only to keep on living, but to live with happiness, contentment, and purpose.A truly groundbreaking work. Seriously, get a copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18DZMVRO7LHMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXN5F5E#wasThisHelpful","R18DZMVRO7LHMR","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those who, like me, have read Patrick Hatt's previous books in the series pretty much expects more of the same excitement and thrill. In `A Not so Barren World', just when you think the story could get more interesting, the author exceeds your expectations and drops your jaws--indeed, this new book offers more of the awesome things you've grown to love in the series.It's Jack and Emily again, and this time, they're out on a new adventure, which mainly rests on their one single goal: to return home. But like in previous books, ""returning home"" is unthinkably so difficult--if seizing the right opportunity to get into Earth's time fraction is hard enough, then the different monsters, political intrigues, the plottings and machinations of various villains thrown into Jack's way make the effort more hellacious--but fun to read! The fascinating thing about this series is how the author deftly manages to shift in between worlds and realities, between science fiction, myths, and fantasy. If you've enjoyed reading how Jack and Emily dodge projectiles from errant knights, dragons, gods and what-have-you, then probably it's fair to say they are meeting the ultimate villain this time: no other than Lucifer himself.So far, the story has built up beautifully for this final confrontation: a battle with the Lord of Hell himself. How Jack and Emily manages to do it depends on the various friends they have earned along the way--because at this point in the tale, there are many--and how they will use all their wit and cunning and the sincerest desire to return home for their son just to defeat the ultimate enemy.Overall, `A Not So barren World' is a gripping tale that readers of all ages will enjoy. It's not only for kids--I'm in my thirties and, heck, I enjoyed this since the first book. As I said in the previous books: get a copy! Or better, read the sample chapters and see what I speak of! Another five-star home-run for author Patrick Hatt for this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22J3VP39A9R5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WWZ5RM#wasThisHelpful","R22J3VP39A9R5J","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before Tony Hustons The big Wig, the last time I laughed so hard in reading a novel was when I first encountered Helen Fieldings Bridget Jones Diary in the late 1990s. So in many respects, Hustons hilarious novel about an overweight guy who only wants the same things we all wantlove, and the ability to eat donuts without gaining more poundsmakes his hero, the endearing Wiggy Higgins, the patron saint of the rest of us. And here Im wondering why hasnt anyone made a movie version of this already?The Big Wig is a literary achievement in many respects. Written with wit and charm, the novel s hero comes off as being utterly real and completely endearing. You root for him because who hasnt struggled with their weight and career dissatisfaction at one point in their lives? Who hasnt hated their boss? You root for Wiggy because who hasnt walked the extra mile just for the love of their life? Wiggy Higginsand here its also important to mention the whole cast of characters that revolve around Wiggy, each of whom is a marvel of character developmentthe big Wig here, is a character who stays with you even long after youve read the book.Let me suffice it to say that I LOVE this book to shredsand Im sure you will, too, if you love a good, funny, and incredibly entertaining book.

"If you think famous people have it easy, then youve got another think coming. Valery Satterwhites Winning the Fame Game is mind blowing not only in how it provides proactive, highly effective ways of handling and managing fame and success, but also in how it provides us a stark glimpse behind the curtain of celebrity.Winning the Fame Game is not a book to be trifled with--Valery knows what she speaks ofapparently, her years of counselling celebrities and other high-profile achievers have given her a unique perspective on how it actually works in the real world, and what one can do. This is close to my heart because I have known a lot of celebrities who eventually succumbed to the pressures of fame. But while others fail in handling their success, there are also others who seem to sail by and actually luxuriate in itand apparently, Valerys book spills the secret.Moreover, what I love most about the book is the simple fact that it focuses not on surviving celebrity, but on thriving in itthereby turning what may be a huge constant problem from some into opportunities where you can further grow and develop and stay true to yourself.Overall, this book is a highly accessible (entertaining, even!), enlightening read about the perils of celebrityand how to effectively manage them. The thing is, these days, with the pervasiveness of social media, you dont have to be a celebrity to ever need Valerys bookanyone can suddenly have their fifteen minutes of fame, and some of the luckier (or perhaps more unfortunate) ones can have their fame (or infamy, depending on which side of the fence youre on) last longer than how theyd like it. It should be read not only by celebrities, but anyone who is interested in the deeply intriguing phenomenon of modern famewhich is my way of saying you must get a copyor send this as a gift to friends. Im sure theyll be quite thrilled to read this, as I have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ORM3525KU74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTKIBN4#wasThisHelpful","R30ORM3525KU74","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monty McClaines book for children, Touch Screen Ted, is one of the most interesting, entertaining books in its genre ever to come out in the past several months. I have often bought books for children, and read them myself, so I know when I encounter something of a keepera book that pushes all the right buttons and even inspires kids to ask intelligent questions. And Touch Screen Ted is that rarity.Touch Screen Ted is about Ted, a construction worker, who one morning on his way to work encounters an astonishing thing: shooting stars. The said shooting stars turn out to be a mysterious rectangular object which modern readers recognize as a touch-screen tablet. But in the context of this story, the said tablet is a Neurocyte, an extra-terrestrial device that has strayed from where it is supposed to be. Ted, unable to figure out the artefact, merely calls it Shinyand from then on treats it as if it were his best friend. And its only the beginningmuch of the storys emotional gravitas, its heart, is unravelled after Shiny arrives. Let me suffice it to say that author Monty McClaine has written something very clever here, crafting a story that engages readers of all ages, while staying true to the books target audience.The authors life-long background in the IT industry obviously informs the storyit reads like a mix of cyberpunk-fantasy-science fiction, resulting in a tale that is as enjoyable to read as it is fascinating. Perhaps it is safe to say that this is only the beginning of Touch Screen Teds adventures, so if the author can maintain or even exceed the excitement in writing the sequels,  I believe we have a series of childrens books worth waiting for. Highly recommended to children aged from 9 to 11 years, Touch Screen Ted deserves a place on that shelf in the family library. Five stars for this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E77R99UBBSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099290000X#wasThisHelpful","R25E77R99UBBSL","A9G85AO0S9UTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9G85AO0S9UTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A. King Bradleys unforgettable book, Savior is that book Ive been wanting to find and readsomething like Stephen Kings Carrie but in reverse, or at least, a book where the main character actually manages to turn his life aroundsuper-awesomely, at that.Savior is about Adam Reaper, a victim of constant bullying that hes barely getting by. But once he discovers he has incredible powers just lying dormant within him, the table is quickly turned. And like most superpowers, what Adam has is double-edgedsometimes, its so powerful he barely could control its desire for destruction and revenge. But fortunately, Adam can still control it, as the Beatles song goes, with a little help from his friends. But still, nothing is cut and driedI love how author Bradley fleshes out the moral dilemma concerning how Adam uses his powers and how he struggles in choosing what is right over giving in to his powers yearning for revengeand all hell sort of breaks loose when Adams brother is murdered. And thats only for starters.The strange thing about Savior and me finding it deeply engaging is the simple fact that I used to not like these booksI couldnt suspend my disbelief enough to actually buy the plot of a teenaged superhero. But author Bradley has that uncanny knack for human drama, for verisimilitude, thereby succeeding to write something fantastic that feels deeply, utterly truthfulAdam Reaper is an unforgettable character you will root for and deeply care about. You will keep on turning the pages just to find out what happens to him and if he succeeds in what he sets out to do.Let me suffice it to say that I love Savior to shreds that Ill buy the next book in the series in a heartbeat. Get a copyor send this as a gift to like-minded friends. If the author keeps up the excitement, or even ups it, then I cant wait for the rest of the books in this series.

"Daria Kacies The Calling made my hair stand on ends and actually freaked me outand the last time I felt like this was when watching Insidious or The Conjuring. Which is my way of saying I love this book to shredsand heres why.The Calling wastes no timeit throws you right into the thick of things, with Karens inexplicable experience with knocking on doors and faucets opening on their own.  But thats only for starters, as its a story about a womans path to investigating paranormal phenomena. Lizzy Sterling, because of a good deed, transcends from being a bystander to the paranormal to one who actively has a say in how it unfolds. And even before you hit the middle part of the book, the full meaning of the books titlethe callinghits you majestically, as main character Lizzy Sterling starts acknowledging her destinyto interact with spirits enough to actually help them bridge the gap.I love how author Daria Kacie has meticulously and compellingly sinewed this paranormal mystery tale with more than enough verisimilitude to make it as believable as the person sitting next to you. You feel the terror of the unknown deep in your bones; you also feel that immense relief when understanding finally dawns, as it did with Lizzy and her group.Overall, I love this book and highly recommend it not only to fans of the genre, but also to those who just love a deeply entertaining tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This is the book you take to the beach or on the trainit will absorb you and will not let go. Get a copy.

"I bought this Kindle book in July of 2012. My first job was in a bakery many moons ago and all my cakes are done from scratch. I am a retired gent and still enjoy baking my own goodies and eating/sharing them. I decided to review the book today because I am doing the Banana Cake. Kroger had a ton of ripe bananas yesterday.I have tried all the recipes in this book but one, the Zucchini cake (just not for me). I must say, the recipes are pretty good. The Orange Cake is my favorite but it took me three times to 'get it right.' If you are comfortable baking, these recipes can be easily adapted to your preferences.If I had one itty bitty complaint, it would be that I wished the author would have listed the ingredients by weight. Also, if you have a convection oven, you should note that these recipes should be adjusted for convection. The times and temps appear to be for a standard oven.I also like to use a lot more vanilla.

"I like this show and I want to like this show but it is confusing.The shows is done half anf half. Half the shows appear to be from the beginning and the other half appears to start at the end. That means you are watching two different time periods at once. For me, this caused a lot of confusion for the first several episodes.I like the characters but I cannot tell several of the women apart. Yes, I know there is a set of twins. However, because it wasn't clear the show was being presented from two time-points, I spent many episodes thinking there more than one set of twins or women that looked very much alike. Also, one woman (Shelby, the blonde) looks different enough at the beginning and end that you think it is a different woman when it isn't (she appears to age 20 years but it's just a short period of time). Sound confusing? Yep.I see a lot of other reviews discussing plausibility. Well, that is fairly accurate but this pretty much describes most TV today.

"I use these with a Sparco marker board to practice cartoons.The tips are great for writing or drawing and don't flatten after a bit of use. The marker lines are neat and crisp.

"I paint, sketch and try to do cartoons. There is a lot of difference in pencil/pen sketching cartoons and using markers.I was wasting a lot of paper and marker ink with paper. The marker board saves on both and it is easy to just erase and start all over.This board is a great size, large enough for several figures but small enough I can hold it easily with one hand or in my lap.So far, the best thing about the board is that it wipes clean, I mean really clean, like brand new clean. None of that blackish gray haze. I also like that the trim around the board seems to be fairly sturdy. I bought one at Walmart and the trim loosened within a few days. As a precaution, I put some Gorilla glue in a few places to help strengthen the trim.I am deducting one star for the marker holder. It just sucks. I put a small rubber band around the outside part and it holds my marker really well now. However, I have to wiggle and push the marker into the holder.The back is just cardboard. The trim and marker holder are white plastic. The marker holder snaps on and off so it can be removed. There is sticky tape in the box but I don't use it.

So, that means it had my attention.This movie is about bringing someone (and a dog) back from death and the creepy things that follow.It is well acted, with a decent script/storyline, which makes it a bit better than most in this category. It is also well filmed with special effects that are not overdone nor underdone. Well, in this genre, there is no baseline but the lead actress bordered on over doing it.What makes this movie worth watching? The fact that it isn't bad.Is it worth renting?

"I observed this powder being used in a hospital setting on a palliative care patient's left small toe by family members. The toe was gangrenous and staff expected the lower portion of the limb would need to be amputated. Oddly enough, even though the toe fell off on its own, the foot got better and no intervention was needed.I ordered some but never really used it. It has been sitting in my bathroom for almost since April of 2012. I recently got a really bad spider bite. The bite kept looking worse despite medical intervention. It was getting a little more edematous and uglier looking each day. The itching was almost unbearable. Yesterday, there were small blisters and a new spot forming adjacent to the original spot. I decided to use the powder, mixed with white vinegar on it.The itching stopped almost immediately after the clay was placed over the site. I used a lot, very thick. In the middle, I could see where the clay was pulling fluid from my arm. I removed the old clay and put a fresh batch over the site. I was shocked when I removed the first portion. The redness and swelling had considerably decreased. Four hours later, I removed the second application and the site looked even better. There was little drainage noted with the second application.The itching, the horrible, horrible itching has stopped. The site doesn't look anywhere near as ugly. It's still pink and slightly raised but nothing like eight hours ago.Removing the clay did open the small blistered areas (I knew it would).

"This movie was just aired on TV because Disney is promoting a spin-off animated series for the Disney Channel. From the feel and appearance of the movie, this was originally meant for TV, not theaters. It is not a top-notch Disney release.This movie is predictable but fun. It is a teen movie with a few adults in a high school setting. Violence is minimal but the theme is 'good vs evil.' The main kids are the 'evil' kids because their parents are evil.There is a lot of music and singing almost to the point of being too much. The music is kinda soft Disney stuff except for the stadium number (which is the best).I am a 51 year-old man and enjoyed the movie. It was fun and sends a good overall message. Three stars from me is a good rating for this type of movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJZQUA74L0KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013767FJC#wasThisHelpful","R3NJZQUA74L0KQ","ADWSD45P3NZGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWSD45P3NZGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is 60 pages on my Kindle Paperwhite. Although it is somewhat short, the information is well presented and covers many areas. It helped me with issues which were causing my cartoons to look awkward. I do not feel the book was too short. It was just right.The info is geared toward drawing basic cartoons, not caricatures. There are areas about defining the faces and elements to make them more specific to people, gender, age, etc. The images are like the ones on the front cover of the book. There are lots of examples on one page with little tips and notes mingled between. There are no huge sections of text. The author gives lots of image variations on each topic.The author seems to cover just about everything from gender, faces, hands, clothes, objects, positioning of elements in relation to sex and gender ... and a whole lot more. There are also sections about inanimate objects.Except for the front cover, this book is all black and white. I can see and read everything well on both my Paperwhite and my Kindle Cloud Read. The Cloud Reader on my Chromebook allows me to see the images a bit bigger but the Paperwhite's smaller screen is still easy to view (for me). On my Paperwhite, I only had one image per screen (unlike another reviewer that had two). On my Cloud Reader, I had two images per screen. (one image is like the pic I am posting).My pages turned very quickly with all the graphics and I had no lag at all.There really are a lot of helpful tips in this book and the price is right ... only $2.99. I feel I got a much more than my money's worth.Unless Amazon removes it, I am including one screen shot from a single page on the Cloud Reader so you can get an idea of what the pages look like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJNQKJZS1X8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J088OS#wasThisHelpful","RNJNQKJZS1X8O","ADWSD45P3NZGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWSD45P3NZGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I have tested these, and others, I found there is almost no consistency in amount nor distance. Every brand  seems to have issues.However, this model definitely has more spray strength. It goes much further than the tiny models.This is a bigger bottle than the keychain models. My jeans are very loose and the bottle isn't too obvious when I am walking but if I sit down, it is very obvious.

"I needed a bedside basket for more than remote controls. However, I do put most of my remotes in here.If the remote is very tall and heavy, the basket can tip if it isn't balanced well. I have six remotes (TV, cable, two projectors, two Rokus) and they all fit.Nice construction, stable and can hold a lot of stuff. However, it is small (pic is a bit deceiving). Note the size: Measures 7.5"" x 5.5"" deep x 7.5"" high at the handle. It also has a wire frame which is a plus.When you get the basket, take it outside and shake it/beat it a little to get the dust fiber bunnies free or your chair/couch/bed will be covered. A good vacuuming will also help. After the initial bunnies are eradicated, new ones don't appear too much.If you need a big basket for a lot of stuff, this is NOT a basket for you.

"Yukio's video was very helpful in my decision to purchase this carrier. Locally, nice carriers had an outrageous price. A similar looking model at PetSmart was $95.The only part the video does not show is an actual pet in the carrier. I have a large cat and the size was a concern. Turns out, the size is perfect. In this type of carrier, I want ample size but enough constraint my cat isn't moving around a lot. Lexi can turn-around and reposition herself with ease but she can stand fully and walk (for that, I would use a crate).I have had this almost a year and it has held-up well. I can remove the fleece bottom and toss it is the washer or use a towel instead. A few times I have found the fleece parts in her mouth. It has many access points and plenty of viewing options for both the cat and owner. I can reach inside and hand her a treat without opening the carrier. My cat will drink from a bottle so that helps also.I have found the cat hiding inside, sound asleep, more than once. She likes it.All zippers and handles are well secured. Very sturdy. The carry strap can double as a leash (has a clip on both ends).Happy with purchase, I would buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH0FEJLXJLKE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015AFZZ4#wasThisHelpful","RH0FEJLXJLKE5","ADWSD45P3NZGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWSD45P3NZGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far, the last 5 can openers have all had issues. Either they fall apart or they don't want to open the can.This opener seems sturdy and initiates a cut well but leaves that last bit of top that I must dig out and twist off. I had this same issue with the last opener. No matter what, that last little part just won't cut all the way through.It is easy to clean with a small bottle brush. The bottle opener is a nice plus. It is easy to grip. After a month, no rusted parts but I take good care of my utensils.ETA on 8/26: Where the edges met as the opener was finalizing the cut, I noticed that the initial cut was closer to the edge than the cut nearing it at the end. So, I am tilting the opener on the initial cut away from the can and it almost cutting the lid completely off now. Hope that helps anyone else having this issue.ETA: Although it was cutting much better, I continued to mess with it, using needle nosed pliers, a bastard file and a small rock hammer. I got the two edges much closer then sharpened the blades a little. It is cutting perfectly now. I can cut any lid and it comes off every time, the first time. No twisting.

"This is the best thing to happen to Oreo's in a long time. They are perfect now.For store-bought cookies, Oreos are my favorite. It is hard to beat Oreos and milk but I was always taking them apart to remove most of the middle and making a big mess. No more! Now, there's just the right amount of filling and the wafers are perfectly matched. They seem extra crispy and even tastier.The Original Oreo package is 14.3 ounces, the Thins are 10.1 ounces. However, the Thins have 40 cookies compared to 36 cookies in a normal Original package.Amazon is not providing the nutritional info found on the back of the package. Info found on the back of Original Oreos is for three Oreos but the Thins list the info for 4 Oreos. So, I used Calorie King to adjust the info 'cookie for cookie,' based upon three cookies. Divide by three to get info per single cookie.Original Oreos: (Info for 3 cookies using package info)Calories 160. Calories from fat 60.Fat 7 grams. Saturated fat 2 grams.Total Carbs 25 grams with 14 grams from sugar.Protein 1 gramSodium 135mgOreo Thins: (info for 3 cookies)Calories 106. Calories from fat 41.Fat grams 4.5. Saturated fat 1.5.Total Carbs 15.9 with 9.1 grams from sugar.Protein 0.8 grams.Sodium 72mg.For those of you that like to use Oreos for crusts and toppings, the Thins work in the food processor much better. I don't even need to remove the middle part to avoid clumping. The decreased middle provides just enough cohesion and taste to make them great for recipes.My Walmart has the 10.1 ounce package for $2.98, Walgreens is $3.99 (just bought another bag).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SXB4EZ8C2DZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M7AG62#wasThisHelpful","R2SXB4EZ8C2DZ5","ADWSD45P3NZGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWSD45P3NZGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bryan Cranston and company have turned this series into one of the best TV has to offer. It is intriguing, compelling and at times, quite shocking. Breaking Bad has mesmerized audiences by giving us a glimpse of what a man is willing to do when he feels he has little left to lose in life. Taking the final steps in the right direction, the producers of this show have hit the ""nail on the head"" with the theme of ""The Transformation Of Walt To Heisenberg."" We have been able to watch Walter White change before our very eyes into one of TVs most captivating characters and we want to see how it's all gonna end.5 stars all the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R288MJ9WOCOC3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012QRPU4#wasThisHelpful","R288MJ9WOCOC3B","ADWSD45P3NZGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWSD45P3NZGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My sister ordered these, and other flavors, for a kids' party and party favors. We ordered a variety of cream flavors and an extra package of the orange creamsicle.The wrappers were melted into the suckers and the kids ended up tossing them in the trash. We were afraid the kids were going to aspirate the cellophane/plastic wrappers. After the party were able to take the remaining suckers and run them under hot water and remove the wrapper, little by little, bit by bit and it took a very long time. Even then, we adults were still finding bits of plastic.Even when the plastic isn't melted into the lollipops, the wrapper is very difficult to remove. Forget about keeping the wrapper to keep the sucker clean.The 1.1 ounce lollipops are too big for most kids. I find them a bit too large for me (grown man) so I get the 0.38 ounce lollipops in the regular/cream variety bags from Walmart.Once the wrappers were off the lollipops, they tasted great. They always do.

"This movie was much better than I expected. It was also much different than I expected. This is a psychological thriller set in the future, on a distant mining outpost with a few Earth scenes.There isn't much spookiness. No big aliens attacking people. No big special effects. However, in my opinion, the writing and acting are well enough to keep you watching, and guessing, til the end.There are plenty of F-bombs. No nudity, no sexual content. Fist fights, guns and knives are the extent of the violence.

"This is a documentary type movie. It seems to be done it parts with occasional narration. It is highly overacted by everyone but I think it is suppose to be that way because it's a 'spoof' type movie. I have no idea if there is a plot, I don't know the characters' names.The film quality, audio, sets and makeup are fine. Most of the costumes are good but some are just silly (not a funny silly).I just finished the movie and I never cracked a smile. I have no idea how it won so many awards. I found parts interesting enough to finish the movie they weren't funny, just oddly interesting.I don't recall any cursing. The nudity scenes had blurring.So why did I give it 3 stars. Because I am a fair person. It's my fault I only relied upon a few reviews and I did not find another trailer before renting so it gets 3 stars.

"I was anxious to watch the new series with David Tennant but it was difficult for me to get through the first episode. I tried watching it several times over several months and finally got through it yesterday. After that, it was a marathon.It takes the eight episodes of season one to solve one murder. They take their time and it is not rushed. However, a lot of season one is not as well done as I had hoped. Tennant overacts his character to the point it is very unrealistic. His partner's actions and words are also unrealistic. Many things happen throughout this series that are just too much of a stretch to believe. It's both the major events and the little things of everyday life ... how people treat each other, their reactions, simple conversations. This makes it impossible to get 'lost' in the series because you start thinking about the acting and writing too many times in each episode. Although it was a mildly interesting 'whodunit' first season, and worth watching for free on Netflix, this is far under par in both writing and acting.One example is a main character stumbling through the police station with a heart condition, falling against a wall and barely remaining conscious while people just stand and stare. In real life, people would be rushing to this person's side and trying to help.Another example, the actions and evidence associated with the father and sister of the victim would never be handled in such a manner by police. It is a joke. Cash, cocaine and whopping lies? The police never press nor fully investigate these things?Another example is the poor hygiene by Tennant throughout the entire season. You wonder, ""Does he ever shower or shave?"" No boss would ever tolerate such.The reason I don't cite the MAJOR unbelievable things is because they are spoilers. At the end, you will realize this murder should have been solved by the second episode.3 stars is being highly, highly generous to David Tennant. Watch for free on Netflix.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EY4YU84L7CPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EE3FVSU#wasThisHelpful","R2EY4YU84L7CPD","ADWSD45P3NZGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWSD45P3NZGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I so wanted this to work. I wanted to listen to some gifted audible books while driving.Setup was super easy. Turn your radio to a non-used station, insert the plug into the DC receptacle, the 3.5mm (1/8) jack into your device , use the < and > buttons (only two buttons on the device) to go to the same station and start the sound on your device.I tried multiple, multiple stations (pretty much every station). The sound was so low and the quality was so poor, I could barely hear it. I adjust my phone settings, my radio settings, everything I could think to do. With my radio on full volume, I tried other devices, thinking it might be my Samsung Galaxy phone. I was in my Jeep Wrangler, so I tried my Dodge Ram and the same issue.A total disappointment.

"I'm a huge fan of geek history, and I previously read Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, so I was excited when this was published. I really loved this book, with its sweeping, thoughtful history of the whole digital age. I knew a lot of the overall story before I read this, but this book put things in perspective and provided a more comprehensive context than I've ever had before for my understanding of the way the digital age has evolved.Walter Isaacson has an amazing ability to craft highly enjoyable, easy-to-read prose to tell stories that most other authors would struggle to make readable. This is a history book that was as hard to put down as a decent fiction novel.

"This screen cleaning kit was terrible. The cloth is a tiny square of microfiber barely large enough to clean a phone screen, but my main problem with this is the fluid. The bottle comes with a tiny amount of fluid, and promises to leave no streaks. However, this fluid leaves streaks on everything, and requires cleaning with a different fluid and a larger cloth.

"I really like this case, but I'm still kind of missing the book-cover form factor of the Amazon case that I used to have on my Paperwhite. The origami stand is nice, but it can be cumbersome to use. The magnetic attachment to the Kindle is amazing, and makes removing my Kindle from the case a breeze, although it feels so light and delicate in my hand without the case that I rarely remove it.This case has a similar high quality leather feel to the previous case, and may be even a bit better. It's got substantial weight and feels protective, and I love how awakens my Kindle and puts it to sleep upon opening and closing the cover.The only other thing that's a little bit cumbersome is the power button, which is now located on the back. The button on the back of the case is right over the top of where the button is on the back of the Kindle, and it works well  but if I leave the Kindle with the cover folded flat on the back, or in origami stand mode, long enough for it to auto-shutoff, I have to pull the cover away in order to access the power button. This is not a big deal, but it's a slight annoyance that did not exist when the power button was on the bottom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16KHASEH8T5YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZVG02E#wasThisHelpful","R16KHASEH8T5YY","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This faucet elevates the user interface of my reverse osmosis water system to a whole new level. It's unfortunate that APEC doesn't include a faucet like this by default; the default faucet is of severely poor quality, which tarnishes the perceived value of an otherwise wonderful filtration system. It has a flimsy feel and a plastic on/off lever that feels like it might snap at any moment.But this faucet, for the reasonable price of about $50, completes the package and lends a truly deluxe look and feel to the whole system. The ceramic disc also makes it easy to control the flow. If I want just a drop of water, I can get it by turning the handle just slightly. If you've invested in the APEC RO system this faucet is designed for, it's well worth another $50 to add the faucet that the whole system really ought to come with in the first place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20EF1GU205I9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZ0Y538#wasThisHelpful","R20EF1GU205I9R","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've really liked all the Booq products I've ever purchased. This sleeve is no exception. It's a quality-made item, and has a high-end look and feel. The only misgiving I have about it is that it's not very form-fitting. My Macbook Pro Retina does not fill it up. There's not a ton of extra room, but I was expecting a more streamlined fit.Also, I recommend that if you get this sleeve, be mindful when opening it with your computer inside. The zipper opens all the way around, so the sleeve can sit flat, which is a cool feature  but it also makes it easy to drop the computer if you unzip it too far. I dropped my computer at the airport, and fortunately I caught it before it made a solid impact and no damage was sustained.

"I'd never read The Shining before, so before I read Doctor Sleep, I plowed through The Shining, and my experience of these books back-to-back was amazing. The plot consistency between the two books is incredible, especially considering that The Shining was published in 1977 and Doctor Sleep in 2013. I'm more enamored with King's fantasy/sci-fi flavored works such as The Dark Tower series, and Doctor Sleep seems to be more of that quality than The Shining, which is straight-up horror. There's more light and deeper character development in Doctor Sleep, which sets a nice counter balance to the sheer terror and overwhelming darkness of The Shining. King's maturity as an author shows through.I recommend this book to anyone who likes Stephen King's work, but especially to anyone who prefers the more fantasy-leaning stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M4XL1I8PD8WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6CCF0K#wasThisHelpful","R2M4XL1I8PD8WO","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of the Kubrick film for years, but I've always been told it was a completely different experience from the book. I'm not a hardcore Stephen King fan, but I have really enjoyed quite a few of his works. I absolutely love the entire Dark Tower series, and I also have enjoyed a few others such as Talisman, It, and 11/2/63. Now, as a result of finally reading The Shining then its sequel, I'm likely to dive into a bit of a Stephen King binge.The Shining is an incredible novel, and I like it all the more since it was written in the 1970s. It is truly a completely different story from that told in Kubrick's film, but I don't want to issue any spoilers so I'm not going to talk about how.

"I bought this to replace my 5-year-old Sonicare Series 2 toothbrush, which was still serviceable but could no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days. This new one is so much better!This model runs more quietly, it's lighter and thinner, it's compatible with a larger selection of toothbrush heads that are better designed and use less landfill-filling plastic. My old model used the screw-on type of heads.This model also has a battery indicator light, a sleek, well-crafted charger base, and a compact carrying case.The lithium-ion battery holds a charge for a very long time, and is part of why this model costs so much and is so light, slim and quiet. As long as this toothbrush lasts anywhere near as long as my old one did, I'm happy to have paid the premium price for everything this model has to offer.The carrying case is made of molded plastic, and I imagine that after a bit of use it will probably fall apart, but they can be bought on Amazon for around $10, so I'm not worried about that. The toothbrush's several modes are useless to me; I just use it to brush my teeth, at full speed with the quad-timer. But for that it works great.I've read reviews by people complaining that some Sonicare models force them to cycle through all the useless modes when turning off the device. That does not happen with this model. The switch turns it on, then turns it off, simply. The different modes are selected using a separate switch. This model also does not shut off automatically after the 2 minutes, which I appreciate because sometimes I want to brush for a little bit longer.One word of caution about the product listing: The product description says this model comes with a charger AND a travel charger. This is not exactly accurate. The travel charger is a minimalist little charger that fits inside of a larger plastic base, which otherwise is hollow. The ""non-travel"" charger is just the travel charger with an extra plastic covering that has a larger surface with pegs to store a couple of extra toothbrush heads and a space to wind the cord.If you're sharing this with someone and expect to have two complete chargers, you'll be disappointed. When you take the travel charger on a trip, what's left behind is a useless shell that cannot be used to charge anything. So if you leave town for a few weeks and take the travel charger with you, the person staying home with whom you've been sharing will have no way to charge her toothbrush until you return.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQP5FJNZIVFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDHHTJM#wasThisHelpful","R3MQP5FJNZIVFK","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first tactical flashlight I've owned, and the usability, brightness and build quality are awesome. I like the tail button on/off switch, which remembers the previous setting. The front button, which switches between modes, is a little bit hard to find, even with the light turned on, but it's not as critical to be able to find it in complete darkness like the on/off switch is, so I think this design approach is best. I can always grab the light and turn it on in an instant, and if I fumble around for a second adjusting the brightness or activating the strobe, it's okay. I'm not a paramilitary type who will use this for attacking bunkers; I'm just a nerd who likes camping and backpacking with reliable gear.I previously owned one of the Streamlight flashlights, which I unfortunately lost, and when I started shopping for a replacement my research led me to this one. I think it would be unfair to compare the two, since this light is in a different class than the Streamlight I owned, and costs more than twice as much. But I'm very happy so far with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32C96WZJZ0XUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNUBH7G#wasThisHelpful","R32C96WZJZ0XUB","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pouch, for the price, seems pretty well built. It doesn't fit my iPhone 6 Plus like a glove, but it certainly fits, with its case on. I use this when strapped into my backpack, which renders my usual belt holster unusable. It is a bit of a hassle to whip the phone in and out, but that's the point. The phone is not going to fall out of this case on its own.I may find other uses for this little pouch.

"I bought the Loopy Slim directly from Loopy upon the recommendation of a friend, and it was pretty good, but did not seem as protective as I would have liked. At the time, the Loopy Vibe, which is a bit thicker and more protective, was not on the market yet. Loopy offered me the Vibe at a steep discount when it became available, since I had just purchased the Slim.I have an iPhone 6 Plus, and it's pretty huge and heavy. I got the Loopy Slim because I didn't like how huge my previous case made my phone. It seemed to double the weight and size. The Loopy Vibe is less chunky than my previous case, but it's still pretty heavy compared to the Slim. But that's the price to pay for better protection, I suppose. I might switch back at some point, but for now I do like having all four edges of my phone covered.The lip around the front edge still is not big enough to really place the phone on its face and feel safe about it, especially with the tempered glass screen protector that Loopy threw in to sweeten the deal. I might at some point remove the screen protector and go back to the Slim just to keep things light and thin, but for now I'm happy with the Vibe.The other drawback to the Vibe is that it's shiny plastic on the back, which collects fingerprints and shows scratches pretty badly. I don't beat on my phone, but the case already looks very scratched up, and I think the shiny approach is a design flaw. I'm not really that picky about how my phone case looks, but it would be silly to think that it will retain its shiny exterior for very long. The Slim has a matte finish, which is another reason I might at some point risk less protection and switch back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJ0UWBL8JDIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UY3P6OS#wasThisHelpful","R1YJ0UWBL8JDIX","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this after a friend gave me a Premiere RO filter system that came out of this house after he moved into an apartment, and I struggled with the installation for a few days. The Premiere system seemed cheap, and things were broken just from a year's worth of use in my friend's house. I did some research and decided to try the APEC. I installed it myself, and it wasn't difficult even though I'm just barely ""handy."" The water it provides is clean, delicious, and seems even better than the finest local bottled RO and distilled water.I still can't believe I don't have to purchase and haul huge bottles of water home any more. One thing I will note though is that the default faucet that comes with this system seems cheap and feels like it will likely wear out very quickly. It has a plastic handle, and is either on or off. I recommend splurging for the $45 upgrade with the ceramic valve. It's well worth it, and the upgraded APEC faucet seems more in line with the quality of the rest of the system. I think if APEC just included that faucet outright and raised the base price by $50 it would be a smart move.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWW5I2FOOJMXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0ZGOZM#wasThisHelpful","RWW5I2FOOJMXB","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these after first buying and sending back the Momentum on-ear model, and there's a world of difference between the two.These phones are just wonderful! The build quality is far higher than that of the next model down, and they fit and sound better. The details, such as the plugs on the cables and the carrying case, also show top attention to detail in the quality.Also, these phones come with a quarter-inch adapter that works with the iPhone cable, which is important. The iPhone cable, because of the way it's wired to work with the built-in mic and controls, does not work with a standard quarter-inch adapter, and the on-ear phones didn't come with one. These phones come with a specially-crafted quarter-inch adapter that works perfectly. I need this when I'm listening via my recording studio audio interface or my headphone exension cord.These phones are definitely optimized for listening pleasure, not for studio recording. But they're not advertised as reference studio phones, so anyone is expecting them to be that maybe hasn't been paying attention. But I thought I'd toss that into my review as a reminder.I don't think you can go wrong with these phones. I've never purchased headphones for more than $300, so I have no frame of reference to compare these with some of the extremely high-priced audiophile phones out there, but that would be an unfair comparison anyway. For this price bracket, I don't think better phones can be found.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F9GSQ5IKSBJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZZNXOK#wasThisHelpful","R1F9GSQ5IKSBJX","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ended up sending these back and getting the more expensive Momentum over-ear headphones instead.These on-ear phones were very nice to look at, and had a pretty solid build quality. But they pinched my head badly, and hurt my ears after less than an hour of wear. I tried genly bending the steel to make them pinch less, but if I bent it any further the phones would stop sealing against my ears and the phones would stop working. This design just doesn't fit my head. I don't have a particularly huge head, but I've been told it's a bit long, or tall, so that might be the problem.Anyway, after I got these I ran into a friend who had the over-ear model, and showed them to me. After the comparison, I decided it was worth ponying up the extra cash to get the better phones, which are just awesome. The build quality, sound quality, and fit of the more expensive phones is so much better than these that it's hard to believe.

"I ended up sending these back. I bought them before doing ample research, based on all the positive reviews and knowing for certain that I wanted Ortlieb panniers.But for just a little bit more money, the Ortlieb Back-roller Classic is a far better buy. Here are features that are missing from this pannier that the Classic includes:* Buckles with straps that enable closing the panniers more quickly and easily across the top for quick access when using as a commuter and when total waterproofing is not as critical (I live in the desert).* Compression straps that double as carrying handles when toting the bags around off-bike. Again, for commuters, this is pretty important. The City model does not have any straps anywhere, although a strap can be purchased as an add-on. But the price of a single strap is more than the difference between the price of the City and the Classic.* Buckles that are opposite each other so that the panniers can be attached to each other off-bike to make them into one big blog of baggage. Again, for commuting I've found this invaluable.* Inner pouches, with a large, flat pocket and a small zipper pocket. These are very handy for keeping wallet, keys, sunglasses and so forth easy at reach, especially since my cycling shorts have no pockets. The City has one big cavernous space in it.Otherwise, the two models of panniers are basically the same. But these differences are pretty important to me. I'm using the bags primarily for urban commuting, but I can imagine the same features would be just as important for long-distance cyclists. I just don't think it makes sense, when buying a top-of-the-line set of panniers like this, to save $20 or so just to compromise this much. I wouldn't be surprised if Ortlieb discontinued the City at some point because it's not really cheap enough to be worth all the missing features. Had I known more clearly about all this in the first place, I wouldn't have bought the City.I just love the Classic, but I ended up getting a better deal elsewhere, so I haven't writtten an Amazon review of that product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFJFAUVNSL6Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OMMH4K#wasThisHelpful","RFJFAUVNSL6Q8","AUFTATW022N80","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUFTATW022N80?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The gently provocative title of this book - Sleeping Embers of an Ordinary Mind - persuaded me to choose this as my Kindle First offering as midnight struck and November began. Anne Charnocks adept weaving of the lives of three singular souls cost me most of a nights sleep but repaid those hours with glimpses of three singular souls in a tale threaded with Renaissance art, sci-fi, and the significance of family history.Antonia, Toni, and Toniah: Three young women, each with an inner core strengthened by an earlier challenge, and each with a compelling perspective on life and a slice of art  a way of seeing.The real Antonia Uccello lived and breathed in 15th-century Florence, and Charnock compellingly imagines how her father (a painter still known today) nurtured his childs gift of vision, and her understanding of perspective, color and painting.Charnocks two fictional characters seem equally real. Toni, a teen in contemporary times, invokes her vision with fabric trims and happenstance spottings of found art in everyday places.Meanwhile, Toniah hails from the year 2113, and is about a decade older than Antonia and Toni. With her freshly minted doctorate in art history and her ability to spot connections and understand context, Toniah is the most complex character of the three. Some of this is due to her age, but she also is enriched by a family heritage that unfolds during the course of the book.Charnock skillfully builds her story a vignette at a time, with chapters alternating among her three protagonists. Pacing is easy and fluid, and we are able to draw inferences and insights based on earlier elements in the book - earlier in terms of time periods as well as book chapters. You may well find yourself pausing to reflect on such notions as the stickiness of success - whether something from our lives outlasts us and takes on its own reputation thanks to a happenstance of traction.In the end, this is a beautifully imagined and carefully structured story that pays homage to the visual and the metaphysical. It is warm and genuine without being self-important (early hints of this include sidewalk sap and a nod to Dr. Who). Its closing chapters demand inference,  reflection and rereading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPG5WQSV8E8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YRHDXK6#wasThisHelpful","RAPG5WQSV8E8S","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kathleen Ernst puts her young readers front and center in Catch the Wind, a choose-your-pathway story that melds events of 1812 with those of the present. The two main characters are tweens/young teens facing similar physical and emotional challenges of being without one of their parents in service to their country. This subject is resonant today with our all-volunteer branches of service, as well as frequent activations of various states National Guard troops.The narrators mom will be leaving soon on an eight-month deployment as a shipboard doctor in the U.S. Navy, and the narrator is trying to cope with a host of emotions and concerns. Similarly, her 1812 counterpart and new friend, Caroline Abbott, is dealing with the aftermath of the capture two months earlier of her father by the British.Ernst wisely chooses to use the War of 1812 in her point-counterpoint story, because it is distant enough it is not freighted with the immediacy of emotion of contemporary engagements. Additionally, as materials from the American Girl franchise are known to do, theres a strong, accurate underpinning of historical information, an added benefit for this time period, which likely is unfamiliar territory for many of Ernsts intended readers.At several locations within the book, the reader chooses between two pathways, and follows the story to one of a number of endings. At each ending, a note suggests that the reader turn to a specific page (number provided) to see how the story would play out with different choices.This structure is equally rewarding for avid and struggling/resistant readers. Students at or above grade-level reading might be given 15- or 20-minute chunks of enrichment reading time in class if they have finished other work. The clarity of Ernsts writing is such that struggling readers also will benefit from this book both to build reading skills and as an entry point for content-area reading.The situations and choices posed throughout the book are suitable for the target age group (8+) as independent reading, and a teacher or parent can provide added opportunities for learning by guiding young readers in the development of a glossary of challenging words. My only caution regarding this book in a school environment is for the teacher or librarian to be aware of possible sensitivity on the part of young readers who may have a parent serving overseas.Physically, although this is a soft-cover book, both cover and page stock are durable enough to withstand use by multiple readers in classroom and library settings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11I2VGODI7ZUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609584473#wasThisHelpful","R11I2VGODI7ZUS","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept of this soy-and-fruit snack is appealing, but the actual bar is disappointing -- both in taste and content.On taste alone, this Soyjoy Blueberry bar leaves a lot to be desired. While the flavors of blueberries and raisins are identifiable, they are overwhelmed by the weirdly powdery yet sticky consistency of the bar.The fine print on the product label continues the bad news. A third of the calories come from fat -- not horrible for an occasional snack or for a portable energy boost in the midst of strenuous activity, such as a hike. However, 3 of the 6 grams of fat in each bar come from saturated fat, a big disappointment, especially in a 1-ounce snack.Further, a bar positioned as healthful ought to be drawing any necessary sweetness from whole fruit or fruit juice. Not this one. Sugar is the third item in the list of ingredients. It is followed by butter, which is another stumper, given the multitude of other available choices.I tried to like these bars -- after all, I like blueberries and raisins, and I enjoy soy in a variety of preparations. However, by my third try, all I was willing to eat were the few blueberries I could rescue. That experience was a good reminder that trail mix and fruit leather made from dried fruit and fruit juice are satisfying and more healthful choices than this processed product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V921EGA3UDMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045XAFZ8#wasThisHelpful","R3V921EGA3UDMV","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many teen readers devour the quirky and satirical and dystopian. With such teaser phrases as dark comedy and quirky murder mystery that is intricately plotted, I hoped No One Else Can Have You would hook adolescent readers.For all I know, it may. However, the caliber of writing is such that I will not be recommending this book to any reluctant, struggling, or avid readers (the three groups for whom I continually seek quality, age-appropriate writing). The plot has promise but the pacing and story arc are insufficient to sustain any true momentum.Hales satire is blunt and at times awkward. This transparency and visibility actually can be a positive for struggling or reluctant readers, who benefit from the added context. However, the language and situations that pepper this book are such that I cannot recommend this book as a resource for independent or book-club-type reading. To be clear, I have sourced and used everything from ghost stories to murder mysteries in units for adolescents.Adults who are shopping for the adolescents in their lives should plan to read this book themselves first before deciding whether to pass it along. Quirkiness is an approach that resonates with the teens with whom I have worked; unfortunately, even leaving aside my other concerns with this book, I dont think the quirk here is sufficient to carry the book, even for an adult reader.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFU5E5BDK08G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062211196#wasThisHelpful","R1BFU5E5BDK08G","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking at this dartboard, chances are youre either knowledgeable about the game of darts or looking to improve your game. If you know your stuff, the specs of this board speak for themselves.If youre like me, and are looking for a tool that will help you improve hand-eye coordination and have some fun along the way, a board like this will help you elevate your game.+ Its no-excuses hanging mechanism is straightforward to use, so that your board is at the ready and positioned accurately, even if you have to store it between uses.+ The board itself is made using materials and methods that reduce the disappointment that happens when your dart hits and then falls down (as well as possible damage to the tip of the dart).+ The wires that divide the scoring sections are thinner than the norm, and are shaped in such a way that your chances of hitting wire rather than board are reduced.+ The board is staple-free. This is a biggie for me; for some reason, my darts are drawn to the staples on other boards, so practicing with this board has been a pleasure.With care, this board should last for years. The face of it is designed to minimize the appearance of punctures and the overall construction is such that the board will continue to grip dart points repeatedly.

"Imagine for a moment that you have spent 10 years in jail because you blunted the attack of a man determined to harm a childhood friend. You have spent a decade pulling kudzu and drinking coffee brewed from ground acorns, and counting the days until the next time a family member can visit  one person, 15 minutes, every other Sunday.Now imagine the childhood friend is Nat King Cole, and he is repaying your loyalty with his trust, and that he is offering you a new start working for him in Los Angeles, away from the bittersweet memories of Montgomery, Alabama. The wrinkle that drives this story? After a year in Los Angeles and a stint on television, Cole is returning to Montgomery to perform a single concert and wants you by his side. His spoken desire is to conclude an evening that was interrupted 11 years before by violence. What lies beneath is the chance for both of you to find closure for wounds that have been festering for all those years.Author Ravi Howard brings together fact and fiction, stitching them together so delicately that it is difficult to tease apart reality and imagination. Several of the larger elements of the story have roots in history  the Montgomery bus boycott, Coles weekly 15-minute telecast, and the onstage attack (although Howard changes the particulars of the latter to suit his timeline and the creation of the fictional character of Nathaniel Weary).While it seems that Howard is running through a checklist of bigger-picture items he feels he must include, his writing and storytelling are at their best in the smaller moments. He is particularly effective at creating the character of Nathaniel Weary, and fleshing him out slowly, anecdote by anecdote and recollection by recollection.Howard doesnt tell us of Wearys character; rather, he allows the unfolding of quiet moments with his family to illustrate that Weary is a man of principle. Several particularly moving passages occur early on  on the day Weary is released from Kilby, where he has been jailed for 10 years. Tears may tickle the back of your throat as Weary and his father visit the cemetery where Wearys mom is buried. They sip coffee from the familys marriage china, paid for in cash, a piece at a time.Unfortunately, while these smaller moments ring with the clarity of a fingernail on crystal, some of the larger elements impede the story. Its almost as though Howard got tongue-tied when dealing with moments of larger significance, which is especially a shame given his deftness at coaxing out vignettes that bind his readers to his characters.Is this a book worth reading? Id say yes, if only because of the way Howard brings the fictional Nathaniel Weary to life and makes him someone you care about. (If you are a Cole fan, note that he plays only a supporting role in this story.) However, structurally, there are a number of weaknesses, and these are reflected in my final rating. That said, Howard has a beautiful voice, and I look forward to his next book, and may well check out his backlist.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132QAILAUQBDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006052961X#wasThisHelpful","R132QAILAUQBDD","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive been using this as both a splitter and extender for several months and it has performed in steady, no-nonsense fashion. At this price point, I did not expect svelte looks, and I did anticipate that it might not be engineered for all the pluggings and unpluggings such adapters undergo.Happily, my concerns were unfounded. My various power adapters easily mounted and dismounted. Even more importantly, the business end of this adapter was designed and manufactured carefully enough that I had no issues using this in several vehicles  both the ones I drive regularly, as well as a rental vehicle that had just one adapter port.The splitter easily and securely fits into the cigarette adapter in both my newish car and an older truck, and eases out without a struggle. Between-times it stays put, unlike a more expensive dealer-supplied extender that came with one of our vehicles. While testing and monitoring the unit for this review, I found that it was able to pass through enough power to charge two smallish devices, such as cellphones, as long as both were not in heavy use. While using a map app on one phone, the other device continued to top up, but the charge percentage stayed put on the phone in use. I consider this acceptable, since I have encountered similar performance with a charger that is not sharing power with another device. Thus I mention it so you are aware, but I have not docked any stars for this.I did subtract a star because the section of cable between the power port and the split is inconveniently short, especially if your vehicle has its shift control (manual or automatic) near the center console. That is a common setup, and it is just too close to this splitter's two ports. In addition, I think this situation is contributing to the wear I am beginning to see at the Y-junction, which is disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IARZOWRTHYKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8WLT7C#wasThisHelpful","R1IARZOWRTHYKD","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Over the years, I have found that my body is most likely to tolerate vegetarian capsules, but not all of them are as complete as their non-vegetarian counterparts.After several months use, I can say that the Womens Multi Gold is my new gold standard. Capsules go down (and stay down) smoothly, theres no odd aftertaste, and the amount of Vitamin D3 included means I no longer have to buy a separate bottle of D3 to boost the effectiveness of my daily doses of calcium. A calm tummy also means I am faithful about taking these daily.Im not sure whether my body tolerates these capsules better than other multivitamins because they are made from fruit, vegetables, and herbs, but I do appreciate that the ingredients are organic. When you think about it, a lifelong commitment to taking a daily multivitamin means thousands of doses, and those doses ought to be both healthful and helpful.As to the latter, it is worth noting that the manufacturer has a third-party laboratory test samples of each lot it makes of these vitamins to measure their purity and potency.These vitamins are supplied in amber-colored glass bottles with child-resistant caps, and the lot number and best buy date are printed legibly on the bottom of the bottle. Standard dosage is 3 capsules a day.Note: Initial sample provided by the manufacturer for impartial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QOYYQTQ4TBK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRO2VO4#wasThisHelpful","R2QOYYQTQ4TBK8","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of Anna Freeman's characters describes a press of people as being ""both terrible and wonderful, like an animal show at which the fences were too thin."" This brief simile conveys a hint of the power that awaits you between the covers of The Fair Fight: A Novel.Freeman transports us to 18th-century England, and realistically evokes the period through descriptions, characters' conversations, and even cultural norms. Her research is evident: every archaic phrase I looked up was spot on both for the period and the context.As the title and book description indicate, this is a story of two women boxers. Their stories are told from the points of view of several key characters, with each vantage point providing a different perspective on the women and on key events.Freeman invokes two countervailing methods of bringing these women to life for her readers. One woman, Ruth, appears fully formed as a teenager -- we see her challenges and choices and life's inevitabilities as being formed on bedrock to which we aren't immediately privy. By contrast, Charlotte enters from the wings, and her importance to the story builds along with the development of her personality through a series of events that unfold during the course of the story. Ruth ""is,"" while Charlotte ""becomes.""The book begins with Ruth's introduction to the ring, when she ""comes up to scratch,"" taking her station for her first fight. Thus, quite literally we see Ruth initially as a fighter, and only in ensuing chapters do other elements of her character take shape. However, we meet Charlotte in a domestic setting, and are immersed in the development of her character in response to internal and external forces. Only after we understand Charlotte do we see the role boxing will play in her life.This is an engrossing, well-crafted tale featuring two resilient women. At 480 pages, it is not a quick read, but it certainly is an engaging one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMNBT6N21WHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633290#wasThisHelpful","RWMNBT6N21WHH","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What were you reading as a teen? Chances are, at least some of those authors and their works became touchstones in your life, or at the least markers to the teen you were. I was an Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Dick Francis and Agatha Christie kind of person, because I couldn't quite wrap my mind around short stories ... they felt too demanding.So, before we go any further, let's acknowledge the intellectual rigor embraced by the adolescent editors of this anthology. Short stories are more challenging than they appear -- both to write and to comprehend fully as a reader. It cannot have been a simple turn of events to have combed through heaps of short stories and chosen the fraction of submissions that appear in this collection. The reader's reaction to short stories often is more immediate and visceral than it is to a book, which is fitting, because of the comparative sizes of each.The two unifying components of this anthology are that the stories all were initially published within months of each other, and that they have a noticeable degree of quirkiness. Beyond that, your favorites are likely to be different than mine. To provide just one example, I found the AP story to be a standout, but I haven't seen any of my fellow reviewers mention it. And this illustrates the truism about anthologies ... everyone is sure to gravitate to something, but those ""somethings"" may well differ.  The fact that this anthology was curated by teens provides readers with the added insight of what this rising generation of readers considers worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12DEHZNODTSDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544129660#wasThisHelpful","R12DEHZNODTSDY","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While the idea of ""teaching to the test"" is not something that educators at any level like to do, sometimes pragmatism trumps principle -- especially for standardized gatekeeper-type exams for advanced degree programs.When it comes to the GMAT, the multiple sections of the tests call for strategies and tactics tailored to each component -- not unlike the diverse components of the heptathlon. In both cases, effective preparation calls for studying the route, educating yourself on the possible pitfalls and distractions, building stamina and endurance, and becoming attuned to what the judges are seeking. By removing variables and preparing mentally, you provide yourself with ways to clear obstacles from your path and make your test results as competitive as possible.At 747 intensive pages, this book is a single-source preparation manual that encompasses everything from describing the philosophy of the test and how to prepare to practice problems and two full-length sample tests.The authors address how this style of test may impact your mindset, and offer advice on how avoid getting distracted or discouraged.  Particularly helpful is their advice on gauging the ""discomfort zone"" that is on the upper end of your confidence level in the adaptive sections of the test. They follow this up by explaining how practice and familiarity can help you nudge that upper range higher. ""[H]ow well you can recognize and manage your discomfort zone will determine how high your score can go,"" they note.They provide ways to identify patterns and predictability within the test. In addition, they help you to understand the reasoning behind each section of the test and what measurements each section is gathering. They also address such practical matters as practicing with homemade materials resembling the ones you will be limited to during the test, and replicating test conditions as closely as you can.In addition to generalities such as time management and how scoring is calculated, they provide specific strategies and tactics for each section of the test. They dissect how to identify what is being asked, as well as understanding what sort of answer is desired. This is especially helpful for the essay (AWA) section of the test.The overview of the various sections of the test includes a description of how the adaptive sections play out, since they function differently than other standardized tests you may have taken in the past. The initial questions predict the test-taker's skill level and the testing algorithm fine-tunes that prediction by offering questions at that level, and requiring that the test-taker demonstrate content knowledge by answering several questions correctly before ramping up the difficulty of the questions.Here's an example of how the authors not only provide advice, but explain why it matters. They debunk a number of myths about the GMAT, including the one that maintains you are best off by spending relatively more time on earlier questions. Doing so doesn't necessarily mean you'd get more of them right than you would otherwise, they say, and it may cost you the time you could have used to complete as many of the questions in the section as possible.  They note that the score-calculation algorithm makes it more costly to miss answering a question than it is to answer a question incorrectly.With the publisher's retail price of this book currently at less than 10 percent of the cost of one session of the GMAT, this book is a sound investment if you are able to commit the time to process the strategies and work through the questions over the span of several weeks so that you will be able to reinforce and encode the authors' strategies and tactics. If your prep time is briefer, the book should still help you perform triage, although less effectively than if you had a longer span of time to prepare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8XRWF9HY5MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1438002319#wasThisHelpful","R2K8XRWF9HY5MD","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hired Man begins as a story of a handyman's life in the small town of Gost, where life is placid and unhurried -- except that it isn't, really. Handyman Duro Kolak makes a low-key entrance as the person who helps the new arrivals who've taken up summer residence in a neighboring house.At first, Kolak seems to be nothing more than an amiable neighbor, wise in the ways of doing much with little, but slowly, slowly, his role as caretaker and conscience and memory-keeper emerges ... at first as if shot through cheesecloth, but later sharpening into razor-edged sharpness.His dramatic foils are new neighbors Laura and her children, Matt and Grace. Laura is froth and superficial, innocent enthusiasm. Matt is nonchalance and disinterest. Grace, his younger sister, is impressionable, determined, and pragmatic -- traits that resonate and harmonize with aspects of Kolak's personality.An old car, a handful of small tiles, and a dinner table are among the touchstones that help tell the story of Kolak and his village. Author Aminatta Forna introduces each of these items with a whisper of foreshadowing, easy at first to blink away and dismiss. But slowly, almost imperceptibly, Forna heightens the underlying tension, tipping you ever so slowly off-balance until you turn each page with anticipatory hesitation and uncertainty, and only notice that your pulse rate is climbing if you pause in your reading.The characters, setting, and pacing of this story are so finely wrought that I refuse to identify any plot points and risk weakening their impact. This story is of such high caliber that it compels uninterrupted focus. It will repay your attention by lingering long after you think you've absorbed the events in its final pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZIDPOCEYHJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802121918#wasThisHelpful","R33ZIDPOCEYHJ1","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My face can be a bit sensitive -- my go-to face wash is Cetaphil -- so I tested this cleansing oil by using it on one forearm and leaving it on my skin for quite a while before rinsing. The next morning, that area of my arm still felt smoother and more hydrated than the remaining skin, so I began using this product on my face.The oils are light in consistency and have a slight, muted scent.

In case you're wondering about the organic fruit acids that Juice has included to help dissolve impurities, I haven't felt any unpleasant after-effects while applying this cleansing oil to my face. After rinsing and drying, my skin does not feel stretched or tight, unlike the sensations I've had with other cleansers. It also gets my face clean: it gets rid of perspiration and such after a warm afternoon's worth of yard work.Although this oil works effectively and rinses cleanly when following the standard instructions, I especially enjoy following Juice's suggested ""spa-like cleanse."" All you do is apply a few pumps of the product to a warm, moist washcloth, and clean your face in circular motions using the cloth.

"There is much to appreciate about this book. It is well-plotted and well-paced, and features a strong but imperfect protagonist. At more than 400 pages, it provides the sort of meaty read that eager young readers will appreciate.I was that sort of reader as a child, as were my kids, and a series like this would have captured and retained our interest. If your kids are fans of the author's previous Septimus Heap books, this book should be a home run for them.Unfortunately, there's a mismatch with how this book is being marketed that is likely to disappoint young readers. Although this is billed as ""Book One"" of a new series, it really is not a standalone work. I'm very disappointed that the author and publisher did not provide a prologue to help readers immerse themselves in the book.In this digital era, it's not too late to give new readers the tools they need: I hope that those involved with this book put together a prologue and host it on the publisher's website and/or release it in PDF or e-reader format. This then could be included in future editions.Thus, my recommendation is split:->Four stars if you are shopping for a Septimus Heap fan.->Two stars if the recipient hasn't read the earlier books -- unless you are getting the backlist, too.

"One of the enduring ironies of the decades after World War II is how two of America's allies, Russia and China, became her foes. The USSR kept German troops occupied on a second front at great cost. Similarly, China battled Japan in isolation for four years, and still as the war drew to a close in 1945, a weakened China continued to keep more than a million Japanese troops on its soil, preventing them from battling the Allies elsewhere in the Pacific.If we want to understand the seemingly rapid shift in the U.S. government's perception and policies toward China in the watershed year of 1945, we must begin several decades beforehand. Thus, although author Richard Bernstein calls this book China 1945 it by necessity is much larger in scope.Bernstein frames this book as an exploration of how choices the United States made in its relationship with China during a single year sowed the seeds of the harvest we have been reaping ever since. However, before he teases out the events of 1945, Bernstein explores two significant precursors. The first is China's bitter struggles with Japan dating to 1895; the second is the rise of two philosophically different groups, the Kuomintang (KMT) or Nationalists, and the Communist Party of China (CCP).Because of an interest in Japan's history, even before I began reading this book, I was familiar with Japan's quest for expansion. Although I knew some of the details Bernstein covered, he placed them into a more meaningful context than I'd had previously, and one that is essential before exploring the choices during WWII, especially in 1945. I found Bernstein's chronology of Japan's engagements between 1895 and 1937 cogent and detailed, and think that readers with less familiarity will not be at sea.Bernstein provides the same thorough, arms-length approach that makes his analysis of China's relationship with Japan so informative as he explores China's domestic situation and the evolution of its political evolution following the revolution that led to the creation of the Republic of China in 1912.Only after readers have these contextual details firmly at hand does Bernstein begin teasing apart the key fissure lines and combustible events of 1945. Without a full grounding in what went before, for example, it is difficult to comprehend why China was in a ""poor and fragile state"" -- even before eight years of war waged by poorly outfitted, poorly fed troops, and a death toll of 20 to 30 million. Similarly, Bernstein makes it evident that one of the beneficiaries of Japan's advances on China was the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong.By the middle of 1944, Bernstein posits, Mao and his rival, KMT President Chiang Kai-shek, both believed that the U.S. would defeat Japan. That realization freed them to focus on which of the two sides would win victory in the internal struggle for control of China after the war ended. In this vein, he questions how subsequent events might have enfolded had the U.S. created a cooperative relationship with Mao on par with that it had developed with Chiang.Bernstein maintains this high level of research and inquiry throughout the book, analyzing the policies and actions of a number of key players, both Chinese and American. This information reaches critical mass, so that we readers are prepared to work through the chain of events at war's end, when the CCP notified the U.S., Great Britain, and the Soviet Union that it had earned the authority to accept the surrender of its foes. Not only was the CCP explicitly claiming its right to take possession of the troops, but implicitly laying claim to their weapons and territory.What happened next has echoed for decades, and Bernstein guides us through the unfolding of a host of confusing posturings and events, both directed at the domestic population and for consumption beyond China's borders. To his credit, he provides enough dispassionate information and analysis that we readers are able to evaluate his conclusions from an informed vantage point and formulate our own opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15JWNW4N5GWF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307595889#wasThisHelpful","R15JWNW4N5GWF0","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Color Song is a finely wrought story about a young woman's devotion to art.  We meet Giulia, a teenage novice who assists in the painting workshop of a convent in Padua, Italy. Giulia is passionate about the creation of art, and the day we meet her is the day that she discovers she can hear the distinctive bell-like music made by each color of paint.Giulia's story begins in the late 1480s, and author Victoria Strauss is careful to evoke the mannerisms, mores, and atmosphere of the period. In Giulia, she has created a character who is strong and self-guided, while still perceptive enough to feel the self-doubts that teens and young adults hold close to themselves, no matter what the era.At its heart, this is a coming of age story that is draped with the details of life, art and adventure. If you've read the liner notes, you know that Giulia is faced with the choice of remaining at the convent and losing her chance to paint -- or assuming a false identity to stay true to her quest to continue developing her skill as a painter.The plot is just this side of fanciful, but is likely to appeal to its primary audience. The story arc and dialog set a fine pace and atmosphere, and Giulia and most of the supporting characters are well drawn. Passages to do with art are particularly finely evoked, especially those that involve Giulia's singular abilities to hear the colors' songs.

"On September 5, 1978, the leaders of three countries met to discuss peace. They each were coping with political pressures and dissatisfied citizens back home -- people who were more concerned about the immediacy of domestic economic problems than the unlikely prospect for peace between Egypt and Israel.Thirty-six years on, the Camp David Accords developed by Jimmy Carter, Anwar Sadat, and Menachim Begin continue to avert war, but tensions in the Middle East remain. Thus, the insights Lawrence Wright knits together in his chronology of that September not only document a key moment in history, but also have a perennial immediacy because they contribute to a fuller comprehension of the ongoing situation and historic tensions.This book succeeds on many levels -- as a day-by-day chronology of events; as a profile of Begin, Carter, and Sadat as individuals and leaders; and as a primer on the region's history. Because of its content, source materials, and approach, this book is both history and a work of journalism. Wright's interweaving of interviews, published works, and archival materials gives the book a richness and veracity from a variety of perspectives, and adds to the sense that you are immersing yourself in unfolding events as you read.Wright starts with an overview of how volatile the relationship between Israel and its neighbors was in the decades leading up to the conference, as well as biographical thumbnails of each of the three men, including their inner motivations and moments that defined their future political choices.One example of Wright's attention to context is his care in setting the stage for the low expectations of the talks' success. He provides a concise exploration of the 10 months before they began. Sadat visited Jerusalem in November 1977, the first leader of an Arab country to do so. That brief visit had the opportunity to humanize each side to the other -- the Israelis who saw Sadat and their local coverage of his visit, as well as the Egyptians who followed their leader's visit on television. Wright uses this unexpected visit to provide an overview of the historic significance of Jerusalem that is specific and detailed, and illustrative of the innate tensions at work in the region. Although that visit offered a hint of the possibility of peace, subsequent actions by Israel and retaliations by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) against both Israel and Egypt.Throughout the book, Wright stays on course with a daily chronology of events. Although he takes readers on a number of side journeys, each one appears at a logical point in the unfolding story of the 13-day odyssey. Wright is careful to keep these side trips brief and focused, and to ensure that they add to readers' understanding of the character, background, and motivation of the leader it is about.Wright's narrative is clear, comprehensive, and explicit, and provides readers with enough detail for them to make thoughtful connections and inferences. If you don't have much background on the subject, he makes sure you are not adrift, and yet he the variety of resources he taps should keep the book from being a rehashing for those who are more familiar.In a book published five years after the peace talks, Jimmy Carter described feeling ""a curious fatalism"" on the day those talks began. As you visit that historic September along with him, Anwar Sadat and Menachim Begin, you may well feel the same way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376TZS36FUEBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352034#wasThisHelpful","R376TZS36FUEBG","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Six hundred years ago, a French teenager changed history. Many of us know little more of her than her name, Joan of Arc, and her contention that she obeyed the instructions of angels.Kathryn Harrison has performed yeoman's work in researching and telling the story of Joan of Arc's life. She delves into contemporary records made at the time Joan was imprisoned, as well as interviews to gather testimony from more than 100 witnesses from various stages of Joan's life that were conducted two decades after her death as part of a retrial that cleared her name 25 years after her death.These and other glimpses of Joan in her own words and those of her contemporaries are memorable in their own right. What makes this biography even richer is Harrison's attention to context, both during Joan's brief life in the early 1400s, and in the centuries since then, as authors and playwrights recast Joan's story within the mores of their own eras. If your knowledge of Joan comes largely from plays, novels and films, you are likely to be surprised at how many misconceptions about Joan exist.What I found of special interest was how specific Harrison is about details of everyday life in the 1400s, and her ability to explain the significance of some of these details from the perspective of Joan's contemporaries, and interpretations and connections they would have made. She describes expectations of the time that were based on one's place in the hierarchy of society.She also is able to put to rest a number of superficial notions using evidence gleaned from multiple sources. For example, Joan wasn't simply the daughter of a poor villager who helped her family by herding sheep. Harrison disproves this notion by providing details about the land her father owned and his duties as dean of their village. In addition, she explains the significance of Joan's mother's surname, Romee, which connoted that either Joan's mother or maternal grandmother had made the prohibitively expensive and difficult pilgrimage to Rome.  These and other elements of Joan's childhood helped to shape the person she became.In addition, Harrison addresses some of the qualities Joan possessed that propelled her life in such meteoric fashion. These include having a memory good enough to counteract her illiteracy; choosing talents worth cultivating; and attaining mastery with great speed and comprehension.All of this helps convey why this biography is fascinating and informative. The following passage from the book conveys the power of Harrison's writing. She is reflecting on Joan's reticence about divulging certain details about the  angels who spoke to her:""Perhaps she didn't so much invent details as relinquish them slowly,"" Harrison writes. ""Perhaps she didn't invent but borrowed unconsciously. Familiar figures ... provided ready vessels in which Joan could safeguard what she didn't want to forget or deny.""This book is intense and captivating. What it demands in focused concentration it repays easily tenfold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROXKLTOFLMV3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531206#wasThisHelpful","ROXKLTOFLMV3I","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"True confession time: The only kind of cooking I really enjoy is baking, and my favorite thing to shop for is books. Thus, with my mind on the holidays just around the corner, the chance to explore this book and offer you my experiences with it was perfect timing.If you're at all familiar with Jeff Hertzberg and Zoe Francois and their blog, you'll know that they've demystified and streamlined the process of baking breads, pizza dough and other fresh-from-the-oven delights.  However, if you or folks in your family or your network of friends are sensitive to gluten, it's probably been a challenge to buy -- or make -- dependably tasty breads and pastries with an inviting texture. That's the sadness I've heard from friends who are trying to minimize or remove gluten from their diets, and why I was pleased that the authors had modified their recipes and techniques for those who need to avoid gluten.Thus, my initial thought was that if this book was as dependable and baker-friendly as Hertzberg's and Francois's earlier recipes, I could bake up a storm and surprise gluten-sensitive friends with gluten-free gifts. After working through a range of the recipes and realizing that they are indeed as streamlined and dependable as the pair's other recipes, however, I've expanded my thinking. Some folks will be receiving baked goods. Those who enjoy cooking will be getting the book, plus a reusable container or lidded food-prep tub filled with the dry ingredients for the gluten-free all-purpose flour mixture, as well as the additional ingredients they will need to make the master recipe for four free-form loaves.Here are some notes from my baking thus far:* Following these recipes is much easier if you have a scale, because some measurements call for firmly packing ingredients; thus weighing is more precise.* The dough does blend together, but it can take longer than you're used to. Since I'm new to gluten-free cooking, I'm not sure whether that's true across the board. I was grateful for my KitchenAid and its dough hook: I didn't mind the need to halve the recipe because the mixer did the hard work.* Prepping and baking are pretty foolproof, and instructions and processes are simple and clear enough for beginning bakers. Parchment paper was a help not only for baking, but for some prep work, including the process of rolling out the pizza dough.* Your biggest challenges are likely to be finding sufficient space in your refrigerator for dough storage, and acquiring some of the ingredients. Look for commercial-grade tubs that will make the best use of the depth and width of your refrigerator, especially if you have a side-by-side. (Measure now, and buy two tubs, even if you plan to keep one tub refrigerated at a time.) As for ingredients, I was successful at finding some of the more challenging ones, such as xanthan gum, ground psyllium husk, and specialty flours at health-food stores and online. The authors also offer a range of substitutions for flours and starches. I wanted to work with oat flour, for example, and found that I could use it in place of sorghum for a nice dough that baked up well.* Pithy sidebars dot the pages of the book, and are designed to anticipate your questions and answer them quickly. Examples include how changing an ingredient can affect the texture and appearance of a dough, techniques for shaping a pizza disk, and flours to choose to boost protein content.* Technique photos for items such as pretzels are helpful both for beginning bakers who need guidance as well as for more experienced bakers who would like to compare the texture and appearance of their doughs against those of the authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBC3Q5TZ1D5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250018315#wasThisHelpful","R3CBC3Q5TZ1D5D","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have needed several weeks' distance from The Nazis Next Door: How America Became a Safe Haven for Hitler's Men to be able to write calmly enough to provide the following review. The reason for that is in part a reflection of the thorough, professional effort by Eric Lichtblau to detail the choices and actions of the U.S. government following World War II. I frankly do not understand how he was able to live with the process of gathering this material, conducting interviews, and writing this very necessary book.You likely are aware of at least some of the details of which Lichtblau writes, such as  the contributions of  German scientists to our country's efforts in space to meet the scientific/political goal of placing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s; or the government's rabid fear and loathing of Communism, as evidenced in the post-WWII era by McCarthyism and the Cold War. There's also the more recent spate of identifying a handful of U.S. residents who have been brought to trial decades after their war crimes.However, what this book does is pull together a number of these threads -- with substantial detail -- and weave them into a stifling blanket of context. The resulting work is an implicit indictment of the choices some members of the U.S. government made that run counter to the tenets on which we like to think the social contract of our country exists.Certainly, most of us know at least a little about Sen. Joseph McCarthy's fear-mongering, and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's empire-building and actions that exceeded Bureau mandates. What may be new to you, as it was to me, is to have these and other lesser-known actions bound together and placed in context in a single volume.Be warned that this is not a simple or pleasant read. The research and writing are excellent, and complex and arcane bits of information are presented comprehensibly. The tension comes from the incomprehensibility of what took place, and for this reason you may need to give yourself permission to read this book in installments over several days' time. I found that I was able to cope with 50 to 60 pages at a time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13EY85FYJS901/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547669194#wasThisHelpful","R13EY85FYJS901","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got a soft spot for pillows, and have bought contoured pillows, memory-foam pillows, U-shaped pillows, and pillows with a thin surface layer of ""cooling beads."" Unfortunately, this pillow has been the most uncomfortable of the bunch, for two reasons.The first reason for my discomfort is a matter of taste. This pillow is definitely on the firm/sturdy end of the spectrum. It does have a bit of ""give"" when you rest the weight of your head on it; however, it molds you to its contours, rather than having enough pliability to mold at least a little to your contours. There is a difference between providing enough support so that your head is in position, and being stiff enough that there is no sense of cradling/comfort.  Those who prefer a really firm pillow may not mind, but the product description should be more specific.The second reason for my discomfort is more fundamental. I followed the manufacturer's suggestion of airing out the pillow for 24 hours before using it. Even after that time had passed, the pillow had a lingering smell, although it was much less than it had been straight out of the package.  I laundered the cover twice while waiting to reassemble the pillow. The cover held up well to laundering, which removed the smell. However, it isn't thick enough to block the lingering smell from the pillow. The foam had a slight color shift, but it seemed cosmetic, and the product information sheet mentioned this was a possibility, so that doesn't affect my rating.However, the flammability of this product is so high that although we are non-smokers and our home is fitted with smoke detectors, even if this pillow was comfortable to use, I simply would not be comfortable with it as a bed pillow. I do commend the manufacturer for the specific warnings on the product insert, including the following: ""Once ignited, polyurethane foam is difficult to extinguish. Foam fires that appear to be extinguished may smolder and reignite. Always have fire officials determine whether a fire has been extinguished.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R172TMUQGPKFU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLQ898#wasThisHelpful","R172TMUQGPKFU6","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With eloquence and grace, Robert Poole invites us to meet some of the many pulsing hearts that make Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery live on.Family members and friends visit the graves of these veterans, leaving flowers, keepsakes, and mementoes, and drawing comfort in the bittersweet process of revisiting everyday memories as well as the ache of recalling how their loved ones died.Somehow, those left behind -- whether civilians or veterans, whatever the year their loved ones passed -- have built a community. Poole touches on this by showing interrelationships, such as Vietnam veterans ""being there"" for those mourning more recent losses.With compassion and respect, he also explores the toll of such combat-related issues as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other challenges that active-duty servicepeople and veterans both confront. Notably, neither he nor his military and civilian sources shies from such painful subjects, including suicide.Reading stories like those shared here can be extremely emotional, but it is necessary.... Necessary for understanding fear and bravery, necessary for understanding what makes a person willing to die for a comrade or a principle, and necessary for working through grief, whether immediate or at a distance.""No man is an island,"" philosopher John Donne wrote four centuries ago, ""every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."" Those at rest in Section 60 and those who keep their memories alive live this philosophy. Daily.As one whose relatives sleep at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific and other veterans' cemeteries, I admire the people who have worked to keep the memories of their loved ones so tangible and visible. I hope their grace and generosity in sharing their stories starts a groundswell of everyday remembrance that spreads nationwide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQNAK5X4RJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620402939#wasThisHelpful","RJQNAK5X4RJM","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise at the heart of Mark Payne's book is likely to catch the interest of an array of people; unfortunately, some readers' enthusiasm may flag in the opening pages, where marketing jargon and ""positioning"" are at their most evident.If you're among them, my advice is to persevere. After taking care of some must-airs, Payne gets down to the business of showing how imagination and pragmatism can coexist in the business world.Depending on your interests and trigger points -- whether for thought or for irritation -- you may find yourself skimming some sections and underscoring key points in others. Again, persevere. If one case study doesn't interest you or provide a thought prompt, the next one probably will.My approach ended up being to read the entire book and returning to some of the sections for deeper reading, annotation, and reflection.

"In All the Truth Is Out: The Week Politics Went Tabloid, journalist Matt Bai makes a case for what he believes is a fundamental change in how reporters cover politics.  He points to an almost symbiotic relationship between a change in political reporting and the implosion of Gary Hart's 1987 campaign for president.Until the mid-1980s, Bai reminds us, there were three major television networks and several newspapers of national record. Although wire services could move news around the clock, there was no 24-hour news cycle in the way we comprehend and live it today -- no live video feeds on location, no websites, cable, no blogs, no tweets, and no cell phones (and thus no text messages).Further, until this point, Bai posits, politicians and beat reporters had a shared ethos about what was and wasn't newsworthy. To buttress this, he points to earlier occasions during which reporters and news organizations were aware of certain politicians' extramarital involvements but did not report them. By contrast, news coverage of celebrities was much more personality-driven, especially as practiced by the tabloid-style publications and television shows.Bai then explores what happened during the 1987 election cycle that changed reporters' and news organizations' behavior; candidates' interactions with reporters; audiences' preferences for the content of news reporting; and the tools and technology available to reporters and news organizations. Some of the details he has unearthed may well surprise you, and at the very least, they bear thinking about.""What really happened in 1987,"" Bai writes, ""was that the finest political journalists of a generation surrendered all at once to the idea that politics had become another form of celebrity-driven entertainment, while simultaneously disdaining the kind of reporting that such a thirst for entertainment made necessary.""That passage continues to haunt me, and it may well resonate with you, especially at this point in yet another election cycle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMM60C48Z97D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307273385#wasThisHelpful","RCMM60C48Z97D","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chances are you've seen dedicated handheld swipe-and-go payment devices in action, but are just starting to explore whether they're right for you. What Square has done with this little device and supporting app is to put mobile credit-card transactions within reach of sole proprietors and small businesses that don't want to be tied to overhead costs, but do want the flexibility of accepting payments by credit card.I am extremely conservative when it comes to the security of personal information -- especially financial data. Thus, I only considered reviewing and using this product after checking in with a business associate who transitioned to Square several years ago. He has a limited number of these readers, and assigns them to employees who will be working at customers' sites and needing to collect payment. Payment processing efficiency, mobile receipts, and accounting data are among the features he says he finds most useful.Downloading and activating the application went without incident on my iPhone, I spent several days exploring the ""back end"" of the accounting/reporting before using the reader, so that I would be prepared for the data. This was time well spent, and something you may want to consider.I appreciate the mobility and security this device provides. Key benefits include:+ Convenience for customers.+ Your ability to collect payments at the point of service in exchange for a set percentage of the billed amount. That rate currently is 2.75 percent for any card type supported by Square. This is a different pricing structure than is offered by some other vendors, so you should do the math to determine whether or not this fee structure would be an improvement for you.+ Accepting a credit-card payment can provide more protection than accepting a check, because the card issuer goes after the cardholder rather than voiding the payment to the merchant. This is a benefit if you are working with a new client, or want to avoid any risks with accepting cash/checks and keeping them safe until you can get to your financial institution. Taking credit-card payments at the point of sale also helps reduce billing and accounting work.- My main nitpick is that there should be more supporting material available to new users.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDTRQ2CTBKY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZYK3CO#wasThisHelpful","R3TDTRQ2CTBKY9","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been an intrigued bystander to the Dragon phenomenon over the years, and was glad to have the opportunity to explore the latest version of the software. Thus, this review is from the perspective of a new user.If you are new to Dragon, be aware that installing and getting up to speed with this program requires an investment of focused time. You will get the best results by reducing ambient noise as much as possible. Dragon mentions that a microphone is optional, and that you can use the mic on a laptop, but those results were spotty because of the combination of my relatively soft voice and even minimal background noise.Also, although this software comes bundled with a headset, I got better results with a headset/boom mic combination I already owned. My suggestion is to buy the physical version of the program and plan to supply your own headset.During actual use, I was happiest with the dictation feature. I tend to speak pretty slowly, and because I'm more used to typing my writing than speaking it, the software was easily able to keep pace. It also kept up when I read passages from the newspaper, so even if you are experienced at dictating, response speed probably won't be an issue. Dragon also was able to work with a microcassette recording of my speaking voice played back through my boom mic.However, I was disappointed with the navigation tools. I didn't always get a response, and some of the responses were inaccurate. At this point, I am finding the navigation tools to be a time drain. Additionally, keep in mind that the navigation function for this version focuses on Word, WordPerfect and several browsers.

"After a long day at the computer or out in the yard, the muscles in my neck and down the middle of my back often feel tight, even when I remember to stretch during the day.This product is well named -- it really does wrap around your shoulders and hug the center of your back. Better yet, it stays where you place it, allowing the moist heat to reach and relax tense or tired muscles. I've bought and made other products that provide moist heat, but they all have had the drawback of not covering enough of an area, or of shifting rather than staying put.The construction of this wrap is part of the reason it's so effective. A removable, thick poly fleece cover provides some insulation and padding for the interior pouch, which contains the flax seeds that provide the moist heat. That interior pouch is channel-stitched, so that the seeds are spread in a uniform thickness throughout the pouch. The poly fleece is easy to spot clean, and it also hand-washes nicely, without any shrinking shaping issues.This product also can be used as a cold pack. It does get quite cold when frozen. The manufacturer suggests removing the fleece cover when using as a cold pack. I tested it briefly while wearing a T-shirt, and the cold did travel pretty well. If you use this for cold therapy, do keep track of your skin exposure, in terms of both time and approximate temperature.SIZE: I wear a size 6 and was very happy with the drape of the large size over my collarbones and coverage of my shoulders and upper back. If you've got broad shoulders, you might want to choose extra-large.WARMING: The product insert calls for microwaving this for 90 seconds and for additional 10-second increments if needed. I obtained even heating by placing the folded wrap on a microwave-safe plate on the turntable of the microwave, and rearranging the wrap after the first minute.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C3HPM1R6P2GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYE7R0A#wasThisHelpful","R2C3HPM1R6P2GB","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our lab eats everything she should, and some things she shouldn't, so her happy acceptance of these dental chews did not surprise me.  What did, however, is her definite preference for these dental chews over the anti-plaque chews she normally receives.Every afternoon, she gets a treat to tide her over until dinner. A couple of times now, I've held out both treat packages and asked her to choose by touching her nose to the bag she wants. Each time, she's chosen these.For a big, adventurous dog, she has a tender tummy, so we are careful when introducing new items to her diet. I was a little concerned that she might have an issue with potato starch vs. the potato flour and rice flour that are the first two ingredients of her usual chews.However, pumpkin is the first ingredient in these chews, and our vet has suggested small servings of canned pumpkin after previous stomach upsets, so I cut one of these treats in half and watched her closely while she ate it and afterward. No apparent issues, and no sounds of gastrointestinal discomfort.Each bone-shaped treat has 80 kcal, on par with other dental-type treats; nutrition values are similar.

"The folks who designed this stainless-steel tumbler either enjoy hot beverages or spent time talking with people who do. Their mission was simple: Start with a hot beverage, keep it as warm as possible, and help the user avoid spills by providing an effective pushbutton seal.This travel mug performs well, keeping the last sip as warm as the first, even after the passage of an hour or more. Its shape is easy to hold, and even when full, the mug does not have a tendency to tip over.My favorite part of this mug, however, may well be the inner workings of the underside of the lid. A lever lets you swing much of the mechanics down and away, making it easier to clean the lid assembly thoroughly. This degree of access may be less of an issue for those who don't add dairy or sugar to their hot drinks, but until I started using this version of the Contigo mug, I confined my homemade cappuccinos to cups with flip-top spout covers.In assigning a rating, I acknowledge that this version of the Contigo line has a price premium. However, I factored in some less-than-happy moments with my thermal cups (such as relatively rapid cooling and spills) as well as the cost savings of preparing espresso drinks rather than buying them.

The tea was acceptable, but there was a lot of swirling to do during preparation, and putting the loose tea in and fishing the wet tea out was messy.The process is much simpler and tidier with this infuser. The flat-bottomed, cone-shaped infuser has plenty of room for your hot water to wash over the tea. Loading and unloading the infuser is simple. You can do this at home if you're not going to be steeping the tea immediately, because the infuser lid and base cover both mount securely, protecting the tea. (The same is true after you use it.)The resulting tea itself is excellent. If you like a particularly strong cup, there is plenty of room for a generous helping of leaves. And even with a more delicate tea like jasmine, the stainless-steel filter does not impart any taste or aftertaste.The only reason this filter does not earn a full five stars is that even with practice, I continue to have some difficulty with snapping the infuser's mounting arms into the lid. Removing the infuser can be even more challenging unless you have excellent grip strength.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKNNXZ29NHK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRVQ21S#wasThisHelpful","RBKNNXZ29NHK6","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am cautiously recommending these placemats. ""Recommending"" because the color gradation of warm straws and golds is beautiful, especially when set against a dark wood table. ""Cautiously"" because of some construction issues and the fact that the maintenance of these mats is more involved than their rustic appearance and the manufacturer's labeling of ""everyday"" would indicate.The range of colors in the taupe placemats I received was as pretty as I had hoped after viewing the color swatch on the Amazon product page. ""Taupe"" means grayish-brown, and these mats are much warmer in tone than that. Strands run from a light straw through to a matte midrange gold. Strands are woven together loosely enough to provide a rustic appearance, which boosts their appeal to me.If you sometimes set a table for eight or more, you might consider getting a set of the taupe and a contrasting set of the variegated ""nautical blue"" or ""olive green"" mats, and alternating them at place settings. That way you'd have two different sets for everyday use.Even before I washed these mats, I noticed a variation in width of an inch. The narrowest mat was 19 inches wide, while the mat next to it in the package was 20 inches. This variance may not matter to you, especially if you will be using these on a larger table. More concerning, however, are the top and bottom edges of the mat. These are the margins without the knotted self-fringe. The weave there is not always as true and tight as it is in the body of the mats. In addition, several threads along the edges were broken and another was frayed, which raises concerns for longevity, especially after several washings.In addition, there were several loose strands on the reverse. These can either be taken in by untying the knot, pulling up the slack in the thread, and then retying the knot, or tacking down the loop with needle and thread. Leaving these loops as-is invites snagging, which could damage the mat.As for cleaning, the care instructions are to wash in cold water and lay flat to dry. The fibers in the strands of the mat are dense, and drying took several hours, even though I used a mesh lay-flat ring that I normally use for sweaters. (I did not want to risk having them get funky and musty without airflow beneath them.) The mats did hold their shape, but if you're laundering four or all six mats, air-drying them may be an irritation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAE27D79Q7DHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WRI7QI#wasThisHelpful","RAE27D79Q7DHU","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With her outgoing personality and her wit, Paige Rawl could have been any extroverted teen with a bevy of friends. Unfortunately, she had something her peers didn't: HIV.And from the moment word of Paige's health status spread through her middle school, she was privy to two painful lessons that all too many children are taught: People can be shallow and unthinking. And the adults entrusted with your care at school can sometimes be more ignorant and cruel than your peers.Paige was fortunate in having a caring, involved mom; in having several strong friendships; and in having several refuges that adults ensured were safe spaces. However, even these supports might not have been sufficient if she hadn't also had an amazing inner well of strength. There is no excuse for bullying anywhere, and yet the fatalistic attitude toward its existence has allowed the culture of bullying to endure and to become institutionalized at way too many schools for far too many decades.Paige's story is one of tears, certainly. But it is also one of resilience, and choice, and perseverance. I cannot begin to imagine what her life's journey has felt like thus far, or what reserves she drew upon so that she could be a very public ambassador for people with a health status that has been stigmatized for far too long.As others have noted, the behavior of some of the people in this young woman's life was irresponsible and even cruel. For this reason, I cannot recommend Positive as a ""here you go"" book for younger teens, even though it is very well written. Instead, this is a book that a loved one should give to a younger teen for shared reading as part of a larger, hopefully ongoing conversation.Paige Rawl was stronger than any adolescent should ever have to be, and it is to her great credit that she is brave and compassionate enough to tell her story from the vantage point of nurturing and elevating a societal dialog that is long overdue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z66IWZ537ANQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062342517#wasThisHelpful","R1Z66IWZ537ANQ","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Literacy and the Common Core: Recipes for Action Sarah Tantillo provides both context and action items for those involved in K-12 education. Administrators, teachers, parents, and aspiring teachers naturally will gravitate to specific -- and likely different -- sections of the book. And while that's understandable, this book is most effective for the reader who explores it in its entirety.In fact, one of the strengths of this book is its value as a shared reference for people in the above four groups, who share the goal of ensuring students have access to quality education. Thus, although the background information Tantillo provides may be a refresher for educators and administrators, it's a good opportunity for recalibration.In addition to overall context, Tantillo addresses teachers' immediate needs with pedagogical principles and strategies, as well as with reproducibles on an enclosed disc. Educators who are especially time-starved can make do with skimming portions of the book over a couple of evenings or a weekend, and will be able to identify techniques and reproducibles they can bring into the classroom rapidly.However, these items don't drift in isolation, because Tantillo anchors them to the perennial goals of rigor and meaningful assessment of progress toward mastery. Such concepts are not abstractions but are firmly internalized by most educators, but absolutely need to be examined by parents and aspiring educators.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JFJ5KLGVC8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118839056#wasThisHelpful","R37JFJ5KLGVC8B","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With all the Bluetooth personal-size speakers on the market these days, it can be challenging to figure out which one will best meet your needs. Because of its portability and oversize sound, this little unit has all of the positives of the ""boom boxes"" some of us remember from our youth, with the added benefit of smaller dimensions and freedom from C batteries.Here's a targeted assessment of how the Bose has been performing.SOUND: This unit puts out a rich, clean, clear sound. Bass is present without being overwhelming; higher notes don't get tinny. When evaluating any speakers, I listen for how well they handle guitar and a cappella, because fuzziness and other issues will stand out. This little unit did not muddy the purity of the unaccompanied human voice. It also stood up to the subtle complexities of guitar -- in ballads, rock, and the music I love best, Hawaiian slack-key.PORTABILITY. The unit is small enough to tuck into a day pack or oversize purse. The internal battery holds a charge of up to 8 hours' playing time, which means you don't need to bring the provided power adapter (but if you do, it's in two compact parts, a USB cable and a slimline wall adapter with fold-flat prongs). The unit will simultaneously recharge and perform as a speaker. I was able to recharge a drained battery while playing music in about 70 minutes.EASE OF USE. Initial setup takes just a few minutes, and can be done while you are recharging the battery. The spoken instructions are easy to follow. Then it's a matter of getting your Bluetooth-enabled devices to recognize the speaker. Once this recognition process is complete, whenever the speaker is on, it will verbally identify any synched device that comes within range. And this is not a generic identification - the SoundLink uses the name you've assigned to each device. Toggling between devices is simple, too, just a matter of using the ""pause"" and ""play"" controls on your devices.APPEARANCE/DURABILITY: The case is smooth, with rounded corners. The one-piece top panel and two narrow vertical panels on the sides of the case are rubberized, with some flexibility. Control functions are printed on the surface of the top panel, and are pressure-sensitive, so there are no moving parts exposed. The narrow strips on the sides of the case give you a surer grip when lifting or moving the unit. The SoundLink and power supply are both well-machined. Overall, the unit seems sturdy and capable of withstanding daily use, including frequent movement and plugging and unplugging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDXKWR5G0WXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N32I2Q6#wasThisHelpful","R1BDXKWR5G0WXX","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A small footprint, a useful touchpad, duplex scanning and wireless connectivity are the highlights of this printer. Its printing capabilities are serviceable, and the provision for two kinds of black ink makes it versatile enough to meet the needs of hobbyists and crafters who want to print both photos and documents using a single device. In addition, those of us who still need a fax will appreciate the ability to ditch a standalone fax unit.Hobbyists and those who telecommute occasionally, or whose work doesn't require high-volume printing are likely to find that this device will meet their needs for scanning, faxing, and low-volume document printing, as well as periodic printing of scrapbook-quality photos.I put this unit through its paces using my MacBook Pro and secured internet connection and am focusing on interactions and output to help you compare this unit against other multifunction and ""small-in-one"" printers.SETUP: Allow yourself at least 45 uninterrupted minutes for hardware and software setup. You'll need about 15 minutes to get the device going (including a 7-minute initialization sequence that sounds much louder than the printer does in action). If you're configuring for a Mac, you will need to access the install packet online, because it's not on the supplied disk. My computer has an optical drive, so I simply inserted the supplied DVD and let it do the work of accessing. While the install packet was downloading, I scanned the QR on the setup sheet with my iPhone and captured the robust app. I liked that the additional items were opt-in rather than opt-out (temporarily select an item to read Epson's description of its functionality).Install for the configuration I selected took just under 15 minutes. I had no issues with running the installation wirelessly, but you may find the process simpler if you connect the printer to your computer. Be sure to save your old printer's USB cable or borrow one; this unit doesn't ship with that cable.SCANNING: The feeder and its duplexing capability may well be what set this unit apart for you. I've scanned documents and snapshots of varying sizes, paper quality and contrast, and have been pleased with the feeder and on-glass imaging. As part of its ""small in one"" footprint, though, be aware that the feeder assembly may not be as rugged as those you're used to in a larger office environment. The scanning itself goes fine, but you've got to be extra-careful truing-up the guides in the paper feeder or you'll get misaligned images. That's the tradeoff for having a lid assembly folds neatly for a streamlined appearance and to keep out dust between uses.PRINTING: Printing speed and quality have been within manufacturer specs thus far. I appreciate the convenience of printing images on the spot, but would not expect to do large runs or professional-caliber printing with this machine.SUPPLIES: Be aware that this printer requires 5 ink cartridges, including two types of black ink, one for photos and an oversize tank for non-photo printing. In addition, if you're replacing an older USB printer, be sure to hang onto your USB cable; chances are it will be compatible with your printer.STABILITY/STURDINESS: The unit's connectivity with my home network has been very stable, even after being shut off and powered back up, as well as after I've shut down and powered up my router. The feeder assembly, as mentioned above, is slightly delicate but workable. However, the supply trays are a frustration. While it's great that a device as compact as this has two supply trays, the guides within the trays and the trays themselves are finicky to configure and to insert properly in the printer. This is both an ongoing issue and a concern for durability down the road. Supply capacity also is small, which is understandable given the printer size and the two-tray versatility.SUPPORT: I received a persistent error message during the first stage of setup and needed to contact Epson. The tech-support person was thorough and knowledgeable, and helped solve the problem. However, I was disappointed that the only timely option for a non-functional printer was paying for a toll call. Before calling, I checked Epson's online resources for the error code and a FAQ setup for troubleshooting without luck.RATING: Thus far, performance is as promised. I am deducting a half-star because of the finicky nature of ensuring that documents stay aligned in the feeder, and that supplies stay aligned in their trays. However, I'm deducting another half-star for setup/support issues. for a printer at this price point, Epson really should be providing a printer cable so that the unit is definitely functional right out of the box. More importantly, it should provide a no-additional-cost means of access to support for units that fail initial setup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDWOYB2S9F7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV97KYS#wasThisHelpful","RBDWOYB2S9F7T","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That stubborn glob of natural peanut butter clinging to the inside wall of the jar just below the thread for the lids -- you know, the one that you can't quite reach with a teaspoon or an offset spatula? -- has officially met its match.This Oxo jar spatula easily and efficiently squeegees off peanut butter, raw honey, tomato paste and other food items that are clingy, sticky or viscous. Its sides taper to narrow, relatively rigid wedges, while the short, leading edge is more bendable, perfect for coaxing material out of the bottoms of jars and cans, where the walls of the container meet the base. The overall curvature is equally as functional in small-diameter cans such as tomato paste as it is in larger-diameter jars. The handle is easy to grip, and the amount of flex along the length is minimal.Although I would prefer that this tool be molded from a single piece of silicone, the seam is close enough to the top of the handle that food probably won't work its way in. Cleanup is simple, whether you wash the spatula by hand or place it in your dishwasher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPWASKMJ3E1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESCL0KA#wasThisHelpful","R2BPWASKMJ3E1Y","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Writing in an effortless voice is exceedingly hard work. Introducing multiple perspectives and storylines and motivating your readers to stick with you through convoluted passageways and high-altitude soaring adds several degrees of difficulty.And yet in this slender volume Eden Collinsworth has managed to draw together a primer on Western etiquette (complete with discourse on the etymology of the word), hiccups and triumphs of being an American abroad, and the joys and challenges of crafting a meaningful life for herself and her son.In less capable hands, these multiple story lines and perspectives would end up in a sorry, knotted mess, but Collinsworth is able to tease out interrelationships and heightened meaning, whether she's illustrating handshake protocol and personal space or detailing the faux pas of using a business card as a nail pick. (Hint: Don't do it. Ever. And when you are Asia-bound, always bring four times as many business cards as you think you will need.)I suspect that Collinsworth's seemingly breezy style may initially be off-putting for some; my advice would be to withhold judgment until you've reached at least the halfway point of this book. This should provide you with enough of a sense of her take on things that are familiar to you to evaluate how you'll perceive what she offers about the unfamiliar.For example, while I can't vouch for all of the China nuggets she shares, enough of the components matched my knowledge and experience to make me comfortable with the bedrock of her message. Incidentally, the Xian farmer she mentions? I have his autograph, too, as well as countless photos of the terra cotta warriors, both from that trip and successive visits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ACBEBW7CDTW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538693#wasThisHelpful","R2ACBEBW7CDTW5","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Food critics praise chefs who develop dishes that are a symphony of flavors and textures in the mouth. Unfortunately, rather than being satisfying, the combination of sensations provided by these low-carb bars is unpleasant. Nuts and other dry ingredients are bound into the shape of a pressed bar by a treacly, overly sweet adhesive.  Somehow, despite these ""toffee"" ribbons, the combination is powdery and dry as you chew.I had hoped to tuck these in a desk drawer as a tasty, nutritious snack on marathon days, but can't get past the taste and texture. While there is some nutrition in these compact bars, I would rather make a snack out of ingredients that are closer to their natural state, such as a quarter-cup of nuts augmented by a handful of dried fruit. Even if the latter weren't quite as balanced as the bars, the snack would be tasty, filling and moderately nutritious.My personal rating would be 1 star, but you may find the flavor and texture less bothersome, so I've raised this a star.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3VBCO4JJ9EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3HFZD2#wasThisHelpful","R2A3VBCO4JJ9EI","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our kitty overcame two cancers, one involving serious surgery. Sadly, her third cancer was untreatable. Despite her continued spunk and interest in us and the world, all that remained after the last diagnosis was to make her final days happy ones.Our vet administered an antibiotic injection for secondary infections, briefed me on end-stage details, and suggested that I head to Chinatown for some Yunnan Baiyao capsules. The herbalist helped convert the dosage from capsules to powder, and instructed me to mix the powder thoroughly in with wet food. He said that people give the powder to dogs, cats, and even horses.Our cat never refused the amended food, and her bouts of bleeding stopped for more than a week. When they resumed, they were relatively mild and stopped quickly, rather than severe, rush-to-the-vet events.When we began the Yunnan, we expected that her remaining time with us would be measured in days; she ended up being comfortable and stable for two additional months. I'm grateful that we were able to ease her journey in a manner that she didn't seem to notice.~~~Packaging notes: Each glass bottle is sealed with a tamper-proof seal inside the lid and has a five-year effective period between production and expiration dates. Under the seal and resting atop the padding that keeps the powder compacted is a bead the size of a small BB that you are to give in cases of heavy bleeding; so far we have not needed them, and have been collecting them just in case.

"Vornado is known for the ability of its whole-room air circulators to take the edge off summertime heat and humidity, and this approach translates well to warming up chilly spaces during cooler months.This compact device quietly warms smaller rooms, raising the temperature within minutes. Following the instructions, I placed the unit on the floor near an electrical outlet in my home office, turned the dial to the highest setting and toggled the three-way switch to high, as well. With the door closed, within 10 minutes, the room was noticeably warmer. Temperature gain was pretty even -- as the product literature promises, there were no noticeable hot or cold spots in the room.Once the temperature was close to the desired level, I decreased fan speed and dialed back the temperature setting. The ambient temperature remained stable, and the sounds of operation decreased even more.I also tested the unit in a larger bedroom with mixed results. While it did raise the temperature of the room somewhat, the rate of climb was slower than in the smaller room. Temperature increase also plateaued before reaching the feel of the temperature in the smaller room. The unit had little effect in our high-ceilinged open-plan living room.If you are wondering about the relatively vague characterization of temperatures, it is because this unit's multi-position thermostat does not indicate target temperatures. While the lack of measurement may well be a drawback to you, it was not an issue for me, as I was gauging relative comfort, not specific temperatures.This unit is compact enough to fit on the top shelf of a bedroom closet for storage during warmer months, and light enough to reposition or move from room to room as needed. The price point and size of this unit also make it worth considering for college students, especially if they are living in dormitories with inefficient heating and rules against small appliances that draw a lot of power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YHOP9DZW3UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB4BQ0G#wasThisHelpful","R9YHOP9DZW3UU","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always thought of washlets as slightly amusing and somewhat self-indulgent - until shivering through a wintertime business trip to Japan. Without being cringingly specific, a washlet can help with cleanliness and comfort.Toto has a line of washlet seats with a variety of features. I chose this one based on the features and ease of installation -- as well as the fact that I have seen this exact model in a number of places in Japan, including upscale hotels and restaurants. Additionally, I noticed that the same washlets were in place and still fully functional on repeat visits months apart. My thought was that if a particular washlet was specified for commercial installations and actually withstood that volume of use, it would be something that would perform well in a home, and be relatively easy to clean and maintain, as well. We've had our washlets for about a year and have found them to be dependable and easy to clean.Installation was simple; all the needed hoses and fasteners were included. Installing the first seat took me about 20 minutes, only because I didn't want to rush the process. I would suggest mounting the included remote on the wall, above your toilet-paper dispenser. Your only challenge may be providing an electrical outlet. If you don't already have an outlet, please resist the instinct to run an extension cord, moreso for your safety than aesthetics. If you are adding an outlet, position it slightly off-center and below the tank of the toilet.As for the toilet, check the Toto website for a list of compatible toilets. Amazon also stocks these, but depending on your location and your level of comfort with pulling a toilet, you may prefer to engage a plumber for this portion of the project. He or she may have ordering resources for the toilet, and shifting that responsibility will spare you from dealing with delays if there are any defects in or damages to the toilet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Y9HVI0ZA432/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011YSEUC#wasThisHelpful","R8Y9HVI0ZA432","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bathing the Lion very nearly succeeds in defying description, especially for a literal, linear soul like me. I refuse to spoil the story for you by parsing it; instead, I'll focus on how unusual an experience reading this book can be.Its characters and story arc resist characterization and pigeonholing. Rather, reading this book is a matter of immersion, a sense that you are passing through an intangible membrane from the here and today of your life to a place that is somewhat reassuringly recognizable -- except that it isn't, really.There's the subtle sense of otherness that you get sometimes when you're on autopilot in a different city. Comfortable and recognizable ... except for the periodic, slightly unsettling jerks that remind you that this place is not home, it is other, and while you can pass the time there, it isn't your real existence. And see? The earlier part of this paragraph is just one example of the author's skill at creating subtle moments of disequilibrium. For me, this resulted in an insistent need to seek patterns and construct comprehension. Your elemental response may well be different, but I suspect one will exist, nonetheless.As I was reading, I kept thinking about a fascinating component of an interactive museum exhibit on the human brain I took in several weeks ago. This portion of the exhibit involved sitting next to a companion on a squashy sofa, donning headphones and giving yourself over to a series of video clips on a monitor. Afterward, a docent asked each of us to describe what we'd seen and what the message was. After hearing both descriptions, which were wildly divergent, he volunteered that there are no wrong answers, just different ones, and that thus far no two answers he'd heard had been alike. I suspect that this singularity of interpretation may well prove to be the case with this wonderful, perplexing, evocative, beautifully written book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R826FXSE84P9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250048265#wasThisHelpful","R826FXSE84P9Y","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are upgrading your current home or building a new one, you probably recognize Arizona Tile from your visits to design showrooms and tile wholesalers. Those folks stock and recommend it because it's quality stuff -- durable, attractive, and relatively easy to work with.Thus, I was extremely happy to find several styles of this tile on Amazon, including my favorite, at a substantial savings. The professional who installed this tile in our bathroom said that even when mosaic tile is supplied on mesh backing, it can be challenging to work with. Apparently, it is not uncommon for some brands to supply sheets with mis-positioned tiles, which the person in the field must manually adjust, at the risk of causing a slight rise or bump in the installation. Ditto with mosaic pieces that have chips or other imperfections.On the recommendation of the installer, we chose Laticrete grout in a neutral color, and the finished bathroom literally sparkles. Since then, I've done a craft project using the mosaic. I found the mesh backing to be substantial enough to position without a problem, and yet simple to cut as needed. If you're tackling this as a do-it-yourself project, my major caution to you would be to make sure you smooth out the thinset mortar, because if you leave the usual ridges, those can show through behind the more translucent pieces of mosaic.A note about the product photo: The shade and tone of the mosaic pieces is pretty accurate, but the photo does not convey the warm glow of the tile or the shiny surface of the glossy tile pieces of the mosaic. This blend coordinates nicely with warm, off-white neutral field tile.

"In the afterword to this absolutely gripping book, author Michael Ross describes several of the coincidences that brought him to the largely forgotten story of the kidnapping of a New Orleans toddler in June 1870 that caught the attention of a nation, as did the subsequent manhunt and trial.Ross was reading the column-inches of New Orleans newspapers published in 1870 in search of coverage about attempts to obstruct postwar Reconstruction efforts when he was hooked by the mention of police officers arresting and questioning practitioners of voodoo.It is our good fortune that Ross is such a thorough researcher, and that he didn't simply gather some notes on what became known as the Digby case and set them aside for some indeterminate future follow-up.Instead, Ross combed contemporaneous newspapers and conducted other research, and produced what he calls a micro-history. It is that, of course, and by dint of the generous footnotes and careful delineation of the New Orleans of 1870, obviously an academically sound tracing of the events of the case, as well as the historical, economic, societal, and political factors that contributed to making these events possible only at that particular time and place.""The Great New Orleans Kidnapping Case"" is gripping, captivating, and evocative of a time none of us will ever know. Somehow, though, Ross has managed to stitch  ephemera and minutia onto a solid, supportive backing of context. These are real people, largely forgotten by succeeding generations, who occupied headlines around the country for a brief moment in time.Indeed, as Ross points out, fellow author William Faulkner's words about another time and place are equally fitting for New Orleans: ""The past is never dead. It's not even past."" This book earns my highest recommendation, and is deserving of all the superlatives it is sure to receive when it is released this fall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZEKBC8P96TT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199778809#wasThisHelpful","R31ZEKBC8P96TT","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kaui Hart Hemmings has a knack for crafting characters with flaws that hamper their lives, without quite breaking them. There's no saccharine in her writing - even sympathetic characters have a bit of ""bite,"" and the more irritating individuals have at least one redeeming quality.Being from Hawaii and having found grains of home truths in her earlier book, ""The Descendants,"" I wondered what insights Hemmings might unearth and portray about the scenic mountain town of Breckenridge, Colorado. While the town and surroundings play a minor role, my sense was they are rendered more generically than places in Hawaii were, unless there are subtleties apparent mainly to those from the area or very familiar with it.Overall, premise and pacing are solid, and Hemmings works to illuminate her characters slowly, adding depth as the story progresses, so that readers modify their perceptions as events unfold. That said, characters are not as finely drawn as they could be, so readers are likely to be engaged in this bittersweet story, rather than immersed in it.Similarly, the final section is adequate, and parts of it are touching, but Hemmings does not capitalize on the full potential of the characters and the interlacing of their lives. Additionally, the pacing seems rushed (rather than purposefully accelerated) and the conclusion a bit abrupt, especially when compared with the relatively leisurely pace of the rest of the book.In sum, this is a book with a thought-provoking and heartbreaking premise, peopled by sympathetic, largely credible characters. However, it does not make the most of its possibilities, and thus earns 3.5 stars, which I have rounded up to 4.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLXRWTOYOP55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476725799#wasThisHelpful","R1GLXRWTOYOP55","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine being able to remember everything perfectly. Time, date, place, content. Exactly. That's the bittersweet gift Brenna Spector developed after the disappearance of her older sister. It is an ability that helps Spector in her ""day job"" as detective, but causes a range of emotions in her personal life, from amusing to useful to incredibly painful.Stay With Me is Alison Gaylin's third novel featuring Spector (and this unusual but factual ability). Although you could possibly read this story as a standalone book, its impact will be greatly heightened for you if you read the first two books in the series. You wouldn't be totally adrift if you started here, but you would miss the full impact of the chills and poignancy without the context of the earlier books. I found the absence of rehashing of earlier elements in the series arc to be a positive but if you start here, that positive becomes a negative.Gaylin has an understated way of heightening tension by word choice and pacing, and her mainstay characters are credible and appealing. Spector herself is someone you root for, even as you worry with her about the fate of her missing daughter, and puzzle over the heartbreaking disappearance of her sister and busy yourself trying to avoid drawing parallels.Without spoiling this book for you, Gaylin does tie together some threads and snip some loose ends, as you would hope with an ongoing series. While this is an enjoyable read, I did not find it as absolutely captivating as the first in the series. Thus, this earns a solid four stars from me, as opposed to the five I gave And She Was.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7HB16NKY8ORM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006187826X#wasThisHelpful","R7HB16NKY8ORM","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cute, classy labels with their scalloped edges lend themselves to a variety of uses -- pantry organization, jar toppers for preserves or dried mixes you create for gifts, and application to larger circle in a contrasting color for a tag -- or even a holiday ornament.If you've got page-design software, you can build a template, but the simpler route is to go to the Avery website, provide the product number, and build your templates on the spot. Be sure to do a test-run on a sheet of paper to check that your designs will be centered vertically and horizontally on the labels, and that you like how your designs appear ""in print"" before using your label sheets.The labels themselves are sturdy and pleasant to the touch, and the scalloped edges are cleanly cut. Especially if you are producing a detailed design with multiple colors, consider printing those labels on a color laser printer to minimize the risk of ink bleed during printing and rub-off afterward.One workaround if you are not able to save your template as a PDF is to print it as best you can, and then scan that image and take the file and your labels to a copy shop.

"The philosophy behind Common Core standards can be polarizing, and even educators who support its premise may well feel challenged by ways to make the Common Core challenging and yet achievable for both their students and themselves.This slender workbook provides immediate suggestions and materials to help teachers teach critical-literacy skills across multiple content areas. The author, Katherine McKnight, touches on learning theory, but her focus is on providing tools that teachers can tailor to their students' specific needs and interests.Adolescents are savvy. They can sniff out a canned worksheet within moments of it hitting their desks. Thus, these are not photocopier-ready documents, but images with suggestion and thought bubbles -- homework for the teacher, as it were. It is evident that care and planning went into developing as streamlined a process as possible for teachers, who are perennially time-starved, and who want to save the majority of their cognitive power for planning rigorous, targeted course work, and for conducting useful assessments in the moment and in quiet hours spent reviewing students' work.While this book may be most immediately and visibly helpful to teachers who are in their first few years of teaching, seasoned educators also will find thoughts and tools to elevate their practice.In addition, at this price point, administrators should consider providing lending copies of this to their faculty, and teacher-certification programs should add this to the required-purchase list for content-area pedagogy classes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZUDMHHLRTQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118710150#wasThisHelpful","RRZUDMHHLRTQ6","A3KGLXW3EYDTUH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KGLXW3EYDTUH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The human brain is a wondrous organism, capable of building virtual compartments in which to store knowledge, and fashioning methods of connecting disparate specks of information and stitching them together into concrete and abstract thought.Each day, we are bombarded with many more impressions -- sights, sounds, smells, concepts, theories, and ""facts"" -- than we can possibly organize, store, and retrieve. And yet our brains keep amassing data and tagging it so that we can build comprehension and access details (from memories to factoids) months and years later.In this approachable and thought-provoking book, Benedict Carey prompts us to think about thinking and learning. He provides an array of data points and then takes a step back to enable us to work through the ideas at our own pace and inclination.No doubt his low-key metacognitive approach will resonate to varying degrees with different readers, and that is exactly as it should be. I am reflective and linear in my thinking, so for me this book was a series of ""aha""s, ""ha!""s, and ""I need to think some more about that""s. You may well feel differently.Thus, my rating is five solid stars, but I recognize that those with specialized knowledge of neuroscience and/or psychology may find this relatively elementary, and other sincere readers may just not like it.

"I am a little ambivalent about ROMEO AND JULIET.  In many ways it is a wonderful play, but to me it falls short of being a great play.  Nevertheless, it is, with good reason, firmly ensconced in our literary heritage for being, to quote Harold Bloom, ""the largest and most persuasive celebration of romantic love in Western literature.""ROMEO AND JULIET was written about the same time as, and perhaps simultaneous with, ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"".  In a way, the two plays are the opposite sides of the same coin.  In ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", all four love pairings experience turbulence, but then, at play's end, everything and everyone magically end up happy and wonderful.  In ROMEO AND JULIET, the title characters fall in love with one another at first sight and are married, but then things go horribly and tragically wrong.It is a brilliantly crafted play, even for Shakespeare.  It has three marvelous, ""larger-than-life"" characters:  Mercutio (Romeo's friend), Juliet's Nurse, and Juliet herself, not yet fourteen but with a wit and strength of character that exceed her apparent beauty.  What, then, about Romeo?  I find him rash, petulant, and histrionic.  In a fit of pique, Juliet's father Capulet refers to her as ""a wretched puling fool, a whining maumet"", words that in truth fit Romeo much more aptly.  He is the one who acts like a fourteen-year-old.I have other vague dissatisfactions concerning the play.  On the level of plot, it is rather like a Gothic soap opera.  There is a surfeit, to use Capulet's phrase, of ""chopped logic.""  Capulet himself seems to embody a huge contradiction in character, on the one hand the open-minded, equable host who doesn't mind that the rival Montagues attend his party, and on the other the tyrannical ogre who insists that Juliet marry Paris or else be disowned.  Then there is the awkward wrapping up at the end of the play (Friar Laurence's summary in particular strikes me as unnecessary).  In other words, I suppose (presumptuously), the play could have benefited from an additional round of polishing by Shakespeare.Still, there is Juliet's love for Romeo -- and, to a slightly less sublime degree, Romeo's for Juliet.  The epitome of transcendent romantic love is expressed by Juliet:""My bounty is as boundless as the sea,My love as deep:  The more I give to theeThe more I have, for both are infinite.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J8BG44UVG5FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4H4E12#wasThisHelpful","R2J8BG44UVG5FL","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A week ago I read Tom McGuane's latest book of short stories, ""Crow Fair"".  His first book of short stories was TO SKIN A CAT, published in 1986.  Although it has long been in my library, I never got around to reading it.  I thought it might be interesting to do so and compare McGuane as a short story writer over three decades, from TO SKIN A CAT to ""Crow Fair"".The two books share a strong family resemblance.  I would say that the McGuane of ""Crow Fair"" is a slightly better writer, with a smoother writing style.  But I prefer the stories in TO SKIN A CAT, by a whisker -- by a wider margin if you toss out the one real clunker.  Four of the stories are excellent, better than anything in ""Crow Fair"", in my opinion.  The clunker is the title story, which also is the longest; it was so raunchy and unpromising that I gave up on it about one quarter of the way into it.  (As was the case with using ""Crow Fair"" for the title of the most recent collection, I wondered why McGuane -- or his publisher -- used ""To Skin a Cat"" as the title story.)Seven of the thirteen stories are set in Montana, two in the South, and two in Ohio (or thereabouts).  In many of the stories, one of the main characters is on a tear, rebelling against conventionality and seemingly hell-bent on offending everyone around.  This, of course, is not at all uncommon in McGuane's fiction.  Three of the stories feature bird dogs, including the best one, ""Flight"".  It is one of the few stories in which the main character is not fighting the life circumstances he finds himself in; he is, however, disconcerted by the prospect of death, which he is reminded of when he learns that his close friend from youth has a terminal illness:  ""We've all got to go, I thought.  It's like waiting for an alarm to go off, when it's too dark to read the dial.""In TO SKIN A CAT, as usual, McGuane is entertaining.  He is especially good at exposing, ruefully and comically, some of the myths of America, particularly those of Montana and the West.  But he rarely shows much compassion for his characters, and he rarely digs very far below the surface.  When, occasionally, he does -- as in ""The Millionaire"" or in ""Flight"" -- he can be excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOA31T0PIZF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525244603#wasThisHelpful","R2MOA31T0PIZF1","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been fascinated with Siena since taking a college course about the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  Then, about twenty years ago, I was fortunate enough to spend a week in and around Siena; it was a high point of my rather limited experiences as a world traveller.  I doubt that I will return, although I would love to.  Given that background, I probably was much more predisposed to like SIENA by Jane Tylus than the average general reader.  Having read it, I doubt that it will persuade people unfamiliar with the city that it is indeed one of the more special and singular cities on earth.  However, for those who already are enamored with Siena, or are going there for an extended visit, the book should not be missed.Jane Tylus is a professor of Italian studies and comparative literature at New York University.  She spent considerable time in Siena over the years.  Her book is a learned and literate -- and loving -- survey of Siena and many of the sites, people, and cultural artifacts that make it special.  (The center of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.)  She gives some attention to the contrade, or neighborhoods of Siena, and to the Palio, the famous horse race around the Piazza del Campo held twice each summer.  She also discusses some of the more famous buildings of the city -- for example, the Duomo, the Palazzo Pubblico, and the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala (about 1,000 years old and one of the world's oldest hospitals).  But she focuses more on the past of Siena, especially its cultural past.  Among the famous Sienese who figure prominently in her account are Saint Catherine (her preserved though shriveled head can be seen in a side chapel of San Domenico; her body is interred in Rome) and Aeneas Silvia Piccolomini, better known as Pope Pius II.The book does not really serve well as a travel guide to Siena.  Nor, as a history, is it comprehensive.  (For example, relatively scant attention is given to the Black Death plague of 1348, which reduced the population of Siena by about two-thirds.)  Instead, the book seems to cover what most interests Jane Tylus.  Moreover, she is not systematic in her presentation.  Rather, her text meanders from topic to topic, returning again and again to some while leaving others mentioned only once.  In noting these points, I am not being critical; Tylus's approach is an idiosyncratic but ultimately charming one.SIENA is a handsome book.  It is quite well-written, with a flowing style that I found reminiscent of Ingrid D. Rowland (whom Tylus quotes).  Sometimes, however, the prose began to wash over me and lull me into a doze, a phenomenon, by the way, I also have experienced reading Rowland.  The book includes thirty-five illustrations, mostly Sienese works of art and most in color.  There also are three maps, but I would have appreciated more detailed maps on which one could more readily locate all sites discussed in the text.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTGQK70VTTRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022620782X#wasThisHelpful","R2QTGQK70VTTRA","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently my eldest son and I had a lively discussion about what were the five most significant battles of the twentieth century -- not necessarily the biggest or bloodiest, but the ones that most influenced the course of history.  Our agreed final list, in chronological order:  Verdun, Midway, Stalingrad, the Allied invasion of Normandy (D-Day), and Dien Bien Phu.  Although written nearly fifty years ago, HELL IN A VERY SMALL PLACE remains the classic account (at least in English) of the last of those landmark battles.The French landed in force in the remote valley of Dien Bien Phu, in northwest Vietnam about thirteen miles from Laos, on November 20, 1953.  Almost immediately Viet-Minh forces began surrounding them.  The Viet-Minh began their assault of DBP with a massive artillery bombardment on March 13, 1954.  For the next fifty-six days the Viet-Minh besieged the French strongpoints, inexorably reducing them, until May 7, 1954, when the last remaining French installations were overrun.  With their defeat at DBP, the French abandoned Indochina, leaving it to the Vietnamese themselves and the Americans to stave off nationalistic communism.When I first learned about DBP, my initial question was, Why there?  What was so important about that remote village and valley?  As Bernard Fall writes, the French stationed themselves there hoping to draw the Viet-Minh into a set-piece battle, on the belief that that would be the best way in the circumstances to destroy a large part of the Viet-Minh army as rapidly as possible.  It was, as Fall puts it, ""an incredible gamble.""  General Vo Nguyen Giap called the French ""all-in"" bet and won.  And the world order of first-tier powers versus all the rest was shaken to its foundations, an earthquake that continues rumbling.Fall's account is a detailed one, replete with military information such as the Orders of Battle.  A separate sub-section of one to ten pages is dedicated to events of each of the fifty-six days of the siege.  But Fall writes so well, and intersperses his narrative with sufficient anecdotes, that by and large he avoids tedium.  In addition, he lucidly covers larger issues, both those military and strategic in nature within the French command and those international in scope, including the ambivalent involvement of the United States.  I was not looking for so much detail, and ideally I would have preferred an intelligently abridged version of the book, but looking back I don't begrudge being exposed to so much information because Fall presents it so very well.Among the points and highlights of the book:  the schism between the overall French commander in Indochina, Henri Navarre, and his immediate subordinate Ren Cogny; the gross, and fatal, underestimation by the French of Viet-Minh capabilities, especially those that were logistical in nature (the Viet-Minh were able to supply their siege by means of 20,000 coolies over 500 miles of jungle road); the gross inadequacy of French fortifications; critical French deficiencies in the air, both airborne firepower and air transport for delivering reinforcements and supplies; the immense problems of sheltering and treating the wounded; how the latter half of the battle was fought during the monsoon season and thus the French positions were waterlogged; and how many of the French kept going with the help of benzedrine.Two things relating to the Americans particularly registered.  As the French position at DBP became desperate and the Americans engaged in an internal debate about whether to intervene in force, some proposed dropping atomic bombs around DBP.  One of those was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who said to the French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, ""And if we gave you two atomic bombs to save Dien Bien Phu?""  More generally, Dulles is revealed, once again, to have been both thuggish and highly disingenuous in his diplomacy.But what's most impressive is the courage and tenacity displayed by both the Viet-Minh and many of the French Union forces (which, in addition to Frenchmen, included Vietnamese, Algerians, Moroccans, and Foreign Legion soldiers drawn from Germany, eastern Europe, and elsewhere).  At one point in the battle, a Viet-Minh officer gathered a bunch of dazed Algerian soldiers and directed them, as prisoners, to the rear; suddenly the Algerians stopped as they were blocked by the body of a Viet-Minh rifleman draped over barbed wire with his intestines hanging out; the Viet-Minh officer motioned the Algerians to proceed, saying, ""You can step on him.  He has done his duty for the People's Army.""Only one aspect of the book bothers me, based on what I otherwise know.  Fall writes as if there were a direct causal link between, on the one hand, Dien Bien Phu and the victory of the Viet-Minh, and, on the other, events in Algeria from November 1954 to March 1962.  Fall implies (a) that the Algerians would not have rebelled without the example of the Indochina war, and (b) that right-wing French military officers acted as they did in Algeria, including their formation of the OAS, due to the Maoist/Communist lessons on ""mass terror"" they had absorbed in Indochina.  I am skeptical about both implications.Still, HELL IN A VERY SMALL PLACE is an excellent and very instructive hybrid of journalism and history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OSXIS8FQT2PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030681157X#wasThisHelpful","R3OSXIS8FQT2PS","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say that Thomas McGuane produces great literature, but with CROW FAIR I now have read nine of his books over the years.  That's more than I have read of William Faulkner.  So there clearly is something to McGuane.  Here's what I think his appeal is, at least for me:  He is an excellent writer; there is plenty of dead-pan humor; his tales are always a little askew, which makes them more entertaining; there are plenty of gimlet-eyed observations about contemporary America (at least, contemporary white America); and he never demands much from the reader.  In a way, he is like Elmore Leonard.CROW FAIR is McGuane's third collection of short stories -- here, seventeen of them.  Most of the stories are set in Montana.  All feature characters who are social misfits of one stamp or another; they do not ""fit in"".  They might not all be ""losers"", but none are winners.  Some are angry about it while others are merely rueful.  For almost everyone, life has not worked out they way they planned or desired.  There are few (if any) stable, enduring marriages.Yet there is no real sense of tragedy.  (The closest is ""Hubcaps"", which features a mentally handicapped kid, Ben.  But ""Hubcaps"" is more bleak than tragic.  It also is anomalous in that it is set in Wisconsin.)  For McGuane, alienation and loneliness, failed relationships, the hollowness of the American Dream (or, the Montana Dream) -- all that is simply Life As It Is, worthy of wry or caustic wit but not tragedy.None of the stories in CROW FAIR take your breath away.  Most are quite good.  They all are told with a brisk pace.  Of the nine McGuane books that I have read, CROW FAIR slots somewhere in the upper middle of the pack.  Which means that even at age seventy-five there has been no discernible drop in McGuane's writing or storytelling abilities.  It also means that if he comes out with yet another book, I probably will buy and read it, even though I cannot satisfactorily articulate his appeal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16555ZYNR7UOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350198#wasThisHelpful","R16555ZYNR7UOT","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in the midst of reading through all of Shakespeare's plays, something that I feel is incumbent on me in order to be moderately familiar with my literary heritage.  The last time I read any Shakespeare (about six of the plays) was in high school.  I liked some, but not others, especially not A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.  I thought it rather silly.  A half century later I can recognize its wit and charm, its genius even, but I still think it rather silly.  It probably is the fairies.In A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, Shakespeare ingeniously weaves together four story strands.  The first involves the upcoming marriage of Theseus, Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons; there is a small hiccup in their troth (""the course of true love never did run smooth"") before their wedding is celebrated at play's end.  Second, there is the fairyland counterpart to this royal coupling -- a tiff between Oberon and Titania, King and Queen of the Fairies.  At the most fractious point of their quarrel, Oberon, through the offices of his puck (or sprite) Robin Goodfellow and the application of a magical love-juice, makes Titania fall for a jackass.  That hairy beast is actually the costumed weaver Bottom, who is the leading character of the third strand (and arguably the entire play); Bottom is one of six workmen who devise, rehearse, and ultimately perform a masque as entertainment for the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta.  Finally, there are the shifting romances involving two couples of nobility, one being Lysander and Hermia, the other Demetrius and Helena.  Both Lysander and Demetrius begin the play in love with Hermia, but when given Oberon's magical love-juice they transfer their affections to Helena, and a final dose of magic is needed to sort everything out for the play's ending.It is quite an achievement; I would not quibble with anyone calling it a tour de force.  Especially engaging, and funny, is the performance of the masque by Bottom and pals at play's end.  There is some sublime poetry, the best I have encountered so far in my traversal of the plays.  Indeed, it is the poetry embodied within the play that to my mind most commends A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM as something for high schoolers to read.  But I have never been very receptive to fairies and magic, and I sympathize with Hippolyta when she remarks, in the midst of watching the farce performed by the mechanicsmen-qua-actors, ""This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z93OP43MHAHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199535868#wasThisHelpful","R2Z93OP43MHAHX","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pikin Slee is a village deep within the rainforest of Suriname (formerly known as Dutch Guyana).  Most of its inhabitants are descendants of Maroons, who escaped slavery on Dutch plantations in the eighteenth century.  Access to Pikin Slee is via a three-hour canoe trip up the Upper Suriname River.  Thus, the village and its people are rather isolated from the world at large.Viviane Sassen is a Dutch artist/photographer.  This book of photographs represents my first exposure to her work.  It is very arresting and captivating.  The photographs tend towards minimalistic abstractions, but usually there is enough context to make some sort of sense of them.  The subjects fall into three categories:  people (almost all of whom have jet-black skin), nature (for example, the river or palm fronds), and everyday objects (such as planks, plastic buckets, or a satellite dish).PIKIN SLEE contains about ninety-five photographs.  About two-thirds of them are black-and-white.  In some of the color photographs, black nonetheless dominates and one has to look a second time to realize that it is indeed a color photograph; in others there are shockingly bright splashes of color.  My four favorite photographs -- four photographs of which I would love to own a print -- are in color, although they probably would not be as outstanding were not the majority of the book's photographs black-and-white.In this regard, it is worth quoting a paragraph from the brief afterword by Viviane Sassen:  ""This project is an exploration of the beauty of the everyday, an investigation of the sculptural qualities of the ordinary.  As I longed for a simpler kind of photography, I decided not to stage as many images as I have in the past, and to work mainly in black and white.  As if to re-set the eye: back to the basics.""For me, PIKIN SLEE is a model book of photography.  The photographs themselves seem to be of exemplary quality and the reproductions are as fine as I could ask for.  Equally significant, text is kept to a bare minimum.  The photographs are presented without captions on unnumbered pages.  Hence, you are left alone with the image.  There is a six-page ""index"" of sorts at the back of the book where postage-stamp sized reproductions of the photographs are accompanied by minimalistic names (such as ""Rorschach"", ""Cassava"", ""Patina"", and ""Giallo"").  And then there is Sassen's one-page, three-paragraph afterword.  How welcome it is to be presented with just the images, without the pretentious or portentous intermediation of a fine-arts expert.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCL3PEUPEJX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3791349538#wasThisHelpful","R1BCL3PEUPEJX1","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Only once have I been to a baseball game at Dodgers Stadium in Chvez Ravine.  I don't recall anything about the game, but I remember well the stadium, the perfect summer evening, and the seemingly Edenic setting.  This wonderful book is about the Mexican communities of Chvez Ravine that were displaced in the name of progress -- which turned out to be Dodger Stadium.Chvez Ravine is near central Los Angeles.  The Pasadena freeway runs next to it and from its heights City Hall is visible in the intermediate distance.  In the first half of the twentieth century, however, it was not prime real estate due to its precipitously rugged topography.  Its 400 acres became the site of the houses and shacks of Mexican-Americans, some of whom were descendants of folks who had fled the Mexican Revolution.  They developed three poor albeit close-knit communities:  La Loma, Bishop, and Palo Verde.  In 1946, the City of Los Angeles Planning Commission designated Chvez Ravine a ""blighted area"", and in 1950 the residents of Chvez Ravine were suddenly told that they all had to move.  Initially the purported plan was to build low-income public housing there, but in the end 350 acres of Chvez Ravine, bulldozed of houses and re-graded with modern earthmoving equipment, was used as bait to persuade Walter O'Malley to move the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles.  The ""chamber of commerce"" story was that a baseball palace now sat on what had been a wasteland.  (For an angry former resident's rebuttal to that story -- which was promulgated by, among others, famed Dodgers announcer Vince Scully -- see the comment to this review.)Chvez Ravine in the late 1940s was a very picturesque area, and it attracted a number of painters and photographers.  One was Don Normark, who took many black-and-white photographs of Chvez Ravine and its people in early 1949.  Nearly fifty years later, Normark began showing his old photographs to small gatherings of displaced residents.  (They had even formed a group called the Los Desterrados, the Uprooted, which met once a year at Elysian Park, overlooking their former homes.)  CHVEZ RAVINE, 1949 combines about eighty of Normark's photographs with the comments and recollections of these former residents.It is a lovely and poignant book.  Most of the residents look back on the demolished neighborhoods fondly, despite their poverty and hardscrabble existence.  The comment of Sally Anchondo is typical:  ""I would love for my grandkids to grow up someplace like that.  Everybody knew everybody and it was beautiful.""  (Curiously, more women seem to have fond memories than do men.)  Don Normark's photographs capture well the people, their spirit and dignity, and the nature of their lives in Chvez Ravine.  CHVEZ RAVINE, 1949 is more instructive than a score of sociology books.  At the same time, it is an excellent documentary of a time and a sort of civic spirit not that long ago, which, I suspect, is irretrievably gone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28P2FZF7E0IPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811840573#wasThisHelpful","R28P2FZF7E0IPI","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having recently read a very evocative novel of Singapore circa 1941, ""The Singapore Grip"" by J.G. Farrell, I thought this would be a good follow-up.  It is about Malaya in the years after World War II, especially the Communist insurgency, or ""The Emergency"" as it was locally known.  (The British called it an ""emergency"" because Lloyd's of London insurance would have been cancelled had it been deemed a ""war"" or ""civil war"".)  The novel also deals with the Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1941 to 1945.The narrator is Teoh Yun Ling, a Straits Chinese woman in her mid-sixties.  She is recounting the story of her life from the perspective of 1987.  She and her sister, as young women, were imprisoned for three years in a Japanese labor camp; she was horribly abused and two of her fingers were chopped off, while her sister was one of the ""comfort women"" for the Japanese soldiers; Teoh Yun Ling was the only inmate of the camp to survive.  After the war, she worked as a lawyer, helping prosecute Japanese in war crimes proceedings and then prosecuting Communist Terrorists (CTs).  Then there was a yearlong interlude in 1951, during which she worked as an assistant to Aritomo, a Japanese gardener, in restoring his private garden Yugiri, in the highlands of Malaya.  She then had a career as a judge, the last fourteen years on the Supreme Court of Malaysia.  But she has been diagnosed with aphasia and told that soon dementia will overtake her, so she returns to Yugiri to tend to some matters of personal significance and write the story of her life, as best she can remember it.  The ""present"" time of her narrative switches back and forth between 1951, when she was Aritomo's assistant and CT mayhem was at its worst, and 1987.THE GARDEN OF EVENING MISTS is a capacious novel in terms of historical and cultural scope and in the array of characters.  From the standpoint of history, there is the Japanese occupation during World War II, Japanese suicide squadrons (kamikazes), the Malay independence movement, tensions within the Chinese community of Malaya, and the violence of the CTs.  As for art and culture, there is much on Japanese gardening, Japanese archery (kyudo), Buddhism and Taoism, the genre of Japanese woodblock prints known as ukiyo-e, and the elaborate Japanese tattoos known as horimono.  For me, the novel was very instructive, and it imparted all its new information effortlessly, as part of an easy-reading, quickly moving story.It is not a great novel, however.  It is not subtle:  messages or lessons are often writ large, and author Tan Twan Eng too often states the obvious and occasionally he belabors it.  There is some heavy-handed melodrama, several coincidences that strain credibility, and more than a few stilted conversations.  Finally, I did not find Teoh Yun Ling to be a consistent, coherent character.  I frankly am a little surprised that the novel was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize.Still, I enjoyed reading THE GARDEN OF EVENING MISTS and I recommend it, particularly as a window on a different sort of life.  There also are some nice metaphors for memory, which (along with forgetting) is the novel's real subject.  Here is one of them:  ""Memory is like patches of sunlight in an overcast valley, shifting with the movement of the clouds.  Now and then the light will fall on a particular point in time, illuminating it for a moment before the wind seals up the gap, and the world is in shadow again.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XCAG5MFM0DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602861803#wasThisHelpful","R16XCAG5MFM0DV","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel Hale (is the similarity to the author's name more than coincidence?) is a young ""underachiever"", saddled with debt, an aspiring author, and somewhat of a romantic, it would seem.  One summer night after he and his girlfriend Helen made love they retreated to the fire escape to cool off, and Daniel noticed that the moon wasn't in the sky.  ""Where's the moon?"", he asked.  But Helen didn't know what he was talking about.  No one did.  There wasn't even any mention of the moon in the sky chart in the daily newspaper.  So begins a beguiling tale that explores solipsism and psychiatry.  Ultimately, it is Daniel's shrink Dr. Pallister who steals the show.  (But, as noted in one of the story's clever lines, ""the shrinks have been stealing the light from their subjects ever since Freud."")I do not read a lot of sci-fi or ""The Twilight Zone""-type stories, and perhaps I am doing ""The Man Who Remembered the Moon"" a disservice by invoking that genre.  There might be more to the story than I caught.  It might, for instance, be an elaborate allegory.  For me, it was an entertaining story, with some good lines, striking images, and welcome humor.  Although outside my usual realm of reading, the tale was well worth the hour or so required to read it.What I have (courtesy of the author) is the paperback book.  It contains a second story, thirteen pages in length, titled ""The One about the Ballard Fanatic"".  It was similar in tone and effect, and it too ended with an uncanny twist.  The ""Ballard"" of the title refers to J.G. Ballard, and no aficionado of J.G. Ballard should miss it.By the way, the paperback edition is a handsome one.  Kudos to Dumagrad Books.  I will be on the lookout for future offerings from both the publishing house and the author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R854BKLNGITAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0993790909#wasThisHelpful","R854BKLNGITAT","A1OBNY1WB38LMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OBNY1WB38LMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for a great gift idea or an entertaining way to spend time with young children, this is a wonderful option.Not only does this book feature delightful illustrations and age appropriate poetic rhyming, but it has extras as well. There are lots of colours, textures and moving parts in the book, so that kids can play peek-a-boo with bear. (Mum had a lot of fun playing peek-a-boo too.)There are a lot of creative books out there, but this one has the kind of special quality that makes children's eyes light up and makes them want to read it again and again.An imaginative and adorable book for young children, highly recommended.This review is based on a complimentary copy.

"To be honest, I came into this book with high expectations. Some of them were met and even exceeded, and some of them were not. I liked the writing from the beginning, and the amount of research the author put into this was more than obvious in her perfect attention to detail. Unfortunately, it was that same attention to detail that gave me pause later in the book.I love that the author did so much to make the story authentic, and yet I found some parts of this book to be a bit too detailed, especially the mundane tasks portions of it, and that slowed down the rest of the story.The characters are described with careful detail, and I felt as though I got to know them well enough that it was easy for me to care what happened to them. The author did a fantastic job with the setting, making it believable and realistic.Overall I enjoyed this book, but would have cut a few sections out as I really didn't feel they added much to the book.This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher and provided through Netgalley.

"This is an excellent, quickly-paced novel that will keep you guessing until the end, and one that ends in a rather unexpected way.The cover and description for this book made me curious and after just a few pages, I settled in for what I was pretty sure was going to be a great read, It was.The characters were interesting right away and the setting had the strange, ethereal qualities that a book like this cannot survive without. The author avoided the usual pitfalls of turning this into a simple haunted house story and after a while I began to think of the house as one of the main characters as well.I liked the way Brendan Duffy combined real history with fictional history and thought he did a great job of building believable supporting characters and a story that gave them all purpose.The relationship between the townspeople and the family as well as the inner dynamics of the main characters themselves had some serious complexity and that added to the intensity of the story.

"Isn't this a beautiful cover? I fell in love with it right away.The book took me a bit longer. If you like books where you get to know a lot about the characters before jumping into the meat of the story, then you may find yourself struggling a bit with this one. The writing is clear and concise, but I still found I had to keep going back to figure out who was who, until well into the story.The novel has a lot going for it, both memories from the past and the current parts of the character's lives are interesting, but I did have a few issues with it. I didn't feel that the relationships and conversations amongst the characters always felt genuine.I did like the way the author fit pieces together that at first didn't seem to make much sense. Whislt reading this, you will no doubt have a few ""aha"" moments as the book progresses.Overall, I thought this was a complex story with a lot going for it, but there were opportunities to make the characters more important to the reader that I thought were missed.Still a good book.

"It is no secret that I have a total obsession with all things Lincoln. I collect these presidential artifacts, muse over them and ponder the writings of and about the man himself to the exclusion of most other interests in life. So, I hate most Lincoln fiction. I didn't hate this book.I don't love it, but I didn't hate it either.The author has done a fine job of choosing an interesting historical period for his setting, and has created a main character that can carry a book even without the use of a popular historical figure. His story was well thought out and I liked that the main character had a life in his own right.My issue with this book was my own inability to suspend belief. Yes, I came into this knowing that it was a re-imagining of events. Yes, I also knew from the description that Lincoln survived in this story. Oddly, that wasn't what I took issue with. I will not reveal too much here for fear of spoilers, but I will say that although Lincoln became famous for freeing slaves--he did not exactly champion equality--and there is a certain thread in this book that I just could not put aside.This is a creative story filled with imagination. The research that went into it is obvious, but for me, I found it difficult not to compare to history and that made it hard for me to fully appreciate.For those who enjoy historical fiction and can come into a book with an open mind, this book will thrill you with action, intensity and solid writing.This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher and provided through Netgalley.

"Subtle terror.I think those two words sum up the feeling of this book pretty well. B.D. Bruns does not jump into this story with gore and violence the way many horror authors seem to approach their books these days. Instead, the author allows the story to gain momentum using the unknown and builds the rest from there.If you are a fan of suspenseful books that make you use your powers of reasoning to figure them out, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this book. I wasn't sure what to think in the beginning, but soon the story grabbed my attention and I found myself turning pages until I was finished. The classic elements chosen for this story reminded me of why horror is such a great category of fiction.I enjoy books that can describe a setting well and make you feel like you are right there alongside the character and this is definitely one of those stories. It isn't a tremendously long book, but the author gets to the point and makes it memorable.A suspenseful, interesting book.

"This is not a bad book at all, and I was happy to see a return of some characters from ""The Butterfly and the Violin,"" but I just didn't get as involved in this story as I did in that one. That was quite possibly my favourite book of all that I read last year.This story is a continuation, but is a lot different. I found myself heavily invested in the historical parts of this story, but not as much in the current events.Once more. Kristy Cambron proves that she has a way with words and can create some of the most beautiful, haunting descriptions of any author I've read. Her ability to transport you from your most comfortable piece of furniture into a time and place that we have only read second hand accounts of is amazing.This is a beautiful series, and whilst I may not have felt as close to this novel as the first, I still recommend it.

"This is a very courageous memoir that does not hold back from telling the truth about the author's life. She writes with a strong voice and gives her audience the kind of audience that one hopes for when they pick up a memoir.We all have struggles in our lives at some point, some more so than others, and I applaud Donna Carol Voss for using her own experiences to help others that may be experiencing some of the same things.She writes about a lot of different topics, some very personal, some not as much, but each one of them is interesting in a different way. The author had a lot of unique experiences when she was younger and travelled a long road to come to the realisation of her true faith and what she was meant to do with her life.From her early life and questions of her sexual orientation to her feelings about motherhood and the relationship with her own mum, she covers a lot of ground in this book.If you enjoy memoirs and are looking for something good to read, this is a book that I think you will enjoy.

"First--an admission. I was not one of those people who followed the Sunshine Girl videos on YouTube so I came into this unaware of what it was about and went off the book blurb to tell me about it. I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. I suppose I went into reading this without any real expectations.For the first third or so of this book, I was pretty enthralled. I liked Sunshine and her mom Kat right away. I liked the dog and the cat and the best friend and I was grateful that the author didn't wait until the last page to start revealing the paranormal aspects of the story. This seemed like it would turn out to be the kind of old-fashioned, creepy ghost story that relies a lot on the unseen to create terror. The it went a different way.I can't say that I didn't enjoy the rest of the book, I did, but in a bit different manner. Rather than being a ghost story, this book becomes more about the strange qualities of the main character and what her future holds. I thought the plot line was pretty unique, and I was still happy to continue reading, but I also was a bit dismayed that the story went from being about one thing and suddenly became about another. I'm not sure (again with the lack of videos) where the author will take this series, but it should be interesting to see.I do have to say, the final battle with the dark force in the story was not my favourite. It seemed a bit too easy and too convenient for such heavy subject matter. I also want to mention that the bathtub scene is possibly one of the most terrifying scenes in any book I've read. So, I guess it balances.Overall I think teens (and adults) will enjoy this book. I look forward to reading the next and seeing what happens to Sunshine in the future.This review is based on a complimentary copy offered in exchange for an honest review.

"Allison Brennan hits the ground running with this novel and doesn't ever give the reader a chance to settle down until the book comes to an end. This is the kind of story where the surprises and unexpected twists keep piling up when you least expect them.For those who enjoy procedural crime novels, there is a bit of that here, but we also get to know the main character a lot more. I thought this was an interesting plot and that the author did a good job of following through and tying the various events together.The end of the book wasn't what I expected it to be and it didn't feel like one of those sappy endings that doesn't quite fit the rest of the book. I like the way the author makes her characters realists.Overall I thought this was a good book and would recommend it to others. This is going to be a good series that I hope will be around for a long time.This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher and provided through Netgalley.

"Good tasting coffee, just the right brew if you don't like a lot of sourness in your blend. For me, this is nice for mornings when I want some good basic coffee. It may not be the cup you savor after dinner, but a second cup at my desk keeps me awake, which is always a good thing when one is working, and it's gentle enough that I don't have a coffee tummy a few hours later.If you are like me and enjoy several cups during the day, this might be a good choice. Non-argumentative, flavorful, always better with the addition of a little honey or cocoa or sugar when you need a treat, and no mess or fuss.Every coffee maker is now churning out K-cups, so it's easy to find your favorite in this wonderful format.  And K-Cups just make life easy.  Every morning when I joyfully leap out of bed, chase away the bluebirds and dance my way into the kitchen, it's lovely to know I will be drinking coffee as soon as I push the button.  And if you have seem me, no that's not a scythe in my shriveled talon, I'm not wearing a hood, and why not just shut up?  Anyway, mornings are so much easier.  No more filling the kettle for the French Press. No more realizing I never put the darn filter into the Mister Coffee (you'd think I'd have one of those permanent ones by now, wouldn't you). This is instant gratification.  If they could make a K-Cup shrimp and grits maker, life on earth would be perfect.These K-cups are the soft-bodied kind, fit the machine perfectly, and presented no problems. The product information claims that, with less plastic, these cups are easier on the environment, which is always something to strive for. Except in the morning I kind of forget about environment and citizenship, friends and family. I just want coffee.  I have been found huddling in the corner where the dishwasher meets the cupboard, sucking on a k-cup, making feral noises and scaring the cat. It probably would not be a good time to question my environmental footprint.Hills Bros looks to me like 4 stars -- not stellar coffee, just darn good.  Enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7IJTWFDYNKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZJMTAO#wasThisHelpful","R1U7IJTWFDYNKZ","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To begin with, this utility bin is small:  About 16 inches long, a foot wide and ten inches high.  It does not hold a great deal. And it has no lid, so it's not good for long-term storage unless you wrap everything in plastic first.  The idea is, when not in use, you collapse the thingy and shove it someplace. Then when you need it, you pop it open.  Which is nicer in theory than in fact.  The sides are soft, there is no bracing, so if you pick it up from the bottom, it collapses and whatever you've put inside can fall out.  You may want to make a note to yourself: Always remember to pick up by the handles. And then, also like me, forget about it real fast, so you are always chasing rogue oranges and lamb chops on the lam in your trunk.  If you are interested improving your swearing abilities, not to mention the depth and breadth of the bad words, this will come in very, very handy.In my quest to find something to use this thing for, I decided it could make a decent beach carry-all, but I've seen better and without a lid, you'll be wiping sand off the peaches and shaking it out of the towels. If you transport clothes from your home to a second location, you could cram in a day or two's worth of stuff, or some towels, or a sheet set. But not much more. And remember, no lid, so don't keep this is an attic or someplace dusty or inhabited by cute but horrible rodents.I finally decided to use mine to hold bags from the supermarket.  It's okay for this purpose It can live in the trunk or passenger seat and replaces the collapsing paper box that formerly did the job.  I do have to be careful with the thing. The instructions say 'do not machine wash' and that means you can clean the inside, but if you spill something on the outside, you'll have an annoying clean up on your hands. So make sure that your steaks aren't dripping out of the plastic bag or anything. Or add another layer of plastic. And another layer of work.I'm exhausted already.The cost is $18.50 and when I compare it to the old box it replaced (one of those bank boxes for transporting papers...heavy duty cardboard, a lid (which I lost) and holes for handles, it seems a little pointless. The box was free, being thrown away by some former employers, so I was already ahead by almost 20 buck.  I use a plastic trash bag to line the box, which you could also use to keep the Scrunch Storage Utility Bin clean, but then who would see that tweedy brown fabric you just shelled out good money for? Counter productive.  When the box got dirty, I threw it away. I could have foraged another free box. When this gets dirty, I have a cleaning job to deal with. Do I need more of that? Isn't my life short enough, I'm going to spend my golden years washing utility bins?  If I clean the kitchen, I invite people in off the street to see. Not that they ever come.  Cleaning utility boxes is way, way down on my bucket list.So I'm stuck with three stars because it does what it says, but there are better ways.  Think about it. If you need a handsome storage bin you can leave out for people to enjoy, this is for you. And I'm sure we all have friends who just can't wait to see our storage solutions.  On the other hand, you are going to have to spend time figuring out what to store.  I thought of  firewood (too small; magazines (I don't save them), and I'm down to the schlepping sheets to a country house (which I don't have, but would happily visit you if you are short of guests, and keeping the bags from falling down in the trunk (which the box did cheaper and better).If you are rich, this may be the plutocrat's solution to cardboard boxes.  If you are not rich, keep looking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35FRT99Q7YG33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPBNS4Q#wasThisHelpful","R35FRT99Q7YG33","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are real cooks out there, the kind who say stuff like ""Hmmmm, fifteen minutes before dinner? I think I'll make a bundt cake.""  And then there's me. Most of my kitchen time is spent stopping the bleeding and putting out the flames.  I like to cook, I would be a better cook if I could, but there is just something missing in my wiring.  Paying attention, reading directions, and not eating the better tasting ingredients first could be part of the problem. So the words ""season"" as applied to a frying pan terrified me. I pictured Mountain Woman doing all sorts of arcane things with hot oils and ovens and forge-like flames.  I just learned that it means put oil on the pan and get it hot.  Okay, I'm not Mountain Woman. I'm more like one of those gals whose out running around while poor Hank Williams is yodeling for me to get back to him and the kids.  But at least now I can season a pan.But to get back to the review. This 12-inch, extra heavy pan from T-fal says preseasoned, but that doesn't mean you are off the hook. This one got what seems to be a light coating of vegetable oil. And no offence to the T-fal people, I'm not sure how long it sat in a warehouse. So when I got it, I got out a scrubber, put it in hot water, and cleaned it.  After it dried, I googled ""seasoning a cast iron pan,"" found the instructions that sounded like they were written by a real human being with a life, not Mrs. Bundt Cake, and then I cooked some bacon.  One must always use bacon when testing frying pans. It tastes good, you can eat it on its own or in a sandwich, and gives you a reward for all that labor. Plus it is also playing it's little role in seasoning the pan even more. I've used the pan a few times, always careful to oil it up, and have had no problems.The pan has a nice design, with a long and nicely shaped handle on one side, and a  very essential grab handle on the other. Since the thing weighs a ton, you are going to want to be sure to have a spare pot holder handy so you can carry it with both hands if necessary.  There are two drip spouts for pouring off the excess bacon fat (as if there was such a thing).What I like about cast iron is that you can go with very high temperature. I mean Very. This one is good for up to 600 degrees.  I have no immediate plans for becoming Satan's chef, but I also have no immediate plans to reform, so I'll keep the option open.  Plus you can start off browning a steak under high heat and then finishing in the oven, or even using it on the barbecue (with a pad).  The amazing non-stick of good cast iron means you can do eggs and bacon, pancakes, delicate fish like trout -- all without worrying about stuff sticking to the pan or having it fall apart on you.  Fish cooks so fast, you just want to whisk it in, eat a slice of bacon, and whisk it off. (Important kitchen note: If bacon is not handy, chocolate can be eaten instead.) I have several Lodge pans and this seems about as good. The price is not a killer either.  12 inches is not one heck of a lot of frying pan, but it's fine for two people or for side dishes.  I figure four trout or two steaks are the perfect fit.Clean up is easy. Remember, seasoning eliminates sticking. Just don't use soap on the pan.  I use some steel wool and hot water, and then wipe it dry. I have a friend who is a brilliant cook who has pans from her grandmother, and they are rusted up; she just scrubs them down before she uses them, adds some oil and heats them up. No big deal. If you have never ventured from the usual stainless steel or non-stick, this pan is a good beginning and after just a few uses, you'll see why so many people like cast iron.

"Until I saw the Cuisipro Mandoline, my newest favorite slicer was the OXO Good Grips Complete Grate and Slicer Set. Nice, lightweight, portable, with storage for the blades inside the vegetable holder. It looked good and even though I could tell it would not last forever, I liked what it did.  And then along came Cuisipro, big and brawny, handsome and up to the job.  There you go: my second marriage all over again.Anyway, I switched over to the Cuisipro and like it very much.  It has Includes three cutting blades with dual surfaces. YOu can slice, make those crinkle cuts and waffle cuts, or you can grate or julienne.  The weight is nice.  It does not wiggle around on the counter and it's sturdy as all get out.  You slide in the blade, turn the key and you're good to go. The handle is slip-proof, you get a big knuckle guard (essential for people like me who are now officially down to the bone).  With five cutting options you can do a lot with the Cuisipro. Even better, you can adjust the thickness from paper thin to zoftig.  I like my potatoes with a little heft to them when I make a salad, but I'm thinking of doing some home-made chips and this is going to make it possible.  Because, you now, I do need that essential second source of chips.  If Frito-Lay ever decides to top playing fast and loose with my arteries, I need a back up system.Anyway, I have tried the Cuisipro on a bunch of different foods.  First out was a big bowl of semi-kim chee, which is a kind of fermented Korean cabbage slaw that I didn't ferment. It had sliced onions, napa cabbage, radishes, carrots, and other stuff along with hot peppers, fish sauce and any number of other herbs and spices.  It was pretty good tasting, and the Cuisipro came through the challenge with no problems.  Since then, I made some carmelized apples and onions which were a cinch to slice, and the next project is a truck load of potato salad, with a cart full of onions and maybe some carrots and other things that look interesting.  With bacon and mayo and vinegar and boiled eggs.  Traditional plus bacon, which is the international term for ""more.""  The Cuisipro is big and strong, does what you need it to, makes boring things like slicing your way through a ton of potatoes less unpleasant.  The price is $39.95 ($10 more than the OXO, but this looks like it will last longer, so that's a wash).  Storage is easy...the mandolin is flat and I put the blades in a plastic bag underneath.  It will take me months to lose them all.So, for a good looking, heavy duty slicer that is easy to use, with blades that are a cinch to install or release and sharp enough to tackle what you want to slice, I don't see how you could go wrong with one of these.  On the other hand, that third marriage didn't work out so well: I tend to be an optimist.Five sharp stars for an excellent slicer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN9IIFR60XNYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUMLQV2#wasThisHelpful","RN9IIFR60XNYD","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a blanket made for snuggling. I moved from Los Angeles to a more northerly and significantly colder climate and waited until I now so I could give the blanket a real test. Evaluating in on a 65 degree L.A. night didn't seem just right. Here is drops down to the high 30s/low 40s, although the days are beautiful and warm and breezy.  My first night here, I shivered and got up and put on a pair of sweats. My light as a feather (and featherweight) comforter is fine for tropical nights, but not made for real cold. Next night I broke out the DozzZ blanket. It's so big, it covered my comforter, trapping all the heat under it. Big plus.  I was warm.  But was I comfortable? You bet. This blanket is soft and fleecy and surprisingly light.  The color is a shocking pink...if you like that kind of oooomph in your pallet, you'll love it. Even if you don't, just throw the blanket over yourself and your existing covers on a cold night and you won't worry about whether or not it matches the ecru and robin's egg.  You'll be snoring in warm, cozy comfort. Come the morning, fold it up and put it away. No problem.After a week, I threw it in the washer, used cold water and Tide detergent, let it tumble dry and it came out soft, fluffy and perfect. No stiffness, no pilling, no color fade.  If it continues to hold up this way, it's worth the price and then some.There are a few hiccups in the description, but none that would be deal-breakers.  The description says: The front of the velveteen blanket is Coral fleece, the back is plush throw.  Actually they seem identical to me. The velveteen is polyester, not a natural fiber, but for the price, you aren't going to get anything fancier.  And that color is a little bright. Not horrible, just not at all shy. I kind of like it. All my life I have had white bed linens, sometimes running wild with a pale beige or a light blue.  And all these years there has been coral. What was I thinking. It's loud but pretty. And after all, it's your blanket and your bedroom. If you want coral, go coral. I'm seeing a whole new world out there.For the price, this is possibly the softest, warmest choice you can make. Totally practical. No fancy stitching, no satin edging, just a warm blanket. And sometimes that's all you need and all you want.Not bad to wrap yourself up in while watching tv either.  I indulged in a three episode House of Cards Binge and this kept me warm all the way through without overheating.Five stars for the perfect snuggling blanket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PXI5YTH7UDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRRI8CU#wasThisHelpful","R24PXI5YTH7UDL","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I now have five of these coffeemakers in various sizes, from a tiny one-cupper to this six cup (four mug) giant.  I started with a Bodum, which is a good place to start, and so far have have never had a problem with any. I like this one for the big size and for the borosilicate pot that can withstand even my fumblefingered acrobatics.  It arrived in the mail and I washed it out and gave it a try...but while pouring in the boiling water, I managed to drop the glass carafe, bouncing it off of the sink and onto the floor. It hit hard but didn't crack or break. I did only minor damage to myself, because I was somehow not where the water sprayed, which was also nice.  Anyway, it's good to know that this carafe can withstand early morning coordination lapses.The innards are put together well too, nice and sturdy. The fit is perfect, so you don't get too much in the way of coffee grounds floating into the brew when you depress the plunger.  It is as easy to clean as any French Press, just rinses out.  I put the plunger in the dishwasher, but generally just rinse the carafe itself to keep it looking new.  It certainly is not difficult to keep clean.  But the best part is that generous volume.  The directions state 32 ounces, which is four filled to the brim mugs, more like four and a half or five. And an easy six to eight regular coffee cup sized cups. Enough for a dinner party without getting up to do it all over again, or for one of those Sunday mornings where you know you are going to do the crossword, keep refilling your cup and to heck with the chores.This oversized pot is easy to hold, easy to pour.  The plastic siding means you don't worry about burning your hand if touch the side.  I have nothing but good things to say about this press, and urge anyone who really loves coffee to try one of these coffee makers.  You will discover a new way to get a tremendous amount of flavor out of almost any grind (you just don't want anything too fine or powdery...it slips through the plunger), a brewer that looks good at the table, and a fun addition to your coffee making arsenal.If you look at the reviews, everyone who tried the Kona French Press liked it. There is one single-star review, but I think the reviewer misses the point. He thinks it is excellent. Someone should tell him.  Anyway, this is definitely something to consider and easily worth five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DD8IMV4CXEI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMJDJ5C#wasThisHelpful","R3DD8IMV4CXEI3","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Tide Liquid, it's a nice cleanser for anything from linens to towels, and the kind of clothes you just throw in the machine without worrying about. There are people who use specially sourced powders and liquids that improve the environment, make their 1000 thread count pillowcases float off the bed, and turn a spa-quality bath towel into a tiny and absorbent piece of heaven.  Me, I buy my linens and towels at Big Lots and they're tough enough to handle whatever detergent I throw at 'em.I used Tide Downy on the criminals in my linen closet and they certainly improved with the contact. Soft and fluffy, nice smelling...I couldn't ask for more. Well, technically I could ask for them to make their own way to the washing machine and to fluff and fold themselves, but let's be realistic.  Tidy Downy is fine for normal clothing, sweats and that sort of thing.  If you wear antique laces and vintage Chanel, you wouldn't be schlepping with this stuff anyway.I prefer liquid to powder detergents because I have been known to overfill the washer and that results in powder trails.

"These toppings are just plain good.  They give variety to popcorn and don't require that you slather it with rich, sweet butter and big clouds of freshly grated cheese. Sure, you can, but you're watching Real Housewife of New Jersey, do you really want to waste time with the gourmet popcorn fixing? Nah. Microwave, shake, eat.  It's not just good, it's Reality TV good.I got my package a couple of days ago and shared with my friends. Everyone gave a thumbs up for the flavors but no one was impressed with the 'spice.' The Buffalo Wing tastes like the flavoring on the buffalo wings they serve you at a bar when you are pouring back the beer and would probably eat one of the darts and think it was chicken if the feather was long enough. The Bacon Cheddar tastes like both and no sane person on the planet will argue with that, and the cheesy Jalapeno tastes, well cheesy, but not necessarily jalapenoid.  I believe spicy means SPICY. One jalapeno is invisible. A half a bottle is a serving.  Once my best friend and I got into a Thai food eating contests that left us both with lip blisters. I still can't say things like ""sylvester"" without something falling out of my mouth. Or body cavity.If the Buffalo Wing and Cheesy Jalapeno had the slightest bit of heat to them, I'd amp it up to five stars. But there is no discernable heat at work here, and if you have the world's most mild palette, you can enjoy these without worry. The rest of us can sprinkle on some cayenne.  Or, if you are a deranged Martha Stewart type, get some really good gruyere cheese and grate it until it's like a cloud; you want a lot of cheese, so that when it melts, the popcorn kernels get glued together with its cheesy goodness.  Really delicious.  And for something weird but inexplicably delicious, try this blend.  Trust me. People will eat their own fingers trying to cram this stuff down. The mixture is nothing special individually, but put together, tastes like nothing else on earth and makes popcorn the food of the angels: 3 tablespoons brewers' yeast 2 tablespoons garlic salt 2 tablespoons celery salt 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon curry powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)Lots of options: you can dig out the cheese and grater, go rummaging in the spice cabinet, or just unscrew the Kernel Seasons stuff and pour away.

"This is not the binder of your dreams, it's not beautiful, one reviewer points out it doesn't have a handle. Well, no. It doesn't have wheels and a handlebar either, so I couldn't ride it to work.  I checked my other binders for handles and they all grinned with embarrassment and looked around like they wanted to get outta there.  Apparently I have been living in a world of handle-less binders, the last knuckle-dragging Neanderthal in the Cromagnon world.  Here it is: I'm a simple woman.First of all, all I ask from the binder is that it hold paper, and the Mead holds a lot, maybe a whole ream.  I use lined and unlined, and various forms in mine. The purpose is business related. It holds the paper, it holds the dividers. I'm not looking for more.  Reviewers say there aren't enough places to keep things--phones, pads, ipod, keys, parking ID, pencils, calculators and other stuff; they prefer a binder with lots of pockets. I am more efficient:  I save time by losing the accessories as soon as I get them, or just throwing them in my purse and then losing the purse. A good system is hard to beat.Anyway, if you want a binder that serves as your personal assistant and porter, this is not it.  There are 3 storage places; on the outside you get one made for a pen and a pencil, and another where a phone could fit, or perhaps a card case.  The inside pocket is fine for a tiny address book or notebook.  To be frank, I don't have much more stuff, so even this limited accommodation seems lavish to me.If you want to be a stickler, this binder is shaped a little oddly as well...not regulation size. It's much wider.  I have no problem with that, having lived with my hips all my life. But you will not be able to carry this in a backpack. Again, not a problem for me. I am not of the backpack generation. I don't camp, I don't schlep. And when I was in school, we used a rubber strap to hold our books. Even back then, every girl carried a purse where you kept your money, lipstick and tissues and your lunch. Boys stuffed things like this into a back pocket. They walked funny but it worked.Before that, we carried book bags, like fat briefcases only with pictures of Scout the Wonderhorse or Barbie.  You could fit the sofa in one of those. Little kids also had to carry a lunchbox with a  picture of a famous horse or Barbie on the front, plus it had a thermos which you broke or lost the first day. The thermos was for soup, but I never knew any kid to bring soup and a sandwich to school. Maybe in the suburbs. We just brought the chopped ham on a kaiser with mustard, maybe some cookies if we were lucky. This was before Juice In A Box. There were little juice cans, tiny things, but they cost a lot and your mom always 'forget' them.  ""Drink water"" was her advice. Or you could buy milk at school. No vending machines, no choices. And no soda.But getting back to the binder.  Complaints from reviewers include no locks (a locking binder?  Who are these people? Enrico Fermi?  Another reviewer complains that a pen or pencil might fall out of the front holding spot, which is, of course, a rather sobering possibility. I generally get my writing supplies out of someone else's purse or office, so it doesn't really bother me when I lose one. And if I have to buy a pen, I generally get a truck load down at the 99C store.  One buck gets you enough pens to drop behind the sofa for the rest of your life. Live it up.For ten dollars, give or take, the Mead is just fine in that it gives you a good place to hold paper and dividers. There are some extras, which are nice.

"I saw a refrigerator magnet that said ""Dance Like Nobody's Looking.""  Cute, but really, why would you. Dancing is a good time to show off. Or slink off the floor before that elbow takes out somebody's eye. Forget dancing.  Eat like nobody's looking -- that's the thing...and the newest release from America's Test Kitchen tempts us to do just that.The editors take a lot of trouble with their instructions. I understand they scout around and locate a few 'best ways' to cook something and then make their choice.  I came to these books late...I have no idea why I waited, but they are always good, always have the info you need and, in fact, most of the time, it is the best way to roast pork or cook cauliflower or make cranberry relish.In this case, ATK took about 650 of its favorite recipes from other books and revamped them to suit two people. Brilliant idea. There comes a point in every life, sometimes two or three points, where the number of people you cook for changes. Maybe you cook for yourself, then two, then a family, back to two or one, up and down. That's how it went for me. Now I'm down to one, and soon it will be two again.  I can cook, but I can't cut down. I make that six serving casserole and the freezer is full of ancient stuff that was good but has worn out its welcome.  Cutting recipes down just doesn't work. If I want a stew for two, what do I do with the rest of that lamb shoulder after I cut off enough for us?  Measurements, food amounts, cooking times, everything is calculated for the deuce.  You don't get an unspiced curry or an overcooked piece of fish.The other thing I love about ATK is that they don't assume we automatically know something.  They tell us what do to from the gitgo. I'm a long term cook of the so-so variety, and they've shown me I still have a lot to learn. For instance, this book includes a basic cooking guide and the smartest advice on how treat an egg that I've ever seen.  There are tips on how to shop for two so you don't end up with furry tomatoes or squishy mushrooms, and they also tell you how to store things so they stay fresh longer.Since there are 650 different goodies to cook, you have an entire repertoire between two covers, from parties to weekday meals, breakfasts, lunches and dinners, soups and salads, everything, in other words, that two people will be eating.  Feeling romantic? Want a hearty dish for a cold night or something cool and crisp for the dog days of summer? You got it. Plus dessert.Whether you are new to the stove or a seasoned vet, ATK's The Complete Cooking for Two Cookbook is a gem.  And it's fun to read.  Plus you will never be forced to stuff down that third or fourth helping of mousse because the recipe was double what you needed.  OKay, we can skip that part.  The rest of the book is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8IXERB87SJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493837#wasThisHelpful","R2X8IXERB87SJE","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know when somebody like your annoying old aunt wants to tell you all about how bad she feels and what hurts today? Well, this is one of those things so I advise you just walk on by.  Next thing I'll be yelling ""get offa my lawn.""Anyway woke up at two a.m. on Monday feeling like a truck had parked on me plus nausea. A spot on my shoulder that hurt like heck to touch and the hurting kept going down my back to my stomach.  Can't sleep on that side. Downer. Okay, that I get. Pulled something? But nausea too? I mean, is that even fair?  I never get sick, ever, so this was annoying. And I'm a bad patient. Stuff like this makes me mad. I attacked with the first weapons I found...an ancient bottle of Motrin and some Gas-X recommended by a neighbor who says ""gas bubble"" as the reason for everything from hair loss to bad attitude.  Gas X made no difference.  I saw these little pills in Vines a while ago and ordered them...promptly forgetting I had.  Was it fate? Foreseeing the need? Or just thinking I could write a funny review. Whatever, I ordered and they arrived yesterday so I added them to the mix, along with gingerale, which is all that I could tolerate. Not that it stayed. Anyway, 3 yesterday, 3 today, and a shall we say thorough cleansing of a rather empty system, and the nausea is gone and the hurting only when I laugh or mutter obscenities. So, they worked. I guess. On something.  Still hurts though, but not so bad.I never used a laxative before, finding prune juice or sauerkraut juice remarkable in their prowess. Just didn't want to go there this time because of my temporarity fragility and their take no prisoners attitudes.  The Dulcolax worked on an empty stomach, no cramps, no hurting. Not a cure to the whole problem, but they got rid of what ever was making my stomach do somersaults. So I would recommend them. I'm only going four stars because I don't know if it was 'irregularity' (now there's a nice euphemism) or something else, but I feel better so they get credit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFY9OD9M1PHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GU6DMQ#wasThisHelpful","ROFY9OD9M1PHA","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kitchen scales have improved greatly since I got my first version...basically a steel plate on a spring that used to boi-oi-oing around and was pretty much unreadable.  The Taylor 3842 Digital Food Scale combines almost all the best features of every kitchen scale I've tried, plus it's small, easy to store, durable and very reliable. If you don't have a good kitchen scale, you're missing a very handy piece of equipment. Baking with one is essential...so is making pasta. And if you try to maintain discipline with a little portion control, you want this. It is shocking how big I think four ounces are...until I started using a scale to weigh pieces of meat.  I honestly thought four ounces equaled four pork chops or the rough meat equivalent of a basketball.  Not counting the gravy. Turns out, four ounces was the amount I'd slice of to taste when I wanted to make sure it was salty enough or cooked through.  I made no connection between the size of dinner and the size of my thighs. I figured it was global warming or something.  I still hope it might be.  Anyway, if you are like me, you cannot possibly do portion control without this scale. And probably somebody holding a gun on you.The Taylor does just about everything someone who cooks a lot would need from their kitchen scale, and it has some very nice features:*You can zero it out after placing a bowl on the scale, so your count is accurate and easy.*It weighs in grams or ounces and you can switch between the two easily. I have no idea what a gram is and suspect it is totally bogus, but the machine has it all figured out, so we don't have to worry.*There's an on and off feature, so you are not wasting batteries (I put this in because I read it in the product description, but really, everything has an on and off. You don't keep the car running or the flashlight on, do you?  I don't feel particularly grateful to Taylor for the switch, but will acknowledge the gesture.*The LED display of weight is nice and big. I have a scale where the read out is so small and overshadowed by the weighing plate, you need two people just to check if that's 8 ounces of all purpose flour or not.  Anyway, this is large, clear and readable. No problem.*The scale stays in place. It's not heavy, but not such a lightweight that it slides all over the place, mostly onto the floor where everything spills.  The bottom has a nice grip.*The size is compact but you can weigh some pretty big things on it with no difficulty. The small size means easy storage which, for me, is essential since I cannot resist gizmos and thingys and my pots and pans cupboard looks like somebody's yard sale exploded.*The weighing plate is glass, which I prefer to plastic.  You don't need to dirty a plate just to weigh your dinner pork chop. Glass is easier to clean than plastic and doesn't absorb odors (not that you should eat meat that stinks unless you are really, really hungry) or harbor bacteria.*Batteries are included. This uses 3 AAAs, a nice common size, which doesn't matter because everybody always forgets to get replacements until it's too late. But with AAAs, you can just take 'em out of the flashlight. This may be why they stopped making smoke detectors that run on AAA. For years I thought mine was a poorly designed battery container.There is only one drawback. You can't remove the plate. Ideally it would pop off and you could fling it in the dishwaster or hold it under hot water in the sink. Since you can't, you have to hand wash it and it takes a good 30 seconds more.  Okay, it's not exactly heavy lifting, but you add up all those extra 30 seconds and you're working four, sometimes five unnecessary minutes every week or so.  Unless you're some deranged Martha Stewart who lives to keep her grout clean, sitting down and watching Real Housewives of New Jersey is a better use of time. Those ladies don't use portion control, wanna bet.Anyway, if you don't have a kitchen scale and you are even semi-serious about weight control or cooking, they are very handy. I bought this scale as a gift for a neighbor and then was offered it for review by Vines and decided I needed one for myself. This one does just about everything you want from a scale and the price is right. Five stars.Of course if it made a mistake now and then on the four ounce meat portion and gave you five or six or 47 ounces instead, my heart wouldn't break either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ECIEG3NAJHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDS2X2G#wasThisHelpful","R32ECIEG3NAJHH","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So says Agnes Brown who may not have the luck of the Irish but does what she can with the fortune she's been given.We meet Agnes soon after the death of her husband. Redser was stumbling home from the pub when the wheels of a bus suddenly landed on him, leaving Agnes bereft and with seven hungry kids to feed.  Poor Mr. Brown may not have been much of a breadwinner before the fateful encounter with the trolley, but what little he brought in from work or the dole put food on the table. Agnes can't wait for the grief to subside.  She gets the news and heads straight to city hall to start fighting with the bureaucracy for her widow's pension. She explains to the clerk that her husband was a kitchen porter. When the clerk wants to know where he worked, Agnes looks at her like she's seeing a bug: In the kitchen, I suppose.  Obviously it's going to be a long fight.We spend the next few months with Agnes and fall in love with her. The role is beautifully played by Anjelica Huston who also produced and directed this funny, touching little treasure. I don't know about you, but I can't get enough of Ms. Huston. She improves whatever she touches. Her first directorial project, Buster out of Carolina (name has been changed because I'm afraid Amazon might not permit the actual term, which has to do with illegitimacy), is another fine piece of work; both are tinged with but not spoiled by a great affection for her characters and lots of emotional performances.The film co-stars Marion O'Dwyer as best friend Marion Monk. Agnes and Marian spend their days together smoking their ciggies, drinking countless cups of tea, gossiping about their friends and neighbors, and occasionally analyzing Marion's enjoyment of 'the organism' -- an event that Agnes has not experienced despite six sons and a daughter. The two are loud, brassy and funny. They work together in one of the great open-air Dublin markets, selling vegetable that they transport via baby carriage. The year is 1968, but with the exception of beehive hairdos and Tom Jones, it might be 1918 or 1948. Agnes lives at the tail-end of that never-ending era, where the Jakes was usually outdoors and communal, if you lived on the wrong side of the river it was assumed you were poor and no better than you had to be, and when you needed a coat, you stood on line at the St. Vincent De Paul. If Da was a drinker, the coat got pawned on Wednesday night to tide the family over until Friday's paycheck, if there was one.Agnes was no different than her neighbors, but now things are a little tougher. She's making do, but barely. The veggie stand lets her eke out a living. It's only the extras, like shoes for the kids, or paying off the local loan shark for the money needed for Redser's funeral and getting the kids out of trouble, that are hard to come by. Still life is good, except when sickness, loss and maybe even love make things a little tricky. But one thing we see early on, Agnes is a survivor. She's nobody's fool.I can't think of a film I've enjoyed more. Great slice of life, great characters, great acting. There are situations that will make you laugh out loud and others that really touch your heart. The film captivates you from the beginning and spell lasts until you almost reach the end. It's that ending that's a problem: it just doesn't work.  What was Huston thinking?SPOILER ALERT. Tom Jones shows up and saves the day and ruins the film. To begin with, the entire situation is false, it doesn't work on any level. We get kids running around a hotel in a scene that feels a way too Brady Bunch, they meet Tom Jones and Hey Presto involve him in the action so he can show up on Agnes' doorstep and save the day.  It's as bad as it sounds. Tom Jones is all wrong for the part, for one thing. It's supposed to be 1968, we're supposed to be seeing Tom as the amazingly sexy young star he was then. But the film was about 40 years later and Tom Jones is no Tom Jones anymore and he really doesn't have much to do but stand around while the other actors register surprise and wonder whenever he shows up. The whole thing feels a little too deus ex machine and slapdash.Still, if you can forgive and forget the last few minutes, this is a winner. Arno Chevrier is believable and could not be better as would be suitor Pierre. He reminds me of Gerard Depardieu, big and ugly and sexy. Marion O'Dwyer is so good, I can't wait to see more of her work.  Ray Winstone as Mr. Billy, the local moneylender and thug, is so good, you can't take your eyes off of him. Treat yourself to this one. A movie doesn't need car chases, billion dollar FX explosions, flying dragons or crouching wizards to be great. This is for the grown ups.Enjoy!NOTE: If you try to find this title the internet, be sure you're getting the movie with Anjelica Huston. There is also a very old TV show about a foul-mouthed Irish woman of the same name, played by a fellow named Brendan O'Carroll, who wrote a series of books about the Agnes Brown character. The show aired in the U.S. a couple of years ago and won a bunch of cable awards.  It's oddly surreal and a little hard to describe. Imagine a mix of Coronation Street and Are You Being Served with by Benny Hill and John Cleese wandering around. O'Carrol's first book is called Agnes Brown in the U.S., and The Mammy at home. There are three or four sequels. If you like the movie, you'll probably end up hunting down the books. They're worth five stars too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZXWK5R598TJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009E27GW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZXWK5R598TJW","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fan di Fendi could become your favorite perfume. On the product description, someone suggests that we save Fan Di for special occasions. That's completely wrong. But this is a fragrance that's easy to get wrong, from the first time you smell it to when and how you wear it.The top notes are tangerine, black current and pear. Not bad. But the midnotes bring together Jasmine, Rose and Tuberose. That's a lot of flower. And then there's the Patchouli, with it's own dose of candy sweet scent.  The winy  top notes will tone them down and tangerine should add some spice, but on paper, this is just another Miss Dior Cherie, for the teenager who cant carry off  Miss Dior and doesnt mind smelling like cotton candy.But wait, theres more.The description doesnt tell you that there is just a hint of peppercorn in the mix. Subtle, but boy does it diffuse the sweetness.  You can also pick out the cedar and a touch of leather.  These play off the Patchouli and light it up like a pinball machine, bringing out that sexy undercurrent and toning down the chocolate candy.  It's what they don't say that makes all the diffrerence.  And to make things even trickier, you can be fooled even if you try the perfume in a shop; the ingredients dont come together immediately. You have to wait for the perfume to dry and give all those little goodies a chance to nestle against one another, find their spot, and learn to live together.  Wait and see.This is an easy perfume to get wrong and a lot of people think it's a great scent for a young woman. It's not.  This is a serious perfume, despite the initial giddiness. Once things settle down, this is a clean and sexy smell. THere are flowers and spices and things that make people sniff and sniff again...intrigued and curious.  One thing it isn't is familiar.  You can wear it day or night, its light enough for casual wear, but deep enough for nights when you want to be the center of attention.Fan Di is a lovely discovery and one you won't smell on every other woman.  This perfume takes a little time to love. Your patience will pay off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LVJQHL1WYPMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00468IR0W#wasThisHelpful","R2LVJQHL1WYPMI","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A smart little product that does exactly what it should.  The Good Old Values Splatter Screen is a dense mesh lid. Pop it on top of a frying pan and you don't have to worry about a greasy spatterprint on the stove or backsplash.  Pick it up by the little knob...another practical touch. You don't burn yourself on a hot handle, and you don't have an inconvienient shape to store.I have never used a spatter screen before and I could kick myself.  All the wiping down of the stove after frying bacon, all that tile to be cleaned after a dinner of fried fish or clam fritters.  And as an added bonus, you don't get burned by hot fat pop ups.

"If you were concerned that the Keurig was the work of the devil, that final slippery slope at the end of the world, you were right.  From day one it made good coffee without any human effort. The machine has trained us to be useless. And I like it. We all do.  Because it's not just the coffee. It's the hot cider. The hot chocolate. Remember how hard hot chocolate used to be...opening the box, ripping open the envelope, pouring the powder into a cup, adding water, microwaving? I'm exhausted just talking about it. But now, every day can be like Christmas eve because Keurig does it for us.  And now they have taken it to the final stage. They are showing the hand. It's all over for us, we're doomed.  THey came up with an iced tea/lemonade combination. In a k-cup.  And it's good. Devilishly good.With Keurig taking over tea, civilization is completely doomed. Tea was easy, you couldn't make bad tea. I mean, teabag, cup, water, sit there counting your fingers and toes and by the time you get to 20, give or take, it was ready.  But this isn't just tea. It's made to for us to drink cold. And it's half lemonade. Really good lemonade.  All you have to do is stick it in the freezer and wait until it's cold. No more remembering to buy lemons, slicing them, getting juice in your eye and on the counter, clattering ice cubes on the floor and a general mess and lemonade that was only so so.  It's all in the k-cup now. TEOTWAWKI.  We're gonna be sitting around on our gigantic butts waiting for the stuff to cool when Gabriel blows his horn.We used to call it Arnold Palmer tea, mixing half lemonade half iced tea. It is, in fact, the perfect drink for a hot summer day. Tart and sweet, and almost impossible to get right. I still remember a perfect pitcher made by one of my husbands, in the early 1980s.  I forget if it was the second or the third one, husband, not pitcher...but I remember that tea.  That's how rare good Arnold Palmer iced tea is.And if you think well, maybe we can save ourselves while waiting for it to cool...don't even go there. The stuff is delicious hot. Like mom used to give you when you had a cold. And if you want to take your last ride down that dark and fiery slope in a handcart, add a splash of bourbon.Lipton's K-cups fit in the Keurig perfectly, they deliver a delicious drink hot or cold, every time.  If they could just figure out a way to make it come outta the machine ice cold and give us complete instant gratification, we'd be dancing the hootchie cootchie with the forces of evil right now.  You know it's true.

"The year is 1948.  The war is over, the boys are home from the war, everybody listens to the radio, but TV is already changing thing. The World Series is going to be seen on the small screen for the first time in September. It's a new world.  There's plenty of work and the pay is good.  Everybody could afford to buy a house...starters run around seven grand for a California Cottage. Two more bedrooms will double the tab. Almost 70 years later, these cottages are gems and the prices, even post-bubble, are so high you can't tell your horse or he'll choke.Ex-GI Ezekiel Rawlins, played with that low key grace and charm that makes Denzel Washington such a great actor, tells us right at the start how much he loves his little house and that great neighborhood surrounding it. We can see his neighbors enjoying the good Southern California life, kids playing in the lawn sprinklers, dad barbecuing and sharing a beer with the guys, mom bringing out the potato salad.  This is what we fought for. Right?  It's just that things go wrong when Rawlins' boss at Champion Aviation fires him.  Downside to innocence.  Without Easy and those like him, white guys can pull more overtime.  Don't like it? Wait another decade or two for civil rights to catch up and then you can complain.  Meanwhile, Easy is  running out money and the bank is getting ansty about the mortgage.And that's how it starts to go noir..The movie is based on the Walter Mosely novel of the same name, the first in an ongoing saga of the black detective who lived at what could have been L.A.'s finest hour.  Give or take. It's that golden age when a snazzy new car would set you back  $1,500, you could gas it up for 23 cents a gallon, and if you wanted to see the USA in your Chevrolet you'd have money left over for lunch.  Bread cost fifteen cents a loaf, the baloney another twenty, and you could wash it down with a cold beer for two bits.  The movie industry was thriving,klieg lights along glamorous Hollywood Boulevard heralded star-studded premieres, the Red Car would get you anywhere in the city for a few cents. No traffic and no smog, the ocean was unpolluted, neighborhoods were free of graffiti and people sat on their porches at night enjoying those breezy L.A. nights.  Of course the cops rousted anybody whose skin wasn't on the right side of white, and nobody cared about job discrimination except the poor slob being discriminated against...and nobody cared about him.  Women's rights? Don't make me laugh.Easy needs a job. Fast. He meets a guy in a bar and a hundred bucks changes hands. Plenty more where that came from too.  Next thing you know, Easy is hunting down a white dame with a secret or two and the object of interest of some very dangerous men in high places. We run afoul of hoods, bootleggers, crooks, thugs, oily operators with snap brim hats and pencil thin moustaches, and a cast of characters that makes every minute of this film entertaining.  All the mean wears hats, smoke unfiltered cigarettes, and down their whiskey straight. The women wear those great Joan Crawford pumps, those great 40s hairdos with the poufs and rolls, and they can talk tough or sweet depending on which side of the mouth is chosen.  We have plenty of shootings, lots of beating and one unfortunate choking. We get a look at Watts that makes you wish you could be there, listening to the music in those great smoke-filled clubs and racing the milkman home. The plot flows, there are bad guys and dirty cops, politicians of every stripe, people you don't want to see die but who do, and a plot that gets muddled but always manages to dust itself off and keep going.  Denzel couldn't be better. This is a role that was made for him.  Don Cheadle, playing a lovable psychotic is superb.  A grown up Jennifer Beals is great as the lovesick wearer of the Blue Dress.Five stars for sheer entertainment and another chance to see Denzel Washington make great acting look easy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHF5RYCUDSOR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E907HM#wasThisHelpful","RHF5RYCUDSOR5","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can spend $40 at the supermarket for some mass-produced night serum with traces of the active ingredients. Or you can spend the same amount on this entry from Forever Young and get some excellent skin care.  You can see from the label the ratio of ingredients and this one seems to formulate correctly.Don't get confused by the word 'acid.'  This is not the kind of acid that peels or exfoliates. It's much more gentle. Hyaluronic Acid is the stuff that makes baby skin so fat and fluffy. The little critters are born with skin that is loaded with the stuff.  As we get older, among the many treats we encounter, is a slowdown in the amount of good stuff our body manufactures.  Hence, wrinkles.There are many wrinkle cures and women are still diligently smearing collagen on the faces as it if does some good. It doesn't. Collagen is the stuff that bonds your skin to your body. You can't put on some poor cows ground up collagen and expect any benefits. You need to make your own, the same way you did when you were young and your own collagen was rubbery and supply and stringy so your skin had life and didn't form those ugly little quilts.  Hyaluronic Acid helps a tiny bit.  It plumps out the skin, and does, in fact, help reduce the appearance of wrinkles a little. Nothing but filler, botox or invasive procedures are going to get rid of the real grooves, but if you go to work early enough and are diligent, you can have skin that looks years younger than it should. (It also helps to have good genes, so next time you pick out parents, check their faces carefully.)You aren't going to get miracles, but you can see a softening of wrinkles and that's ;pretty good. You can also stop them from getting worse, which is very good. Hyaluronic Acid is good for all skin types. If you are 20 years old, you should start using it now. Don't wait for damage to show up and fight a battle of attrition.The pump also deserves mention. It works well, one pump gives you the right dose for one use. You don't have to dip your hands into the product and smear in a bunch of bacteria. Smart thinking.You won't find a better moisturizer and 'rejuvenating skin cream' for the money. Five stars.  I was give the product for evaluation by the manufacturer. The product arrived on February 14th and I have used it every day since them and my review is based on two months use.

"I was up-to-hear with most earbuds. The sound on the two pairs I had was not good, although they came with high recommendations and one with an equally high price tag.  The earbuds that came with my eyephone were worthless and I've been looking for something decent. And also for a pair to use when I'm out biking.  I usually listen to music, and the different with the Brainwavz S1 is remarkable. Sounds are crisp and clear, there is no distortion.  My ear is far from perfect and I don't demand top of the line quality, just something that doesn't sound tinny. These do more than deliver.When it comes to Audio books, this is a brand new area for me and I had a very hard time understanding a lot of dialogue with my old headphones. I ended up wearing my 'earmuff' headphones just so I could listen to Simon Prebble's wonderful Scots accent (playing the detective in the great mystery The Ice House) without thinking the guy was having a seizure.  Now I wear these little gizmos and there is no problem with hearing the words and I don't look like an idiot. More that usual.The other good thing about the Brainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones  is the design. They fit in my ear and stay there. I'm not forever picking 'em up.  The rubber holds nice and tight and the buds stay in place.  If you are looking for a decent set of headphones, if you are not demanding the highest possible standards for music appreciation but just want to enjoy listening, and if you like audio books, these are what you want. And the price is right too.

"How could you not love this little thingy. It slices bananas. Yeah. Bananas. Those soft things that you used to slice with a butterknife in about 30 seconds before dropping them in the cheerios.  Now it takes about one second to do the same job, only better.  Sure, we're doomed. Civilization is going to collapse because instead of our old pioneering spirit, we're sitting on our fat behinds eating sliced bananas and not even working for them.  I'm going to blame Bush. You can blame Obama. The important thing is, we have more time for watching Real Housewives of New Jersey, eating snacks (like bananas and cereal) and lolling on the sofa.  And if that is not worth the destruction of all that humanity has achieved over the millenniums, I don't know what is.Look, the world could end anyway, no help from us.  Solar pulse, Kim Il Whatever could press some button, or global warming could take us out. And really, if you were hard at work, doing a double shift, hungry from skipping dinner, exhausted from not taking weekends off, how much good would that sense of accomplishment do you when you saw the lights start to flicker. But if you sit there, all fat and happy and wondering what your toes look like, s;acking off from work to watch daytime TV and guzzling one bowl of cheerios and bananas after another, you'll think ""What the heck, I wasn't going anyplace anyway.""The truth is, this is just the right tool for the job.  Usually I'd grab the knife I used to butter the toast to cut the banana, which meant there were toast crumbs and a butter slick on my cereal. Unsightly. Plus I'm hungry in the morning and usually late, so I slice that banana fast. It's more like wedges, some thick, some thin. Hardly conducive to fine dining. It's the slippery slope, those off kilter slices and next thing you know, you're shoving them in your mouth as soon as their sliced, four or five at a time, and just grabbing a fistful of Cheerios, shoving that it too, and washing it down with a swig of milk out of the carton.  Is that any way to live (actually it is; it's fun and you don't have a dish to wash). This gives you all the slices at one time, and precisely cut.  But even more important, it somehow elevates you to this whole new realm where you could be of eating out of a bowl, and with a spoon like gourmets and humans.So you decide. Do we tank civilization for an easier way to slice a banana?  Remember. Civilization is rules, getting up when the alarm clock goes off, uncomfortable underwear, commuting in traffic, standing on line at the DMV and paying bills.  Chaos on the other hand is laid back, sleeping in when it rains, no alarm clocks, putting sugar on anything, making slurping noises when you eat spaghetti and never having to contribute to the office birthday fund.Think about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB48RYPWBVFSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GICHT7G#wasThisHelpful","RB48RYPWBVFSX","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For anyone who has tried to shove the made-for-catfood plastic lid onto the half-eaten can of olives, or who has struggled with tin foil covers for the condensed milk, this is a small but wonderful breakthrough. Cheap plastic caps and lots of sizes, so whatever you have opened and eaten half of, you can find cover it up and save it for later.Oh, sure, you could be one of those people who immediately pours the leftovers into the little right-sized Tupperware container and close it (burping the lid, of course).  But if you are just an ordinary human being struggling against a tide of technology and overcrowded cupboards, you can't find 'em. And if you find the container, you can't find the lid. These doohickeys eliminate the middle man.  Can, cover, finished. Nothing to wash later on. And even better, you can see it's a can of Kitty Stew, or sliced, pitted olives. No guessing.  It eliminates one step of labor and helps prevent the ""What's that smell"" refrigerator search. Something in one of those plastic containers has gone rank and you have to open all 230 to find it.  With the cap, you know it's not the canned peaches because you just put them in a week ago, but those picked beets...aren't they from last Thanksgiving?There are lids for most can sizes(not the big giant ones like coffee cans or industrial sized pickles, but all regular stuff).  They're cheap so you can buy two sets because you know you're going to lose at least a couple.Very handy, affordably priced and, until I send them down the disposal, accidentally toss them in the trash, or otherwise get rid of them, they're a nice little extra.

"Brad Pitt spends a lot of time running down streets, sneaking around in the dark, walking through crowded corridors with other survivors, and as an exciting denouement, racing up and down almost identical laboratory corridors.  It's the end of the world, Living Dead style. There are some scary moments. And they are very good, which makes you see exactly how dismal the rest of the film is.  I was moderately entertained until the laboratory sequence, when I realized that being bitten by a ghoul was a picnic in the country compared to watching more of Pitt tiptoeing past zombies in labcoats, pushing security button door openers and piling gurneys against swinging doors. We have all seen the other movies, they all did the same thing.  ""28 Days"" and its sequel were better and they weren't wonderful.  The book the film is 'based' on, which was written by Max Brooks, son of comic genius Mel, is an oral history of our planet's encouters with zombies and very well done.  Too bad they just used the title.If you want to see a really chilling zombie film, something original but that sticks to our essential Romero Rules, you have to keep waiting. And if anyone knows of a film that lives up to the standard set by Romero's original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" please let me know.

"And even so, I was overcharged.Grant's last wife undertakes to tell us all about her brief fling and briefer wedded bliss with the acting icon. Let's simplify.  She was about 25 years younger and vapid; He was older, sophisticated and just not that interested. Not that he had other women, he was just was kind of lukewarm about the whole relationship. Maybe even women.  Whatever, it's mostly an on off-again/off again courtship. Grant doesn't seem exactly hot for this ingenue. He is unemotional. They date, nothing much happens. He disappears, he reappears. They date some more, they break up, reunite, break up, reunite, and then they get married. The marriage is rocky. Go figure.Ms. Cannon spares us not a moment of ennui, dragging us along through the entire lackluster romance. And when I say 'spares us nothing,' I'm not whistling Dixie. At the end of the story, we find her tormented, wondering where she went wrong, who failed whom, and could things have been different. So she asks God for the answer. And God responds by inspiring her to write a poem that explains it all. And she shares that poem with us. All of it.No, God did not smite her. We have a benevolent diety. And a patient one. The reader, on the other hand, wouldn't have hesitated.To sum up, there is nothing here.. Nothing to learn, no romance, no emotion, nothing to enjoy, no good gossip to savor.

"I tried to walk away.  Quit. Just say goodbye.  But it's impossible. How can you turn your back on Caroline, the evil genius who poses as a caring friend and mother but, in fact, is the source of all the real drama. The woman is sublime in her badness.  And then there's Teresa Guidice, with the amazing hair and crooked husband. Her Joe is literally as wide as he is tall, tough little bugger, except he's either narcoleptic or drunk all the time. Hard to tell.Teresa is the current Villain of the piece (I don't think the world at large is onto Caroline yet, but I hope they figure it out and soon).  She is hilarious. A woman of oversized assets, Teresa crams herself into clothing that is pink, leopard-spotted, shiny, feathered or leather-ish.  No color is too bright, no style too outr.  For this woman, sequins are the new black.  But she's not evil. Just jealous.  She is not, let's say, the smartest anchovy in the bagna cauda.  A published author, Mrs. Guidice 'writes' cookbooks. Ok, actually she just poses for pictures among the recipes collected by some worker bees, but still, standing and facing the camera is, you know, work. it must take hours to get that make up on. And somebody has to round up the kids.  And oh boy, what kids.The oldest, 11 going on 45, is a world-weary cynic, a model and dancer, who seems to know way, way too much about the ins and outs of marital relations and family dysfunction, not to mention teased hair, hair extensions and weekly pedicures. All three little girls who range down to about five, are fighters and biters. They whine, they complain, they pose hands on hips and toss their manes. Just like mama. One can only hope they surprise us all and don't grow up into what we're all expecting.Anyway, Teresa isn't bad, she just envies any woman younger, prettier or slimmer. Okay, in her crowd there are not many, these women obviously like to eat and their spandex capris aren't helping things out.  Neither is the make up.  Lashes out to there, orange lipstick on gigantically inflated lips. I mean, the lips are so big, I'll bet they need ladles to eat soup.  And the eye make up? I'm not kidding. If you want faux mink lashes, black liner and Super-Extending Mascara, I'll bet you have to drive down to Delaware to get it.  So we know how Teresa must feel. Even with all the Special Effects make up, there is something simian about her face. She's not a beauty and she's not so young. Or so skinny. When she encounters someone who is, watch out.Mostly Teresa is jealous of her sister in law, the sexy and slender (by comparison) Melissa Gorga...prettier and younger and wife to Teresa's brother. Who is more successful than Teresa's husband, not cheating on his wife, and not under indictment. Who wouldn't be jealous?  The brother is also as wide as he is tall, but he does have beautiful eyes and at least stays awake.  Mrs. Gorga thought she could sing at one point, and for almost one full year we watched various producers show up to get big bucks from her husband as they tried (almost successfully)to pretend she had talent. Anyway, Teresa hates her.There are other men and women besides the core group...we have extra sisters and brothers, parents and aunts and uncles, cousins, one idiot cousin in law and one gay one, and lots of frenemies, but aside from all having world-class heavyweight keisters, they don't count for much. They change sides, gossip, wear awful clothes and have their own rococo homes.  We don't care about them.  It's Caroline, Teresa and Melissa who are the magic.Caroline is older than the others, a lot older. And fatter.  And she always looks unkempt.  No wonder she stirs up trouble.  Her children are extremely strange. The boys have no visible means of support other than some questionable 'PR' business that trades on their mother's fame. They appear to be pushing 30, both of them, and their mom just bought them a ""really classy"" bachelor pad in Newark -- full of leatherette furniture and what looks to be at least three faux stone fountains. One of the sons...the visionary...treasures a dream of one day owning a combination strip-club/car wash.  The daughter (after many seasons' worth of trauma and skin of her teeth graduation from manicurist college)now has her own nail salon, also courtesy of a generous mama.Okay, are you hooked yet?  Trust me, watch this show. No matter how screwed up you are, how bad your family is, you can't sit through sixty minutes of this without thinking ""Whew.""  But for the grace of god and some decent taste in clothes, make up and men, there go all of us.I started out with Real Housewives of New York, but the women are at least 20 years past their sell-by dates.  No fun watching Grandma carousing in her Gucci hip boots. But the Jersey Gals...just try them.  I haven't even mentioned Jaqueline yet...or Caroline's sister from the first season who will not speak to her sister or discuss the show ever, with anyone...except TV bloggers and newspaper columnists and tabloids.  And Joe Guidice? Don't get me started.  He's going to jail, probably, and maybe Teresa will spend a night or two in dire incarceration as well.  Or Caroline's dad-in-law who was NOT, don't get her dander up on this) a member of organized crime in any way, shape or form, just because he was gunned down while entering his favorite restaurant (and it wasn't a sushi bar, know what I mean.

"I've had my Kindle for quite a while and just lost the original recharger. I got a new one from Amazon (after checking in with customer service to make sure it was what I needed).  It is about as idiot-proof as you can get, which is essential for me. You get this and the power cord, put it together, attach to the Kindle and plug it in.  It is a little pricey, since I'll bet it costs 30 cents to make in some prison factory somewhere, and really, they could just throw in the power cord for free, since they are gouging you for this gizmo, but I am starting to understand Amazon policy. I think.  They are so customer-centric, they err on our side all the time, so bargain basement pricing would hurt them.  On my original phone call, I asked about a different recharger and was given incorrect information.  I complained and within about ten minutes, the Amazon 'live chat' person fixed the dilemma and gave me both pieces free of charge.  A simple ""I'm sorry"" would have been okay, but this gracious offer knocked me out.  I've heard other people talk about how eager Amazon can be to fix things when they are truly in the wrong.  I've dealt with expensive department stores that aren't this sensitive or customer-friendly.  I know people love to complain about Amazon, but I have to say, I have never, in about ten years of doing business, had a single unsolved problem or one situation that left me unhappy. I can't thing of another retailer who has that kind of a record with me.  Imagine coming away from a shopping trip at Rite-Aid or Wal-Mart and thinking ""Boy, I'm really satisfied with the way they treated me...they knew what they were doing, went out of their way to help."" Yeah.Right. And you can see the flying pigs at the same time.So five stars for a simple product that does the job, but really, the stars are for how easy Amazon makes it do buy things.

"I am modern, pragmatic, a minimalist and absolutely impatient with froufrou, nonsense, tchatchkis and other silliness. You show me your unicorn collection and chances are I'm gonna take a swing at you.  So, there is no excuse whatsoever for me having the Teapot Beyond Teapot Fair with Tea Warmer Cozy.  Except...I love it.This is just the prettiest little teapot one could find. I have a very sturdy and serviceable Brown Betty that works just fine and an ultramodern pot that is all angles and laboratory glass that someone sent me from Italy. It is very hip.  But I don't love them.  That's reserved for my Teapot Fairy.  I'm not even embarrassed about saying the words.  Teapot Fairy.  There. Make something of it.For one thing, this little pot makes three fine cups of tea, which is to be expected.  Normally I'd swig my tea out of a mug that says Shop or Die. I'm one step away from eating my dinner out of the frying pan and consider styrofoam clamshells an acoutrement of fine dining. But I found myself sipping, not glugging. Out of a cup. With a saucer. With lemon slices. And sugar cubes.  Next thing you know, I'll be wearing underwear even when I don't expect company.But this is not just empty frivolity. This is a serious teapot.  The lid fits well, and the glass handle is heat-resistant so you can pick it up without burning yourself. The pot itself is made of tempered glass so you have no worries about pouring in the boiling water.  And then it sits on a pretty little glass bowl where your tiny little votive candle sets the mood and keeps the next two cups nice and warm for you! A festive little teaparty whenever you want.  Of course if you really want to push the boat out, you have make use one of those fancy blooming teas -- a special treat when you really need one.In the interests of honesty, I want to make it clear that I received this teapot in exchange for a review. Months and months ago. I was embarrassed to admit how gooey and silly I am about it, so I kept putting off the moment of truth. But here it is...five stars for something that's pretty and feminine and considerably more than just a pretty pot. In the even greater interests of honesty, I must admit that I am only a second generation cup drinker. My grandmother used to pour her tea from the cup into the saucer, blow on it, stir it with a Stella D'Oro Anisette Cresent, and then take a gracious but noisy slug. Her pinky would be raised, of course. We were not animals. And she always let me share the cookie.  My grandfather would only drink his tea out of a glass while hold a sugar cube between his teeth.  I have never mastered this trick and if you would try it, I suggest doing it while naked or else risking tea stains on your clothes. And I'd let it cool off a little first.Whether your lifestyle is simple, decorative or as in my case, semi-feral, I think you'll get a kick out of this pretty little pot. Sometimes it's nice to treat yourself like someone special.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NVMG0WJUMZ1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIK7ZW4#wasThisHelpful","R1NVMG0WJUMZ1Q","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For $20 you get a very well designed water bottle. The size is just right for bicycling, the stainless steel body is sturdy and has so far resisted my attempts to damage it by falling off my bike and onto the bottle.The Hydracentials Slim Grip is designed with hand holds so you can get a good grip on the thing, even if your palms are sweaty from pumping that bike uphill on a hot day.  There is a built in straw, it's easy to fill and has a 'leakproof' closure. So far so good. I have had a couple of bottles with screw tops you had to be Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson to open. They even give you a little instruction card on how to clean the thing, in case use of hot water and dish soap has eluded you until now.The size is generous, holding 25 ounces, it fits in bike carrier and the beverage holder in a car.  The only negative is that $20 price tag. Pretty high, since the Hydracentials isn't insulated or double walled, so liquids don't stay really cold after a about two hours.

"Once again Krud Kutter comes through with a cleaning product that works better than expected, doesn't require any heavy labor on the part of the user, and makes a dirty, disgusting job easier.  I have used their grease cleaners, household cleaners, carpet cleaners, and window cleaners and am a Big fan.  The Krud Kutter for Carpets gets rid of stains that a professional carpet cleaner swore were impossible.  The regular Krud Kutter cleaner got the EPA to back off and remove my bathroom from that list with Fukushima, Chernobyl and 3-Mile Island.  So, when I saw they had another cleaner for mold and mildew, I rejoiced and tried it on a really nasty culprit that keeps fighting me for possession of the bathtub.Normally I take straight chlorine bleach, soak paper towels in it, and place them along the discolored bathtub surround. It bleaches the caulking to a sparking white and removes all the lining in my lungs and the skin on my fingers.  I hate doing it, but I hate bathing with black gunk looking up at me too.  And a week later I do it again, because one thing you gotta say about mold and mildew around here, they are persistent.  I've been married to people who didn't hang around as long.Anyway, I gave Krud Kutter Mold and Mildew Stain a try. It works as well as the Chlorine Last Ditch Kill or Be Killed Method, but it's a lot easier to do. And the black gook has not come back as quickly...maybe it's not for gone good, but it's been a while and I'm hoping.  To make sure, I just spray a bit on a sponge when I do my regular cleaning and go over the grouting around the tub.  It just takes a minute, so even a lazy person like me is not overwhelmed.Once I overpowered the tub, I looked around for new worlds to conquer...and there it was: The Stinky Patio Chair Cushion. You could smell the mildew on this from down the block.  I wiped it down with Krud Kutter and let it sit in the sunshine for a day, and did it again, repeating the process three or four times. It got rid of the mildew and the stink.  Okay, maybe I would not bring the cushion inside, but outdoors on the patio, even My Neigbor Who Cleans did not make a face about it when she sat down, and this is a woman who practically has a coronary when she sees my kitchen.  Anyway, Krud Kutter scored another triumph and I can go to sleep at night without looking to see if Erin Brockovich is lurking around taking notes.

"After a certain age, our skin must come to a screeching halt when it comes to moisture. Suddenly I'm plagued with dryness, face, hands, everplace...and particularly on my legs.  I've been using various creams and lotion for the last couple of millenia, but I let those poor shins of mine go to Aitch Eee Double Hockeysticks in a handcart.  Shame on me.  This dryness leaves skin looking rough and red and flaky and makes legs itch like crazy. Usually right after I get in bed and get comfortable.  And I'm sorry, but having dry, flaky shins is such an Old Geezerette thing, it's embarrassing. I may have reached my sell-by date, but I'm not old. Not that old anyway. I shouldn't have problems my grandmother did.After I noticed how horrible my legs were getting, and after I scratched myself raw, I went out and spent a small fortune on various moisturizers but it was like locking the barn door after the horse died of old age.  My legs were still rough looking if I didn't marinate them twice a day.  I saw the Eucerin on offer from Vines and gave it a shot.  Boy howdy. One use and it was like the skin on my legs was drinking the stuff up. I didn't have to rub...it just sank it.  My skin looks the way it should, the way it used to...smooth and sleek. And it feels soft, no ugly flaking. Best of all, there is no itching.  I use it on my arms and legs now, especially elbows and knees, which can look like the joints on a camel if you aren't careful.I love Eucrin. It's certainly inexpensive, it works better than I expected. It feels clean going on, there is no greasy residue, it soaks into your skin fast, doesn't leave oily stains on clothes or bed linens, and it doesn't have that old person Ben Gay odor.  The fragrance is extremely light, almost undetectable, and not anything one would connect with old folks. If you have severely dry skin, and it itches, try this stuff.  I can't tell you about how it works on Eczema, but since it is gentle enough for babies, it might help adults without any harmful side effects.

It is too light, the ink doesn't show up clearly, and the magnet is not strong enough to keep it on the refrigerator door.

"My hair is naturally a sort of dirty blonde, and I started playing with the color when I was fifteen. That was a long time ago. Long.  Bleach, dye, streaks, highlights? You bet. Does anyone remember those wonder Sherry and Mahogany cellophane wraps from the 80s?  I like anything that revives the color and saves me an expensive trip to the salon. Right now I have a sort of dark blonde with various highlights.  Looks nice, but boy, the upkeep needs a professional.  I used the John Frieda Warm Brunette Glosser as an experiment. I was afraid it might be too dark and destroy the highlighting, but it works rather well.  I am going to be able to wait another two or three weeks between salon appointments. Right now, every six weeks or so has been my schedule, but this might help me hold out for 9 weeks, maybe more. Since I'm about to retire, saving money is important and for $6.95, this is a good option.On the downside, it's messy, drippy, and I don't know the long-term damage it might do if used regularly.  If you hate using drippy home hair colorings, you won't like this stuff any better. But if you want a cheap temporary fix, get used to it.  You have to do the coloring in the shower, in takes a little time, and it's not the most fun ever, but I'm willing to suffer for beauty. (Who am I kidding...I'm willing to suffer to save money.)  After using it, my hair is a tiny bit darker, but the blonder highlights remain, so it doesn't look like a bad one-note dye job.  And there is certainly a lot of gloss...which is I normally acquire by spending even more money at the salon.  So, for a money-saving and pretty good way to get some extra time out of your hair coloring, for a way to make your hair look shiny and sexy, Four Stars.  If it didn't drip down my neck in the shower, I'd give it five.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXVSTQPGLD1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLS554Q#wasThisHelpful","R3BXVSTQPGLD1Y","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't care how many closets you have, it's not enough.  I am forever hunting for the grey shirt with the white stripe, that other silk blouse, no not that one, the one with the double buttons on the cuff.  And didn't I used to have pants in the perfect camel color, because I haven't seen them in a long time. In other words, my closets are like most peoples...overstuffed, disorganized and chock full of clothes I don't remember buying, let alone ever wearing. And why is everything so small?I tried the J.S. Hanger Natural Wood Skirt Hangers/Pant Hangers with Etc., and they work just fine. The wood is a nice weight, not too heavy but substantial. The metal clips have a nice snap to them...it doesn't feel like the spring is going to wear out soon. And they're nice and tight. I used them to hang five pairs of trousers, one of which is lined wool and quite thick, one is silk and slippery, and the rest linen and wool blends.  The thick trousers are held perfectly. The clips provide enough room so I'm not worried about them digging into the fabric and leaving marks. The slipper silk, which half the time ends up on the floor of the closet, is held tightly too.  I gave them a little tug and it looks like they are there to stay.  I notice one reviewer says the hangers are cheap and flimsy.  I don't know what kind of hangers they're used to, but these are as good as any I've seen. Maybe not the kind the haute couture comes with, but certainly as good as the kind most of us use, probably a bit better.  The quality is certainly above average, even for hangers that cost a bit more.If you have limited closet space, or are one of those weirdos who like to be organized, I don't think you can find a better set of trouser/skirt hangers. Especially not for this price.  Hangers are one of those items where you can pay a fortune for junk or find the perfect set at the 99C store.  No rhyme nor reason. These are at the top of the Hanger List.  They save space, are extremely lightweight, feel durable, and do exactly what you need them to do.  If you travel and use a garment bag, they'll come in handy as well, saving lots of space.I'm thinking of getting a couple of sets for Christmas gifts this year.  Everyone on the planet has enough scented soap, aromatherapy candles and bath salts, but nobody ever has enough hangers. Think about it.Or else I'll buy a bunch and keep them for myself...the more likely scenario. So what if I spend another Christmas Eve at Rite-Aid wondering who got the lavender bath set and who got the Orchard Body Spray Collection last year.  At least I won't be ironing my silk pants every time I want to wear them.  If I remember to hang them up in the first place. So, five stars for the hangers, zero for me for throwing stuff on the closet floor and hoping for little cleaning elves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOG7OXI93XFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9VP2IU#wasThisHelpful","R1TOG7OXI93XFM","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little gizmo is now in my car glove compartment, along with the Emergency Perfume, mascara, hairbrush and moisturizer.  I don't know if I will ever need it, but there is a feeling of security just knowing it's there. I don't camp and I don't go places that are dangerous, but you never know. And I have a lousy sense of direction. Once while heading for a shoe sale I ended up in some quarry where there were big red signs about dynamiting and a lot of angry men in hard hats came running at me.The Friendly Swede Carabiner has a 3 inch bundle wrapped in braided paracord. The whole package is small and virtually weightless, but there is a bunch of good stuff inside.  I know because I went an unraveled the darn thing.  You should trust the Friendly Swede. Once you unwrap that paracord, you can't rebraid it. I keep mine in a tiny leather pouch now...not much bigger, but not nearly as cool.What you get for your $15 is a lot. Starting that paracord ...nine feet of it and potentially very helpful if you remember what Bear Grylis taught us about building a shelter out of sticks and  leaves, bundling our belongings, or finding dry wood and making little floats that help us when crossing a stream or lake, that sort of thing. However It  doesnt look terribly strong and I would not use drag myself up or down a mountain or anything like that. And given my fear of heights, if there are mountains in front of me, Im staying put anyway.The grenade also contains two separate fishing lines with hooks, sinkers and bobs for each.  Not fancy, but I dont think a fish would carealthough those of us who do go fishing know that those little rascals can make themselves scare when we really want them.  You get a nice hunk of tin foil, which can be used as a heat reflector, to wrap your leftover fish, turn into a solar still (Bear Grylis explained it allnot much water, but better than none...and if you didnt watch him or Les Stroud or the rather sexy Mike Hawk and wife, you should rent the tapes or stay indoors.The kit also contains an alcohol swab for cleansing stuff like wounds and a needle for those who dont have the foresight to have a sewing kit. The instructions say this can be used for suturing wounds, but if we are camping and you have foolishly torn yourself open and expect me to sew you back together, it's not gonna work.  Id pretend I was looking for water and just leave you.  And there's a chance I would have sucked the alcohol out of the pad when I discovered we were lost.  On the other hand, I would not go all Donner Party on you either so look at the bright side.There is quite a bit of wire included as wellfor making snares to trap small animals.  I dont know if I could make a snare that would fool even that one rabbit that the other rabbits point at, but at least its there.  Most important is the fire starter. Yes, you can actually make sparks with it. They even provide some tinder. Les Stroud made it very clear that the stick rubbing thing ain't gonna happen, so this is crucial. Fire keeps away big animals, makes you easier to spot, and keeps you warm.  I never remember to include matches in my first aid kit, so this is a very good thing. You also get a tiny but very sharp knife...enough for cooking purposes, I suppose, and cleaning the fish, that sort of thing. And another thing my survival materials did not have.All in all, the kit seems well thought out. I'd give one to those outdoorsy types who like to camp, or to anyone who lives or travels through underdeveloped areas.  For me, the ""grenade"" is going to sit in my glove compartment, forgotten, along with the reminder about my 2014 car registration (It's a smog year...who can bother?).  But if I ever find myself down at the Silver Queen Quarry instead of the Glendale Mall again, I'll feel a little bit better.  Although I have not tried the product, it certainly looks practical and provides the essentials.

"I used the Durable Pet Comb by Dog Grooming Supplies on my large and independent-minded cat.  Anna Nicole is enormous, has enough fur for herself and at least one other animal, and an attitude that some might call 'entitled.'  Others might say 'rabid.'  She looks like a long-haired Siamese, white with pale gray and peach markings, and is quite beautiful, unless you cheese her off. Then all you see is Teeth and Size.  She moves fast for a big 'un.Anyway, Anna Nicole (aka AhNo) developed a sizable mat on her chest.  I wanted to cut it off, but we have this basic disagreement of philosophies when I get out the brush and scissors.  I try to be gentle, she tries to kill me.  And I'm terrified that as she wriggles and twists, I'm liable to hurt her.  To make a long story short, I used the comb as a guard.  First I got it in position under the mat, took the pet grooming scissors (they have a ball at the end of the blades, instead of a point...no accidental jabbing of critter or human) and started cutting. What surprised me is that the grooming comb was also working to gently separate the hairs, sort of dematting as it protected AhNo's skin.  She had some mats-in-the-making on her tummy, which combed out quite easily. You just sort of wriggle and glide the comb and it gets through the tangles without pulling. Scissors help where the mat is severe.Brushing does keep the mats from forming, but this cat is a mat factory.  The comb is non-invasive and takes out a lot of loose hairs when I groom her. She has not minded me combing her and kind of likes it.  Her sister, Jane Air (also known as ""Please come out, I know you're around somewhere) appeared briefly to look confused and go back behind whatever it is she goes behind.  I'm afraid she is the kind of cat the other cats would whisper about. If I ever see her again, I'll try the comb on her.  She doesn't bite.  Her trick is waiting until I'm asleep in bed and then diving on my stomach from the big dresser.Still, they're mine and I love them.  The comb works well, it helps untangle beginner mats, the curved teeth make it easy, and my extremely fussy cat is not bothered by it, and I have not been lacerated or punctured while using it, so Five Stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MC2HHE4IQ9AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSY9170#wasThisHelpful","R1MC2HHE4IQ9AS","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small flashlight from Rayovac provides an awful lot of light. You can dim it down for walking the dog at night, or trying to find the bathroom during a power outage, or turn it on full blast and land a small plane in your back yard.  The weight is nice, not too heavy, but with a good heft. Nice to hold.  I do wish it had a wrist strap so you didn't have to keep your hand wrapped around.  I can probably work something out and add a lanyard or something, but that's the one thing this light is missing.Besides modesty.It claims to be 'indestructible.""  Now, I don't take this sort of thing as a challenge, but I'm remarkably adept at breaking stuff.  Without even trying. I don't think they want me in most Nordstrums stores anymore since an incident with a rack of raincoats and a wall display that fell over, which wasn't even my fault. Mostly.  And when I was a baby, my grandmother named me Mountain Killer.  Not in a nice way.  I have gone through cars, hammers, husbands, all sorts of things that are supposed to be durable but, in fact aren't.The folks who tested the Rayovac  dropped it from a height of 30 feet without problems. The casing is aluminum and titanium alloy. I have no idea what this is, but it sounds good. Also it has an IPX4 Water Resistance Rating.  This means you can drop it in the water. I like to sail, but to tell you the truth, anything I drop overboard, especially something that I'd use in the dark, like a flashight, is going to stay there. I don't go in after it, so this part will probably not be tested.  The description also says that the rubber cover on the lens and tail are great shock absorbers.  Maybe.  Also the LEDs last ""a lifetime"" and will never need to be replaced. This is another claim that confuses me. Whose lifetime? I'm not saying how old I am, but a carrot could probably be guaranteed to last a lifetime if we're getting personal. So I'm giving the flashlight five stars because it does a lot of good things. The 'indestructible' claim remains to be tested. And the 'lifetime' guarantee.If it does break, I'll come back and change the review.

"You really can't. Because somebody finally figured out that the best place to keep the slicing surfaces is inside the mandoline.  The OXO Good Grips Complete Grate and Slice Set is the perfect size and has all the attachments you need. Best of all, you store the grating/slicing platforms inside the container. I must have bought a dozen of these things over the years and somehow the grating surfaces disappear...they're like socks.  One minute they're there, next...Poof. Gone.  And since they aren't expensive, I buy more, except the only blade surfaces I have never fit the machine and I try to force them together and next thing I know, there is blood everywhere and nobody wants to even taste the carrot salad.  Cowards.  Anyway, this eliminates the problem. The container even has little slots so the attachments tuck away neatly once you snap on the cover. They couldn't escape if they tried.There are four blades, one for regular grating, one for coarse, one to slice and one for julienne slicing.  This gives you those skinny little strips that are impossible to cut by hand unless you are an expert and have nothing else to live for and the bathroom cleans itself. The set also comes with a food holder, so you are not risking your finger tips or knuckles everytime you make coleslaw.  The container snaps shut to hold leftovers, if you so choose, but really, who is going to risk losing the slicing gizmos. Keep the blades inside the slicer container. For storing leftovers, dig out one of the  storage containers inside your cupboard. You know the ones I mean...without the lids.  Why is it we all have 1 million little plastic containers of every shape and size, and one million different lids, but none of them go together? What happens at night? Do the lids change places with the ones next door? Is there some alien plot where Space Invaders do the switch to make us crazy and weaken our species?The blades on this Oxo Grater/Slicer are very sharp, by the way.  I just grated some past-their-sell-by carrots with no problem, and a piece of Jicama, which after you taste it, you'll know why it's not very popular.The gizmo comes with rubber feet so it won't skid...another smart little idea.  Nothing like slicing away at the jicama and have it fall on the floor where the dog steps on it and the cats chase hunks under the refrigerator and you have to scoop 'em up and rinse them off and hope nobody saw.  Please note: If you have ever eaten at my house, this has never happened; I am theorizing. Also the dog never licked the plates before they went in the dishwasher. Of after they came out.The product description says this is 'color coded.'  Every cutting surface has its own bright primary color, but I'm kind of missing the code.  I can see that the holes on one grater are bigger than on the other. They didn't have to be different colors.  And you can see that the Julienne slicer has a second blade. No trickery, no disguises. Even if it wasn't green, I would have figured it out. Eventually.  Maybe OXO doesn't realize just how clever I am. On the other hand, they know that I keep Tupperware lids and mandolin blades, so maybe they grade on a curve.  So, except for that mysterious 'code,' I'm delighted with the OXO Good Grips Complete Grate and Slicer Set. It's small, easy to store, has the right blade type for most kitchen jobs, looks nice, is convenient to use, well-designed and so far has not caused any mutilation.

"I have never used a programmable feeder before. My cats eat the same amount, no matter how much is placed in their bowl. When going away for the weekend, I'd just pour out a huge dish of dry food and several big bowls of water and ask a friend to check on them every day.  But the Crestuff Machine was offered to me for a review, so I decided to try this higher tech option.The unit is nice looking, feels substantial, and seems to be well made.  It works quite well and has several features that make it fun.  To start with, assembly is no problem, since it is just about complete straight out of the box. But programming the autofeed features is very difficult. It took any number of attempts, the use of a lot of creative swear words and recourse to the bourbon before I finally got it to do all the stuff it's supposed to. Or at least enough to reach a happy medium.The gizmo dispenses anywhere from 1/4 cup to 2 cups of food at a time, at times you set. You program in how much and how often.  In my case these were not precisely what I wanted but I was frustrated with trying to get it to work and as soon as I figured things out enough to get food dispensed and the timer set, I said 'enough.' If the cats want things more to their liking, they can reset the thing. Programming does get easier once you do it for a while, but there is a learning curve. A big one.When I set it up, I was not 100% convinced that it would work properly and feared some mishap...that it would jam or the food not come out. None of these things happened, so to begin with, I had it dispensing a lot of food. There were no failures, so I managed to cut the amount and number of feedings to a more reasonable amount and number, which eliminated a lot of food on the floor.  With most cats, leaving food out is not a problem. They'll take what they need and leave the rest for later. A dog, on the other hand, will eat until he explodes. Portioning is essential with pups. Still, I am a pessimist. If I'm going to be away for a day or two, I prepare for the worst case scenario, where the gizmo breaks and the catsitter is kidnapped by a roving band of disgrunted dachshunds. There is always that emergency bowl of dry food and a big bowl of water on the kitchen counter just in case. I mean, cats are cats. If something goes wrong, they'll blame me.The Crestuff has another interesting feature: it lets you record a message for your animals...you can call them to eat, tell them you love them, remind them to marry for money, whatever.  This may be reassuring. Probably is for dogs, but I have a feeling the cats just nudge one another and roll their eyes.  Besides, invitations don't work on cats. If they want to eat, they eat. Mostly they just slink up to the bowl, take a bite, look bored and walk away.  Of course if their dish is ever empty, they find me and torture me. But then, they do like torturing humans and it might not be food related at all.  And I notice it's not my voice that attracts them...it's the little buzzing noise the machine makes before the food comes out.  That makes them perk up their ears. My voice? Not so much.All in all, this is a real convenience for people who work or have to leave their animals for a day or two at a time. My Anna Nicole (aka AhNo) and Jane Air (aka I Know You're Here, Please Come Out) seem perfectly happy, the machine is their good and faithful servant, and if it just scratched their heads and changed the kitty litter, I'm sure they'd consider replacing me.  You never know with cats.  So four stars for operation. The fifth star would require easier set up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ICNTSQXMZYFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNK619K#wasThisHelpful","R2ICNTSQXMZYFL","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The package containing the five canvas prints arrived a couple of days ago.  The first thing I noticed was how carefully and well packed it was, each piece separately swaddled in plastic wrap, and all contained in an exceptionally sturdy box.  Whoever packages these products makes sure that arrive in good condition.The second thing I noticed was the weight. These are not flimsy little nothings.  Each piece is mounted on a solid frame, the canvas stretched to wrap around the sides. Nothing chintzy or cheap about the construction.  The way they are constructed on a frame makes mounting very easy. We just measured, hammered in the hangars and the work was done. Per the manufacturers instructions, we left a couple of inches between each space. The five pieces make a BIG display.  In this case, the stretch across the wall behind an oversized green leather sofa. The sofa is fat...overstuffed and fairly plane. It cried out for an accent, and this group of panels does the job brilliantly.If you have bought reproduction paintings in the past, you may be surprised at the quality of the product by Global Nature Crafts. Usually pre-framed or ready to hang work that is affordably priced is pretty bad in terms of quality and construction.  These aren't disappointing and, in fact, are much better than what I expected.  I bought them for my niece who chose the subject matter. In this case, it's a misty autumnal forest in very pretty greens, browns and yellows.  The separation is done with care, not matching, but organized to work together as five separate pieces that form a single unit.  The colors are lovely. Realistic and somewhat subdued. The canvas is top quality and the grouping looks like we paid much, much more than the amazingly affordable price of under $150.This is, by the way, a BIG grouping. The individuals panels measure a little over one foot wide by just under 3 feet high. When you put them together across a wall, using the guidline 2 inch separation, you have a major statement.  If the colors were not so good, if the subject matter not so likable, and the quality not so admirable, you'd see it. But this -- all 16 feet across in total -- is just about perfect.  Bold enough to be  noticed and admired, but it won't overwhelm the room.I could not be more surprised at how good this is, how high the quality, or how great it looks. My niece is thrilled.  It took us almost no time to measure the wall, figure out the spacing and hang all five pieces.  And believe me, I can make a mess out of putting a magnet on a refrigerator.Global Nature Crafts makes dozens of different styles.  If you have an empty wall and want to make it look good (and like you spent a small fortune), you cannot go wrong with this. My niece had been looking for something to put up on that wall for ages. When the manufacturer contacted me and asked if I would review this product, I took one look and eagerly accepted.  When I do say 'yes' to a review request, I tend to be harder on the product, but in this case, I'm almost afraid to say how much I like it.  I have not looked at other reviews, but I suspect they must be equally good.  It's just a fine product at a fine price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XSQIU3CAFM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006SDI6X6#wasThisHelpful","R23XSQIU3CAFM5","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for an affordable knockoff of Hermes Birkin, keep looking.  People who like the style but are sane and find $18,500.00 a little steep for a purse, have made Birkin copies a cottage industry.  And good copies are worth it. The birkin and its better wannabe cousins are big. Like satchels. They can be used as overnight bags. They're durable. The leather is top quality, the sewing is sturdy and you're not afraid the handles are going to fall off.  The size makes a statement.  Okay, maybe the statement is ""I have way too much money or I want you to think I do,"" but even so.  And  to be perfectly honest, if I had that kind of money, I couldn't spend it on a purse.  My car isn't worth that much.  Or half that much. I'm level headed. I'd throw the money away on botox, spa vacations and cute cabana boys, that kind of stuff.Anyway, getting back to the Big Handbag Shop version, if you wanted a knock off, this won't fool anyone. It's too small, the leather is mediocre, and the lining is cheap.  The real Birkin (or its better copies) is really big, weighs a ton, and can hold a small dog, portable umbrella, hair dryer, address book, curling iron, make up bag, cell phone and the other accoutrements of the stylish woman with money burning a hole in her pockabook.  I bought my good copy in Italy; the not so good one came as a gift. The good copy cost close to $300, but it's made of ostrich leather, with heavyweight hardware and a thick silk lining. This one costs half that, but for $150, I still expect a decent purse, even if it's not pretending to be somebody else.  Sure, for that price I'm not going to walk around flaunting the skin of an exotic bird, but it should not look like it's coming apart at the seams either.  After six months of minimal use, mine shows a lot of wear and tear.  One of the little metal footies has already fallen off; the hardware is lightweight and cheap looking, the handles don't have that hand sewn look, and there is nothing that makes this look special. If you know handbags, you might pay $40 for it and use it for everyday.  But you'd never convince one of Oprah's spaniels or Lindsay's little Yorkie to travel around in it.

"What a good little pencil. The point is thin, making it easy to create those feathery little strokes that are best. The color is not too dark, not too light. If your hair is light brown to blond and you have fair skin, the shade is will probably match your natural brows.  The pencil lasts all day long, doesn't smear, the tip isn't soft so you are not constantly resharpening.  The only thing I wish is that there were a sharpener in the lid. That's a brilliant idea and all pencils should have one.Most eyebrow makeup tips have been around for a while: Don't overpluck, brush eyebrows up and out before using the pencil, make pencil strokes that resemble eyebrow hairs, don't 'draw' on the eyebrow, and use a powder or liquid to thicken and fill in. And always trim, don't pluck, those long rogue hairs.  I did find one tip that was new and really makes a difference.  After you've done your brow make up, take some flesh colored concealer a shade or two lighter than your skin below the brow, and the same with a concealer a shade or two darker above the brow (use a pencil or a thin angled brush to apply). If you do it right, it's a subtle frame for the brows that sets off the eye area. Looks very good.The Vincent Longo pencil is an excellent addition to your brow make up, it's easy to use, the color is natural.  Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL49B662M65SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z5YBK0#wasThisHelpful","RL49B662M65SP","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Macarons are tiny, crispy and chewy, sort of meringue textured, but reinforced with ground almonds, and filled with a variety of delicious concoctions, from chocolate ganache to fruit blends.  They're tiny, just two bites and all gone, and completely addictive. After tasting one, I was so hooked, I bought a cookbook and started baking. I mean, who wants to sit in a bakery guzzling plate after plate while people snap photos and shake their heads? Nope, I decided to make 'em at home and stuff myself in private. My first batch wasn't quite right, the second okay, but as I continued to bake them, they improved. Advice from a friend, someone who actually knows what he's doing in a kitchen, helped a lot. Now I make them often, because they are impressive and look way more difficult than they are. Although I now have several books, when I saw this little item, free on Kindle and I couldn't resist.Martha Stone is a no-nonsense baker. She provides a great basic recipe, a few twists on the basic, and even adds those helpful little things that the expensive cookbooks make you figure out for yourself (or ask that generous friend about). Like wait until the batter has dried a little before baking, don't get over-eager and try to split or fill them them too soon.  Little tips, but essential. And some of her recipes are genius. She offers a variation that's made with sumac in the mix. Sumac is a somewhat lemony spice. Paired with the writer's suggested orange filling, it is the perfect balance of sweet/tart citrusy deliciousness.The fillings are so good, you'll want to grab a spoon and forget the macaron.  Some are unusual. Mango and Dulce De Leche is so good, you want to run around stuffing it in people's mouths. Some are traditional unions in a new form, like Pear and Earl Grey Tea. She even has one for ketchup filling, which I haven't tried yet. But it sounds pretty good. I have tried tomato marmalade and like it, so why not a spicy, jammy ketchup filling?Anyway, the price is right, the writer knows what she's doing, her recipes are easy to understand, you don't have to be Martha Stewart to get good results.

"When it comes to this type of grooming, the best is professional waxing. If you choose the DIY route, the Bic Soleil Shave and Trim seems like a good alternative. Other options for home hair removal include depilatories, but not for the bikini area, I hope, and that Epi-Lady contraption that grabs the hairs a few at a time and rips them out. Yeah. Right. Just as soon as I finish poking my eye with a stick.Anyway, most of us choose shaving.  The Bic is the first to combine a shaver and a trimmer. Smart stuff. You can use the razor for a clean, hairless shave in certain areas and the trimmer to groom others.  Both are both kept in that little torso container, so they stay handy. In theory. The shaver is a good one, with 3 blades for a close, smooth shave, and a pivoting head that glides over curves easily. I've used those wand-shaped trimmers before, but this removes hair more easily and moves better, probably because of the triple razors and fancy pivoting. The trimmer attachment slips onto the razor and stays in place until you take it off. It has 1/4 inch of clearance, which is a good length.  Remember, you do need something to work with; if there's not 1/2 an inch of material to shave down there, there is nothing for the trimmer to get hold of.The problems with shaving are it must be done very often, there is rough stubble, and some skin types react by going bumpy.  The Bic Soleil provides partial solutions to all of these.  The trimmer is made especially for grooming in this area. By not cutting down to the surface of the skin, the stubble situation isn't as bad, and so far so good regarding the bumps. By the way, these can be prevented with some smart shaving techniques (except for very sensitive skin). If they do happen, they are treatable.Bumps occur when hair follicles are irritated or infected. A clean, sharp razor and light touch help prevent this.  Pressing down irritates the skin. If you need to go over an area, take your second sweep in the direction of hair growth so there's less pull. Shave in the shower. Hot water steams open follicles, and washing first removes dead skin that can harbor bacteria. And good exfoliation, particularly on the legs, will eliminate ingrown hairs. Also, always use a good quality shaving lotion. It holds hair up so the razor can cut cleanly, provides 'glide' and essential moisture. And don't shave too often. Every other day at the most.Afterwards, rinse in cold water and, if you like, try an after-shave preparation with salicylic acid or glycolic acid and aloe vera. In any case, the last step should ALWAYS be a splash of witch hazel. The stuff is magic. It's anti-bacterial, a very nice toner for the face and body, and tightens the skin. It can even help tighten eye bags (a little), and it helps skin retain moisture.But back to the razor...it's not perfect, but it is the best among the similar products that I've tried, and I've tried most brands. It has the trimmer option which others don't, the trimmer works well, and it helps eliminate some of the skin issues resulting from shaving. So, Five stars...Brazilian if they have any.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBGIW3UUMI54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D18ZDM8#wasThisHelpful","R3JBGIW3UUMI54","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second good kitchen scale. Until recently, I had a dreadful Weightwatcher style metal platform-on-a-spring-type of scale, which is useless for any real kitchen work.  I then bought a very stylish and expensive kitchen scale which is flat, slender, easy-to-store, useful and accurate. Mostly expensive.  When I saw this one, I liked the bowl, which can be used or removed. Not as storage friendly as my other model, but for the price, who could resist.  This one features an oversized weight read out, you can set it for normal or metric measurements if you prefer. And there is a 60-second shut off feature so you don't waste batteries.  The bowl fits nicely on the unit, and has a little lip so it is secure and won't slide.  When not in use, you can pop the bowl on upside down and you have a protective cover. The bowl has a lip for easy pouring, is dishwasher safe, and just the right size for most kitchen tasks. I use it mostly for baking and it have not experienced any problems.Some of the things I really like about this unit are the size, which is somewhat compact, the nice styling, the attention to detail...big backlit readout, easy conversion from pounds and ounces to K/g, and the TARE feature.  This is just a fast and easy way to weigh your own bowl, if you use one, and have the gizmo do the subtraction automatically.  I am not mathematically gifted, and were it not for the extra toes, wouldn't even try. The scale goes up to 4 1/2 pounds, which is plenty for my purposes. I bake bread, mostly, but not in tremendous quantities because then I would eat it in tremendous quantities and when it came time to weight me, I'd have to head to one of those highway truck scales.You don't need to fuss around with the Smart Weigh. It's ready to use, the batteries are included, and they're those nice little AAs. For some reason, all my other scales now require the round battery that I have to schlep to the hardware store to get. If I remember, which does not happen often. With these, if you run out, there are usually two lurking in the junk drawer...or you could just ravish some flashlight or other appliance.I've read the negative reviews. These mention difficulty in getting the scale to zero out. I didn't have a problem, and I'm about as technically gifted as a rock.  I still confuse the tv remote and my phone.  Two other reviewers say they received defective models, which is a problem and I hope they used Amazon's good replacement policy or demanded their money and postage costs back.  As for me, I like this very much. I like having the bowl, so I can weigh liquid or wettish ingredients without having to remember to use the TARE feature, I like the option of just using the platform. I like the size and the stability, and I like the accuracy (tested upon receipt by weighing coins...which is kind of fun).Baking is, for me, an exact science. My grandmother's kitchen equipment consisted of some pots that were so dented, they never sat straight. She measured with her fist, any handy spoon, or a teacup without a handle that was reserved for the purpose.  She cooked on a huge woodburning stove (In Brooklyn, in the 1950s!) with no thermometer and no oven gauge. And she turned out the lightest, fluffiest pastries and cakes, she could make a spongecake that floated, an ethereal souffl, incredible bread, and just about anything else she chose.  Me, if I so much as add an unneeded chocolate chip, the roof falls in and the cat goes crazy.  I've used the scale at least twice a week for a couple of weeks and have not had a single problem. The bowl has been in and out of the dishwasher every time and is doing fine.  The scale makes life easier, makes baking easier, and helps ensure good results. For under fifteen bucks, it's worth having.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H4EO1CQJX78I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPPXRCE#wasThisHelpful","R3H4EO1CQJX78I","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just came back from a doctor appointment, so my weight was fresh in my mind when I found that the Smart Weight bathroom scale had arrived.  The first thing that struck me was how attractive it is, consisting of a white frame and clear center. The read out section is about three times larger than on my much more expensive digital scale. I never remember to carry my glasses so I usually can't see the damage. This makes the bad news impossible to miss. It's even backlit in case you were trying to fool yourself that those three donuts you wolfed down (on top of breakfast) were walked off when you got up to get some ice cream.With the Smart Weigh, set up is easy, and the scale comes with 4 batteries so you don't have to empty out the flashlight every time you want to know how much you weigh.  Best of all, it uses double A  which everyone usually has in their junk drawer. My old scale requires a round battery that is not sold at the supermarket, requires a separate trip to buy, and costs quite a bit more. When I even remember to buy one. And then it only tells me bad things and makes me wonder if I need one of those things that makes a beeping noise when I back up.The Smart Weight was right on the button in terms of accuracy. Unfortunately.  The larger numbers made sure I got a really good look at how much I'd gained in the last few days.  And there's a sort of holding pattern that keeps the numbers lit up for a few seconds, in case you are a complete masochist or you have a husband/wife/friend who enjoys a good laugh.  After a couple of seconds, the light goes out and the scale shuts down so you aren't wasting batteries. The scale goes up to 800 pounds, so there is some leeway for those among us who think bacon and donuts are a match made in heaven.The scale has a number of good features. There is a warning light to let you know the batteries are running down. No more skipping breakfast, stepping on the scale and finding no results.  There is also a little gizmo that lets you change weight measurement from pounds to kilograms or stone.  I like this because  a kilo is 2.2 pounds...instantly your weight is cut in half. And a stone is 14 pounds. You can weight 280 pounds and it's only 20 stone...you'd feel like you had anorexia! Plus, it doesn't scream when you step on it.A few reviewers found that this Smart Weight is inaccurate.  I have not had this problem. My other scale, which I moved to the guest bathroom, let visitors be miserable, shows me the same weight.  Some reviews say you have to hold still and balance carefully. Well, sure. But leaning or wriggling will jigger the numbers on any scale. I've even figured out how to lean exactly right so that the monster in the doctor's office, the one with the weights that slide, counts me as a good four pounds lighter. You sort of hang one hip over the side, keep your right foot foot flat but only half on the weighing platform, and pray the nurse isn't watching.The cost of the Smart Weight is just $20.  I paid over three times that much for my other scale and this one is just as good in terms of accuracy, and a better piece of equipment given the cheaper and more accessible batteries, the nicer design, the bigger and brighter read out and the kilo/pound/stone option.  After at least 3 weeks of use, not a single problem has occurred, it continues to be accurate, and I'm very pleased. Not any smaller though. It occurs to me that in a perfect world when your weight crossed some set point, the refrigerator door would automatically lock and you'd go on the No Fly List at the pizza delivery place.  Scale people, can you work on this? In the meantime, the Smart Weigh deserves five weighty stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DO2VSSZ5KIMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTXW9A6#wasThisHelpful","R3DO2VSSZ5KIMH","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found these at the Polish Arts website at about the same price, along with some that are twice as big and twice as expensive.  This is a nice size for wearing under a coat...just right to keep the chill off your neck.  They wrap around with a nice overlap, feel soft against the skin, aren't itchy like wool, costly like cashmere, or icy cold like silk.  The Polish site has more colors and I selected white, beige, blue and red.  I occasionally wear one as a headband at the gym (viva 1985) or to give a little life to a dark sweater and trousers.The 20% polyester may turn some people off, but in fact, it just makes them easier to wash and iron.

"Secrets is silly.  The information may be first class, but the producers have given us something that's hard to take seriously.  First of all, the voice-over is portentious; the most minute discovery is greeted with awe.  The word 'centuries' is repeated like an incantation. Oh yeah, this series was made for American audiences and is packed with all the power and drama of Geraldo Rivera's opening Al Capone's airshaft.  They manage to make the discovery of Richard III's skeleton seem like the work of a bunch of screwballs.  And to be fair, they're probably not all that wrong.The Hunt For The Tomb was spearheaded by The Richard the III Society, an organization that is run by and composed of two extraordinarily dedicated people: Philippa Langley and Simon Farnaby.  Miss Langley is a nervous-looking blonde lady. She calls herself a screenwriter but has yet to write anything  and seems to have a lot of time on her hands.  Mr. Farnaby is a television actor who has not been over-utilized by the media, let's just say.Obviously ""Secrets"" must be paying for some of the uncovering because every expense is spared.  This is not a show that throws money around. In addition to plenty of stock footage, they throw caution to the winds when it comes to digging up the remains, utilizing bulldozers to gouge out this archeological rarity. It's only when the earthmover uncovers some human legs that we get the dozers out and the diggers in.Real investigators take over and carry out chores like carbon dating, DNA testing, and such.  Preliminary exams reveal that our skeleton does indeed have a spinal deformity.  This is big news because scholars who defend  Richard III say that his famous hunchback was just Tudor propaganda.  Turns out, Richard III may have been a twisted little fellow after all.  Amazingly enough, the world greeted this information with stoicism.  Philippa, however, is beside herself with grief and has an on-camera melt down.  ""I'm sorry, guys,"" she mumbles, voice cracking. ""I can't do this"" and staggers away, leaning on Simon for support.Next we have some more interesting dirt. We are shown portraits of Richard and told these are probably inaccurate, the result of artistic illusions and flattery by court painters. An interview with a very pleasant and happy lady explains the science behind the reconstruction, how painstakingly it is done, even measuring the skin depth (they don't tell us how) of men of that age who lived at that time. Pegs are affixed to the skull indicating skin depth. How about that.  Anyway, we are given a lot of information.  She has done this sort of thing before and giggles at the conceit of portraits. ""Oh, you can't trust royal portraits,"" she notes as the camera closes in on a painting of Richard, the one with the black hat with a brooch on it. Nope, she assures us, we can bet that he didn't look a thing like that. Only science gives us the Real McCoy. Or the real Plantagenet in this case.  The segment goes on and on, but we never get the payoff.  Obviously we will have to watch to the bitter end to see what Richard really truly looked like.  At this point the discerning viewer will wonder what sort of cocktails Richard might have enjoyed and, no answers being available, just hit the gin.About halfway into the show and armed with new resolve and that belt of booze, we meet historian and geneologist John Ashdown-Hill.  Mr. Ashdown-Hill labors over various records to find the missing great great great great etc.  Unfortunately this expert is missing a front tooth which not only gives him a rather dotty look, it also goes all too well with his performance. Anyway records turn up an heir, one Michael Ibsen, a Canadian who lives in London and makes wooden chairs.  Simon Farnaby interviews Ibsen at what seems to be a truck stop. There is a long, long shot of some very yummy but greasy looking eggs and bacon frying away on a cook top.  We did say this doesn't apear to be one of those shows where the producers throw money around.  Mr. Ibsen says he is overwhelmed, but really he looks more confused. And his eyes keep cutting to that bacon.  Mr. Ibsen is the key to it all.  If he has the same DNA as the skeleton, then Philippa and Simon have nailed Richard III. On which they both seem oddly keen.The results of carbon dating come in and it looks like All Systems Go...the timing is just right. This skeleton was alive and well at the same period as Richard III.  Philippa becomes animated again, clutching at Simon.  Now the news media is starting to pay attention.  Good thing, too, because things are getting interesting.  An examination of the cleaned, tested and reconstructed skeleton reveals many injuries and the probable cause/causes of death. Whoever he is, this dead guy died fighting. Lots of cleaving and stabbing of the face, sword and knife wounds to the chest and back, and something referred to as a post-mortem 'humiliation wound,' which is never expanded upon or explained.  But the producers are kind enough to give us a close up of the skeleton's rear end, so we have a pretty good idea of where that last sword ended up.The rest of the show is largely taken up with stock footage of actors wearing armor and what looks to be costumed tourists at a Renaissance Faire.  Simon and Philippa are filmed standing in the general vicinity of Bosworth Field, but there are no remnants or reminders of the great battle. Just the two of them. She wears an enormous fur cap with gigantic earflaps.  Elmer Fudd would have killed for that hat.  Anyway there's nothing much for anyone to do...t's all over but the payoff.  What did the guy look like?The fellow was King of England for just two years, which is about how long if feels like we've been watching. Plus the gin seems to have evaporated. But the end of the tunnel is at hand. Tension mounts. Philippa, eyes closed, is led into a darkened chamber. There is an altar-like construction with turntable, upon which resides the scientifically accurate head and authentic artist-proof face.  One light illuminates it.  Philippa stumbles, her eyes still shut tight. She is savoring the moment. We can see she is breathing heavily. Even Simon the actor  assumes a facial expression, laboring to show us both anticipation and his good side.  Philippa squares her shoulders.  Her eyes open, her expression goes from surprise to a beatific joy. It is The Big Reveal. And now it's our turn. The camera pans from Philippa's tear-streaked face and to the altar...and sure enough, he looks exactly like the portrait.The show ends by assuring us that Richard's skeleton doesn't tell us whether he was a bad or good.  Maybe not, but if you ask me, that hat with the brooch said plenty.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FF02QKMQXTCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDMW3CI#wasThisHelpful","R1FF02QKMQXTCF","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a diet plan for people who don't like food, have iron discipline, and never feel hungry. For people like me...after one day, I'd be as hungy (and picky) as a vulture. If a tired cowboy came riding into town, I'd circle him and hope he fell from the saddle.There are only three things to consider about a diet-replacment liquid. Does it taste good? Does it fill you up? Is it easier than preparing your own food.  Okay, some grown up types are concerned about nutrition, but if they're so smart they probably eat well all the time, awful stuff like vegetables without the cheese sauce. They don't need to be on diets like those of us who think a bacon is a vitamin and the heck with them.  The rest of us know who we are and not just by the fried chicken grease on our polo shirts.  SlimFast passes the taste test. It's really good, just the right amount sweet, with a light but velvety texture and delicious flavor. And it's easy. I mean, how tough is it to take the lid off a bottle and glug it?  But does it fill you up?  I suspect if you gave this to a hummingbird long enough, it would wrassle that vulture for dibs on Pecos Pete.You are supposed to follow their 3.2.1. program which consists of 1 bottle of SlimFast or the SlimFast protein bar (200 calories for either) as your complete breakfast, then the same for lunch, followed by a 500 calorie dinner. You also get some 'snacks' -- three 100-calorie treats per day. This translates to one decent sized orange, 8 dry roasted almonds, or four of those little pretzel twists. Yeah, you'd slim down some. Another good diet plan is visiting Moscow, insulting the Politburo, and getting sent to the Gulag.So why would anyone mess around with 3.2.1?  First of all, for a real snack that won't leave you pretending it's the dog making those noises, you could put together a bowl of lettuce, cucumbers, radishes, green peppers, jalapenos and even a few sunflower seeds for crunch and indulge in a luscious tablespoon of the richest dressing imaginable and not go over the 100 calorie count. The fiber will certainly cure the empty tummy.  You could boil yourself  four shrimp and 5 asparagus in some Old Bay seasoning, squeeze on some lemon and really go to town.  But then you'd be working for your calories and the whole SlimFast 3.2.1. deal is the convenience.By the way, you think all that deprivation during the day ends with a big blowout dinner feast, think again. You have 500 calories, so you'd be chowing down on something like 1/2 cup (cooked) pasta topped with sauteed zucchini, maybe six little chunks, all followed by a big, delicious slice of...nothing. A half cup is usually what I wind around the fork to taste to make sure it's cooked enough.  But that's your dinner and not another bite. No butter, no oil, no sliced chicken. Nada.  Of course you'd still have another 100 calorie snack...maybe ten of those little green Thompson grapes, yippie-yi-yo-kai-yay.  And if you want something to drink and get the taste of the zucchini out of your mouth, don't even look at the wine or the juice or the beer.  You can wash it all down with water.For me, 3.2.1 doesn't work. If I'm in a hurry and watching weight, I might grab a container of the stuff as a meal replacement. Say for breakfast when I oversleep, or fun times like waiting on line at the DMV. Or the lam from the cops. Otherwise, why bother? With a tiny bit of effort, you can have real food and not exceed that 1200 total daily calorie count. I'd rather spend fifteen minutes throwing some honest-to-gosh edibles together any day. I know it's what the poor cowboy would want me to do.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N83ZCIMAM5TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KUUY24#wasThisHelpful","R1N83ZCIMAM5TP","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This exceptional BBC series ran for just four episodes in its debut season...barely enough to satisfy, but sufficient to show us how good a television show can be.  The series is based on Mikhail Bulgakov's short story collection of the same name, and is almost alarmingly true to the book's character and content. Americans probably know Bulgakov best for his masterpiece, ""The Master and Marguerita.""  This short story collection, however, is more personal to the author, being based on his own early life, and presents readers with some of the best Russian writing of the post-revolution era, along with an excellent and always entertaining ethnography of Russian village life...and a Stalin era history lesson. The stories outline the experiences of a young doctor who practiced in Smolesnk, a Russian backwater, from 1916 to 1920.John Hamm, known to U.S. audiences from his Emmy Award winning role in ""Mad Men"" and Daniel Radcliff of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, share star billing and a single role. Both play the same doctor, Radcliffe taking on the fresh-out-of medical school lad with no practical experience, and Hamm playing him as a cynical adult.  The series uses the gimmick of having the older Doctor interact with his younger self, advising, criticizing, provoking. It's a conceit we've seen before, but rarely done this well.  Both Radcliffe and Hamm are excellent, and the material gives them plenty to work with.The young doctor is sent to replace the late and imposing Leopold Leopoldovitch, a physician of imposing whiskers and reputation (and an extensive library of Turkish erotica, illustrated and in color.  When Leopold Leopoldovitch (always referred to by both names and in the most reverent terms) shuffles off the mortal coil, the young man must step into his shoes, not to mention oversized surgical gown.  And the poor kid only shaves every week or so.  But the lad is redeemed by two things:  The appearance of his older-self when his nerve fails, and his skill, albeit untried.  He graduated at the top of his class. ""Five in all 15,"" he brags. ""It was unprecedented!""  Not that this does any good when he has to saw both legs off of a dreadfully maimed 8 year old.The series is dark, the humor bitter, it's not always funny, people die, even young ones and nice ones. The first episode shows us the fear and optimism of the nave young practitioner; the fourth gives us the same young man already succumbing to depression and burn out.  The writers have captured that special bleakness that inhabits the Russian soul. The most mundane of things can have a saturnine twist; behind the loudest laughter there's awareness of death. It's a Russian thing. Maybe Eastern European, because the Scandinavians have it too. And the Poles. But if the humor reflects this spiritual black hole, it still manages to be funny.  And the parts that are meant to be serious? Well, it's fair to say they are sobering and unforgettable.  We deal with the doctor's own devils as he deals with his sick and injured.  And things can get bloody. Those operations don't pull any punches when it comes to showing us what it was like back in the day. Even the yanking of a rotten tooth can result in the accidental removal of a hunk of a jawbone and some truly impressive hemorrhaging.  The injuries may be gruesome, but they're just about right, given they way most peasants lived and worked.  And no staff of hotty interns to help the good doctor out. Would Doctor House have gotten as far with only the burned out hulk of his former self to advise him? Probably not, but the good doctors do have at least one thing in common, as we see in the enfolding episodes. You'll have to watch. I'm not going to spoil things if I can help it.(Just an aside: Do Americans know that Hugh Laurie, our haunted Dr. House, is one of England's best known comics and a skilled musician and singer?  ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"" was a hilarious sketch show. His partner, Stephen Fry, also took a dark turn, going on to star in ""Kingdom."" Fry played the somewhat troubled Peter Kingdom, a not-terribly successful solicitor who juggled family secrets and the legal problems of some eccentric villagers in his small Norwich town.  The sketch show and Fry's series are both worth seeing. And so is ""Jeeves and Wooster,"" the pair's other TV series. Fry is the sensible butler, but Laurie steals the show as the nave Bertie. Whenever he was deep in his Dr. House miseries, I kept waiting for him to break into a rousing rendition of ""47 Ginger Headed Sailors."")""A Young Doctor's Notebook"" originally aired in the UK last year and pulled in tremendous ratings. Ovation picked it up here in the U.S.  For those who aren't familiar with it, Ovation is a U.S. cable network that's devoted to 'artistic' content.  Mostly good stuff.  Season 1 is now available on Amazon and Netflix.  The producers have promised us Season 2.  The problem, of course, is pulling the stars away from their lucrative day jobs.You want to see this. It's excellent television, fine acting, good production values, and not the usual predigested television fare.  And you could read the book too.  Five stars for both.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKKI64PXCT6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6CI7MY#wasThisHelpful","RKKI64PXCT6U","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a book of Portuguese recipes manages to misspell Portuguese, and do it on the cover no less, you have to wonder about the recipes.  It was with great trepidation that I looked at the recipe for Portuguese fish stew...but it seemed fine.  I was thinking of what to do for dinner and got out my kindle for inspiration. The was one of those Kindle freebies...I always download the books but rarely cook from the recipes. Despite the off-putting cover, I gave it a shot. I know how to make fish soup, so any egregious errors would be easy to spot.Turns out, there aren't any. I did add some clams and mussels to the recipe because I had some and wanted to use them. Anyway, it smelled and looked so good, there was no chance of letting it 'rest' until dinner. With some chewy Italian bread and a glass of wine, it was a perfect late lunch. Later on tonight, another big bowl is going to make a nice supper and possibly a midnight snack. Even better, I suspect it's got a nice low calorie count to boot, so this binge will not be too damaging. And the wine, by the way, is something called 2010 La Craie Vouvray, Loire, France. It was $7, and I'm amazed at how good it is...dry and sharp,but not at all biting. I bring this up only because, if like me, you enjoy wine but know zip about it, this is a good and affordable choice if you care to remember the name.  I'm still sipping, which may account too for my generosity with praise and generally happy attitude.The book also has about fifty delicious sounding recipes. My next will be the fish chowder. It's not the typical creamy preparation we  associate with the word. This is more briny, with a thin stock and closer to Manhattan clam chowder than the Boston version. Closer too, I think, to those flinty older versions...seethed layers of fish, onions and potatoes. No butter, milk or cream.If you've been hit by the kale publicity tsunami and are looking for ways to introduce more of this Flavor of the Week Wonderfood into your diet, the Portuguese have always favored it, particularly in soup.  There are two recipes here, one for Portuguese Kale Soup and one for Kale Soup with Beans.  Both have beans, by the way, and both look very good. And most of the recipes look like a bunch of kale tossed into the mix wouldn't be a bad idea at all.  Like most soup and stew recipes, they are flexible. You can add or delete, give them your personal spin, and toss an extra garlic clove or ten into the mix if it feels right.Considering the cost, this may turn out to be a genuine treasure.  I give it five stars but add a little warning: having read most of the recipes and seeing no glaring problems, but used only one, I can't vouch for the entire book. If you like to cook, know the general drill when it comes to making soups or stews, and are willing to try the untested, I think this will make you very happy.

"I've used the Pantene 2% Minoxidil treatment per directions for a couple of weeks now, and there are absolutely no visible results. If you're hoping for a fast fix, a permanent fix, or a definite fix, this is not it. According to the package information, results become apparent after 4 months -- but Pantene only gives us 3 month's worth of product. Marketing of this sort strikes me as dishonest and we shouldn't tolerate it.  And the product itself is a little questionable.According to all the research I can locate, Minoxidil 2% solution is not very effective. Small clinical trials have shown that the 5% solution is significantly more effective in both retaining and regrowing hair in women with androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss. A quick scan of WebMD gives you this information: Results from clinical studies of mostly white women ages 18 to 45 years with mild to moderate degrees of hair loss report that after using minoxidil for eight months, 19% of users had moderate regrowth and 40% had minimal regrowth. Of those using a liquid without active minoxidil (a placebo) during the same time period, 7% reported moderate hair regrowth while 33% had minimal regrowth.Not very encouraging. And don't forget that minoxidil is not a permanent cure. If (and that's a big if) it works for you, you have to keep using it. Twice a day, every day.  Quit and the hair falls out again.The FDA has approved the much more effective 5% solution for over-the-counter sales to men; women need a doctor's prescription.  Don't ask me why. As we get older, most of us experience a little thinning on top. Mine isn't a problem and when it is, I'll deal with it. It's smart not to wait too long, by the way. If you have androgenetic alopecia, those empty hair follicles die and you can't bring them back. Nothing will work. So don't wait too long.Some women may want to explore hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if their hair loss is related to perimenopause or  menopause.  Estrogen and progesterone pills may provide some help.  You can also investigate follicle transplants.  You'll have to shell out $4,000 to $15,000 for a transplant, one session takes from 4 to 8 hours. I know several men and women who have had it done on thinning scalps that were not actually bald, and the cost was much closer to $4,000 that the higher figure...but it's out of your pocket and not covered by health insurance.Despite not having complete evidence to support me yet, I can't give this product more than two stars. I suspect it deserves just one. Pantene is cheating us from the gitgo by providing insufficient product to determine efficacy, we must make a second investment just to find out we are  among the tiny percentage for whom it works, and on top of that, they're charging us considerably more than other manufacturers.  If you want to take a chance with 2% minoxidil, go price shopping. Don't pay for the Pantene label. And don't expect much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5Y37PYVGXMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF5B374#wasThisHelpful","R3J5Y37PYVGXMA","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Frank's Place"" aired for just one season in 1987.  I remember this series so clearly, even after so many years. It was, simply, one of the best I've ever seen. Fresh and funny, the cast was exceptional, and dialogue real.  The premise was not unusual--the perennial fish-out-of-water. This time it was Reid, a Boston professor who inherits The Chez (say the z), a small restaurant in New Orleans. I can't believe I still remember the name of the place...particularly after having just watched the entire ten billion episodes of breaking bad and could not tell you one character's name. Circumstances (and a voodoo curse) are such that he's pretty much obligated to stay and learn how to live in the South, run a restaurant, and figure out a culture that is possibly more alien to a New York or Boston black man than that of a foreign country.The cast was not the usual sitcom pretty faces and included a lot of talented and underutilized actors...notably Robert Harper (who had the wonderful name of Bubba Weinberger) and Daphne Reid as the love interest.  The producers used locals, including Don Yesso, who had never acted before, in several key roles.  Yesso played a character named Shorty, the lone white restaurant employee. His accent sounded more Brooklyn than Nawleans, but it was accurate.  That magnolia drawl most actors assay to play French Quarter types is strictly Actor's Studio.  Yesso went on to play Stanley Kowalski opposite Jessica Lange as Blanche DuBois in a 1992 Broadway revival of ""Streetcar Named Desire.""  Only three other actors have ever tackled the role on Broadway: Marlon Brando, Alec Baldwin and Jack Palance.  I think I'd prefer Yesso to those last two by a long shot.The humor at ""Frank's Place"" was broad on occasion, satirical on others, but never expected. And there was an interesting undercurrent of racial tension...it was presented in new ways and not always inter-racial. I remember one episode about a club for blacks that would only admit members who could pass the paper bag test.  I didn't know about this before the show, but some black people are very biased against dark skin tones. Anything 'lighter than a paper bag' is the acceptable shade. This was the unspoken requirement for the organization Frank wished to join. Lots of interesting little tidbits like that made the show unlike most other sitcoms, then or now.After just that one season, the show disappeared with no fanfare, no outcry.  Tim Reid has worked since them, fairly regularly, but nothing he has done has come close to this. He played a disc jockey on a dreadful show that, unaccountably became a huge success: WKRP in Cincinnati. The show is most notable for introducing (inflicting?) Loni Anderson on the population.Most recently, Reid plays another New Orleans character, a judge in the excellent ""Treme,"" a show that feels like a direct descendent of this original piece of work. This new cable show is set in post-Katerina NO. Its music, issues, and humor are all a little reminiscent of what we saw on ""Frank's Place.""  The difference is, ""Treme"" has a tremendous budget and this series was done on a shoestring. Amazing what sheer talent can do.  But no one wanted to watch, being glued the screen by ""Who's The Boss,"" I guess. Was it P.T. Barnum who said nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public?  From the reviews here, there was a handful of people who could tell the difference between comedy and a laugh track and they still miss the show a quarter of a century later.  I am eager to see this little slice of TV history again...maybe it will be available on DVD.  I hope so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGTG1A9IQTY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015QT77U#wasThisHelpful","RXGTG1A9IQTY7","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Making tea has never required heavy lifting. I mean, water, tea, cup and there it is. But it gets tricky if you want it cold. Do you make hot tea and then sit there whistling for hours and hours while it cools? Make sun tea and get old waiting for that too happen?  Make it with those little crystals that taste good not like real iced tea? If you've been asking yourself this question over and over again, you need to find more to do with your life. I'm just saying. Any way, back to the tea.Lipton came out with some drops that are very tasty. The Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids Tropical Mango Flavor is delicious. I just guzzled down 32 ounces while watching ""The Rake"" on Hulu.  Good show, good drink. I added a big squeeze of lemon to cut some of the sweetness and it went from good to WOW.I know drinking water is good, but I get bored with the stuff.  This makes downing those 8 or so glasses per day very easy. In fact, it's so drinkable, I find myself gulping down an entire glass. Too good to sip. It reminds me of getting a glass of chocolate milk when I was a kid and glugging the whole thing.I did not look at the ingredients. They are on the bottle, but the print is tiny. And sometimes it's just better for me not to know. It may be full of horrible things, but what the heck, life is short and I'm probably doomed anyway and not because I'm going to have an occasional glass or two of Lipton Tea and Honey Liquids. It's too late to fix things now, I might as well enjoy.A great thirst quencher. It's good hot, and even better cold. The container is tiny so you can leave it in your desk at work, carry it in your purse....and instead of paying $3 for an iced tea when you order lunch, get some free water and give it a quick skwoosh.

"I have tasted nutritional supplements only a few times, so I can't say how this one compares to others, but for a fast and low-calorie meal replacement, this certainly works for me.  I love to eat...I live to eat...and if I let myself, I'd eat everything in sight and you'd be scouring the countryside for crumbs. I'd also weigh 800 pounds. So in order to fit into my skinny jeans (and on the sofa) I spend 3 days a week eating like a crazed tyrannosaurus and the other four being abstinent.  Designer Whey Fit & Trim makes a nice change for those times.I tried the powder plain, in soy milk and it was only so-so. There's an underlying graininess that you can't get rid of.  But after a little playing around, I figured out it is a great base for smoothies.  Throw a little yogurt, almond milk or soy milk, some berries or a banana, a ripe peach, or a really ripe mango with a cup of ice in the blender and you have something delicious that gives you tons of fiber and essential nutrients and keeps you feeling full.  That last one is important. I have what my grandmother called 'a healthy appetite,' meaning stand back and keep the pets and small children out of reach.  My stomach growls on my abstinence days and I bite. Hunger is not my best side.  But one of these drinks for breakfast, another for lunch, and maybe a big salad or vegetable soup for dinner and I feel satisfied...physically and spiritually. The former because the claims are true, this does satisfy your appetite (even mine); the latter because I know that pretty soon I will be sinking my fangs into something covered with gravy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WWSK6SUJE48H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTKKE7I#wasThisHelpful","R1WWSK6SUJE48H","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to read. Whatever else I'm doing, my Kindle is usually nearby. On line at the bank, while riding the bike at the gym, driving in traffic, in the dentist's waiting room, even while watching TV. Okay, not in traffic. Unless it's really bad and I'm dying of boredom. And frankly, I'm not a good driver. I don't know if paying attention even helps. Anyway, I require my Kindle most particularly when I'm eating alone, either at home or in a restaurant. Usually it's propped up against the ketchup bottle or salt shaker. And it keeps slipping and falling, which makes the letter size icon appear and suddenly it's all in tiny type and I have to reset it. Or else it falls and sends the salt shaker careening off the table and into the back of some poor diner's head, forcing me to look innocent which, given my features, somehow is not so easy. So the Moshi Cirrus Standing Cover seemed like a brilliant little contraption.  And it is...but it isn't.The Standing Cover is not perfect. It's of a very flimsy fiber that I understand is Dacron but feels like rough cardboard. It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen and doesn't provide much  protection as a 'cover.' So full props for the stand part, and zero for the cover.  The $25 price tag seems a bit ridiculous since this is certainly not well made. I wouldn't think of keeping my Kindle in the thing when I put it in my purse. I slide both into a little felt sack for safety.I  can't see shelling out $25 just to protect some strangers at the Sunshine Diner from flying salt shakers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLY7R4O277THN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECERJHW#wasThisHelpful","RLY7R4O277THN","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I collect flashlights because I live in Southern California where blackouts and brownouts are not infrequent and a decent sized earthquake can knock the power out for a good week or more.  The NOCO does everything you want a flashlight to do and a lot more.  250 Lumens is decent illumination, you get a choice of high, medium or very low, as well as an emergency strobe. I'm not sure what good the very low light is (10%, according to the package), or how helpful that strobe is in a real emergency, but the flashlight itself is just fine.  There is a little bit of flickering at 50% and 10%, but it's not bothersome if you use it as a flashlight. If you are using this in place of a battery lantern, it will drive you crazy. And it's not made to light a room or a tent. It's handy for all traditional flashlight uses. The size is compact, it's sturdy with a nice heft to it, the design is attractive, and it has a wrist strap for easy carrying. But it's the extras that make this a good choice.First of all, It's square. I thought this would be hard on the hand, but the diminutive size makes it quite easy to hang onto, the edges don't dig into your palm.  And the square shape is a good thing...no rolling.  Second and best of all, it has a locking mechanism. I like to keep a flashlight in my purse...where it bounces around, the on switch gets an accidental push, and the batteries burn out.  This happens all the time. I need the flashlight, find it, click it and...nada.  With the NOCO, you depress the two buttons and it doesn't turn on by accident. Simple but brilliant feature.Since I'm always forgetting to recharge my phone and, with impeccable timing, find it dead whenever I really, really need it...with a flat tire out in the boondocks, when the ground is shaking, or something else is upsetting my peaceful little world and I need help, companionship or take out.  But now I can just plug it into the flashlight!  Some reviewers complain that there is no way to know how well it recharges or how long the charge will last. Okay, it's a serious issue, but in an emergency, seeing those bars appear is enough. I don't need it to last hours, just long enough to get the tow truck, the fire department or the pizza deliver guy (for worst cast scenarios)to show up.My only hesitation is that price tag. Seventy bucks would normally leave me torn between thrift and desire. But what's the value of having a way to recharge your phone when it's dead and you really need it and you're away from home?

"The SterlingPro just replaced my Bodum as the go-to coffee maker. It's big...at least four good sized mugs, and the filter is nice and dense, and fits perfectly. Almost no grounds floating around in your brew. I love French Press coffee and this gizmo delivers.  It also looks great. The silver lid and frame are sturdy and very handsome; the handle is comfortable to hold.  I like the heft of the press. It feels solid, but it isn't too heavy even when you've filled it to the brim. Best of all, this gizmo has a double filter system so you escape the Coffee Press Curse...no coffee grounds floating in your cup!I love coffee and collect coffeemakers. Everything from an Armenian Ibrik to a Vietnamese tin hat.  I'd be lost without the Keurig for those mornings when you gotta have your coffee NOW (plus it's fun to have all those different flavors and types to pop into the machine. They have their uses, but the SterlingPro is the choice for day to day coffee.  You can brew a full pot and have plenty left over to offer a neighbor or turn into iced coffee.I like strong coffee and usually grind the beans myself. I've found that, for this machine, a little bit over a 1/2 cup (ground) makes four good cups.  One reviewer suggested grinding beans fine for extra strength. I don't know if this is such a good idea. The fine grind floats up into your coffee and makes it muddy.  I'd stick with the medium grind and a rounded, generous 1/2 cup measure.  And while you're at it, try throwing some spices into the grinder.  For a very exotic and delicious taste, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, the seeds from 3 cardamom pods (if you buy just the seeds, be careful; they lose their taste after a few weeks), and 1/4 teaspoon each grated nutmeg, ginger and black pepper.  It's delicious but subtle and nobody can figure our why your coffee tastes so good.I've used freshly ground beans and fancy coffee blends, but I also tried regularMaxwell House...they use a medium grind, which is perfect for the press. The coffee came out very well.Anyway, if you're looking for a new Press, or if you haven't made coffee this way, the SterlingPro is a good choice.  For the first time, something is luring me away from the iconic Boodum.  I was sent one of these by the manufacurer for review purposes. Usually I find I'm harder on products that are submitted to me, as opposed to those I buy. But in this case, I really couldn't find one thing to complain about.  The price is right, the beaker and plunger are dishwasher safe and easy to clean, the size is right, the smoothness of the brew and lack of grounds make it a terrific choice. I've used the press just about every day without a problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P03AG6HYN2B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUHACEE#wasThisHelpful","R1P03AG6HYN2B7","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are desperate for a good end of the world movie, you're out of luck with this one. It's not even close. Oh, the producers tried...they tried very hard to give us everything. Every cliche, every stereotype, even every scene from every other TEOTWAWKI movie.Let's see. Band of hardy survivors. Yep. Wrongfully convicted yet innocent black man who we know will be the heroic leader? Got it. Sexy woman who wields a gun the size of a lacrosse bat and says ""Ah em trenned an' deddly"" in what might be a French accent? You bet.  Hooker with a heart of gold? Present and accounted for. Rich and spoiled society dame?  Drunken Irishman? Check and check. Gay guy in a clown suit? Okay, that was a new one one me. You don't see many of those. Probably struck the writers as quirky. We also have a lady policeman who is an imbecile and a lawyer who is there to take up space. Think Maryanne or Mrs. Howell on Gilligan's Island. They did slip up a bit with the characters. The Irish guy is the villain, and like all lousy tv show villains, he has no qualities other than being mean.  Sorry, but this is not in the stereotype playbook. A cliche Irishmen should be happy, with a twinkle in his eye, talkin' o' the leprechauns and the auld pub back in Galaway. It's the lawyer who's supposed to be the jerk.The adventure begins with our little troop getting stuck on an elevator. Almost 15 seconds elapse before they all panic, faint, go into semi-comas, and fight among themselves. Another a grueling moment goes by before they manage to open the doors and escape. This is where things go downhill. For them and for us. Mostly us. Now they are trapped on the building's parking level. Oy, already. The horror. The mesh security gate is shut and there they are starving and thirsty (yeah, it's been fifteen minutes, but back off), succumbing to mysterious illnesses and being attacked for no apparent reason by armed escaped convicts. And despite all this drama, the mesh fence shows no sympathy and stays shut.  They slap it with their hands. They shake it. It doesn't budge.  Hello, this is a parking a garage. Cars? Jacks? Tire Irons?  Fortunately for them, the handsome wrongly-convicted convict shows his leader credentials early, escapes, comes back like the hero he is, and saves them and now they're free. So what do they do? Get in their cars and go home like normal people.  Don't be silly. They all pile into a vacant ambulance and head toward the Rich Lady's house.Several adventures ensue. We get to see mob scenes that are comfortably familiar to anyone who has seen 'Walking Dead,' any remake of 'War of the Worlds,' or one of those Aliens Have Landed and They are Ugly and Have Issues epics. People run this way and that way, stuff explodes for no reason people push, shove, and trample one another, kids cry out for mommy. Helicopters randomly crash into one another. There are no phones, no power. Gangs are on the prowl. And just when you think our Survivors have seen the worst,gone through every syllable of recycled B-movie dialogue and every bad script retread, they go and spring The Big One us.  This is not just some Grid is Down/Bomb Has Fallen/Martians Are Eating Bakersfield adventure. It's multifaceted and complex. Boy howdy.  Get this. The survivors discover they all have the same birthday. What a twist! Why, this could be a discarded moment from ""Lost.""And then, without even hardly giving us time to recover from that shockeroo...we get The Monster. One smooth glide from ""Lost"" to ""Lost in Space."" It's not much of a monster. just a skinny guy with gray body paint and bulging red eyeballs. A sort of unwrapped mummy who didn't get much sleep. But don't snicker. He's scarier than the hairy rocks that used to chase Will Robinson and the Robot. But not much. And The Monster does manage to do an upside down backwards scuttle on all fours that has only been used only in about five or six movies since we first saw it in the Director's Cut of 'The Exorcist' about a decade or so ago. Anyway, that's how it ends. We are left wondering if this is a monster? Demon? Creature from the Planet 9 without his gorilla suit?  Or just a naked guy with dry skin and a hangover.

This one isn't in the ballpark.  I'm giving it three stars because there is no sick little girl who needs special medicine and no lovable little puppy in imminent danger.

"Imagine you are a new bride, you've just tied the knot, the reception is over, that last glass of champagne raised in a toast. And now you and your newly-minted husband are embarking on that most beautiful of all journeys...the honeymoon.  But instead of a tender glance, a kiss, a caress by moonlight, he hands you a book the size of a dictionary, written by him just for you and in the tiniest print, telling you how he likes things done. How he likes everything done...and he doesn't miss a trick.From how to curry his horse, de-worm his dog, plant the kohlrabi and harvest the hops, get the best cuts of mutton, spin, dye and weave his wool, manage the servants and care for the ill, your new Mister isn't shy about making sure you know what he likes. He even his rules for your personal behavior. Yep, wifely deportment. How to dress, bathe, walk, speak, entertain the neighbors, honor his family, worship the lord, be modest about yourself and obedient to him. This amazing volume was written for a 13 year old girl who married a rich Parisian widower who didn't want his lawfully-wedding waif to waste time on a learning curve. Nope, Grampy was smart enough to take notes during previous marriages.The name of the book is, in fact, The Householder of Paris. Over the centuries, it has been excerpted and translated and assumed the name given as the title of this version by Tania Bayard.  It's a good version, although Ms. Bayard, a historian, apparently collapsed in exhaustion because the chapters dealing with servants and horses are very abridged.  Not to mention interchangeable.Hey, the guy meant well.  He took the time to be detailed...minutely, precisely, almost obsessively detailed. But give him credit, his words of wisdom are easy to access: the weighty tome is carefully broken down into sections and articles. Like a legal document or any other endlessly long document that you'd rather eat glass than read.  Here's an example. Article 2, section 4 advises the new bride as follows...""First in all sauces and thick pottages, you should first pound the spices and take them out of the mortar, because the bread which you pound afterwards absorbs that which remains from the spices; thus nothing is lost that would be lost were it done the other way around."" In other words, double duty from the spices, babe, because in addition to being a persnickety little bas...bas...little boy, he's also stingy and wants his money's worth from that quarter of cinnamon and parcel of saffon.  And remember this is just Section two, article four, and he's just talking about pottage...bean soup, basically.  And there are probably 100 more sections to go and a gazillion additional articles. ""Item: spices and bindings put into pottages ought not to be strained; but do so for sauces, that the sauces may be clearer and likewise  pleasant.  Item: know that pea and bean pottages or others burn easily, if the burning brands touch the bottom of the pot when it is on the fire. Item: before your pottage burns and in order that it not burn, stir it often in the bottom of the pot, and turn your spoon in the bottom so that the pottage may not take hold there. And note as soona s you see thaty our portage is burning, do not move it, but straightaway take it off the fire and put it in another pot. Item: note that commonly all potages on the fire boil over, and fall..."" Okay, I gotta stop here. But did you see the best part?  He even knows the best way for her to hold a spoon.History is nothing more than how we spent yesterday.  We can learn about the world and how it worked in various ways. My way is through these books, written by commoners or nobles, chefs, housewives, abbots, slaves.  They are Heloise's Helpful Hints or Godey's Lady's Book written for a specific time and place.  And it's more illuminating than many of the most precise history volumes ever written, when it comes to knowing the people, from the days of ancient Egypt to World War II. Too much of history is given to the destruction of our many worlds, citing this treaty breach, the misbehavior of that dictator, the date of the battles fought and the locations of the treaties signed.  Learning how we built those societies and how we got through the day, fixed lunch, went to work and had an occasional day off have much more appeal for me.  This book deserves five stars.  I only hope that our elderly widower met an untimely and somewhat suspicious end...and that his pretty young wife (and maybe that handsome groom) had a rock-solid alibi.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VN71U7Q82DU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006092182X#wasThisHelpful","R3VN71U7Q82DU2","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ration Cook Book is not just a cookbook. It's a wayback machine. Climb in and you're carried back to 1942, you've got your feet under the table, and you're part of the family.  This is how people really lived. We learn about cooking, certainly...making one scrambled egg enough for three people by adding some crushed bread crumbs and water, how to make eggless cakes, meatless meatloaf, and whipped cream from bananas and gelatin powder, But there's a whole lot more to this little booklet.  Squint your eyes so you can read between the lines and you'll walk away with a lesson in history and sociology. Status, religion, social etiquette...it's all there.  How women shopped, how they spent the day, decorated their homes, treated the men in their lives, raised their children,entertained friends and family, and celebrated holidays and special events. You can even get an inkling of the era's politics and prejudices, along with the basic rules for living.  All cookbooks give the nitty gritty on what goes on inside the home...the day to day, the weddings, religious obervances, births or deaths and whatever comes in between.Forget about history books. Want to know about World War II in Britain and how it impacted the ordinary folks?  Check out ""Make Do and Mend: Keeping Family and Home Afloat on War Rations,"" or ""Good Eating"" printed by the London Telegraph -- they'll make you glad you're an American. Mmmm. Woolton Pie.  Almond Paste with green beans but no almonds.  And 'snook.'  Lordy.  Interested in post Civil War America:  Our Home Cyclopedia: Cookery and Housekeeping, published in Detroit, Michigan, in 1889 is an eye-opener.  What about the rest of the world? And how far back?  For as long as civilization has existed, people have been capturing its essence. Sure, this is the soul of philosophical works, poetry and music. But if you want to see it, smell it and know it, check out the cookbooks and their version of Helpful Heloise.It begins at the beginning, I mean 1st Century beginning.  The Latin book of household hints called De Re Coquinaria.  I think that would translate, roughly, to ""About Food.""  There are cookbooks in Arabic dating from the tenth Century.  The magnificent food eaten by Kublai Khan hasn't been forgotten because his chef wrote down the recipes, calling them ""The Important Things to Know About Eating and Drinking.""  The book gives us some fascinating advice about running a household, partricularly one that is headed by a living god.  Every era, every civilization has its collection of books and I suspect much of what we know about those times comes from what was jotted down by the chef of some forgotten king or abbot.  The books are, of course, obscure and available only to scholars, but we can read of them and we can read parts of them and when we do, we know about the people.The complex world that was Venice of the 1300s is made a lot clearer by Libro Per Cuoco, with its 150 recipes ranging from appetizers to dessert and neatly compiled in alphabetical order and essays about society, morality and politics. ""Forms of Cury"" by King Richard II's chef is a primer about living in the 14th Century.  By the end of the American Revolution, the tradition of books for housewives was in full swing. Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife told middle-class matriarchs on both sides of the Atlantic what to wear, what to serve, what to place atop the piano, how to preserve her summer crop of peaches.  Her colleague Hannah Glasse reached out to  women with The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy. Good basic fare, and good basic info on how to keep the house running, the kids from going wild and Hubby from dropping dead of scurvy.A century after that, Mrs Beeton told us everything we needed to know to thrive during the Victorian era: how to sit while wearing a hoop skirt, how much beer will suffice a footman, what to serve at your brother's wedding, and which feathers might be too vulgar for your bonnet.  Each of these volumes told us how to live while  focusing on food and its preparation -- but what's more basic to ife?  We are what we eat, aren't we?  From the early 19th Century to the present day, housewives have been writing history. Those Settlement cookbooks? The Junior League and church recipe booklets...each one is a little peek into the homes and lives of the writers, a window into the generation.  For wars and generals, for Great Deeds and Discoveries, head for the history books. But to know what went on behind closed doors...it's the cookbook every time.  No heavy lifting...you learn a lot and figure out what to have for dinner.The Ration Cook Book is fun.  I hope it gives you a little bit of amusement and the inspiration to look a little deeper.  Enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IUBPCDUHDHPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NQ8S0A#wasThisHelpful","R1IUBPCDUHDHPP","A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this book The Making of an Atheist, author James S. Spiegel looks at how morality or the lack thereof plays an important role in the rejection of God. Can immorality lead to unbelief? Surprisingly, as Mr. Spiegel documents, many well-known atheists are not reticent in acknowledging the volitional aspect of their atheistic beliefs.But what about those of faith? To my mind that is the bigger question here. Does a lifestyle which rejects the basic tenants of Biblical morality lead to a rejection of God by those of a Biblical world view? Does moral compromise through generations insidiously erode the foundations of faith? After reading The Making of an Atheist, I believe youll find the answer to that question is an unfortunate yes.I think the history of higher education in this country is a good example of Mr. Spiegels premise. Who doesnt know that Harvard, Yale and many of the most prestigious institutions of learning in the US were started by those of a Biblical world view to promote not just higher education but a Biblical moral standard? And today? Those very same institutions are bastions of secular humanism which is the very antithesis of their founders intentions.Morality by its very nature is a God attribute. Without God mankinds competing self-interests are ultimately destructive. Without God each of us becomes merely the next meal in an endless evolutionary food chain. Is that really how we want to see the beauty and mystery of the world around us?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VABN4A02XZ87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802476112#wasThisHelpful","R1VABN4A02XZ87","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just ten years ago a story like this would have been considered farfetched by most peoples standards.  But that was then and this is now. N: The Beginning takes you on a sobering journey into a world where Christianity has been outlawed and Christians are fugitives in the United States.This short novel centers on a young girl Petra Bordeaux and a band of outcast children hiding from those who want them imprison in reeducation camps of the New America. The story begins when Petras world is turned upside by the unthinkable. As events spiral out of her control she must find a way to protect her brother and survive in a world where no one is safe. With the help of a mysterious stranger Petra does her best to adapt to her uncertain circumstances while at the same time trying to hold to the moral standard she was taught by her parents.N: The Beginning is a story that challenges young and old alike to think about the future and how you would respond to being persecuted for your faith. For nearly two hundred and fifty years now the Christians of America have been shielded from the type of persecution others have faced and are facing in various parts of the world. Those days appear to be ending for America and so begins the story of N: The Beginning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HOO2BN2XZJEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017PG53QM#wasThisHelpful","R3HOO2BN2XZJEK","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If I had to sum up this book in just a few words I would have to say it is about stewardship - stewardship as individuals, families and church communities. So often the discussion of preparedness gets framed in terms of wild eye survivalists preparing for the end of the world. In this well written book the author Carl Gallups elevates the discussion and gives practical and commons sense advice on how Christians can fulfill their responsibilities to each other and their fellow man within a Biblical context of love.In this book youll find a wealth of practical information on preparedness with an underlying foundation based upon solid Biblical principles. I especially appreciate how Mr. Gallups reminded his readers throughout the book that real stewardship and preparedness begins in the heart and it is that focus which keeps physical preparedness in the proper balance.In the end, at least from my perspective, its about fulfilling the Royal Law to love our neighbor as ourselves. It is that principle reflected, in our actions towards each other, which should really drive our daily lives as believers. BE Thou Prepared is a practical primer on how to accomplish that in the day in which we live.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISHWZVV4DWOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935071319#wasThisHelpful","R2ISHWZVV4DWOH","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not sure what I was expecting when I started this book but after just a few pages I was caught up in a gripping tale of tragedy and love. Even though Child of Mercy is a captivating novel it illuminates one of the darkest sides of our culture, namely the exploitation and abuse of innocent children.I wont give away the plot but I can tell youll have a hard time putting this book down. In this tragic thriller, the author Grant Carroll explores the question of why God allows bad things to happen and how we as Christians should respond when they do. Where the author could have been graphic he handled the plot delicately, exposing the darkness without over the top details.Personally, I really appreciated the dialog between the Christian and non-Christian characters when questioning their faith, the lack thereof, and how darkness plays out in the plan of God.Overall this book was a great combination of thrilling fiction and real life questions many of us have asked ourselves at some point in our lives.

"I must admit it is still thrilling to read a new book on Bible prophecy and have the opportunity to see the subject through another believers eyes.  I believe all of us still see the subject of Bible prophecy with an incomplete understanding. Encouragingly, as we draw closer to the return of Yeshua it is becoming apparent that the veil is slowly lifting. The past couple of years Ive read quite a few books dealing with the subject of the pre-trip verses the pre-wrath position on the rapture and the 2nd coming. I frankly dont understand the subject to the degree I would like so Ive been pursuing the subject with the intent to perform my Berean duty.Recently, I was introduced to the book Worthy to Escape: Why All Believerse Will Not be Raptured Before the Tribulation. In this well written book the authors Adrian Zenz and Marlon Sias explore the subject of the rapture and its timing relative to the eschatological events described in the Bible. For those who have studied the subject, you know that the pre-trib or the pre-wrath interpretations both have aspects which their adherents have a difficult time explaining. Mr. Zenz and Mr. Sias, in Worthy to Escape make a case for a dual rapture eschatological position which attempts to reconciles the problems found in both of the other positions.Though I still have not clarified the various positions to my liking this book offered another valuable perspective on the subject which helped explain some of the challenging aspects of subject. Several of the chapters which really stood out to me included: We Are the Bride: What it Means to Be Engaged to Jesus Chapters 6 & 7  Pretribulation Versus PreWrath (part I & II) The Origin and Rise of the Antichrist Gods Wrath and the Fall of Babylon The Final Battle and the Entrance Into the Millennial KingdomI would be remiss if I did not mention that the book doesnt just look at the subject of the rapture in a clinical vacuum. The authors do a great job of explaining why the subject is important to our faith and our walk with Christ. Regardless of your view on the rapture this book offers a clear view on why righteous living in these last days is important to God, our fellow believers and ourselves.In the spirit of a fair review there are a few aspects of the book with which I disagree and/or I thought needed some clarification. On the subject of the spirit versus the letter of the law and legalism versus lawlessness I thought the chapter was a bit complicated. The authors did a thorough job of explaining this critical subject for todays believers but I felt the underlying principle sometimes got lost in the details. If we are to live by the spirit of the law we must be able to explain the subject in terms our children or new believers can easily understand.To often in todays culture our Christian testimony is lost because we have no real understanding of how the spirit of the law is the principle upon which the letter was based. The spirit of the law says we are to love YHWH with our heart soul and mind. That principle then undergirds the spirit of the law when dealing with our fellow man who was made in the image of YHWH. If we love YHWH in the spirit of the law then the natural extension of that will reflect our love of our fellow man.The spirit of the law then illuminates the 10 commandments which are the basis for the letter of the law. If we look at the letter of the law which say thou shalt not steel we can see the underlying spirit of the law which says if we really love our brother we cannot steel from him because doing so shows a lack of love for YHWH.Another more difficult example would be trying to find the spirit of the law in 4th commandment to keep the Sabbath. After 2000 years this topic is still hotly debated amongst believers but far too often it is only looked at in terms of the extremes of legalism and lawlessness. (What we are required to do and what we have the liberty not to do)  Frankly, I think if we as believers could see the Sabbath in terms of the royal law then it would go along way to helping us apply the underlying spirit of the law to every aspect of our life.This discussion often makes me think of one my children (or even myself) when they were still young and innocent. One of the greatest joys was simply going into our parents closet and trying on or fathers shoes. (Or our young daughters trying on her mothers heels). Have we ever really thought about why that was such a memorable experience? Could it be that in our innocence zeal we simply had the desire to be like our parents. Its sad today that we all, in one respect or another, have lost the innocent zeal to simply walk in our fathers shoes. Getting back to a more specific disagreement given in the spirit of respectful disagreement and the spirit of a Berean which the authors encourage their readers to emulate, To the extent the authors rely on a chronological framework based in the prophecy of 70 Weeks in general and the 70th week in particular, I believe it undermines their argument for a two stage rapture. Ill try to briefly explain:1. The authors explanation of the prophecy of 70 Weeks is based upon the unproven assumption that Ezra and Nehemiah were contemporaries of the Persian king Longimanus. The Bibles chronology simply does not support this. The Bibles own internal chronology shows that Ezra and Nehemiah were contemporaries of Darius the Great Artaxerxes. By connecting the two stage rapture theory to an unprovable assumption regarding Daniel 9 it creates a credibility issue for both theories. In my opinion it would be better to prove the two stage rapture theory independent of the assumed chronological framework built in the prophecy of Daniel 9.2. A 360 day year or as it is sometimes called a prophetic year is simply not a biblical reckoning of time. In order for Sir Robert Andersons prophetic year to be accurate it must be synchronized with the solar year of 365.24 days. Left unsynchronized it makes Andersons prophetic year a vague or wandering year like the Islamic calendar today. Genesis 1:14 clearly states the Bibles calendar is both lunar and solar. This is confirmed by the fact that Israel (at the Exodus) was commanded to synchronize their lunar months with the solar agricultural cycle of barley. Although there is historical records of a 360 day lunar year there is no evidence that the solar cycle has ever been 360 days long. This necessitates an intercalation of 5.24 days for the prophetic year to be accurate. Historically speaking a 365.24 day solar year is evidence by the cubit, the Sothic cycle, the Great Pyramid of Giza and Stonehendge just to name a few of the more notable places it is found in antiquity going back at least 4500 years. A Biblical reckoning of time on the other hand is based upon the 29.53 day cycle of the moon and the 365.24 day solar cycle. In practical application this means the biblical year varies between 12 or 13 lunar cycles.  Most Biblical years have 354.36 days but every three years or so the Biblical year is 383.89 days long. (A 13th month is added)It should be noted that the shorter times frames in the book of Daniel and Revelation are expressed in days or months in deference to the biblical definition of time. When accuracy is required it only makes sense for the prophecies to be expressed in days or months because the Biblical year varies. So instead of seeing 3.5 prophetic years of 30 days each in 42 months (1260 days) we should understand the prophecy as 42 lunar cycles of 29.53 days (1240.26 days). This makes that period of time nearly 20 days shorter than 3.5 prophetic years. When the events of Revelation begin to be fulfilled those 20 days will make a big difference to those trying to understand the prophecy.In a similar manner when we want to related the 1260 days of revelation to the Biblical calendar we should be looking at this time frame not in terms of 365.24 solar years or 360 day prophetic years but rather 29.53 days months. In Biblical time this would equate to 42.67 months.3. Finally, scholars have claimed 4 Persian decrees as possible fulfillments of Daniel 9:25 and the commandment to restore and build. The word commandment of Daniel 9:25 is the Hebrew word dabar and simply means word as in the word of YHWH. Out of the over 1000 times dabar is used in the Bible the vast majority of the times it references the word of YHWH. In Daniel 9 dabar is used four times. Each of the other three times it refers to the words of the living God of the Bible. In the context of the 2nd temple era the word to restore and build Jerusalem most reasonably refers to the word of YHWH to restore and build given in Zechariah 1, Haggai 1 and witnessed by Ezra 6..My disagreements with the authors regarding Daniel 9 notwithstanding, I think this book is a great addition to the subject of understanding the rapture and the second coming. It is also a wonderful resource for why righteous living is a necessity in these last days.  I would definitely recommend this book to any Berean who is serious about understanding all aspects of this wonderful subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VA2LCBMJJM6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8AMHRG#wasThisHelpful","R3VA2LCBMJJM6A","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this wonderful little book the author Stan Guthrie shares some of the Bibles most important prophecies in a clear and engaging manner. True to its title the book looks at 60 of the Bibles most treasured prophecies in a concise manner. Despite this the reader still gets a true sense of beauty and depth of these prophetic texts.Ive had a love of Bible prophecy for over twenty five years and I can honestly say this book is a wonderful read full of great insights. It is always a pleasure to see the subject of Bible prophecy through the eyes of another believer and this book was no exception.On a bit of a more critical note, in my opinion Mr. Guthries explanation of Daniel 9 and the starting date for the 70 Weeks prophecy is a little bit lacking. Starting the prophecy from 458 BC based upon Ezra 7 creates a bit of an interpretation problem because Ezra 7 provides no date for the command of the Persian Artaxerxes.  A prophecy as important as Daniel 9 must be established upon a solid Biblical foundation.Additionally the word command in Daniel 9:25 comes from the Hebrew dabar and simply means word. Dabar is Biblical record is predominately used to refer to the word of YHWH. In Daniel 9 dabar is used several other times and in each case it refers to the word of YHWH. In the context of the Second Temple era the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem (in my opinion) best describes the word of YHWH as given in Haggai 1, Zechariah 1 and witnessed by Ezra 6.One other minor note: In location 603 on my Kindle Mr. Guthrie makes the following quote: Under Cyrus, the  temple was rebuilt, but those who had been around to see Solomons temple wept when they saw the new, much smaller version (see Ezra 3: 1-13).This passage in Ezra 3 refers not to the complete temple but the laying of the foundation stones. The temple was not completed during the reign of Cyrus, but nearly 20 years later during the reign of Darius the Great Artaxerxes in his 6th year.In summary this was a wonderful book I would recommend to anyone interested in the subject of Bible prophecy. In reading this book I gained a new appreciation for the many wonderful prophecies found in the Bible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C9XT108OZULN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B85M5B8#wasThisHelpful","R2C9XT108OZULN","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know Ive read a lot of material by Chuck Missler over the years. I was even a member of his Berean forum for a time and I must say he has often had wonderful insights into Bible prophecy. In this his latest book Mr. Missler looks at the prophecy of 70 Weeks. Here is a quote from the first few pages of his book which I think is worth repeating because of its importance:Daniel 9 is probably one of the most pivotal chapters in the entire Bible for understanding end-time prophecy.Mr. Missler goes on to explain why Daniel 9 and the prophecy of 70 Weeks is so pivotal to our understanding. Here are a few of the aspects of Bible prophecy which Daniel 9 influences.1. The death and resurrection of Yeshua.2. The 7 year tribulation.3. A future seven year covenant4. The anti-Christ5. The rapture6. The Second Coming.As Mr. Missler goes on to explain there are few aspects of Bible prophecy which Daniel 9 does not in some way influence. Thats how important the propehcy of 70 Weeks is to our eschatological world view.In chapter 1: Background and Context, Mr. Missler makes this extremely important statement concerning interpreting Scripture and deception as it relates to understanding Daniel 9:How do we protect ourselves from being deceived? There are all kinds of people spreading all kinds of viewpoints. But which are correct? We discern the truth by diligence, and by comparing Scripture with Scripture. Our ultimate refuge is always the whole counsel of God. Any particular perspective must be consistent with what we find in the Bible.In the subsequent chapter Mr. Missler goes on to lay out his understanding of the prophecy of 70 Weeks, based upon the original template first proposed by Sir Robert Anderson. Since this is meant to be a balance review I would like to point out a few areas where I believe Sir Robert Andersons theory fails to meet the criteria Mr. Missler establishes above1. Sir Anderson provides no evidence for his belief that Ezra and Nehemiah were contemporaries of the Persian king Longimanus. In the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Zechariah, Haggai and Chronicles all biblical chronological evidence shows that Ezra and Nehemiah were contemporaries of Darius the Great Artaxerxes. Anderson never explains this position but simply defers to the judgment of the chronologist Rawlinson who himself never provides any Biblical evidence for such a claim.2. Andersons prophetic year of 360 days is never intercalated with a solar year of 365.24 days. In order for Anderson calculations to be accurate the solar cycle must be accounted for. Historically it can be proven from the measurements of the Cubit, Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid that for at least the past 4500 years the solar cycle has been 365.24 days in length. Andersons prophetic year then would wander through the season much as the Islamic calendar does today. Remember YHWH told Moses at the Exodus that the Biblical year began based upon the agricultural cycle of Abib. Abib in turn is governed by the solar cycle. This means that a intercalary month had to added in order to keep the lunar and the solar cycles in sync.  This is never addressed by Anderson3. Anderson claims only four Persian commands qualify as possible candidates for the commandment to restore and build of Daniel 9:25. Yet the word commandment comes form the Hebrew dabar and it simply means word. Dabar is used several times in Daniel 9 and each of the other times dabar refers to the word of YHWH. It is disconcerting that Anderson never attempted to look for a word of YHWH which might begin the prophecy of 70 Weeks.As a Berean which Mr. Missler so often encourages us to be I would love to get his opinion on these omissions by Sir Robert Anderson. With so much riding on the prophecy of 70 Weeks I think it is important to answer these questions with a reasonable rendering of the Biblical record.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TUWSI83A8V3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143TH2TU#wasThisHelpful","R2TUWSI83A8V3W","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mark Levin, in his latest bestseller explains why Plunder and Deceit are but hallmarks of a society which has lost its virtue.  In this compelling treatise directed towards Americas younger generation Mr. Levin describes why the excesses of the past will be borne by the children of those who incurred them. The mission of this book, as Mr. Levin describes it, is to avert the loss of the greatest republic known to mankind. In thinking about the consequences of failed republics I am reminded of ancient Rome and the events its failed republic spawned. I cant help but wonder if we have really learned anything from the past. As George Santayana the respected Spanish philosopher and essayist is famous for saying, Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Speaking of failed republics and the past there is a bit of little known early American history which reminds me that truth is often stranger than fiction. Some might call it irony or even destiny, but nearly 350 years ago in the mid 1600s a little known man named Francis Pope purchased a track of land in southern Maryland which he named Rome. A creek on his property called Goose Creek he renamed the Tiber. Maybe Mr. Pope had a sense of humor or maybe he knew something others did not, but just over 100 years later the Rome of Francis Pope became part of land upon which was build our nations capital. In the early years Tiber Creek was used as the sewage system of the District of Columbia. Over time the Tiber disappeared underground and merged into Washington DCs growing sewage and canal system.  Buildings were built on top of the Tiber including many north of Constitution Avenue.Then in the 1930s in an act of fate, even our founding fathers could not have foreseen, there was constructed atop the sewage system of Tiber Creek one of Americans most favored institutions. You and I know that institution as the IRS. So next time you or someone you know complains about Washington flushing your tax dollars down the drain, you can now tell them the rest of the story. Tell them about an American with a sense of humor, about Francis Pope who lived in Rome on the Tiber...Obscure American history aside, history does indeed have a strange way of rhyming and Mr. Levins book is a tour de force in educating Americans about the dangers of government overreach. Several of the chapters which stood our for me were:1. Plunder and Deceit2. On the Debt5. On EducationI admit the concerns Mr. Levin expressed in this book confirm many of my own thoughts and fears as an American husband and father of five children. Although Mr. Levin did briefly acknowledge the moral root of our problems I think his argument would have rested on a stronger foundation if he had developed a chapter on the importance and origins of morality in the civil affairs of man.  Overall I appreciated the book and I gained many valuable insights by reading it.I think it only fitting to end this review with words of the Irish poet Thomas Moore after he visited our nations capital in 1803:In fancy, now, beneath the twilight gloom,Come, let me lead thee oer the second RomeWhere tribunes rule, where dusky Davi bow,And what was Goose creek once is Tiber now;This embryo Capital, where fancy seesSquares in morasses, oblelisks in treesWhich second-sighted seers, even now adornWith shrines unbuilt and heroes yet unborn.Will we be our children's heroes?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ET3CCW9WN3RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W061CFO#wasThisHelpful","R2ET3CCW9WN3RE","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter purchased these shoes through my Amazon Prime account and I thought I would post her thoughts on the shoes.After reading some reviews about this brand of sandals that the size listed was usually not the best fit, I made sure to measure my foot according to their size scale. When the shoes arrived, they did seem a little small, but once I wore them in a little, the size is great. The reason for the 4 stars is, although they are super comfortable, it is rather easy to twist your ankle. The adjustable strap is very nice because as the shoes get more worn in, you can tighten them up.

This makes for some really great quality video. Recording stop and start is on the front of the device and is a simple one push button. There are numerous sensor features on this camera which allow the user to automatically turn on the camera under various circumstances. Most of these sensor features have multiple settings. I did notice the camera gets a little hot when recording but this does not seem to cause any problems that I could tell.If you are looking at this camera you should know that it does not come with a micro memory card and that will have to be purchased separately.

"The Final Jubilee is a follow up to T.W. Tramms book 2012-2015: The Season of Return. In this latest book Mr. Tramm pinpoints the year 2015 as the final jubilee of this age and the possible date for Christ return. Building upon Newtons interpretation of Daniel 9 and the blood moon celestial phenomenon Mr. Tramm makes a multifaceted case for dating the return of Christ. Although Mr. Tramm provides some really great information on the jubilee and Sabbath cycles I believe he takes his current theory several steps too far by trying to provide a specific date for 2nd coming. The dating aspect of this theory aside there are several aspect to Mr. Tramms theory which I respectfully dont believe meet a reasonable evidentiary threshold.* Regarding 2015 being the terminus date of 6000 years from Adam and the final jubilee of the 120th cycle it is important to clarify that this requires a 50 year Jubilee cycle which is not synchronized with the Sabbath cycle. The problem with this the Biblical evidence suggests the jubilee and Sabbath cycles are synchronized. By Mr. Tramms own admission a jubilee of years is patterned after the count to Shavuot (Pentecost). Shavuots little jubilee of days begins and ends on the first day of the week. Likewise it is only congruent that a jubilee of years begins and ends the same way otherwise you would have the jubilee cycle interrupting the continuous yearly Sabbath cycle. I believe it would be more accurate to use a jubilee that is synchronized with the Sabbath cycle which would make the 6000th year from Adam fall during the 123 Jubilee cycle.With this in mind it is fascinating to see that the apostle Matthew gives 41 generations from Abraham to Yeshua. Further using the Bibles chronology those 41 generations are equal 41 synchronized jubilee cycles. Equally fascinating is there are 41 jubilees between Abraham and Adam. Also our own generation is living in the 41st jubilee cycle from Yeshua.On a related note in confirmation of Shavuot being a little jubilee its really neat to see that the first time the word jubilee (yowbel) is used in the Scripture it is found in Exo. 19:13. This auspicious date marked the point when YHWH personally gave the law to Israel at Sinai. The next 13 occurrence of Jubilee in the Bible are all references to the yearly jubilee instructions.There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet (yowbel) soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.  Exodus 19:13* Another problem with Mr. Tramms theory is when he refers to Hebrew years as 360 days in length in calculating the 49 years between 1967 and 2015 (Kindle location 731) Im not entirely sure what the author means by a Hebrew year but the Biblical year as defined by Genesis and affirmed in Exodus is not a lunar year of 360 days but rather a lunar/solar year which requires a 13 month intercalation. Even a 360 day lunar year as Mr. Tramm suggest still requires an intercalation to keep it synchronized with the solar cycle as inferred by Genesis 1:14. Any calculations which do not take this intercalation into account cannot be considered accurate.It is entirely incongruent (in my opinion) to use a 360 day Hebrew lunar year to calculate the 49 years between 1967 and 2015 and at the same time use a lunar/solar Biblical year to calculate the 49 year Jubilee and Sabbath cycle.* Mr Tramms claim that the 7 sevens of Daniel 9:25 begin with Israel establishing control over Jerusalem in 1967 and end with the return of Christ in 2015 has some additional obstacles to overcome. First, Daniel 9:25 states specifically that the countdown to the Messiah begins with a commandment to restore and build. Simple put there was no commandment to restore and build Jerusalem in 1967. Further the word commandment is the Hebrew word dabar and out of the over 1000 times this word is used in the Bible the vast majority of the time it refers to the word of YHWH. Daniel 9 uses dabar 4 times and each of the other 3 times dabar refers specifically to the word of YHWH.  In context the word to restore and build Jerusalem can only refer to the word YHWH gave to Haggai and Zechariah which commandment the Jewish people to return and build Jerusalem and the temple. Besides the two witness of Haggai and Zechariah this word was also recorded by Ezra in chapter 6 of his record of the 2nd temple era.In summary, in my opinion for the above reasons, this book falls short of a reasonable evidentiary threshold.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J0ZL47MLMOO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JA42IA#wasThisHelpful","R2J0ZL47MLMOO8","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bible prophecy is such a rich, complex and wonderful topic. I dont know about you but more than once over the years Ive found myself a little confused about the wide ranging disagreements and the unusual terms used by scholars and teachers on the subject. Well be confused no more. Ron Rhodes new book The 8 Great Debates of Bible Prophecy does an excellent job of describing some of the most important and complex subject of Biblical prophecy. Written from a futurist pretribulational perspective Mr. Rhodes explores some of the most controversial aspect of eschatology by explaining the different eschatological positions held by believers today. Now I do have substantive disagreements with Mr. Rhodes on several topics but I loved the genuine spirit with which Mr. Rhodes offered what he believed is the soundest Biblical perspective. I especially appreciated how Mr. Rhodes described the 8 Great Debates of Bible Prophecy without getting lost in all of the details. Without arrogant condescension Mr. Rhodes explained the diverse perspectives on the great debates and then gave what he believed to be the correct Biblical interpretation. A couple of the debate topics which stood out to me were:Debate 2: Are Israel and the Church Distinct in Bible Propehcy?Debate 3: What Can We Know About the Signs of the Times?Debate 4: Which View of the Rapture is Correct?In debate #2 Mr. Rhodes makes what I believe is a sound case for why Israel and Church remain distinct in YHWHs overall plan for mankind. Mr. Rohodes explains why the yet unfulfilled prophecies about the 2nd coming, Israel and the end of this age are best understood in a literal manner.In debate #3 Mr. Rhodes makes a good case for why many of the signs today do indeed point to soon return of Yeshua. As part of this debate Mr. Rhodes also offers a perspective on the Ezekiel Invasion and when it will occur in the Biblical timeline. In this section Mr. Rhodes also looks at the question of whether America is in Bible prophecy. For those wondering his conclusion, he believes the US plays no direct role, instead he looks to a revived Roman empire originating out of a European union for the fulfillment of the future beast empire. I must admit I am often struck by the irony of this subject. Today many have rejected the theory of a revived Roman empire of Europe instead opting for a Islamic anti-Christ system based in the middle east (this debate is covered in the book as well).Though adherents to both of these two positions believe we are living in the last days neither believes the worlds only superpower today has any direct role in these final events. This logic then naturally leads to the conclusion that this superpower must fade from the world stage in short order. What I find ironic is that both sides go to great lengths to show how either Europe or Islam fits a revived Roman empire model or some derivation thereof but they dont hold the US to the same standard of consideration. For balance here are a few facts to consider:1. The US capital was built on piece of land owned by Francis Pope. Ironically our capitol was build on a hill on this piece of land which Pope named Rome Hill. The creek which was once Goose Creek became the Tiber. The Tiber evolved to become part of the drainage and sewage system of our nations capital.2. Rome hill eventually became Capitol hill. We own the origins of the word Capitol to Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of ancient Rome where the Roman god Jupiter was honored.3. The US was founded by immigrants from what was once the Roman Empire.4. Like Rome the US was once a republic.5. Like Rome the US became known for its cultural, military and political influence.6. Like Rome the US became obsessed with games of sport played in coliseums. True prosperity was traded for bread and circuses (entertainment).7. Like Rome the US, as its power and affluence increased, lost any semblance of moral or ethical standard.I could go on but I guess I cant help but wonder what the future holds for the worlds only superpower whose cultural beginnings can be traced directly to the ancient Rome. Surely we have been blessed as a nation but to whom much is given much is required. Have we become so arrogant that we believe God wont use us in the same way he used Rome or ancient  Egypt when they hardened their heart to the words of the living God of the Bible? Have we become so blinded by our glorious beginnings that we cant fathom the possibility that we might have become what we most feared?Okay I got a little of track there so I will only mention one other part of Mr. Rhodes debates topic which really stood out to me. In debate #5 Mr. Rhodes explains how Daniel 9 and the 70 Weeks prophecy relates to the book of Revelation.  To illustrate how important Daniel 9 is to Mr. Rhodes eschatological framework you will find that he mentions the final week of this prophecy at least 60 times in the book.In the spirit of respectful disagreement, in consideration of how central a role the 70 Weeks prophecy plays in eschatological framework of this book,  I think it important to note that Mr. Rhodes interpretation of Daniel 9 is not based upon a strong Biblical foundation. Here are a few points where I believe Mr. Rhodes interpretation does not meet a reasonable Biblical interpretational threshold:1. Mr. Rhodes believes Ezra and Nehemiah were contemporaries of Artaxerxes Longimanus. This assumption is contrary to the Biblical evidence which shows Ezra and Nehemiah were contemporaries of Darius the great Artaxerxes.2. The interpretation of Daniel 9 used in this book is based upon a vague or wandering lunar calendar of 360 days. The Biblical calendar used from the Exodus onward was lunar/solar and intercalated with a 13th month.3. Daniel 9 as interpreted in this book does not take into consideration the Divine command to restore and build given to Israel though the prophets Haggai and Zachariah. In Daniel 9:25 the word command is the Hebrew word dabar. Dabar is used 4 times in Daniel 9. The first three times it is used it refers to the word of YHWH.4. In Mr. Rhodes view of Daniel 9 the first 69 weeks (98.6%) of the prophecy focuses on the Messiah. The last 1.4% of the prophecy then shifts to the Anti-Messiah. By this interpretation the Messianic focus of Daniel 9 ends with the death of the Messiah and the rise of the Anti-Messiah. As a futurist who believes in the literal and yet future return of Yeshua as well as the literal and yet future fulfillment of the promises made to Israel I find it very difficult to believe that Daniel 9, the single greatest prophetic expression of the Messianic hope, ends with the death of the Messiah without a single word of hope for His resurrection.In closing, I hope the disagreements I expressed in this review are taken in the same spirit that Mr. Rhodes used throughout his book, The 8 Great Debates of Bible Prophecy. My disagreements notwithstanding this book is one of the best books on Bible prophecy Ive read this year and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to get a better handle on some of the Bibles great prophecy debates.  Let me end this review with a quote Mr. Rhodes used in the postscript to this book which well sums up the attitude Mr. Rhodes showed throughout this book.  Mr. Rhodes takes this quote from J.C. Ryles book on Holiness:  I must enter my protest against the sneering, taunting, contemptuous language which has been frequently used of late. To say the least, such language is unseemly, and only defeats its own end. A cause which is defended by such language is deservedly suspicious. Truth needs no such weapons. If we cannot agree with men, we need not speak of their views with discourtesy and contempt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHXBMRW0MXPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736944265#wasThisHelpful","R1KHXBMRW0MXPQ","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You know, the older I get the more I am awed at how often our Creator uses our often difficult circumstances in this life to bless others and further His purposes in this age. Even more amazing is that often the beneficiaries of those blessings are people we dont even know. Marci Julins new book When You Cant Trust His Heart: Discovering the Limitless Love of God is a good example of this rule. In this touching story, the author describes the challenges she faced which left her questioning her faith in Gods love. Im not talking about the new exciting faith which comes when a new believer professes faith in Christ but rather the faith of the one who had grown and matured to the point where we have peace in this life knowing that despite the difficult circumstances Gods love has not forsaken us, but rather it is His love which sustains and strengthens us through those challenges. So many things spoke to me personally in this book. Ive been a self employed contractor for nearly all of my adult life and if my phone does not ring there is no work. Ive personally often struggled with trusting that God would provide the work needed to feed my family and take care of my responsibilities, but you know, in looking back despite all the ups and downs YHWH has provided for us every step of the way even when I couldnt see where that provision was going to come from. I can say from personal experience that there are valuable insights and wonderful encouragement in this book for those who have or are currently struggling with relying on the love of God and his faithfulness to help you get through lifes challenges. Take an hour or two and read this book. I think you find, like I did, that it will bless and encourage you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPCDG9PWRUIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTJUGK4#wasThisHelpful","R2BPCDG9PWRUIN","A66FEF7OJVIBE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A66FEF7OJVIBE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CONTENT:Joe South: Golden Records 1961- 1966, released by reputable reissue label Rare Rockin Records from Australia in 2015, contains 32 songs. This is not a Greatest Hits album, but instead it is a collection of hits and rarities from the pen of Joe South  legendary writer, singer and producer, reflecting the Early Songwriting Genius of Joe South. I have compiled a detailed song listing (including label & number, chart position, year of release, plus personal comments)(BB Pop=Billboard Hot 100):01 SILLY LITTLE GIRL  Joe South*from album The Joe South Story (MGM LP MSG 1100)(1971)*stereo; the charted version by the Tams should have been included here.02 DOWN IN THE BOONDOCKS  Billy Joe Royal (Columbia 43305)(a-side)(BB Pop 9/1965)*stereo.03 UNTIE ME  the Tams (Arlen 7-11)(BB Pop 60/1962)*rare gem.04 FELL BY THE WAYSIDE  Pat Powdrill (Reprise 20,166)(uncharted a-side, 1963)05 CONCRETE JUNGLE  Joe South (MGM 13196)(uncharted a-side, 1964)06 LONG LONELY WINTER  the Chips (Joe South)(Tollie 9042)(b-side, 1965)*a-side Party People track #11.07 DEEP INSIDE ME  the Tams (Arlen 7-17)(uncharted a-side, 1962)08 GOLDEN RECORDS  Judy Thomas (Tollie 9021)(uncharted a-side, 1964)09 I WANT TO BE SOMEBODY  Joe South (Apt 25084)(uncharted a-side, 1964)*stereo.10 DEVIL MAY CARE  Ray Stevens (Monument 45-927)(uncharted a-side, 1966)*b-side Make A Few Memories track #25.11 PARTY PEOPLE  the Chips (Joe South)(Tollie 9042)(uncharted a-side, 1965)12 DARK GLASSES  Billy Joe Royal (Fairlane 45-21013)(uncharted a-side, 1962)*b-side Perhaps also written by Joe South not included here.13 BIG BROTHER  Vince Everett (ABC-Paramount 45-10624)(uncharted a-side, 1965)14 JUST TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN  Joe South (Fairlane 45-21015)(uncharted a-side, 1962)15 HES MY HERO  Barbara South (Capitol 5692)(uncharted a-side, 1966)16 THAT SAME OLD SONG  the Fabulous Dinos (Musicor MU 1025)(uncharted a-side, 1962)17 WHAT A LIE  the Chips (Joe South)(Ember E-1077)(b-side, 1961)*a-side Bye Bye, My Love track #32.18 MASQUERADE  Joe South (Fairlane 45-21010)(uncharted a-side, 1961)*stereo; b-side Im Sorry For You track #23.19 SHOULD I COME BACK  Jay Lewis (Capitol 5095)(uncharted a-side, 1963)20 SPRINGTIME IN MY HEART  Bob Collins & the Diamond (Tuneglow 1)(uncharted a-side, 1961)21 REALLY YOU  Billy Joe Royal (Players 1)(b-side, 1965)*a-side Im Specialized not included here.22 STANDING IN  the Tams*from album Presenting The Tams (ABC-Paramount LP-481)(1964)23 IM SORRY FOR YOU  Joe South (Fairlane 45-21010)(b-side, 1961)*stereo.24 I DONT KNOW YOU  Judy Thomas (Tower 131)(uncharted a-side, 1965)25 MAKE A FEW MEMORIES  Ray Stevens (Monument 45-927)(b-side, 1966)26 TO HAVE, TO HOLD AND LET GO  Vince Everett (ABC-Paramount 45-10624)(b-side, 1965)27 POLLYANNA  the Classics (Capitol 5710)(uncharted a-side, 1966)*stereo; later became the Classics IV.28 LEANING ON YOU  the Yo Yos (Goldwax 303)29 BLUE SHADOWS  the Tams (Arlen 7-20)(b-side, 1963)30 STANDING INVITATION  Joe South (MGM K 13145)(b-side, 1963)*a-side Same Old Song not included here.31 I KNEW YOU WHEN  Billy Joe Royal (Columbia 43390)(BB Pop 14/1965)*stereo.32 BYE BYE, MY LOVE  the Chips (Joe South)(Ember E-1077)(uncharted a-side, 1961)POSITIVE POINTS:1 It should be pointed out from the beginning that the title Golden Records is misleading. This set does not collect the Golden Records of Joe South. But instead this set is a collection of songs written by Joe South from 1961 to 1966, performed by himself or other artists. There are many rare gems, making their CD debut. The editor has done a good job compiling this collection.2 The sound is very well remastered. As stated in the booklet, due to the rarity of some recordings, it was necessary to remaster from both analogue tapes and vinyl sources. Still, the remastering job is good.3 There is a fantastic 16-page booklet, with an excellent liner notes. 8 rare singles labels are included. There are also many rare pictures of Joe South.4 32 songs. Good value!NEGATIVE POINT:1 The misleading words Golden Records should be removed from the front cover.FINAL THOUGHTS:In 2013, Rare Rockin Records issued a CD of the songs written early in the career of David Gates, called The Early Years. (my review elsewhere) There is a lot of similarity between David Gates and Joe South. Both began their careers in the late 50s and even issued recordings under their own names in that decade. The 60s followed and both were esteemed studio musicians and sought after guitarists. They wrote and produced many songs, even gracing the charts from time to time. At the end of the decade, both finally got the recognition they so deserved: David Gates as a member of Bread and Joe South as solo artist with his LP Introspect and the Grammy winning hit single, Games People Play. This set demonstrates just how talented Joe South is, with so many rare gems, making their CD debut. Because of lack of many charted singles, I am afraid this set is more for collectors and Joe South fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MV2BAIYIDD79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBNZ7EA#wasThisHelpful","R2MV2BAIYIDD79","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:Heart of a Woman, released by Private Music in 1999, contains 12 songs, dedicated to Women.

She asserts and expresses her true feelings in every song through new exciting arrangements. She claims a respectful signature tribute to her female idols: the late Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, and Carmen McRae. All the songs are produced by Lupe De Leon, arranged by Josh Sklair, with a great supporting band, including Dave Matthews on electric and acoustic piano. Both her sons, Sametto and Donato, were also involved.POSITIVE POINTS:1 This is a concept album of Etta James, celebrating The year of the Women and at the same time, her personal tribute to all her female idols. All the songs are nicely done.2 The sound is very well remastered.3 There is an 8-page booklet, with a forward written by Etta James and short essay by Pat Kannas. Members of artists in each song were identified.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Heart of a Woman is Ettas 27th album release and 6th on Private Music label, following Life, Love & the Blues and 12 Songs of Christmas both in 1998. Her soulful, romantic, tender voice delivers one of her richest and most satisfying collections ever. She bumps and slides into a groove exceptionally glamorous for her seasoned fans ears, like ours, while setting the stage for a stampede of new fans to emerge. The entire set is totally enjoyable and very satisfying, and is highly recommended to all Etta James fans.PS: Please note that this current album is NOT included in the ""Complete Private Music Album Collection"" box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZETNM5SDFC35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00138D18G#wasThisHelpful","R2ZETNM5SDFC35","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are two young children with Etta, probably her grandchildren.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:12 Songs of Christmas is her 26th album release, following Life, Love & the Blues in 1998. Christmas is not exclusive to Bing Crosby, Perry Como or Andy Williams. I feel that every major artist should have a Christmas album for completeness sake.

"CONTENT:Time After Time by Etta James was released by Private Music in 1995, her 23rd album so far and her 2nd on Private Music, following the very successful Mystery Lady: Song of Billie Holiday in 1994. I have compiled a song listing which is as follows (US=US Singles Chart prior to 1955; BB Pop=Billboard Hot 100):LP TIME AFTER TIME (Etta James)(Private Music 82128)(1995):01 DONT GO TO STRANGERS*original version by Etta Jones (1960)02 TEACH ME TONIGHT*original version: Jo Stafford (US 15/1954) and Dinah Washington (US 23/1954); inspired by Dinahs live performance watched by Etta after a verbal spat at Ettas live performance.

From his essay, I enjoy reading about the encounter between Dinah Washington and Etta James: In the 1960s, when Etta James was performing, knowing Dinah Washington in the audience, she started with Dinahs Unforgettable. During the song, Boom: someone swept the glasses off the tableit was Dinah Washington. Etta cried off the stage. After the show, Dinah met Etta in the dressing room, and politely taught her Never sing another artists song if shes in the house. Dinah then kissed Etta on the cheek and apologized for losing her temper and invited Etta to her own show the next day. That was the time when Etta heard Teach Me Tonight that inspired her to put that song in her new record. Thank you, David, for such an insightful story.NEGATIVE POINT:1 It should be noted that in the CD, track 7 Imagination and track 10 Evrybodys Somebodys Fool are reversed.FINAL THOUGHTS:Time After Time was Ettas 23rd album and the second on Private Music. All the songs are well chosen and nicely performed with excellent band with great soundindeed, a worthy follow-up to her Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday. Her next release is Loves Been Rough on Me in 1997. This album combines her powerful, bluesy voice with cool jazz, the best of both worlds.

"CONTENT:Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday by Etta James was released by her new label Private Music in 1994. This is the breakthrough album that reignites her career to new high. I have compiled a song listing which is as follows (US=US Singles Chart prior to 1955):LP MYSTERY LADY: SONGS OF BILLIE HOLIDAY (Etta James)(Private Music 82114)(1994):01 DONT EXPLAIN02 YOUVE CHANGED03 THE MAN I LOVE*original version by Marion Harris (US 4/1928)04 I DONT STAND A GHOST OF A CHANCE (WITH YOU)*original version by Bing Crosby (US 5/1933)05 LOVER MAN (OH WHERE CAN YOU BE)*original version by Billie Holiday (US 16/1945)06 EMBRACEABLE YOU*original version by Red Nichols (US 2/1929); later by Jimmy Dorsey (US 23/1941)07 HOW DEEP IS THE OCEAN*original version by Guy Lombardo (US 4/1932)08 (IM AFRAID) THE MASQUERADE IS OVER*original version by Jimmy Dorsey (US 4/1939)09 BODY AND SOUL*original version by Paul Whiteman & His Orchestra (US 1(6)/1930)10 THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU *original version by Ray Noble & His Orchestra (US 1(5)/1934)11 ILL BE SEEING YOU*original version by Bing Crosby (US 1(4)/1944)According to Etta James, the Mystery Lady was her mother, Dorothy, Billie Holiday or Etta herself. A gentle mist fell over the recording session, a study in subtlety and understatement by a singer whose overpowering successes have come chiefly in the field of hard-hitting rhythm-and-blues. Mystery Lady is a departure, a reflective journey looking back and forward at the same time. This album was produced by John Snyder, arranged by Cedar Walton, and recorded at Ocean Way Recording Studios, Los Angeles, California. The band was also outstanding with Cedar Walton, piano, Tony Dumas, drums, Ralph Penland, drums & percussion, Josh Sklair, guitar, Kraig Kilby, trombone and Red Holloway, tenor & alto saxophones. In 1996, this album won Best Jazz Vocal Performance Grammy.POSITIVE POINTS:1 A simply outstanding album 11 unforgettable jazz ballads, done Etta James style. Her mother reminded Etta not to try to copy Billie Holiday, because nobody could, but simply sing the songs in such way to express Ettas own innermost feelings. I guess this is what true singing and jazz music are all about.2 The sound is very well remastered.3 There is an 8-page booklet, with an excellent, informative essay by her autobiographer, David Ritz.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday is an outstanding album with unforgettable songs and performance by Etta James that both simply soothe the soul. This is her debut release on new label Private Music,  a label that she will have another 9 albums until 2003. Her next release will be Time After Time in 1995. This current set is her 22nd album release, and is one of my all-time favourite Etta James album, combining her powerful, bluesy voice with cool jazz, the best of both worlds. In my opinion, this set is very highly recommended and a Must-Own.PS: Please note that this current album is NOT included in the ""Complete Private Music Album Collection"" box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q176Y69SRZJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HMHQ8I#wasThisHelpful","R1Q176Y69SRZJ5","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:The Right Time by Etta James was released by her new label Elektra in 1992. This is her only release on Elektra label. I have compiled a song listing which is as follows:LP THE RIGHT TIME (Etta James)(Elektra 61347)(1992):01 I SING THE BLUES02 LOVE AND HAPPINESS03 EVENING OF LOVE04 WET MATCH05 YURE TAKING UP ANOTHER MANS PLACE06 GIVE IT UP (duet with Steve Winwood)07 LET IT ROCK08 NINETY NINE AND A HALF (WONT DO)09 YOUVE GOT ME10 NIGHTTIME IS THE RIGHT TIME11 DOWN HOME BLUESThis album was produced by Jerry Wexler, who also produced her Deep In the Night album in 1978. Jerry was determined to produce this album that he sent Etta over 100 songs (by cassette then of course). The songs were recorded in Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, Sheffield, Alabama, where Etta cut her Tell Mama smash in 1967, and the same period  when Wexler brought Wilson Pickett to this quiet hamlet to record the raucous Funky Broadway and Mustang Sally. Working with the motivation of hungry teenagers, both producer and singer share the belief that in this over-tech era of bloodless syntheses, soul music is an endangered species. To remedy the situation, prior to meeting in Muscle Shoals, Jerry and Etta have dedicated six months to laying the foundation of a record described by Wexler as immaculate funk. Not just right, adds Etta, but righteous.POSITIVE POINTS:1 This is a very strong, funky album, made with blood, sweat and tears. Every song is outstanding, with a great supporting cast, like Clayton Ivey on keyboard, Lucky Peterson on guitar and Hammond B2, Steve Ferrone (of Average White Band) on drums, Willie Weeks on bass and Steve Cropper, one of the chief architects of the Southern soul sound, on rhythm guitar, plus Hank Crawford providing the horn section and sax solos. We also have Steve Winwood providing strong vocals.2 The sound is well remastered.3 There is an 8-page booklet, with an informative essay by David Ritz. Details about names of the band were included. At the back cover, we have a beautiful coloured picture of Etta with her two sons, Sametto and Donto James. One notices that she still looked overweight, before her reduction in weight by gastric bypass and rekindling of her career to follow.NEGATIVE POINT:1 None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California. She was nicknamed Miss Peaches. She has a long illustrious career.  Her singing style spanned a variety of music genres including blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz and gospel. She has frequent bouts of heroin addiction, but finally cured in the late 1970s. In 1996, her album Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday won Best Jazz Vocal Performance Grammy. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2008. She died of leukemia on January 20, 2012 (age 74). Her mighty, moving voice is sorely missed.After collecting all her 123 songs (as singles, except one song Bring It on Home to Me her duet with Tony Orlando), I am in the process of collecting all her domestic albums. The Right Time is her 21st album release, following Stickin To My Guns in 1989. Her next album is break-through album Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday. This current entire album is making its CD debut with good sound. The entire set is totally enjoyable, and will be treasured. Naturally, this set is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNNN3FIBYEWDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003A9GGWY#wasThisHelpful","RNNN3FIBYEWDT","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:Stickin To My Guns by Etta James was released by her new label Island Records in 1989, her 2nd and final release on Island Records. Barry Beckett, whom Etta James called his Moses, was the producer and also on keyboards. This album was recorded in Digital Recorders by Justin Niebank. I have compiled a song listing which is as follows:LP STICKIN TO MY GUNS (Etta James)(Island 210 715)(1989):01 WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT*featuring Arik Marshall, lead guitar.02 LOVE TO BURN*featuring Arik Marshall, lead guitar; written by Dobie Gray, on background vocal.03 THE BLUES DONT CARE*featuring Jimmy Pugh, piano; written by Etta James and Brian Ray.04 YOUR GOOD THING (IS ABOUT TO END)*featuring Jimmy Pugh, piano; written by David Porter and Isaac Hayes.05 GET FUNKY*featuring Def Jam, vocal, & Bobby Vega, bass; written by Danny Rhodes, rhythm guitar.06 BEWARE*featuring Leo Nocentelli, lead guitar.07 OUT OF THE RAIN*featuring Jimmie Wood, harmonica; written by Tony Joe White.08 STOLEN AFFECTION*featuring Josh Sklair, rhythm & lead guitar.09 A FOOL IN LOVE*featuring Gene Dinwiddie, tenor sax solo.10 IVE GOT DREAMS TO REMEMBER*featuring Jimmy Pugh, piano; written by Otis Redding.POSITIVE POINTS:1 This set was her second and final album release on Island Records. Again, Barry Beckett produced another funky record. It should be noted that Dobie Gray was one of the background vocals. In the booklet, she thanked the Toronto Chicks. Being from Toronto, I wonder who they are.2 The sound is well remastered.3 There is a 6-page booklet, detailing all the artists involved. There is a nice picture of Etta with her two sons, Sametto and Donto James.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

"CONTENT:Seven Year Itch  by Etta James was released by her new label Island Records in 1988, after 7-8 years following her last album release Changes. Barry Beckett, whom Etta James called him his Moses, was the producer and also on keyboards. This album was recorded in the FAME Studio. I have compiled a song listing which is as follows:LP SEVEN YEAR ITCH (Etta James)(Island 91018)(1988):01 I GOT THE WILL (Island IS 418)(uncharted a-side, 1988)*rare gem; CD debut.02 JUMP INTO MY FIRE03 SHAKEY GROUND04 COME TO MAMA*featured on James' live album Burnin' Down the House: Live at the House of Blues in 2003.05 DAMN YOUR EYES (Island K-891)(Australian b-side, 1988)*rare gem; CD debut.06 BREAKIN UP SOMEBODYS HOME07 THE JEALOUS KIND08 HOW STRONG IS A WOMAN09 IT AINT ALWAYS WHAT YOU DO (ITS WHO YOU LET SEE YOU DO IT)10 ONE NIGHT (Island IS 418)(b-side, 1988)*rare gem; CD debut.POSITIVE POINTS:1 During the 7-8 years hiatus, Etta James was fighting drug and alcohol addiction. In 1984, she contacted David Wolper, asking to perform in the 1984 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, where she sang When The Saints Go Marching In. Then in 1987 she was seen performing ""Rock & Roll Music"" with Chuck Berry on his ""Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll"" documentary. In 1988, she was signed to Island Records. This set is her first release on Island Records, now making its CD debut. The album title may reflect the 7-8 years absence from album release.2 The sound is well remastered.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 There is no essay about the album.2 There are no bonus tracks.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

"CONTENT:Allen Toussaint Sessions: It Takes Love To Keep A Woman by Etta James was released by Fuel 2000 Records in 2014. This set with 10 songs has the same song listing of her album Changes released on MCA in 1980. At first glance, it seems an unlikely pairing: gritty, bold, occasionally salacious blues and soul queen Etta James, just about midway between her 60s hitmaking heyday and the heartwarming revival she experienced later in her legendary career, and elegant New Orleans piano mater/producer Allen Toussaint. Nevertheless, the two teamed up for the current album Changes done for Toussaint Sansu Enterprises. I have compiled a detailed song listing (including album and singles label & number, chart position, debut date, plus personal comments):LP CHANGES (Etta James)(MCA 3244)(1980):01 MEAN MOTHER (MCA 41264)(uncharted a-side, May 1980)*rare gem; CD debut.02 DONKEY03 CHANGES (MCA 102.693)(b-side, 1980)*b-side to Mean Mother in Netherlands.04 DONT STOP05 WHOS GETTING YOUR LOVE06 NIGHT BY NIGHT07 IT TAKES LOVE TO KEEP A WOMAN (MCA 41264)(b-side, May 1980)*rare gem; CD debut; there is another acceptable title It Takes A Lot of Love To Keep A Woman08 WHEEL OF FIRE09 NIGHT PEOPLE10 WITH YOU IN MINDPOSITIVE POINTS:1 Even though the entire album is fascinatingly funky and unlike anything else she ever recorded, but somehow the set fell through the commercial cracks.2 The sound is very well remastered. Of course, Allen Toussaint was featured on acoustic piano.3 There is a four page booklet with an informative essay by Bill Dahl.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

"CONTENT:Etta Is Betta Than Evvah! originally released in 1976, now released on CD by reputable reissue label Ace Records from UK in 2013, was the final album of Etta James tumultuous 16-year tenure at Chess Records. I have compiled a detailed song listing (including album and singles label & number, chart position, debut date, plus personal comments)(BB200=Billboard Album Chart; BB Pop=Billboard Hot 100; BB R&B=Billboard Rhythm & Blues Chart; CB Pop=Cash Box Singles Chart; RW Pop=Record World Singles Chart):LP ETTA IS BETTA THAN EVVAH! (Etta James)(Chess ACH-19003)(1976):01 WOMAN (SHAKE YOUR BOOTY)*a funky rewrite of a song Etta had recorded, as W-O-M-A-N, for Modern in 195 and again for Chess in 1971.02 A LOVE VIBRATION*original by Ann Peebles.03 ONLY A FOOL (Chess CH-2148)(b-side, February 1974)*was also previously released in album Etta James (Chess CH-50042)(BB200 154/1973).04 LITTLE BIT OF LOVE05 GROOVE ME*featured in Ettas live set, and redone by Etta in her farewell album The Dreamer in 2011.06 JUMP INTO LOVE (Chess ACH-31001)(a-side)(BB R&B 92/1976)(July 1976)*rare gem; CD debut.07 LEAVE YOUR HAT ON (Chess CH-2148)(a-side)(BB R&B 76/1974)(February 1974)*previously released in album Etta James (Chess CH-50042)(BB200 154/1973)08 IVE BEEN A FOOL (Chess ACH-31001)(b-side, July 1976)09 BLINDED BY LOVE*written by Allen Toussaint, first recorded by Johnny Winter.10 AINT NO PITY IN THE NAKED CITY*minor hit for singer/actress Pat Lundy.BONUS TRACKS:11 YOUVE LOST THAT LOVIN FEELIN*recorded in 1973; never released until The Chess Box (2000)12 DOWN SO LOW*from album Etta James (Chess CH-50042)(BB200 154/1973)13 ALL THE WAY DOWN (Chess CH-2144)(a-side)(BB Pop 101/1973; BB R&B 29/1973; CB Pop 70/1973)(September 1973)14 GODS SONG (THATS WHY I LOVE MANKIND)*from album Etta James (Chess CH-50042)(BB200 154/1973)15 POWER PLAY*from album Come A Little Closer; written by John Kay of Steppenwolf; Etta displays some of the angry emotion she was feeling at the time.16 COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER*from album Come A Little Closer17 FEELING UNEASY (Chess CH-2153)(b-side, July 1974)*from album Come A Little Closer; this wordless song was cut when she was ill from withdrawal, barely able to speak, and the one she never finished. In her autobiography, she stated that even when she hit emotional bottom, her singing did not seem to suffer. If anything, she was belting it out like her was on the line.18 ST. LOUIS BLUES*from album Come A Little Closer; has the same choral background arrangement similar to that used by Bessie Smith four decades earlier in the movie of the same name; this song was nominated  for 1974 Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance, won by Aretha Franklin for her stunning Aint Nothin Like the Real Thing19 LETS BURN DOWN THE CORNFIELD*from album Come A Little Closer; Ettas favourite song in that album; she considered Randy Newmans view of sin and salvation both funny and true.20 LOVIN ARMS (Chess CH-2171)(uncharted a-side, April 1975)POSITIVE POINTS:1 By 1976, Chess Records had been purchased by All Platinum. This album was her final one for Chess Records, mostly produced and arranged by the former Motown baritone sax hero Mike Perry, at the All Platinum Recording Studio in New Jersey, backed by the All Platinum house band, otherwise known as funk/disco hitmakers the Rimshots. All the songs are funky. This is the set where you will find the studio version of her concerts favourite Groove Me. This current set is making its CD debut.2 There are 10 additional bonus tracks.3 The sound is very well remastered.4 There is also a first class 12-page booklet, with an informative and a very moving essay by her long-time make-up artist, Rudy Calvo. But best of all are 7 colourful singles labels and 2 album labels, plus album covers. Labels and numbers are included. As far as booklet is concerned, Ace Records has the best booklet, even better than Real Gone Music (US). Jasmine Records and Sepia Records, are you listening?NEGATIVE POINT:1 The bonus tracks are not as attractive as those in Queen of Soul CD. My only complaint is that 4 out of 10 songs were from an earlier album Come A Little Closer and 3 were from album Etta James.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

"CONTENT:Come A Little Closer by Etta James recorded in 1974, released by Chess/MCA in 1996, contains 10 songs, plus 2 bonus tracks. At the time when this album was recorded, both Etta James and the Chess Record label were undergoing periods of crucial change. At that time, Etta James was incarcerated at a drug rehabilitation center, the Tarzana Psychiatric Hospital in Southern California. She was issued limited passes to leave the center to attend her scheduled sessions. The recording sessions for this album were fraught with extreme personal difficulty and it was a wonder it was ever finished at all. Chess Records was unsuccessful to keep up with the vagaries of the contemporary music scene, at one time going so far as to have several of its older blues artists cut misguided, inappropriate ""psychedelic albums. Most of the major artists were either dead or have left. This album was produced by Gabriel Mekler, who also just produced a charted album just before this one simply called Etta James. I have compiled a song listing (including album and singles label & number, chart position, debut date, plus personal comments):LP COME A LITTLE CLOSER (Etta James)(Chess CH-60029)(1974):01 OUT ON THE STREET AGAIN*album version sports a lengthy synth intro; guitarist was Wah Wah Watson.02 MAMA TOLD ME03 YOU GIVE ME WHAT I WANT04 COME A LITTLE CLOSER05 LETS BURN DOWN THE CORNFIELD*Ettas favourite song in this album; she considered Randy Newmans view of sin and salvation both funny and true.06 POWER PLAY*written by John Kay of Steppenwolf; Etta displays some of the angry emotion she was feeling at the time.07 FEELING UNEASY (Chess CH-2153)(b-side, July 1974)*rare gem; CD debut; this song was cut when she was ill from withdrawal, barely able to speak, and the one she never finished.

The final result was indeed a labour of love. When you listen to her singing very carefully, you could almost feel her pain. A very emotional album indeed.2 The sound is well remastered. According to Etta James, she stated that Gabriel Mekler was the first producer to have her punch in her vocals line by line to piece together a seamless performance  a precursor to the digital console we have in the recording studio nowadays.3 There is an 8-page booklet, containing an informative essay by Mary Katherine Aldin. After reading, one gains a lot of insight as to how this record was made.NEGATIVE POINT:1 None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

"CONTENT:Blues from the Big Apple by Etta James, released by Music Avenue label from US in 2007, contains 10 songs: 9 of which were live recordings from concert in New York in 1980, plus one bonus studio track.

She was doing small clubs at that time. No exact location was disclosed. As a blues singer, she is at her best singing live.2 The sound is good.3 There is an 8-page booklet, with an informative essay by Alfie Falckenbach.NEGATIVE POINT:1 I would like to know more details about the location and the supporting band.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California. She was nicknamed Miss Peaches. She has a long illustrious career.  Her singing style spanned a variety of music genres including blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz and gospel. She has frequent bouts of heroin addiction, but finally cured in the late 1970s. In 1996, her album Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday won Best Jazz Vocal Performance Grammy. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2008. She died of leukemia on January 20, 2012 (age 74). Her mighty, moving voice is sorely missed.After collecting all her 123 songs (as singles, except one song Bring It on Home to Me her duet with Tony Orlando), I am in the process of collecting all her domestic albums. Blues from the Big Apple is her 34rd album release, following All The Way in 2006. The entire album is totally enjoyable, and will be treasured.

"CONTENT:Delirium (Deluxe Edition) by Ellie Goulding, released by Polydor/Interscope Records on November 6, 2015, contains 2 discs: disc 1 (16 songs) and disc 2 (7 songs). I have compiled a song listing (including singles & chart position)(US=Billboard Hot 100; BB200=Billboard Album Chart; UK=UK Singles Chart; UK ALBUM=UK Album Chart; AUS=Australia Singles Chart):LP DELIRUIUM (Polydor/Interscope Records B00241060)(BB200 3/2015; UK ALBUM 3/2015):DISC 1:01 INTRO (DELIRIUM)02 AFTERTASTE03 SOMETHING IN THE WAY YOU MOVE (UK 51/2015; AUS 90/2015)04 KEEP ON DANCIN05 ON MY MIND (US 18/2015 & rising; UK 5/2015; AUS 3/2015)06 AROUND U07 CODES08 HOLDING ON FOR LIFE09 LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO (US 3/2015; UK 1(4)/2015; AUS 1/2015)*from film Fifty Shades of Grey10 DONT NEED NOBODY11 DONT PANIC12 WE CANT MOVE TO THIS13 ARMY (UK 81/2015; AUS 87/2015)14 LOST AND FOUND (UK 57/2015; AUS 70/2015)15 DEVOTION16 SCREAM IT OUTDISC 2:01 THE GREATEST02 I DO WHAT I LOVE03 PARADISE04 WINNER05 HEAL06 OUTSIDE (Calvin Harris, featuring Ellie Goulding)(US 29/2014; UK 6/2014; AUS 7/2014)*from album Motion by Calvin Harris.07 POWERFUL (Major Lazer, featuring Ellie Goulding & Tarrus Riley)(US 83/2015; UK 54/2015; AUS 7/2015)*from album Peace Is the MissionPOSITIVE POINTS:1 This is a great album of pop songs with a good dancing beat. A nice follow-up to Halcyon which topped the UK Album Chart in 2012. Ellies voice is very distinctive, and somehow, her singing will grow on you. In the standard album, it is nice that she includes Love Me Like You Do from film Fifty Shades of Grey. But you should really get the Deluxe Edition, with 7 additional songs, including Outside with Calvin Harris and Powerful with Major Lazer. In my research, I discovered that Powerful was not supposed to be included in the UK Deluxe Edition, only in the Target version. No complaint here.2 The sound is perfectly remastered, with Ellies sexy voice well centralized and in full display. The backing instruments are clearly defined. Great beat!3 There is a fantastic 20-page booklet, containing all the lyrics. Plus there are many beautiful pictures of Ellie Goulding.NEGATIVE POINT:1 It should be pointed out that in the Target deluxe version, in addition to Powerful, two other new songs were included: Let It Die and Two Years Ago. And why are those two new songs not included in the Deluxe Edition, when on disc 2 there is ample empty space? Slightly disappointed.FINAL THOUGHTS:I have followed Ellie Goulding from the beginning of her career, with her two previous releases: Lights/Bright Lights and Halcyon/Halcyon Days. (Note: could there be a Delirium/Complete Delirium coming next?) She is multi-talented, writing all her songs. Her songs are very catchy and her singing is simply very mesmerizing. She stated that she is going to make a pop album this time, and I feel she is very successful with the results. This album will grow on you with repeated listen. And please get the Deluxe Edition. Of course, this set is very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L1ST19PMIGC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015J9HP6S#wasThisHelpful","R2L1ST19PMIGC9","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This current set represents the best overall coverage of Bert Weedons singles career, way beyond 1962, from 1959 to 1967. There are many rare gems that are making their CD debut.2 The sound is well remastered.3 30 songs. Good value.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 The songs are not sequenced chronologically.2 There is no essay. The bare-bone 4-page booklet simply put down the song title, composers and years. There are no label & number and no chart positions.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Although Bert Weedon has only 8 charted singles in UK (never charted in US), I have just finished compiling a Complete Singles Discography, and found that he has actually 47 singles (charted and uncharted, a- and b-sides, from 1953 (under Max Jaffa) to 1979; but only 192 songs, not 194 songs because 2 were repeated releases). His singles labels are (1) Columbia (1953  1954), (2) Parlophone (1954  1958), (3) Beltona (1956), (4) Saga (1959, as Ragpickers), (5) Top Rank (1959  1961), (6) HMV (1961  1967), (7) Fontana (1970), (8) Grosvenor (1972), (9) Celebrity (1977), and (10) Polydor (1977  1979).FINAL THOUGHTS:Bert Weedon was born Herbert Maurice William 'Bert' Weedon on May 10, 1920. He was the first British guitarist to have a hit record in the UK Singles Chart in 1959, and his best-selling tutorial guides, Play in a Day, were a major influence on many leading British musicians, such as Eric Clapton, Brian May, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, John Lennon, Dave Davies, Keith Richards, and Pete Townshend. He was awarded OBE in 2001. He sadly passed away on April 20, 2012 after a long illness.If you are looking for concentrated coverage from 1956 to 1962, I would recommend Play in a Day (Jasmine Records, 2015, 1CD, 36 songs) with all the charted singles and good sound. But, if you are looking for a set that covers more extensively his entire career, in this case from 1959 to 1967, this current set, with many rare gems making their CD debut, is for you, and is highly recommended to all guitar fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JLTETX78XALL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009QRCT#wasThisHelpful","R3JLTETX78XALL","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As noted above, all the charted singles are included, plus many rare b-sides, making their CD debut.2 The songs are sequenced chronologically.3 The sound is very well remastered as per high standards at Jasmine Records.4 The most significant improvement for Jasmine Records is in the booklet. For the first time, a-side was clearly identified. Label & number are included, together with chart positions. Also, colourful pictures of picture sleeves are included together with labels. There are also 3 picture sleeves and 1 single label on the inner sleeve of the back cover of the case. As usual, we have an informative essay by Roger Dopson. Jasmine Records, if you can improve more by giving us a thicker booklet, like those by Ace Records. Keep up the good work.5 36 songs! Good value.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 As per usual practice with most reissue labels in UK, compilation would stop at 1962 because of local Public Domain laws. There are still 16 singles (32 songs) from 1963 to 1979.2 There are still many singles missing during the period 1953  1962, with some of the missing b-sides noted above.3 There are many errors in song title and label number as noted above.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Although Bert Weedon has only 8 charted singles in UK (never charted in US), I have just finished compiling a Complete Singles Discography, and found that he has actually 47 singles (charted and uncharted, a- and b-sides, from 1953 (under Max Jaffa) to 1979; but only 192 songs, not 194 songs because 2 were repeated releases).

If you are looking for a set that covers more extensively his entire career, I would recommend The Very Best of Bert Weedon (EMI Gold, 2002, 30 song, from 1959  1967). This current set concentrates in the years 1959  1962, with many rare b-sides. The sound is excellent. The entire set is very enjoyable, and is highly recommended to all guitar fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R330MES0WRGYQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FT670W#wasThisHelpful","R330MES0WRGYQW","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It really captured the emotion, excitement, drama and spontaneity of Etta James in action. The location was carefully chosen by Etta herself, with the correct atmosphere, receptive audiences, and good acoustics. This album is a pot of gold. The three bonus tracks, although readily available in 2015, were making CD debut in 1964, and I consider this icing on the cake.2 The sound is very well remastered, capturing all the details and spontaneity of the live performance.3 There is an 8-page booklet, with an informative essay by Don Snowden, and also the original LP liner notes by Ralph Bass. Here, we get more insight into the making of this live album. A beautiful coloured picture of Etta James in action was nicely done.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California. She was nicknamed Miss Peaches. She has a long illustrious career.  Her singing style spanned a variety of music genres including blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz and gospel. She has frequent bouts of heroin addiction, but finally cured in the late 1970s. In 1996, her album Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday won Best Jazz Vocal Performance Grammy. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2008. She died of leukemia on January 20, 2012 (age 74). Her mighty, moving voice is sorely missed.After collecting all her 123 songs (as singles, except one song Bring It on Home to Me her duet with Tony Orlando), I am in the process of collecting all her domestic albums. Etta James Rocks The House is her 8th album release. The entire album really rocks the house, and is totally enjoyable, and will be treasured.

Furthermore, besides getting a complete singles collection from 55-62, you also get 4 complete albums on Argo label, plus some extra rare album tracks.2 The songs are sequenced more or less chronologically.3 The sound is very well remastered.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 As per usual tradition at Real Gone Music (UK), no booklet is available, and compilation will stop at 1962 as per Public Domain law in UK.2 No label & number and no chart position were given.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Although Etta James has 30 charted singles on Billboard R&B chart, I have just finished compiling a Complete Singles Discography, and have found that she actually has 67 singles (charted and uncharted, a and b-sides, from 1954  1996)(only 123 songs, not 134 songs because there were 9 repeated releases and two b-sides belonged to other artists). Her singles labels are (1) Groove (1954), (2) Modern (1955  1957), (3) Kent (1958  1959), (4) Argo (1960  1965), (5) Cadet (1965  1970), (6) Chess (1970  1976), (7) Elektra (1978), (8) Warner Bros. (1978), (9) MCA (1980), (10) Island (1988), (11) Capitol (1989), and (12) Chess (1996). As noted above, her last charted single was an old recording of I Just Want To Make Love to You that charted in UK (UK 5/1996).FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California. She was nicknamed Miss Peaches. She has a long illustrious career.  Her singing style spanned a variety of music genres including blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz and gospel. She has frequent bouts of heroin addiction, but finally cured in the late 1970s. In 1996, her album Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday won Best Jazz Vocal Performance Grammy. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2008. She died of leukemia on January 20, 2012 (age 74). Her mighty, moving voice is sorely missed.If you are looking for a box set covering her entire career, I would recommend The Very Best Of Etta James: The Chess Singles (Spectrum, 3CDs, 53 songs, 2005, covering 1960  1975). The best overall box set that covers her entire career, extending into 80s & 90s, is Heart and Soul: A Retrospective (4 CDs, 84 songs, 2011, Universal Music), but rather expensive. This current set, with complete and comprehensive coverage of her songs from 1955 to 1962, good sound and cheap price, is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ASO304M39Y40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CM1S1SS#wasThisHelpful","R1ASO304M39Y40","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:Pat Boone: Duets, released by Pats own label Gold Label in 2015, contains 13 live recordings, duets taken from Pats own TV shows. I have compiled a song listing:01 I WISH I WERE IN LOVE AGAIN  Pat Boone & Ella Fitzgerald02 IT DONT MEAN A THING (IF IT AINT GOT THAT SWING)  Pat Boone & Ella Fitzgerald03 IVE HEAR THAT SONG BEFORE  Pat Boone & Count Basie04 NATURE BOY/POISON IVY  Pat Boone & Nat King Cole05 TOM DOOLEY  Pat Boone & Kingston Trio06 YOURE THE CREAM IN MY COFFEE/THE COFFEE SONG  Pat Boone & Anna Maria Alberghetti07 MY HAPPINESS  Pat Boone & Connie Francis08 FOLK MEDLEY  Pat Boone & Jo Stafford09 STRANGER IN PARADISE  Pat Boone & George Shearing10 ROCK-A-BYE  Pat & Shirley Boone, with the Boone Girls11 TENDERLY  Pat Boone & Andy Williams12 COWBOY MEDLEY  Pat Boone & Roy Rogers13 MAY THE GOOD LORD BLESS AND KEEP YOU  Pat & Shirley BoonePOSITIVE POINTS:1 These are one-of-a-kind recordings, performed live in Pats ABC television show The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom with famous stars, such as Ella Fitzgerald, Jo Stafford, Andy Williams, Nat King Cole, Count Basie & His Orchestra and George Shearing, just to name a few.2 The sound is good.3 There is a 4-page booklet with an informative essay by Pat Boone himself, telling us his own feelings and experience singing with the various stars. In the booklet, the fonts for the words Pat Boone are exactly the same as those for Billboard magazine logo with the same colours. On the disc itself, since Pat Boone was on Dot Records for almost his entire career, he chose the Dot Records logo, replacing the word Dot with the word Pat. Both very clever.NEGATIVE POINT:1 13 songs only!? Pat, you could have done better with more duet songs from your TV show.FINAL THOUGHTS:In the years immediately prior to the British Invasion, only one performer rivaled the chart dominance of Elvis Presley, and that was Pat Boone. With his trademark white buck shoes, perfectly combed hair and gleaming smile, Boone was the very essence of wholesome American values, and at a time when the rise of Rock N Roll was viewed as a sign of the Apocalypse, he made the music appear safe and non-threatening, earning some 38 Top 40 hits in the process. In 1957 Pat Boone began hosting his own ABC television series, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom. The half-hour variety show aired from October 3, 1957 to June 23, 1960 and featured the young star (at the time the youngest person to host their own network variety programme) and a host of top-name guest stars. In all, there were 115 episodes. In this special collection of never-before-released LIVE recordings, Pat has hand-picked 13 memorable performances that pay tribute to some of the best music and entertainers of that time.Pat, if you still have the video for those shows, could you please release them on a DVD box set? Or, instead of just 13 songs, please give us some more. Pat, aint that a shame that you only gave us 13 songs? Being a Pat Boone fan, in addition to the recent CD release R&B Duet Hits, this current set is also being treasured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TVQH023FHW3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJDPU88#wasThisHelpful","R2TVQH023FHW3B","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:Life, Love & the Blues by Etta James, her 25th domestic album release by Private Music in 1998, contains 12 songs. I have compiled a song listing which is as follows:LP LIFE, LOVE & THE BLUES (Etta James)(Private Music 82162)(1998):01 Born Under A Bad Sign02 I Want To Ta Ta You, Baby03 Here I Am (Come And Take Me)04 Running Out of Lies05 Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)06 Spoonful*remake of her earlier duet with Henry Fuqua in 1960.07 Life, Love & The Blues08 Hoochie Coochie Gal09 Cheating In The Next Room10 If You Want Me To Stay11 The Love You Save May Be Your Own12 Ill Take Care Of YoPOSITIVE POINTS:1 In the essay, it is stated Etta James has, at last, (pun semi-intended), given us the album we always knew was within her. A blues album. With her own guys: The Roots Band too. Thank you, Etta. This album was originally conceived as a tribute album to icons like Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf and Willie Dixon.2 The sound is very well remastered. Of course, the spine-tingling voice of Etta James is the centerpiece. The backing band was also up to the task, with her sons Donto James on drums and percussion, and Sametto James on bass.3 There is an 8-page booklet with an informative essay by Bob Merlis.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

Thank you, Martin. And thank you, Etta.2 The sound is very well remastered. Of course, the spine-tingling voice of Etta James is the centerpiece. The backing band was also up to the task, with her sons Donto James on drums and percussion, and Sametto James on bass.3 There is an 8-page booklet with an informative essay by Lithofayne Pridgeon.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

"CONTENT:All The Way, Ettas 33rd domestic album, released by RCA Victor in 2016, contains 11 songs. I have compiled a song listing (with personal comments)(BB Pop=Billboard Hot 100):LP ALL THE WAY (Etta James)(RCA Victor 76841)(2006):01 ALL THE WAY*big hit by Frank Sinatra (BB Pop 2/1958); Ettas bluesy voice mixed with outstanding lonesome wailing horn02 STOP ON BY*the pulsating and pumping rhythm mixed with tenderness.03 STRUNG OUT*Ettas gruff and gripping voice backed by great keyboard.04 SOMEWHERE*big hit from West Side Story; Ettas voice is like a fine, mellow wine that you want to experience again and again.05 HOLDING BACK THE YEARS*big hit for Simply Red (BB Pop 1(1)/1986)06 IMAGINE*big hit for John Lennon (BB Pop 3(2)/1971); Ettas haunting voice is both magical and provoking.07 I BELIEVE I CAN FLY*big hit for R. Kelly (BB Pop 2(4)/1996); Ettas attention-getting, commanding voice mixed with great orchestration makes this song highly inspirational.08 ITS A MANS MANS MANS WORLD*big hit by James Brown (BB Pop 8/1966); Ettas soulful vocal mixed with the flamboyant strings and flamenco-style guitar intro!09 PURPLE RAIN*big hit for Prince (BB Pop 2(2)/1984); the underlying, funky, answer-style guitar and keyboard church-chord accompaniment will send chils down your spine.10 WHATS GOING ON*big hit for Marvin Gaye (BB Pop 2(3)/1971) and Etta puts on hurting on it.11 CALLING YOU*this melancholy, mood-altering side begs for low lights and a stiff shot of something heavy; for me, I just switched off all the lights in my audio room.POSITIVE POINTS:1 This CD marks another milestone in the senior, savvy, sassy Ettas career, including a super-reduction in weight, translating into Ettas metamorphosis to show biz success. She is constantly renewing herself, and whose recordings encompassed nearly every music genre, here again, lends her melodious vocal branding to these previous chartbusters. What a refreshing change!2 The sound is very well remastered. This album was jointly produced by Ettas sons: Sametto and Donto James, with Donto James on drums and percussion and Sametto James on acoustic and electric bass.3 There is a 12-page booklet with an informative essay by Lithofayne Pridgeon. There are a few beautiful colour pictures of new-look Etta James.NEGATIVE POINT:None.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California.

"VIDEO (2D):Terminator Genisys 2D arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC 1080p 2.39:1 encode. The transfer comes with fantastic resolution and details. The imagery is razor sharp and crisp. Contrast is excellent with deep blacks. The colour palette is natural. This is a reference quality video. (5/5)VIDEO (3D)Terminator Genisys 3D arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 MVC 1080p 2.39:1 encode. The 2D to 3D conversion is state of the art, done by Stereo D, Prime Focus and Gentle Giant Studios. In addition to all the positive accolades above, the dimensionality is impressive, as in perceptual depth. Foreground and background exhibit incredible realism. The spatial dimensionality of the 3D version is preferred. (5+/5)AUDIO:The Dolby Atmos/Dolby True-HD (in my case only the latter) 7.1 channel soundtracks are extensively dynamic and immersive. The bass is powerful. The orchestral music score is spread wide and deep and aggressively extends to the surrounds. This is an exceptionally well executed sound design that delivers an impressive immersive, exciting and thrilling experience. (5+/5)MOVIE:Terminator Genisys is the fifth instalment of the Terminator franchise. It comes in with great respect for the original two, somewhat ignoring the latter two (Rise of the Machines and Salvation), and carries the fun and entertaining feel of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Great credit must go to the Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor, unlike his lack of control in Thor: the Dark World by Marvel, now delivers cinematic fun, with creativity, playfulness, and grace. It is the best that the franchise has been since T2. (5/5)PACKAGING:Terminator Genisys (3D) comes with 3 discs, each having its own flipcase: 3D blu-ray, 2D blu-ray (feature film + special features) and DVD.FINAL THOUGHTS:Throughout Terminator Genisys, Arnold's aged T-800 model is starting to fail mechanically. When his capabilities are called into question, he replies that he's ""old  not obsolete."" This same response can be used to describe the Terminator franchise after five installments: it's old, but at this point, it's far from being obsolete. Without question, this is the best that the franchise has been since T2.

I have compiled a detailed song listing (with album & singles label & number, chart position, debut date, plus personal comments)(BB R&B=Billboard Rhythm & Blues Chart):LP MISS ETTA JAMES (Crown CLP-5209)(1961):01 Dance With Me, Henry02 Do Something Crazy03 W-O-M-A-N (Modern 45X972)(uncharted a-side, November 1955)04 Number One (My One And Only)(Modern 45X984)(uncharted a-side, March 1956)05 I Hope Youre Satisfied (Betty & Dupree)(Kent 45X318)(uncharted a-side, 1959)06 Good Rockin Daddy (Modern 45X962)(a-side)(BB R&B 6/1955)(August 1955)07 Hey!

In my research, from the original album cover of Twist with Etta James there is a slightly different song listing:01 Twist With Me, Henry02 Good Rockin Daddy03 Im A Fool04 One Thing*new05 Thats All06 Doin Fine, Henry*new07 Be My Love08 Hickory Dickory Dock09 Feel So Good*new10 Strange ThingsPOSITIVE POINTS:1 Most of the early Etta James albums are on either Argo or Cadet label. These two albums on Crown label are the rare gems. The icing on the cake is the generous 10 bonus singles tracks.2 The sound is very well remastered, using 24-bit.3 There is a fantastic 16-page booklet, with an informative essay by Santi Comelles. Labels and numbers are included. There are also numerous beautiful coloured pictures of labels, front and back album covers, picture sleeves and posters. A first-class job!NEGATIVE POINTS:1 As noted above, there is some mix-up about the correct song titles, plus the some album tracks on Twist with Etta James in this CD are incorrect with some tracks still missing.2 No chart positions were provided.FINAL THOUGHTS:Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938 in Los Angeles, California. She was nicknamed Miss Peaches. She has a long illustrious career.  Her singing style spanned a variety of music genres including blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz and gospel. She has frequent bouts of heroin addiction, but finally cured in the late 1970s. In 1996, her album Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday won Best Jazz Vocal Performance Grammy. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2008. She died of leukemia on January 20, 2012 (age 74). Her mighty, moving voice is sorely missed.After collecting all her 123 songs (as singles, except one song Bring It on Home to Me her duet with Tony Orlando), I am in the process of collecting all her domestic albums. Miss Etta James and Twist with Etta James are her second and fourth domestic albums on CD for the first time. The entire set is totally enjoyable with great sound, and will be treasured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CC1SFE52CW20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYVRY5O#wasThisHelpful","R3CC1SFE52CW20","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

His biggest hit singles are included. There are many rare gems, making their CD debut, as noted above.2 The sound is very well remastered.3 The set comes in a sturdy cardboard gatefold cases like before. There is a short essay by Paul Humphries. Label & number are included.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 Time: disc 1: 49 minutes; disc 2: 46 minutes; disc 3: 47 minutes. Surely, Not Now Music could have made this compilation much more special by filling up the remaining empty spaces (98 minutes) with more songs. Even if Not Now Music chose to end in 1962, there are still 23 more songs missing from 1952 to 1962.2 The songs are not sequenced chronologically. It seems that the producer just hapharzardly and randomly created the song listing. In the song listing, I identified the names of the a or b-sides with their location in this set.3 While I appreciate the efforts of putting pictures of labels, they are put on the inner sleeves behind the transparent CD cases.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Although Lloyd Price has 24 charted singles on Billboard Hot 100, I have just compiled a Complete Singles Discography and found that he actually has 71 singles from 1952  1985 (charted and uncharted, a and b-sides, only 139 songs not 142 songs because 3 were repeated releases). His labels are (1) Specialty (1952  1957), (2) KRC (1957  1958), (3) Artone (1959), (4) ABC-Paramount (1957  1963), (5) Double-L (1963  1966), (6) Monument (1965), (7) Hurd (1966), (8) Reprise (1966), (9) Ludix Production (1967), (10) JAD (1968), (11) Turntable (1969  1970), (12) Scepter (1971), (13) Paramount (1972), (14) GSF (1973), (15) L.P.G. (1976) and (16) Specialty (1985).FINAL THOUGHTS:Lloyd Price was born on March 9, 1933 in Kenner, Louisiana, but grew up in New Orleans. He has a long illustrious singing career with many memorable hit singles. He was known as Mr. Personality and was inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. He currently manages Icon Food Brands, which makes a line of primarily Southern-style foods, including Lawdy Miss Clawdy food products and a line of Lloyd Price foods, such as Lloyd Price's Soulful 'n' Smooth Grits and Lloyd Price's Energy-2-Eat Bar (with the brand slogan ""Good taste  Great Personality""), plus Lawdy Miss Clawdy clothing and collectibles.If you are looking for his Greatest Hits, this current set has the most complete coverage of his most popular singles with good sound. To fill in the gaps missing from this set, you can get those missing songs in Restless Heart (Jasmine, 2CDs, 57 songs). If you are looking for his early albums, I would recommend Classic 7 Albums Plus (Real Gone Music, 4CDs, 2014). His output from 1963 to 1985 on CDs is sorely missing. This current set is recommended to all Lloyd Price fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYW1NJNDSJDSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161KHX3Y#wasThisHelpful","RYW1NJNDSJDSE","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VIDEO (2D):Through Pixar/Disney, Inside Out (2D) arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC 1080p 1.78:1 encode. The transfer is simply pristine, with razor-sharp details and bold, vibrant colours that pop: Joys sparkling gold, Sadness' depressed blue, Anger's fiery red, Fears gorgeous purple, and Disgust's vomit green. A fine mist encircles every emotion that is almost akin to the Pixie Dust found in the Tinker Bell films. Every strand of computer-generated hair on the heads of Sadness and Joy looks and acts realistic. When Joy reluctantly visits the Memory Dump, black levels are deep and inky. This is simply a state-of-the-art animated feature. Oscar, anyone? (5/5)VIDEO (3D)Inside Out (3D) arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 MVC 1080p 1.85:1 encode. Besides all the positive attributes above, the presentation adds a tremendous level of depth to practically every scene. Both colours and details remain the same. Brightness does not suffer. This is an enjoyable 3D presentation. (5/5).AUDIO:Inside Out comes with DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio soundtrack is precisely defined throughout, whether light and airy piano notes or more aggressively styled music. Surround sound fills the room with full immersion. Bass is deep. Dialogue is clear and prioritized. This is an excellent soundtrack. (5/5)MOVIE:It's true that the basis of Inside Out isn't necessarily original. An early '90s sitcom from Fox entitled Herman's Head first introduced the idea of personified emotions controlling the main character. However, Inside Out most definitely expounds and improves upon the formula. The core emotions are done by: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Fear (Bill Hader). It is beautiful, poignant, and richly animated, and a return to form for Pixar. Great movie. (5/5)TRIVIA:1 Inside Out has an estimated budget of $175 million, but has a worldwide gross of $850 million, second only to Minions with $1,156 million for animated feature.2 According to director Pete Docter, each emotion is based on a shape: Joy is based on a star, Sadness is a teardrop, Anger is a fire brick, Fear is a raw nerve, and Disgust is broccoli.3 The writers considered up to 27 different emotions, but settled on five to make it less complicated. Some of the major emotions that ended up being cut included Surprise, Pride, and Trust.PACKAGING:Inside Out 3D comes with 4 discs, each having its own flipcase: blu-ray 3D, blu-ray 2D, blu-ray bonus (very nice gesture) and DVD feature film. There is no booklet.FINAL THOUGHTS:Inside Out brazenly explores an alien world with startlingly astute observations. The interactions between the emotions are synchronously hilarious and poignant. It is pure joy to watch this movie. Both the video (3D and 2D) and audio are top-notched. I personally feel that this picture will be a strong contender for Oscar in Best Animated Feature in 2016. A great picture for both parents and children, and is very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z5RNCNMN0JZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCX7XMY#wasThisHelpful","R2Z5RNCNMN0JZ9","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VIDEO:My Fair Lady (50th Anniversary Edition) arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC at 26.19 Mbps 1080p 2.20:1 encode. Brand new 4k restoration from an 8K scan of the original negative, and other surviving 65mm elements, was painstakingly restored by acclaimed film historian and preservationist Robert A. Harris, whose recent work on Spartacus was nothing short of a treasure. This magnificently restored transfer is a revelation. The 2.20:1-framed image (as opposed to the 2011 release's 2.39:1 framing) reveals the movie like never before, yielding a picture so pristine that watching is practically like seeing the movie for the first time. It retains the original grain structure. There are tremendous details, showing off every stitch in Cecil Beaton's Oscar-winning costumes. Colours pop with deep blacks. Many thanks to Mr. Harris to bring My Fair Lady to its former glory, well deserved for such an iconic film. (5/5).AUDIO:My Fair Lady (50th Anniversary Edition) also features a new soundtrack: the 96k Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack sourced from the original full resolution presentation, heard for the first time here since the film's 1964 premiere. The track pops from the first note forward, exploding into the stage with beautiful, full-range clarity that is not only a precision representation of the orchestral score but capable of singling out the finest points to each section and instrument. Lyrics are just as impressive, with strong vocal clarity throughout the range. With all the popular songs in this film, the restored soundtrack is pure music to die for. Glorious! (5/5).TRIVIA:My Fair Lady won 8 Oscars, including:(1)  Best Picture: Jack L Warner(2)  Best Director: George Cukor(3)  Best Leading Actor: Rex Harrison(4)  Best Cinematography (Color): Harry Stradling, Jr.(5)  Best Art Direction  Set Decoration, Color: Gene Allen, Cecil Beaton & George James Hopkins(6)  Best Costume Design, Color: Cecil Beaton(7)  Best Sound: George Groves (Warner Bros SSD)(8)  Best Music Score: Andre PrevinIn 1965, the Best Actress Oscar went to Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins). Audrey Hepburn, for some unknown reasons, was not even nominated. Her singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon, who was then married to Exodus composer, Ernest Gold. Their son is Andrew Gold, singer in 1970s.PACKAGING:This 50th Anniversary Edition comes with an elegant polish-steel-like gatefold cases. There are 3 discs: blu-ray featured film, blu-ray special features and DVD for featured film. It is simply beautiful just to hold. Unfortunately, there is no booklet.FINAL THOUGHTS:My Fair Lady was first released on blu-ray in 2011 without much fanfare. At that time, I thought that this was a disrespectful treatment of such an important film. I am so glad that Mr. Harris has done such a magnificent restoration, bringing back the glory that this movie deserves. This is the definitive edition of My Fair Lady and I am glad to double-dip. This restored edition is very highly recommended and will be treasured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCQ28PS9Y4U66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NN78PKY#wasThisHelpful","RCQ28PS9Y4U66","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He and his childhood buddy Curtis Mayfield first joined the Roosters, and the name was later changed to the Impressions. He went solo in 1958. He was dubbed ""The Ice Man. In 1991, he was inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Impressions. I feel that he certainly deserved a second separate induction as a solo artist.Iif you are looking for Jerrys singles output, I would highly recommend Singles (Charly UK, 2011, 2CDs, 56 songs, 1959  1966) and The Soul of Jerry Butler (Not Now Music, 2CDs, 38 songs). Beyond 1966, you can get his songs through twofers, but they are usually very expensive. The soul music of Jerry Butler is both an explosion of raw, passionate energy, an artist reflection of its time, plus exploring, learning, revealing and relating. His soulful voice is oh so moving. The entire set, although released so long ago and with only 16 songs, is still totally enjoyable and is recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR00CCQ2HC38I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DRJJ#wasThisHelpful","RR00CCQ2HC38I","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Many singles and album tracks are included. This current set is much better than a similar set No End of Time: The Early Years (Jasmine, 2011, 29 songs).2 The sound is very well remastered.3 Instead of the usual gatefold hard cardboard cases in the past, Not Now Music has now switched to the usual plastic CD cases, which is not a bad thing. There is a short informative essay by Brian Parks.4 The price is cheap.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 Time: disc 1: 51 minutes; disc 2: 46 minutes. This is the trend of Not Now Music with their The Soul of series of not filling up the discs. Surely, there are so many missing tracks that can fill up the remaining empty spaces (63 minutes):From LP Jerry Butler, Esq:(01) Come Back My Love (Abner 59-1017)(a-side)(BB R&B 29/1958; CB Pop 94/1958)(October 1958)(02) If You Let Me(03) The Challenge(04) Chi Town (Vee-Jay VJ-426)(b-side, February 1962)(05) Rainbow Valley (Abner 59-1028)(uncharted a-side, June 1959)(06) No End of TimeSingle:(07) Isle of Sirens (Vee-Jay VJ-426)(a-side)(CB Pop 130/1962; RW Pop 89/1962)(February 1962)And I am only speaking of songs up to 1962.2 As per usual practice with UK reissue labels, the compilation would stop at 1962, because of local Public Domain laws. This is really unfortunate because Jerry Butler has a long charting career.3 No label & number and no chart position were provided.4 The songs are NOT sequenced chronologically. It seems like the producer just haphazardly arranged the song listing.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Jerry Butler has a lengthy charting career. On Billboard R&B Chart, he has 59 singles. I have just finished a Complete Singles Discography, and found that he actually has 85 singles (charted and charted, a and b-sides, from 1958  1993; but only 158 songs, not 170 songs because 12 were repeated releases). His labels are (1) Falcon (1958), (2) Vee-Jay (1958), (3) Abner (1958  1960), (4) Vee-Jay (1960  1966), (5) Mercury (1966  1974), (6) Motown (1976  1977), (7) Philadelphia International (1978  1980), (8) Fountain (1982), (9) CTI (1983), and (10) Ichiban (1992  1993).FINAL THOUGHTS:Jerry Butler was born on December 8, 1939 in Sunflower, Mississippi and raised in Chicago. He and his childhood buddy Curtis Mayfield first joined the Roosters, and the name was later changed to the Impressions. He went solo in 1958. He was dubbed ""The Ice Man. In 1991, he was inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Impressions. I feel that he certainly deserved a second separate induction as a solo artist.Beside the current set, if you are looking for Jerrys singles output, I would highly recommend Singles (Charly UK, 2011, 2CDs, 56 songs, 1959  1966). After that, you can get his songs through twofers, but they are usually very expensive. The soul music of Jerry Butler is both an explosion of raw, passionate energy, an artist reflection of its time, plus exploring, learning, revealing and relating. His soulful voice is oh so moving. The entire set is totally enjoyable, with great sound, and is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7F7UKQ0VJBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161IFDRO#wasThisHelpful","RO7F7UKQ0VJBN","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"VIDEO (2D):San Andreas (2D) blasts onto blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC 1080p 2.40:1 encode. This transfer is a stunner. Definition is beyond excellent. Details are consistently razor-sharp and natural in appearance. Unlike the 3D version, the colour here is beautifully saturated and natural. Blacks are inky. The many sweeping destruction scenes are simply spectacular on my 12 foot wide screen with anamorphic lens. The pictures are simply awesome. (5/5)VIDEO (3D):San Andreas (3D) rocks onto blu-ray with MPEG-4 MVC 1080p 2.40:1 encode. This film was not originally filmed in 3D, which was a post-conversion job. But the 3D effects are fairly impressive. General depth is always evident, whether considering wide-open spaces, like vast city or land overheads, or more intimate, confined spaces like the helicopter interior. The main criticism of this 3D version is that the colours are washed out, with the dimming of brightness. Watching 3D makes for a fun ride, but the 2D has more solid colour and definition. (4.5/5)AUDIO:San Andreas rattles onto blu-ray with Dolby Atmos/Dolby True-HD 5.1 soundtrack. The following description refers to Dolby True-HD since I do not have Atmos. This completely immersive and powerfully robust soundtrack is a true star of the film. Dialogue is clear no matter the on-screen chaos. It is in the various scenes of absolute earthquake destruction where the track really shines. It's heavy and rumbly, with deep bass that simply rocks the whole room. The musical score by Andrew Lockington is also outstanding. This soundtrack is considered one of the top soundtracks, like Fury and Mad Max: Fury Road. This is a totally immersive experience. Turn up the volume and get ready to rumble. (5+/5)MOVIE:The plot and storyline are simply unbelievable. To enjoy this movie to the fullest, you must leave your intellect behind, and simply enjoy all the fantastic, spectacular eye-candy CGI effects. Dwayne Johnson makes a good leading man, and is as solid as The Rock. I am sure you do smell what he is cooking. One minor surprise is the addition of my favourite singer Kylie Minogue as Susan Riddick, but unfortunately only for about 5 minutes. Still, now I simply cant get her out of my head. (4/5)TRIVIA:1 San Andreas has an estimated budget of $110 million, but it has a worldwide gross of $470 million, mainly from overseas.2 Riddick's headquarters building in San Francisco, where Blake, Ben and Ollie meet, is the Bank of America Building at 555 California Street. It was the same building, albeit with special effects, used in the disaster classic The Towering Inferno (1974).3 The first scene wherein the girl was playing ""Style"" by Taylor Swift actually foreshadows the events later on. The song includes the lyric ""And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"", which was what they did in the end.4 Did you notice that when Ray (Dwayne Johnson) steals the truck, he has to hot-wire it to start, but when he gets to the crack, he turns off the engine using the key.PACKAGING:This 3D set comes with separate 3D BD50 disc, 2D BD50 disc and DVD disc. Instead of using flipcase to house each disc separately, the DVD was stacked on top of the 2D blu-ray disc. Warner, dont be so cheap. However, it does have a fancy 3D lenticular cover.FINAL THOUGHTS:I personally like disaster movies. I still remember the experience of Sensurround system when I was watching Earthquake in local theatre in 1974.  San Andreas is big, loud, and stupid  but it never tries to be anything different. It's the perfect definition of a 'popcorn' flick, and often ignores logic and realism just to be entertainingwhich isn't necessarily a bad thing. I personally enjoyed the 2D version better because the colour was more solid with better definition, with outstanding CGI effects. It is an enjoyable movie, and is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V96Z4AUZJESD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHRMLAY#wasThisHelpful","R2V96Z4AUZJESD","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VIDEO:Aladdin finally arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC 1080p 1.85:1 encode. The transfer was stunning with vivid and vibrant colours that pop. Black levels are deep and inky. There is tremendous crisp details, from the crisp line art to every last tiny texture or touch in the background, the patterns on the flying carpet, the riches of the Cave of Wonders, or the splendor of the palace. There are minor hints of banding, but not distracting. (4.5/5)VIDEO:Aladdin arrives in North America with DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio, which was an improvement to the Holland import with only 5.1 mix in 2013. The added channels create an engulfing feeling, especially during the musical numbers. Genie's ""Friend Like Me"" booms from every channel as the camera pans and rolls around the scene. Dialogue is clean, intelligible and smartly prioritized. Dynamics are excellent. This is an exciting and immersive soundtrack. (5/5)MOVIE:Referring to Disney's North American blu-ray release of Aladdin as ""highly anticipated"" or ""long awaited"" would be a gross understatement. It was fun in watching Robin Williams bringing the Genie to life with the kind of madcap flare that only he can provide. Also, the choice of voices is outstanding: Scott Weinger (Aladdin), Linda Larkin (Jasmine) and Jonathan Freeman (Jafar). There are also many memorable songs, like A Whole New World (which won Oscar for Best Original Song by Alan Menken (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics) plus Oscar for Best Original Score for Alan Menken. There are two versions of A Whole New World: within the movie sung by Lea Salonga and Brad Kane, plus the pop version during the end credits by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson (Billboard Hot 100 #1(1)/1992). Great movie. (5/5)FINAL THOUGHTS:Aladdin is simply magical on high definition. It will make your heart race and your spirit soar. Both the video and especially the audio are outstanding with many great songs and lovely music. There are also new extras about Robin Williams as the Genie, a true tribute to the enchanting talent of Robin Williams, the Genius behind the Genie. This set is highly recommended to all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3854SAQUQFBNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR534TK#wasThisHelpful","R3854SAQUQFBNK","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are many rare gems making their CD debut.2 The sound is wonderfully remastered, as per usual high standards at Jasmine Records.3 The songs are sequence, more or less, chronologically.4 There is a 8-page booklet, with an informative essay by Geoff Milne. Names of orchestra are included.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 No label & number are included. While I appreciate the inclusion of session code number, that really does not help me to find the label & number. No chart position was included.2 Disc 1: time 73 minutes; disc 2: time 68 minutes. Surely, Jasmine Records could have filled up the empty spaces (19 minutes) with more songs. For example, there are 9 songs that Kitty sang when she was with Jack Teagarden in 1939 that could have been included.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Kitty Kallen has 15 charted singles from 1949 to 1963. I have just painstakingly compiled a detailed Complete Singles Discography, including all her singles as band singer, plus her solo efforts, I found that she actually has 98 singles from 1939 to 1967 (178 songs not 196 songs because 18 b-sides belonged to other artists). Her labels are (1) Columbia (1939), (2) Varsity (1940), (3) Capitol (1942), (4) Decca (1943  1944), (5) V-Disc (1944 - 1945), (6) Columbia (1944  1945), (7) Musicraft (1946), (8) Mercury (1949  1951), (9) Columbia (1952), (10) Decca (1953  1957), (11) Columbia (1958  1961), (12) RCA Victor (1962  1963), (13) 20th Century-Fox (1964), (14) United Artists (1965), (15) Philips (1966), and (16) Bell (1967).FINAL THOUGHTS:Kitty Kallen was born Katherine Kalinsky on May 25, 1922 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She started as band singer for Jack Teagarden (1939-41), Bob Sherwood (1942), Jimmy Dorsey (1943  1944) and Harry James (1944  1945), Sonny Burke (1946), and Artie Shaw (1946). There are many memorable hits both as band singer and her solo career. She has an illustrious singing career, but has to cut short due to scarring of the lungs from apparent embolus to her lungs from estrogen replacement therapy.If you like her solo singles, I would recommend Our Lady Kitty Kallen (Sepia, 1CD, 2003, 25 songs, covering 1946  1952) plus Warm and Sincere (Sepia, 1CD, 2008, 27 songs, covering 1949  1957) and Little Things Mean A Lot (RPM, 2008, 28 songs). The best overall coverage is Kitty Kallen Collection 39-62 (Acrobat Music, 2CDs, 2015, 51 songs, already released in UK, which I have, but my review cannot be published until the US release date on December 11, 2015). Of course, the twofer If I Give My Heart To You/Honky Tonk Angel on Collectables is also recommended covering 1958  1961. Her output from 1963  1967 is sorely inadequate. I hope someday Bear Family will come out with a Complete Kitty Kallen box set.If you are interested in her band singer era, this current set with good coverage and many rare gems making CD debut, plus good sound, is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DU8SANYDBSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B6TRHU#wasThisHelpful","R5DU8SANYDBSB","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I feel that this current set is the BEST Greatest Hits to date. The closest competitor is Capitol Collectors Series CD, with more songs but more inferior sound.2 The sound is very well remastered, much better than the Capitol Collectors Series CD.3 The songs are sequenced chronologically.4 There is a 10-page booklet, containing an informative essay by Will Friedwald. Label & number, name of orchestra, and chart positions are all included.NEGATIVE POINT:1 Time: 55 minutes. This practice may have been acceptable by 1999 standards. But by todays (2015) standards, surely, Razie & Tie could have filled up the remaining 25 minutes with more songs. The most glaring omissions include Mary in the Morning (BB 27/1967), plus earlier hits like Take My Heart (US 12/1952), Now (US 25/1952), Rachel (US 30/1953), When Youre Mine (US 27/1953), Wanted (UK 4/1954), Here In My Heart 1959 version with different orchestra (BB 86/1961) and Daddys Little Girl (BB 42/1967).COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Although Al Martino has 44 singles on the US chart, I have just painstakingly compiled a Complete Singles Discography, and found that he actually has 97 singles from 1952 - 1993 (a and b-sides, charted and uncharted, US, UK, Australian & Belgium, but only 181 songs, not 194 songs, because 13 songs were repeated releases). His labels are (1) Capitol (1952  1957), (2) Cub (1958), (3) 20th Fox (1959  1961), (4) Capitol (1961  1981) and Hansa (1993). His last single was Spanish Ballerina in 1993.FINAL THOUGHTS:Al Martino was born Alfred Cini on October 7, 1927 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvannia. He had his greatest success as a singer between the early 1950s and mid-1970s, being described as ""one of the great Italian American pop crooners"", and also became well known as an actor, particularly for his role as singer Johnny Fontane in The Godfather. As noted above, he has a long illustrious singles charting career with many memorable singles, like I Love You Because, Here in My Heart, Painted Tainted Rose, I Love You More And More Every Day, Mary in the Morning and Speak Softly Love. He also has numerous memorable albums, unfortunately, still not released on CDs. Al has such a smooth, charming voice, that simply soothes the heart. He died on October 13, 2009 (age 82).There is really no decent singles collection on Al Martino. If you like his pre-1962 materials, I would also recommend Take My Heart (Jasmine, 2CDs, 58 songs) and The Smooth Voice of Al Martino (Not Now Music, 2CDs, 50 songs, 2015). Although his singles after 1962 are sparsely available, I am glad to report that most of them are available online.

As noted above, there are many rare gems making their CD debut. This set represents the most comprehensive coverage of Al Martinos output prior to 1962 to date.2 The sound is very well remastered, as per usual high standards at Jasmine Records.3 There is a 6-page booklet, with an informative essay by Ossie Dales.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 No labels & numbers, chart position, names of source albums, names of orchestra, are included.2 The songs are not arranged chronologically, sometimes with a-side on disc 1 and b-side on disc 2.3 As per usual tradition with UK reissue label, the compilation would stop at 1962 because of local Public Domain laws. Therefore, if you are looking for his biggest hits, like I Love You Because, etc., please look elsewhere.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Although Al Martino has 44 singles on the US chart, I have just painstakingly compiled a Complete Singles Discography, and found that he actually has 97 singles from 1952 - 1993 (a and b-sides, charted and uncharted, US, UK, Australian & Belgium, but only 181 songs, not 194 songs, because 13 songs were repeated releases). His labels are (1) Capitol (1952  1957), (2) Cub (1958), (3) 20th Fox (1959  1961), (4) Capitol (1961  1981) and Hansa (1993). His last single was Spanish Ballerina in 1993.FINAL THOUGHTS:Al Martino was born Alfred Cini on October 7, 1927 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvannia. He had his greatest success as a singer between the early 1950s and mid-1970s, being described as ""one of the great Italian American pop crooners"", and also became well known as an actor, particularly for his role as singer Johnny Fontane in The Godfather. As noted above, he has a long illustrious singles charting career with many memorable singles, like I Love You Because, Here in My Heart, Painted Tainted Rose, I Love You More And More Every Day, Mary in the Morning and Speak Softly Love. He also has numerous memorable albums, unfortunately, still not released on CDs. Al has such a smooth, charming voice, that simply soothes the heart. He died on October 13, 2009 (age 82).There is really no decent singles collection on Al Martino. The best Greatest Hits CD that I would recommend is The Al Martino Collection (Razer & Tie, 1999, 20 songs, covering his entire career). If you like his pre-1962 materials, besides the current set, I would also recommend The Smooth Voice of Al Martino (Not Now Music, 2CDs, 50 songs, 2015). Although his singles after 1962 are sparsely available, I am glad to report that most of them are available online. Out of 181 songs, I am only missing 18 songs. Remember again that this set does not have his more modern big hits as stated above. But, this set, with good sound and many singles and rare gems, is still highly recommended to all Al Martino fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6Q2PYT9CWFCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGC1H5S#wasThisHelpful","R6Q2PYT9CWFCV","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are many rare gems, making their CD debut. The three rare albums are The Exciting Voice of Al Martino, Al Martino and Swing Along with Al Martino.""2 The sound is very well remastered.3 The price is very cheap.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 The songs are not arranged chronologically, sometimes with a-side on disc 1 and b-side on disc 2. This is the usual practice with Not Now Music, a budget label that haphazardly and arbitrary creates its own song listing.2 As per usual tradition with UK reissue label, the compilation would stop at 1962 because of local Public Domain laws. Therefore, if you are looking for his biggest hits, like I Love You Because, etc., please look elsewhere.3 No label & number, no chart position and no name or source album were listed. It took me quite awhile to track the source of the songs down, either singles with label & number, chart position or name of source album.4 There is no detailed essay. In the past, the package includes gatefold cardboard cases. Now the packaging is replaced by the usual 2-CD plastic case. The 4-page booklet is quite forgettable.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Although Al Martino has 44 singles on the US chart, I have just painstakingly compiled a Complete Singles Discography, and found that he actually has 97 singles from 1952 - 1993 (a and b-sides, charted and uncharted, US, UK, Australian & Belgium, but only 181 songs, not 194 songs, because 13 songs were repeated releases).

"VIDEO:The Return of Count Yorga creeps onto blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC 1080p 1.85:1 encode, just in time for Halloween. As a youngster, there were 3 movies that really scared me: House of Wax (with Vincent Price), Horror of Dracula (with Christopher Lee) and The Return of Count Yorga (with Richard Quarry). This movie was available as a twofer on DVD, but very expensive. I am glad that it has finally risen from the high definition grave. Considering this movie was from 1971, the video was quite acceptable, with some details. Original grain was retained. Colours were vibrant, especially bloody red. Skin tone was natural. Black levels were good. (3.5/5)AUDO:With a very strong English DTS-HD MA 1.0 track, The Return of Count Yorga sounds wonderful. Dialogue is crisp and clear and easily heard throughout. The amazing haunting violin-dominated score by Bill Marx has plenty of separation from the dialogue and sound effects elements and comes through to creepy effect. Like the scene when Yorga suddenly appeared at the end of a long corridor, gnashing his teeth, running at an intended victim with outstretched hands, the sound effect maximizes the horrified helpless feelings of the victim. As a senior now, I still hate long, dark corridor. (Another such creepy long corridor scene is from The Shining). (4/5)MOVIE:Yorga and his servant Brudda, who were supposedly killed in the original Count Yorga, Vampire, were brought back to life by those notoriously supernatural Santa Ana winds. Robert Quarry was stellar of course. This was also the final film for George Macready (as Professor Rightstat), father to Michael Macready, who produced both Count Yorga films. This film also marked the debut of Craig T. Nelson (as Sgt. OConnor). If you listen carefully to the dialogue, there is tremendous humour in it. Count Yorga also currently holds the record to the vampire who has the most mistresses (9I think). This movie still holds a special place in my heart. (5/5).FINAL THOUGHTS:The original Count Yorga, Vampire was also available on blu-ray on October 13, 2015, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a limited edition (3000 copies) by Twilight Time, and not readily available.Finally, The Return of Count Yorga is available on high definition with pretty good video and audio. Thank you, Scream Factory. I am happy with my purchase, and this set is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OWB4NC179EAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112HPSD8#wasThisHelpful","R1OWB4NC179EAA","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:This twofer If I Give My Heart to You/Honky Tonk Angel by Kitty Kallen, released by Collectables from US in 2000, contains 24 songs.

She gave her own interpretation of popular hits by other artists. In Honky Tonk Angel, she smoothed out every hard core country influence and replaced them with easy-listening croon.2 The sound is surprisingly good (by usual low Collectables standards).NEGATIVE POINT:1 There are no bonus tracks.FINAL THOUGHTS:Kitty Kallen was born Katherine Kalinsky on May 25, 1922 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She started as band singer for Jack Teagarden (1939-41), Bob Sherwood (1942), Jimmy Dorsey (1943  1944) and Harry James (1944  1945), Sonny Burke (1946), and Artie Shaw (1946). There are many memorable hits both as band singer and her solo career. She has an illustrious singing career, but has to cut short due to scarring of the lungs from apparent embolus to her lungs from estrogen replacement therapy.If you are interested in her band singer era, I would recommend Little Things Mean A Lot (Jasmine, 2CDs, 2005, 47 songs). As to her solo career, I would recommend Our Lady Kitty Kallen (Sepia, 1CD, 2003, 25 songs, covering 1946  1952), Warm and Sincere (Sepia, 1CD, 2008, 27 songs covering 1949  1955) and Little Things Mean A Lot (RPM, 2008, 28 songs). The best overall coverage, with fantastic sound, is Kitty Kallen Collection 39-62 (Acrobat Music, 2CDs, 2015, 51 songs, already released in UK, but to be released in US on December 11, 2015). Her output from 1963  1967 is sorely inadequate. I hope someday Bear Family will come out with a Complete Kitty Kallen box set. Since most of her albums were released prior to 1962, perhaps, Real Gone Music (UK) can release Classic Album Collection on Kitty Kallen. There are still 6 albums from 1954  1962 that have yet to make their debut on CDs.If you like Kitty Kallen, this set is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRD553RSEYK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YNF9#wasThisHelpful","R3PRD553RSEYK6","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are 17 rare gems making their CD debut. The producer has done an excellent job in the song selection because there are songs that are not found in her singles discography. This is simply a collectors dream come true. Thank you, Sepia Records.2 The sound is simply wonderfully remastered: clean, vibrant and warm, as per high standards at Sepia Records using 24 bit Cedar Remastering System.3 The songs are arranged chronologically.4 There is a wonderful 12-page booklet, with an informative essay by Tony Middleton. Names of orchestra and dates of recordings are included. There are five autographed pictures of Kitty Kallen, two addressed directly to Sepia Records. With the good work of releasing her many songs, Sepia Records, you certainly deserved those beautiful autographed pictures.NEGATIVE POINT:1 There are some rare b-sides as noted above that are not included.2 No label & number, chart position were included.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Kitty Kallen has 15 charted singles from 1949 to 1963. I have just painstakingly compiled a detailed Complete Singles Discography, including all her singles as band singer, plus her solo efforts, I found that she actually has 98 singles from 1939 to 1967 (178 songs not 196 songs because 18 b-sides belonged to other artists). Her labels are (1) Columbia (1939), (2) Varsity (1940), (3) Capitol (1942), (4) Decca (1943  1944), (5) V-Disc (1944 - 1945), (6) Columbia (1944  1945), (7) Musicraft (1946), (8) Mercury (1949  1951), (9) Columbia (1952), (10) Decca (1953  1957), (11) Columbia (1958  1961), (12) RCA Victor (1962  1963), (13) 20th Century-Fox (1964), (14) United Artists (1965), (15) Philips (1966), and (16) Bell (1967).FINAL THOUGHTS:Kitty Kallen was born Katherine Kalinsky on May 25, 1922 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She started as band singer for Jack Teagarden (1939-41), Bob Sherwood (1942), Jimmy Dorsey (1943  1944) and Harry James (1944  1945), Sonny Burke (1946), and Artie Shaw (1946).

Of course, the twofer If I Give My Heart To You/Honky Tonk Angel on Collectables is also recommended covering 1958  1961. Her output from 1963  1967 is sorely inadequate.

At the time of release, there were many rare gems making their CD debut.2 The sound is average and acceptable. Nowadays, besides critical listening, I also rip the song onto my wav file in my computer. From the look of the digital file, I can tell whether the producer has put in efforts in remastering. In this case, as typical of 1992 era, no effort was put into remastering the sound. They just laid down the tracks, and thats it.3 There is an excellent booklet, with an informative essay by Peter Dempsey. Label & number, names of orchestra, chart position were also clearly stated. Good job. This really helps in my creation of a Complete Singles Discography.4 The songs are arranged chronologically, clearly divided under different orchestra.5 Time: 76 minutes. Good value.NEGATIVE POINT:1 The sound can be better remastered.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Kitty Kallen has 15 charted singles from 1949 to 1963. I have just painstakingly compiled a detailed Complete Singles Discography, including all her singles as band singer, plus her solo efforts, I found that she actually has 93 singles from 1939 to 1967 (168 songs not 186 songs because 18 b-sides belonged to other artists). Her labels are (1) Columbia (1939), (2) Varsity (1940), (3) Capitol (1942), (4) Decca (1943  1944), (5) V-Disc (1944 - 1945), (6) Columbia (1944  1945), (7) Musicraft (1946), (8) Mercury (1949  1951), (9) Columbia (1952), (10) Decca (1953  1957), (11) Columbia (1958  1961), (12) RCA Victor (1962  1963), (13) 20th Century-Fox (1964), (14) United Artists (1965), (15) Philips (1966), and (16) Bell (1967).FINAL THOUGHTS:Kitty Kallen was born Katherine Kalinsky on May 25, 1922 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She started as band singer for Jack Teagarden (1939-41), Bob Sherwood (1942), Jimmy Dorsey (1943  1944) and Harry James (1944  1945), Sonny Burke (1946), and Artie Shaw (1946). There are many memorable hits both as band singer and her solo career. She has an illustrious singing career, but has to cut short due to scarring of the lungs from apparent embolus to her lungs from estrogen replacement therapy.If you are interested in her band singer era, I would recommend Little Things Mean A Lot (Jasmine, 2CDs, 2005, 47 songs). As to her solo career, I would recommend Our Lady Kitty Kallen (Sepia, 1CD, 2008, 25 songs, covering 1946  1952), Warm and Sincere (Sepia, 1CD, 2008, 27 songs, covering 1949  1957) and Little Things Mean A Lot (RPM, 2008, 28 songs) . The best overall coverage is Kitty Kallen Collection 39-62 (Acrobat Music, 2CDs, 2015, 51 songs, released in UK already, but to be released in US on December 11, 2015). Of course, the twofer If I Give My Heart To You/Honky Tonk Angel on Collectables is also recommended covering 1958  1961. Her output from 1963  1967 is sorely inadequate. I hope someday Bear Family will come out with a Complete Kitty Kallen box set.If you like Kitty Kallen as band singer, I would refer you to Jasmines release Little Things Mean A Lot with 47 songs, more complete coverage and much better sound.

Nevertheless, her biggest hits are included here. There are many rare album tracks.2 The sound is average and acceptable. Nowadays, besides critical listening, I also rip the song onto my wav file in my computer. From the look of the digital file, I can tell whether the producer has put in efforts in remastering. In this case, as typical of 1992 era, no effort was put into remastering the sound. They just laid down the tracks, and thats it.3 There is an excellent, informative essay by Gino Falzarano about Kitty Kallen, with many direct quotes, in the 18-page booklet. The names of orchestra were included.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 Time: disc 1: 35 minutes; disc 2: 37 minutes. Proudly displayed on the back of the booklet. 24 songs may be acceptable by 1992 standards, and thats why the time was proudly displayed. By todays (2015) standards, this is totally inadequate. As the matter of fact, all the songs can fit into ONE CD.2 The sound can be better remastered.3 In a few instances, more recent re-recorded versions from the 60s were included, instead of the original 1940s versions.4 The songs are not sequenced chronologically.COMPLETE SINGLES DISCOGRAPHY:Kitty Kallen has 15 charted singles from 1949 to 1963. I have just painstakingly compiled a detailed Complete Singles Discography, including all her singles as band singer, plus her solo efforts, I found that she actually has 98 singles from 1939 to 1967 (178 songs not 196 songs because 18 b-sides belonged to other artists). Her labels are (1) Columbia (1939), (2) Varsity (1940), (3) Capitol (1942), (4) Decca (1943  1944), (5) V-Disc (1944 - 1945), (6) Columbia (1944  1945), (7) Musicraft (1946), (8) Mercury (1949  1951), (9) Columbia (1952), (10) Decca (1953  1957), (11) Columbia (1958  1961), (12) RCA Victor (1962  1963), (13) 20th Century-Fox (1964), (14) United Artists (1965), (15) Philips (1966), and (16) Bell (1967).FINAL THOUGHTS:Kitty Kallen was born Katherine Kalinsky on May 25, 1922 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She started as band singer for Jack Teagarden (1939-41), Bob Sherwood (1942), Jimmy Dorsey (1943  1944) and Harry James (1944  1945), Sonny Burke (1946), and Artie Shaw (1946). There are many memorable hits both as band singer and her solo career. She has an illustrious singing career, but has to cut short due to scarring of the lungs from apparent embolus to her lungs from estrogen replacement therapy.If you are interested in her band singer era, I would recommend Little Things Mean A Lot (Jasmine, 2CDs, 2005, 48 songs) and Little Things Mean A Lot (Living Era, 1CD, 2006, 25 songs). As to her solo career, I would recommend Our Lady Kitty Kallen (Sepia, 1CD, 2008, 25 songs, covering 1946  1952), Warm and Sincere (Sepia, 1CD, 2008, 27 songs, covering 1949  1957). The best overall coverage is Kitty Kallen Collection 39-62 (Acrobat Music, 2CDs, 2015, 51 songs) released in UK already, and on December 11 2015 in US. Of course, the twofer If I Give My Heart To You/Honky Tonk Angel on Collectables is also recommended covering 1958  1961. Her output from 1963  1967 is sorely inadequate. I hope some day Bear Family will come out with a Complete Kitty Kallen box set.This set, with only 24 songs and average sound, but a few rare gems is recommended more for collectors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XW4XAI4ABMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000288V#wasThisHelpful","R14XW4XAI4ABMC","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

BLUE SKY (Jet 5050)(a-side)(BB 35/1978; CB 27/1978; RW 33/1978; UK 6/1978)*from album Out of the BlueVIDEO:This Live in Hyde Park by Jeff Lynnes ELO arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC 1080i 1.78:1 encode. Compared with recent Out of the Blue blu-ray filmed in the 70s, this video, shot in September 2014, give us the modern presentation with widescreen and very sharp video. The colours are vibrant, especially those pictures on the half-moon shaped video screen, like those of the colourful spaceship and spectacular light show. The images are sharp. Blacks are inky. This is ELOs at their modern best. (5/5)AUDIO:This concert comes with LPCM Stereo. The sound is really excellent, with Jeff Lynnes voice fully displayed. All the different instruments are clearly defined. Richard Tandy (original member) was fantastic on piano. The backing BBC Concert Orchestra was in top form and did not miss a note. I must mention the outstanding violin solos by pretty blonde, Chereene Allan, in hot pants, especially in Livin Thing and Sweet Talkin Woman. After you have watched her play, you will agree that her violin play was purely Strange Magic. The entire backing group was very tight. Jeff Lynne was able to reproduce the studio sound onto live concert. Too bad there was no DTS HD 5.1 Master Audio. (5/5)CONCERT & BONUS FEATURES:This concert reflects ELO at their best, playing all their greatest hits. In the last Out of the Blue blu-ray, the more modern songs were left out because it was filmed in 1979 before those songs were released. Here, we have all those missing big hits, like All Over The World, and Rock and Roll Is King. The very special bonus is the inclusion of Handle with Care, a big hit by the Traveling Wilburys. Concert (5+/5)You must also watch Mr. Blue Sky: The Story of Jeff Lynne & ELO, detailing from the very beginning of Jeffs career with group like Idle Race and Move, eventually creating ELO with Richard Tandy. You also see how Jeff Lynne re-energized the career of George Harrison and Roy Orbison. There is a segment of the Traveling Wilburys. It was really poignant to watch the late George Harrison and Roy Orbison in action. We also have interviews from Paul McCartney, George Harrisons wife, Olivia, and their son, Dhani, who looked exactly like George. Jeff Lynne as a producer for the two hits by the Beatles Free As A Bird and Real Love was well documented. After you finished watching this rather lengthy but totally enjoyable documentary, I simply marvel at the musical genius of Jeff Lynne. (5/5)FINAL THOUGHTS:This is simply the best blu-ray concert released in 2015. Although only two original members of ELO were there, the sound was pure ELO. Both the video and audio are better than the Out of the Blue concert in 1979, a benefit from modern technology in both video and audio. The entire concert was totally enjoyable, and you cant help singing along with those wonderful tunes. This set is very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCK1NXH98VGJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012GKHYCS#wasThisHelpful","RCK1NXH98VGJN","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can get this complete coverage and more on the Bear Family box set Honky Tonk Years 1950 -66 (10 CDs, 2002), but very expensive (nearly $290).2 The songs are sequenced chronologically.3 The sound is very well remastered, almost perfect. Besides critical listening, I now rip the songs onto wav files in my computer. Being a remasterer, I can tell how much efforts the producers have put in from the wav files. In this case, the sound is excellent.4 There is an excellent 24-page booklet with an informative essay by Paul Watts. Label & number plus chart positions are included. Recording session details are also included, just like those with Bear Family. Excellent job!!!NEGATIVE POINT:1 As per usual practice with reissue labels in UK, their compilation would stop at 1962 because of local Public Domain laws. This is a pity. There are 76 more charted singles (152 songs) from 1963 to 1989, including Make The World Go Away (BB C&W 2/1963), For The Good Times (BB C&W 1(1)/1970), I Wont Mention It Again (BB C&W 1(3)/1971), Shes Got To Be A Saint (BB C&W 1(3)/1962) and his last No. 1 single Youre The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me (BB C&W 1(1)/1973). His singles coverage on CDs after 1962 is poor. I guess we need another couple box sets from Bear Family to complete his lengthy career.FINAL THOUGHTS:Ray Price was born on January 12, 1926 in Perryville, Texas, and raised in Dallas. He was known as The Cherokee Cowboy. His most famous song Crazy Arms currently is ranked #5 on the country chart for No. 1 songs with 20 weeks. (The current champion is Cruise by Florida Georgia Line with 24 weeks at No. 1). If you like the early Ray Price, this set is simply the best collection out there with great sound and reasonable price. This set is highly recommended to all the fans of Ray Price and country music.Lastly, if you like this type of comprehensive coverage of country artists, I would also recommend similar Complete Country Hits by Eddy Arnold, Hank Snow, Kitty Wells, Webb Pierce and Marty Robbins by Acrobat Music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U8H7HWPEQ4OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZP49YUI#wasThisHelpful","R1U8H7HWPEQ4OB","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:Golden Classics by the Three Chuckles, released by Collectables from US in 1997, contains 18 songs. I have compiled a detailed song listing (including singles label & number, chart position, debut date, plus personal comments)(US=US Singles Chart prior to 1955; BB Pop=Billboard Hot 100; CB Pop=Cash Box Singles Chart; RW Pop=Record World Singles Chart):01 AT LAST YOU UNDERSTAND (""X"" 0066)(b-side, October 1954)02 RUNAROUND (""X"" 0066)(a-side)(US 20/1954; CB Pop 28/1954; RW Pop 25/1954)(October 1954)*first released on Boulevard 100 in 1954; #23 hit for The Fleetwoods in 1960.03 FOOLISHLY (""X"" 0095)(a-side)(CB Pop 45/1955; RW Pop 70/1955)(March 1955)04 IF YOU SHOULD LOVE AGAIN (""X"" 0095)(b-side, March 1955)*rare gem; not available online.05 SO LONG (""X"" 0134)(uncharted a-side, May 1955)06 YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME (""X"" 0134)(b-side, May 1955)07 BLUE LOVER (""X"" 0150)(b-side, July 1955)*rare gem; not available online.08 REALIZE (""X"" 0150)(uncharted a-side, July 1955)*rare gem; not available online.09 TIMES TWO, I LOVE YOU (""X"" 0162)(a-side)(BB Pop 67/1955; RW Pop 61/1955)(November 1955)10 STILL THINKING OF YOU (""X"" 0162)(b-side, November 1955)(RW Pop 57/1955)*double sided hit11 ANYWAY (""X"" 0186)(b-side, December 1956)12 THE FUNNY LITTLE THING WE USED TO DO (""X"" 0186)(uncharted a-side, December 1956)*rare gem; not available online.13 TELL ME (THAT YOUR LOVE IS FOR ME)(Vik 4X-0194)(b-side, March 1956)14 AND THE ANGELS SING (Vik 4X-0194)(a-side)(BB Pop 70/1956)(March 1956)15 GYPSY IN MY SOUL (Vik 4X-0216)(uncharted a-side, June 1956)16 WERE STILL HOLDING HANDS (Vik 4X-0216)(b-side, June 1956)*rare gem; not available online.17 MIDNIGHT TIL DAWN (Vik 4X-0232)(b-side, 1956)*rare gem; not available online; a-side Falling Out of Love is missing here.18 WERE GONNA ROCK TONIGHT (Vik 4X- 0244)(uncharted a-side, December 1956)POSITIVE POINTS:1 This is currently the only CD collection on the Three Chuckles, released by Collectables. Initially, I have reservation about this set because Collectables in the past was known to produce only 6-8 songs with bad sound. I am glad to say that this current set is an exception. There are 18 songs, with many making their CD debut, and some of them not even available online.2 The sound is surprisingly acceptable.3 The songs are arranged chronologically.4 There is a 6-page booklet with an informative essay by Mark Marymont on the group.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 Time: 44 minutes. There are still a few songs (singles) missing and Collectables could have filled up the remaining space with those missing songs to make this a truly complete singles collection:(1)  FALLING OUT OF LOVE (Vik 4X-0232)(uncharted a-side, 1956)(2)  WONT YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE (Vik 4X- 0244)(b-side, December 1956)*available online.(3)  NEXT STOP PARADISE (Teddy Randazzo & the Three Chuckles)(Vik 4X-0277)(a-side)(CB Pop 59/1957; RW Pop 47/1957)(May 1957)*available on Teddy Randazzo CD.(4)  HOW COULD YOU KNOW (Teddy Randazzo & the Three Chuckles)(Vik 4X-0277)(b-side, May 1957)*available online.2 Label & number and chart position were not included.FINAL THOUGHTS:I bought this CD mainly to complete my Teddy Randazzo Collection. The original members of the Three Chuckles were Tommy Romano, Tommy (Russ) Gilberto and Phil Benti. They got their name from a candy bar. In 1953, Phil quit and Teddy Randazzo joined the group. The rest, I guess, was history. If you like Teddy Randazzo, this set is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19JJ5MNUCFZAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000093E#wasThisHelpful","R19JJ5MNUCFZAO","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:This 4-CD box set, Live in Las Vegas, originally released in 2001 and now re-released in September 2015 by RCA, contain exactly the same song listing, but the discs are housed in a smaller long box. I have compiled a detailed song listing (containing original dates of the performance):DISC 1:FROM INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, DINNER SHOW, AUGUST 24, 1969:Program One:01 Blue Suede Shoes02 I Got A Woman03 All Shook Up04 Elvis Welcomes The Audience05 Love Me Tender06 Jailhouse Rock/Dont Be Cruel07 Heartbreak Hotel08 Hound Dog09 I Cant Stop Loving You10 Johnny B. Goode11 Baby What You Want Me To Do12 RunawayProgram Two:13 Are You Lonesome Tonight14 Yesterday/Hey Jude15 Introductions16 In The Ghetto17 Suspicious Minds18 Whatd I Say19 Cant Help Falling In Love20 Elvis Talks About His CareerPositive Points:1 This is the complete concert from August 24, 1969. The rare gems in this concert are Baby What You Want Me To Do, Runaway, I Cant Stop Loving You and Johnny B. Goode. If you want his August 21 concert, you can find it in CD Viva Las Vegas (make sure get the 2 CD set). If you want the August 26 concert, you can find it in single CD Live in Vegas. Songs from those few dates are also found in disc 3 Collectors Gold (1991).2 The sound is perfect and excellently remastered. Ricky Nelsons guitarist, James Burton, is outstanding. The backing group, the Sweet Inspirations, gives a good support.Negative Points:1 For some unknown reasons, producers Ernst Michael Jorgensen and Dennis Ferrante decided to edit the piano tracks by Larry Muhoberac out. In some tracks, you can barely hear the piano, leaked from other microphones. This is totally bizarre, and the 2015 edition has not corrected this injustice.2 Another bizarre fact is that Jorgensen decided to move Elviss monologue about his career from after track 10 to the end. His explanation was playing convenience. This unilateral unnecessary edit really undermines the historic value of this box.DISC 2:FROM INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, AUGUST 11, 1970:Program One:01 Thats All Right02 I Got A Woman03 Hound Dog04 Love Me Tender05 There Goes My Everything06 Just Pretend07 I Just Cant Help Believin08 Something09 Men with Broken Hearts10 Walk A Mile In My Shoes11 Youve Lost That Loving FeelingProgram Two:12 Polk Salad Annie13 One Night14 Dont be Cruel15 Love Me16 Instrumental Vamp17 Heartbreak Hotel18 Introductions19 Bridge Over Troubled Water20 Suspicious Minds21 Cant Help Falling In Love22 When The Snow Is On the RosesPositive Points:1 The sound is again excellent, perfectly remastered. In this concert, all the different instruments are clearly defined, especially the piano of Glen D. Hardin. Of course, James Burton was outstanding as usual. Simply a fabulous great sounding concert.2 The rare gems include recitation of Hank Williams Men With Broken Hearts, Something and When the Snow Is On The Roses.NEGATIVE POINT:1 This concert was previously found in Thats The Way It Is Special Edition, disc 2, and also Essential 70s Masters disc 5.DISC 3:FROM INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, FEBRUARY 1970:Program One:01 See See Rider*from February 18, 197002 Release Me*from February 18, 197003 Sweet Caroline*from February 16, 197004 The Wonder of You*from February 18, 197005 Polk Salad Annie*from February 18, 197006 Proud Mary*from February 16, 197007 Walk A Mile In My Shoes*from February 19, 197008 In The Ghetto*from February 19, 197009 Let It Be Me*from February 17, 197010 Dont Cry Daddy*from February 17, 197011 Kentucky Rain*from February 17, 1970Program Two:12 Long Tall Sally*from February 18, 197013 I Cant Stop Loving You*from February 19, 197014 Suspicious Minds*from February 19, 197015 Never Been To Spain*from February 16, 197216 You Gave Me A Mountain*from February 16, 197217 Its Impossible*from February 16, 197218 Its Over*from February 17, 197219 Hound Dog*from February 14, 197220 Little Sister/Get Back*from February 14, 197221 A Big Hunk of Love*from February 16, 197222 The Impossible Dream*from February 16, 197223 An American Triology*from February 16, 1972Positive Points:1 The sound is again excellently remastered. Elviss voice was centralized in full display, with the backing instruments, like James Burtons guitar and backing vocals by the Sweet Inspirations clearly defined. It should be noted that J.D. Sumner appeared on tracks 15-23.2 There are just too many great live rare gems.Negative Point:1 The above songs are previously released on Elvis On Stage (1999) and Burning Love (1999).DISC 4:FROM FRONTIER HOTEL, LAS VEGAS, 1956:Program One:01 Heartbreak Hotel*from May 6, 195602 Long Tall Sally*from May 6, 195603 Blue Suede Shoes*from May 6, 195604 Money Honey*from May 6, 195605 Promised Land*from May 6, 1956FROM INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, LAS VEGAS, 1974:06 Its Midnight*from August 21, 197507 If You Talk In Your Sleep*from August 21, 197508 Im Leavin*from August 21, 197509 Why Me Lord*from August 21, 197510 Help Me*from August 22, 197511 Softly As I Leave You*from August 21, 197512 My Baby Left Me*from August 19, 1975Program Two:13 Its Now or Never*from August 27, 197514 Hawaiian Wedding Song*from August 21, 197515 Trying to Get to You*from August 20, 197516 Green, Green Grass of Home*from March 197517 Youre The Reason Im Living*from March 197518 Big Boss Man*from March 30, 197519 Burning Love*from March 30, 197520 My Boy*from March 30, 197521 And I Love You So*from December 6, 197522 Just Pretend*from December 6, 197523 How Great Thou Art*from December 6, 197524 America The Beautiful*from December 6, 1975Positive Points:1 The sound is good for the 50s material, but excellent for the 70s materials.2 There are many live rare gems.Negative Point:1 All the above songs were previously released on The Essential 50s Masters and Elvis Aron Presley silver box set.PACKAGING:This box set comes with a smaller vertical box. There is a 32-page booklet, with many rare pictures and informative essay. The unusual design of the CD holder makes one difficult to take out and put back without putting finger prints on the CDs. Poor design.FINAL THOUGHTS:This is a re-release of the original Live in Las Vegas except in smaller size vertical box, at a lower price too. I would have preferred the bigger size box hopefully with bigger size letters, making it easier for older folks like myself to read, but the price is much more expensive. After listening to the whole set, one will appreciate why Elvis is still our KING. This set is highly recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U1ZDBL23FUR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113GOYA6#wasThisHelpful","R2U1ZDBL23FUR3","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"VIDEO (3D):Avengers: Age of Ultron - 3D arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 MVC 1080p 2.40:1 encode. Ultron offers fantastic 3D with a remarkable sense of pop-out and window-into-another-world effects. There is tremendous depth separation, making the action more realistic. There is no loss of brightness when compared to 2D. All the positive attributes for 2D also apply to 3D. This is simply a remarkable 3D experience. (5+/5).VIDEO (2D):Avengers: Age of Ultron - 2D arrives on blu-ray with MPEG-4 AVC 1080p 2.40: 1 encode. There are tremendous details. Images are razor-sharp. Colours simply sparkle, especially with those CGI effects. Blacks are inky. Skin tone is natural. When compared to 3D, this 2D looks flatter and less grand, but still is a fantastic transfer. (5/5)AUDIO (3D/2D):Avengers: Age of Ultron blasts onto blu-ray with DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio soundtrack, which has tremendous dynamic range. While those explosions will rock your home theatre, there are quiet scenes with clear surround effects, like birds chirping. Dialogue was clearly heard. To appreciate the true power of this soundtrack, you really owe it to yourself to turn up the volume. This is a total immersive experience. (5/5).TRIVIA:1 Avengers: Age of Ultron has an estimated budget of $250 million, and it has a worldwide gross of $1,403 million. Currently it is #5 on the All-Time list, behind Avatar ($2,788 million), Titanic ($2,167 million), Jurassic World ($1,662 million), Marvels The Avengers ($1,520 million) and Furious 7 ($1,512 million). However, for 2015, its domestic gross in North America ($458 million) is only second to this years champion Jurassic World ($651 million). This highly profitable gross receipts really cemented Marvel's status as a brand with a singular vision, ushering in a new era of Studios With Their Own Cinematic Universes.2 Because Ultron was 8-9 feet (2.4 - 2.7 meters) tall, the 5-foot 10-inch (1.77 meter) James Spader had to wear an antennae-like contraption made out of a thick piece of wire with two red balls attached to the top that went up his entire back and 3 feet above his head. This was done so that the actors that shared scenes with him would be able to have a reference point for where his eyes would be; the two red balls represented the placement of Ultron's eyes. Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch) stated that this was actually distracting because Spader would be giving an intense performance and out of instinct she would look at him rather than the balls representing his eyes. Much to everyone's amusement, whenever this happened, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver) would yell, ""Red balls! Look at his balls, Lizzie!"" at her in order to get her to look in the right direction.3 Scarlett Johansson was pregnant during filming of this movie so many of her scenes were scheduled early in filming before she began to show. To help hide her pregnancy later in filming, three stunt doubles were hired. This caused a lot of confusion among the other actors since, according to them, all of the stunt women looked very similar to Johansson. Chris Evans stated that it got to the point where he would say hello and start a conversation with one of them, only to realize mid-way that the person he was talking to wasn't Johansson. Ultimately, some scenes used CGI to hide Johansson's belly.PACKAGING:Avengers: Age of Ultron - 3D arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Buena Vista Home Entertainment as part of a two-disc Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + Digital HD Collector's Edition in an special red case. The Blu-ray 3D houses the feature film only; a 3D Main Menu pops up after the Marvel Studios logo. The Blu-ray contains the feature film as well as all bonus materials. Skippable Trailers on the 2D Blu-ray include ''Ant-Man, Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D., and Agent Carter.FINAL THOUGHTS:Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is a bombastic, globe-trotting action movie stuffed with some big ideas about global security, friendship, and fears. Because there are very little bonus features, I guess eventually there will be an Ultimate Collection Edition in the future. Here, both video and audio are top-rated. Although a single 2D blu ray set is available separately, if you have a 3D set, I would strongly recommend this 3D Collectors Edition. The 3D experience is simply out of this world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGRJFUJ6ER8OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8QXC#wasThisHelpful","RGRJFUJ6ER8OS","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The 6 album tracks listed above, from the still unreleased Fabian Faade: Young and Wonderful, are also making their CD debut.2 The sound is very well remastered.3 This set comes with a sturdy gatefold cardboard cases, with 2 beautiful colour picture of Fabian. There is an informative sleeve note by Brian Parks.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 There is no booklet, as per usual practice at One Day Music. There are no chart position, label & number.2 The songs are not arranged chronologically.3 There are still a few singles missing:(1)  DAVID AND GOLIATH  (Chancellor C-1072)(b-side, March 1961)*available online.(2)  DREAM FACTORY (Chancellor C-1084)(b-side, July 1961)*not available anywhere.(3)  AVE MARIA IN ST.

His labels are: (1) Chancellor (1958  1961, 17 singles), (2) Dot (1962, 1 single), (3) Philips (1971, 1 single) and Cream (1977, 1 single). His singles on Philips and Cream label are still not available anywhere.FINAL THOUGHTS:Fabian was born Fabiano Anthony Forte on February 6, 1943 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was discovered at age 14 (because of his good looks and intriguing name) by a chance meeting with Bob Marucci, owner of Chancellor Records. He began his acting career in 1959 with Hound Dog Man. He belonged to the teenage idol, often compared to Frankie Avalon, Bobby Rydell, Bobby Vee and Ricky Nelson.There is still no Complete Singles Collection on Fabian. But his biggest hits are included here with many rare gems and good sound. If you are looking for his albums, I would recommend Im A Man (Jasmine, 2014, 2 CDs, 54 songs). If you are just looking for his Greatest Hits, this set, plus This IsFabian (Ace, 1991, 26 songs), is definitely highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQ3HZ0JLHXOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014L3XB5M#wasThisHelpful","RNQ3HZ0JLHXOB","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:This 2 CD set, The Platinum Collection by Katherine Jenkins, released by Decca from UK in 2015, contain 40 songs while she was with Decca.

There are 40 songs, which is much better than the last Greatest Hits The Ultimate Collection with only 17 songs. There are 4 songs in that collection that are not present here.2 The sound is good, but not exceptional. Nowadays, beside critical listening, I also rip the song onto my wav file in the computer. Being a remasterer, I can tell how much remastering efforts the producer has put into that song. In this case, not much, but the overall result is quite acceptable.3 Time: disc 1: 78 minutes; disc 2: 77 minutes. Good value.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 In the 8-page booklet, there is no essay. But three pretty pictures of Katherine Jenkins though.2 There is no material from Warner, when she released Believe and Daydream. This set is pure Decca.FINAL THOUGHTS:Katherine Jenkins is a Welsh mezzo-soprano, born on June 29 1980. She is a classical-popular crossover singer, successfully crossing over to the pop market. All her albums hit #1 on the UK Classical Chart. In 2009, she changed label to Warner, and was paid a handsome $10 million, the highest classical recording deal in UK history. People in North America got to know her much more when she finished second on the 2012 Dancing with the Stars. One could not help to notice the transformation from a shy young girl into a mature, sexy and beautiful young lady. You will appreciate her talent even more after you have watched her Believe concert on blu-ray  simply fantastic. If you dont know her, this set is a great introduction to the talents and pure voice of Katherine Jenkins, and is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHU33BTCCY6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG7W7OA#wasThisHelpful","R3LHU33BTCCY6L","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONTENT:Hank Marvin: The Collection, released by Demon Music from UK in 2015, is a 2 CD set with 36 songs, taken from Hanks five solo albums during the period 1982  95. The songs are cleverly divided into two categories: (1) instrumental only, and (2) vocal. I have compiled a detailed song listing (including album source and singles label & number, chart position, debut date, plus personal comments)(UK=British Singles Chart):DISC 1 (INSTRUMENTAL):01 PIPELINE (featuring Duane Eddy)*from album Into The Light (Polydor 517148)(1992)02 OXYGENE (PART IV)*from album Heartbeat (Polydor 5212522)(1993)03 WONDERLAND LAND (featuring Mark Knopfler)(Polygram TV PO 297)(uncharted a-side, 1993)*from album Heartbeat (Polydor 5212522)(1993)04 WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS (featuring Brian May)(Polydor PO 229)(a-side)(UK 66/1992)(October 1992)*from album Into The Light (Polydor 517148)(1992)05 JESSICA*from album Into The Light (Polydor 517148)(1992)06 STEEL WHEEL*from album Into The Light (Polydor 517148)(1992)07 ALL ALONE WITH FRIENDS (Polydor POSP 618)(b-side, June 1983)*from album All Alone With Friends (Polydor 514)(1983)08 RIKKI DONT LOSE THAT NUMBER*from album Into The Light (Polydor 517148)(1992)09 INTO THE LIGHT*from album Into The Light (Polydor 517148)(1992)10 WICHITA LINEMAN*from album Heartbeat (Polydor 5212522)(1993)11 LIVE AND LET DIE*from album Heartbeat (Polydor 5212522)(1993)12 LIVING DOLL*from album Hank Plays Cliff (Polydor 5294262)(1995)13 WIRED FOR SOUND*from album Hank Plays Cliff (Polydor 5294262)(1995)14 THE YOUNG ONES*from album Hank Plays Cliff (Polydor 5294262)(1995)15 THE DAY I MET MARIE*from album Hank Plays Cliff (Polydor 5294262)(1995)16 DEVIL WOMAN*from album Hank Plays Cliff (Polydor 5294262)(1995)17 WE DONT TALK ANYMORE*from album Hank Plays Cliff (Polydor 5294262)(1995)18 SUMMER HOLIDAY*from album Hank Plays Cliff (Polydor 5294262)(1995)DISC 2 (VOCAL):01 DONT TALK (Polydor POSP 420)(a-side)(UK 49/1952)(February 1982)*from album Words & Music (Polydor POLD 5054)(1982)02 THE TROUBLE WITH ME IS YOU (Polydor POSP 479)(uncharted a-side, February 1983)*from album Words & Music (Polydor POLD 5054)(1982)03 THE HAWK AND THE DOVE (Polydor POSP 581)(uncharted a-side, April 1983)*from album All Alone With Friends (Polydor 514)(1983)04 BAD COP*from album Words & Music (Polydor POLD 5054)(1982)05 NIGHT NURSE*from album Words & Music (Polydor POLD 5054)(1982)06 THEN I FOUND LOVE*from album Words & Music (Polydor POLD 5054)(1982)07 LIFE LINE*from album Words & Music (Polydor POLD 5054)(1982)08 JUST ANOTHER HEARTBREAK*from album All Alone With Friends (Polydor 514)(1983)09 TAHLIA TAKE YOUR TIME*from album Words & Music (Polydor POLD 5054)(1982)10 INVISIBLE MAN (Polydor POSP 618)(uncharted a-side, June 1983)*from album All Alone With Friends (Polydor 514)(1983)11 DONT ANSWER*from album All Alone With Friends (Polydor 514)(1983)12 STARDOM*from album All Alone With Friends (Polydor 514)(1983)13 99 DAYS*from album All Alone With Friends (Polydor 514)(1983)14 HEARTBEAT (vocal: Cliff Richard)*from album Heartbeat (Polydor 5212522)(1993)15 MRS.

Hank Marvin first demonstrated his vocal talents in Throw Down A Line, a duet with Cliff Richard. His solo vocals Dont Talk and The Trouble With Me Is You both charted. As noted above, all the songs are extracted from five albums from 1982-1995: Words and Music (1982), All Alone With Friends (1983), Into The Light (1992), Heartbeat (1993) and Hank Plays Cliff (1995). There are no new songs here.2 The sound is very well remastered. Nowadays, beside critical listening, I also ripped the songs into wav files on the computer. From those files, I can also tell how much efforts have been put into remastering those songs. In this case, it is not perfect, but very good. Some songs, like We Are The Champions did not get the remastering efforts that it deserved.3 There is an 8-page booklet with an informative essay. The names of vocalists are included.NEGATIVE POINTS:1 As a Hank Marvin Collection, I am disappointed that two of his charted singles are omitted:(1)  LIVING DOLL (with The Young Ones and Hank Marvin)(WEA YZ 65P)(a-side)(UK 1(3)/1986)(March 1986)(2)  LONDON KID (Jean-Michel Jarre, featuring Hank Marvin)(Polydor 32)(a-side)(UK 52/1989)(January 1989)2 Disc 1: 74 minutes; disc 2: 65 minutes. Surely Demon Music could have filled up the remaining empty space (21 minutes) with more songs. I know this is not a Singles Collection, but a lot of the b-sides could have been included.3 Hank Marvin has 14 solo albums with the latest Hank in 2014. Therefore there are lots of materials to choose from.4 His solo materials from Columbia were not included.5 No label & number, chart position, names of source albums were identified.6 The songs were randomly sequenced, not grouped under individual albums.FINAL THOUGHTS:Hank Marvin (also known as Hank B. Marvin) was born Brian Robson Rankin on October 28, 1941 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He chose the name Hank Marvin while launching his career. The name is an amalgamation of his childhood nickname, Hank, which he used to differentiate himself from friends also named Brian, and Marvin Rainwater, a country and western singer. He is currently living in Perth, Australia, with his wife Carole, and had 2 children: Tahlia: remember the song Tahlia Take Your Time and Ben, whom Hank taught guitar and he played with dad during the concert in 1994. If you like Hank and the Shadows, I would highly recommend The Shadows: The Final Tour (2004) on blu-ray. This current set is a great collection of Hanks solo efforts with good sound, and is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4F2G1TJNEU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BMOJ8I#wasThisHelpful","R3P4F2G1TJNEU3","ACCGLD049CRBI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACCGLD049CRBI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are very comfortable jeans and pretty well made, however they have changed these jeans since the last time I bought them: the denim is lighter weight and (on my last order at least) there was virtually no distressing.  Previously I've had 361's come with anything from very little (dime sized) to a lot of distressing (up to torn knees).  Compared to past purchases of 361 Lucky Jeans I found the quality to be more consistent, which is good, but I wish they hadn't switched to the thinner, cheaper quality denim.The fit is good and the stitching is well done.  These are a step above what you would buy at someplace like Old Navy, but just barely.  I would not pay more than $50 for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7P1AK9UZ0FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SYWOHQ#wasThisHelpful","RQ7P1AK9UZ0FC","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Under no circumstances could I see myself giving this to one of my kids.  Why?  Well let's start with ingredient #2: Hydrogenated vegetable oil (corn, canola, palm olein).  Wait, that's trans fat right?  How can they get away with listing ""zero"" trans fats?  Easy, they make the serving size really small (40g of powder) so they can get the trans fats down to under 0.5 grams and they can legally claim ""zero"".  Which is to say they're lying and you won't know unless you read the small print and know about the legal loopholes.  But there are 20 servings in this can, so that's potentially around 10 grams of trans fats.  Safe amount for children?  Zero.  Actual zero, not the ""pretend"" zero on this label.But let's go on.  The third and fourth ingredients are corn syrup and sugar.  So sugar, and sugar.  How much?  18 grams of sugar per serving!  18?  That's desert! (Compare to a serving of Hagen Daz vanilla ice cream which has 19 grams of sugar).  The ""prebiotics"" is just your basic fiber (chicory root and oligofructose) and you only get 1 gram of that.  That's not really going to do you much good.  A decent fiber gummy will give you 3x as much per serving.  An apple will give you 4-5x.  And they toss in some vitamins so you think it's healthy.So don't be fooled by this garbage: your best bet is regular milk, but if you need powdered milk, buy real powdered milk (which generally has one ingredient: milk).  I can't conclude this product is anything but a scam.  I realize Nestle primarily sells this in third world countries where people may not have the means to know any better, but it's hard to imagine they thought they could get away with this here.  Of course it's targeted at poor immigrants from those third world countries, so perhaps Nestle is betting that their cheap, unhealthy, sugary drink (with vitamins!) can continue to sucker them in here.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252NBVFJ86382/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LVDDFA#wasThisHelpful","R252NBVFJ86382","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my 7 year old niece, who really enjoys it, but the humor is just a tad above her level (but it's good stuff for encouraging discussion).  However it has quickly become a favorite of her brother (age 10) and my 9 and 8 year old sons (so much so that they'll stay up late reading it together with a flashlight - laughing the whole time).  They've moved on to the second book and can't wait for the third one to come out.  I've read a bit of it as well and it's absolutely brilliant.Like all really good ""kid books"" some of the writing is above the targeted level.  In my experience kids thrive on that and it encourages them to stretch.  It certainly helps that it's really, really funny.  I would absolutely encourage you to buy this for any girl or boy in your life who is reading at or above the 4th grade level.  Even teens would enjoy this - it's just that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RUB6CEA4O44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKNMFMO#wasThisHelpful","R12RUB6CEA4O44","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have four kids and have been through our share of diapers.  My wife and I are both engineers and cant help but deconstruct and analyze things just for fun.  This includes diapersAfter trying lots of brands weve generally defaulted to Huggies and Pampers, which do seem to perform slightly better than the competition.  Though if you are on a budget even cheap store-brand diapers work pretty well (except Babies-R-Us and Walmart which are both terrible).  Over time we have seen diapers improve quite a bit, and frankly its gotten to the point where its hard to recommend one brand over the other.  In our experience the best diaper varies from kid-to-kid.  We generally found Pampers fit our older kids better and Huggies fit our younger kids better.Feature wise both Huggies and Pampers are pretty equal: umbilical cord cutouts in the newborn diapers, wetness indicators, and better leak protection around the edges.  Weve noticed that Pampers tend to be much thinner (Proctor and Gambles SAPs [super absorbent polymers] are industry leading and it seems that they are doing more with less) but we found Huggies seemed to minimize diaper rash in babies with sensitive skin (a lot of the extra bulk in a diaper is cellulose and Huggies seem to have more of it  perhaps that extra bulk is keeping SAPs from drying out skin?).Weve used these diapers on our kids with no complaints or problems.  They fit well, rarely leak, and are easy to get on, and off.  They are not as absorbent as Pampers, but in our experience its not just how much can it absorb, but can it keep it away from skin?  For newborns we had better luck avoiding rashes with Huggies (along with regular diaper changes).  As kids got older and more mobile Pampers seem to work better.  Though as weve said, every kid is different, and you should be prepared to change brands as kids grow and their bodies change.One tip though: this is a GIANT box of diapers.  Start with a few small packs from various brands and try them out first.  Then shop for the mega-sized box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28AP0K5TXUZQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB0WGAY#wasThisHelpful","R28AP0K5TXUZQ6","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are so many tablet choices out there it can be hard to sort through them all.  At the high-end there are the iPads and Surface and at the low end a lot of Android tablets youve never heard of.  In this price point I would consider two options: name brand Android vs. Kindle Fire.  For kids I buy Kindle Fires, which have excellent parental controls.  For adults I suggest name-brand Android tablets which provide better performance and more flexibility than a Kindle Fire.Asus isnt the only choice but its a good one.  They have a long term reputation for quality but tend to be a better value than the bigger name brands like Samsung.  I consider their quality on par with Samsung, well above Amazon, and step below Apple.  The quad-core Intel CPU far out performs anything you will find in a Kindle Fire and compares well against higher end Samsung ARM based tablets.  It does this at very low (~1.3GHz) clock speeds keeping leakage power loss to a minimum.  This uses a Moorfield platform SOC which includes the excellent Silvermont cores.  Its a quad-core single threaded design. For graphics it has a PowerVR G6430 clocked around 450Mhz (same basic graphics found on the Apple A7 but a higher clock).  I would rate this as a mid-tier graphics core that will handle anything Android will throw at it, but it would be underpowered if this was a Windows tablet.  It fits with the price point but you will find better cores in higher-end Apple and Samsung products.I personally found the IPS screen to be excellent.  Its not quite on par with the Apple Retina display but it puts my Kindle Fire HDX to shame.  I gave it to my kids and let them run a couple of their games and they had no issues with performance.  I think for the price you are getting a pretty good tablet from a well know manufacturer.  Minus catching a higher end Samsung on sale, I dont think youll find a much better deal out there.  If you are shopping around for an Android tablet I would not hesitate to buy this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOGTYVPS9X9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012UEUQM0#wasThisHelpful","R1NOGTYVPS9X9N","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Starting with a Le Creuset enameled cast-iron Dutch oven several years ago I've slowly migrate most of my cooking over from stainless steel.  Along the way we've picked up Staub (on par with Le Creuset), Martha Stewart (junk), Kirkland (awesome value), and now this Gorham Dutch oven.I can't comment on durability yet but it seems solid enough.  I can say that it seems to cook fairly evenly.  The lid fits well and has mimicked the ""dots"" found on Staub cookware that allow condensation to wick together and drop more evenly onto your food.  I'm not sure this really helps anything, but I don't suppose it hurts.  This is faller and narrower than I might prefer, since I tend to cook dishes that involve browning beef or chicken (so a wider base works best for me), but it's the perfect shape for stews.Cleanup so far has been easy.  My Kirkland still wins for easiest cleanup, but this has been nearly as easy.  I generally throw everything in the dishwasher, but for enameled cast iron a short soak and scrub with a scotch pad is often in order.  I intentionally overcooked a little frond in the pan and discovered that (just like my other cookware) a quick scrub with a SOS pad cleans it up nicely.Overall a decent Dutch oven at a very good price.  If you are on a budget and have the option I would try out Kirkland first, but this seems to be a good option.  If money isn't an object then go ahead and splurge on the Staub or Le Creuset, but understand that while you are getting a better product it's not the best value for your money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30C8BCUOJJ323/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKKTD8#wasThisHelpful","R30C8BCUOJJ323","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arendelle's Winter Festival is a fun interactive math game aimed at kids pre-k to 2nd grade.  It covers that range pretty well with five games where you can earn crystals which you can use to buy prizes.  The mathematics is pretty lightweight, but if you are going to have the kids play a video game, it had might as well be one that offered a little learning to go with it.  The quality of these LeapTV games are improving and this is probably the best of the bunch.  The important thing for me is (like Kinnect) that it has games that will the kids up and moving, which is great for cold, wet, winter days.I have two three year olds and a seven year old in the house along with some older kids.  The younger kids were able to play all the games with vary degrees of success.  They need a little adult (or older kid) direction to get going but they picked it up pretty well.  They definitely dont get much of the math involved, but its not a barrier.  The seven year old is beyond most of the math, but Im all for anything that associates math with fun so for her its still a win in my book.  Its attracted some interest from the older kids who will play occasionally.  Overall for the price I think you get a good video game system that offers some physical and learning benefits.  I still treat it as screen time entertainment, but its definitely preferred to just having them sit and watch TV during their allotted screen time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91U4LIO8DJFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1PPGM#wasThisHelpful","R91U4LIO8DJFK","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of our sons is a deep sleeper/sleep walker who still occasionally has accidents.

"This is a very powerful little hand-vac and it's great for cleaning up small areas that are hard to get to with a regular vacuum.  I really like that it has  a motorized brush for pet hair clean up.  The cord is a blessing and a curse.  Ideally we'd all like to have a cordless vac but that means compromising on power and battery life.  Having a cord means more power for less price, and it's a reasonably long cord (for a hand vac) which is great for things like stairs.  On the downside you've got a 15' cord to drag around.It's bagless, relatively light weight, and has a decent set of tools.  This is perfect for things like chairs, sofas, stairs, high-chairs, curtains, and cars.  If you are willing to spend about $500 you can get a cordless Dyson almost as powerful that will run for 15 minutes.  Depending on what you need it for and your budget, that might make sense.  I think for most people this makes more practical sense.  Yes you have to deal with a cord, but you save a ton of money and there are no batteries to replace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AQLYAQG57TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9Z36T8#wasThisHelpful","R13AQLYAQG57TQ","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great looking cable and the quality seems really first rate.  It ought to for the price!  Why would you spend so much on a cable?  Frankly for most people, this probably doesn't make sense.  I gave it a Five star rating for the quality, but for value it's a Three Star.  For much less you can get a decent cable, and for most people that's the best use of your money (if your cable stays pretty much in one place for example).  However if you travel a lot, or otherwise abuse your cable,  this might make sense.  This is going to stand up where other cables fail.

"I was a little nervous trying this out because I see a lot of negative reviews.  That tells me the quality is probably spotty.  However in my (short) experience with this cable I don't have any complaints.  The cable seems durable.  I've only had it a few days but I haven't treated it gently and it's going strong.  It's charging my iPhone 6 and my wife's 6 plus like a champ.  The length is good for a larger car or mini-van.  For a smaller car it might be a bit long.  I've also swapped the Lightening cable with my Kindle (micro usb) cable and it charged my Kindle without any trouble.  For the price it seem like a reasonable deal.  Because Belkin is a well known brand, watch out for counterfeits - that may account for the people getting faulty products.

"I see a lot of complaints here about crappy cables.  Let me tell you, be careful ordering a cable, even a name-brand, from some no-name seller.  There are just too many counterfeits out there.  If you want to save some money look for Amazon branded cables.  This Belkin cable (assuming you order from a reputable vendor and got the real deal) is a solid, well made cable.  I'm an engineer and I've made my fair share of cables (granted far easier stuff like RS-422) and the quality of this cable is really good.  I've tried it out on a couple of iPhones without any problem.  Overall a great cable.  It's a bit pricey and if you shop around carefully you can find something cheaper and still well made.

"I have four kids aged 3-9 and probably the one game that all ages can play together is store/restaurant.  We have a small Step2 Kids Kitchen and we put this register on a stand next to that.  They were already working up fake menus and pretend money, and now they have this to put it all in.  It was an instant hit.The register itself has an okay build quality.  I think the quality is fair for the price.  So far its handled a fair share of abuse with no problems.  My kids have had a great time integrating it into their pretend play.  Aside from being just fun I think theres a lot of learning value to having it.  This sort of thing really helps kids grasp how stores and money works.  Its the sort of thing thats tricky to explain but really sinks in when the role play it.  The scanner is a bit hokey, but we put some of the scan sticker on some old cereal and pasta boxes and the kids have just run with it.  The important thing is that they get a satisfying beep when they scan stuff.  That sort of thing is important to kids.  I dont know if the scan comes up correctly and it doesnt really matter, their imaginations fill in the rest.So Im not sure its the sturdiest toy in the world, but I think there is real value in having it, especially if you have a small group of siblings/cousins/friends who can play together.  A much better investment than say a video game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVPD78H6FXCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00063FE66#wasThisHelpful","R3UVPD78H6FXCJ","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second Luly Jr. product I've tried.  I don't have my result back yet on this one, but I have gotten it back on our hardcover.  It's pretty straight forward.

You get to submit up to 14 pages for the book, but they give you a few extra in case of mistakes.My kids absolutely love these things.  For the price is one of the best gifts you can give a kid.

"Our house has it's fair share of Kindles and iPhones and we have a collection of cables for the lot of them.  I wish they could establish a single cable standard, but since that seems to be beyond them, I'll settle for more cables like this that support both.  I've used this cable for both my iPhones and Kindles and for this somewhat random HP tablet we got from somewhere.  It did the job for all of them without any trouble.  We've now moved this out to the car where we mostly need it as a phone charger but occasionally we have a kindle in need of charging.  The cable is a tad over 6 inches, so don't order this is your charger isn't close to what you need to charge.

"A friend first turned me on to Rocket 3 vocalist Ramune Nagisetty's debut album ""Truth and Beauty"" after he heard one of cuts on the radio and thought it was something I'd like.  It had an honest, raw vibe that I really enjoyed, and it stayed on my regular playlist for a while.  When I didn't see any follow on I kind of gave up and her CD eventually slid off my radar for a while until word she was fronting a new band came my way.This CD does not disappoint.  As much as I liked her solo work, I think this has a stronger energy.  It has that honest ""just out of the garage"" sound that harkens back to a great tradition in Northwest rock (and I'm not just talking Grunge - think Kingsmen).  While a little more polished than her solo album, it's still ""honest rock-and-roll"" that spares you any tricks and just delivers the goods.Try out ""Never Again"" and ""Catch Me"" - I think those are good examples of their range and pretty accessible to first time listeners.  And if you like this CD try out Truth and Beauty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M90W8ZLN50ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHR0QIK#wasThisHelpful","R3M90W8ZLN50ZW","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this Linksys WRT AC1200 Dual-Band and Wi-Fi Wireless Router to replace an older Linksys AC1900 router that I wasnt happy with.  Im not looking for the highest performing router, just something reliable that doesnt choke when Im streaming a movie while somebody is online.  The setup seemed pretty similar to what I recall doing for my AC1900.  Thats mostly a good thing as I had no real complaints about the setup.  Honestly most of the routers Ive tried lately (Asus and Netgear) seem to have pretty decent setup wizards.Whats different is my initial experience with this router has been really good.  No drops, no reboots, no hassles (after 2-3 weeks of use).  Compare that to my AC1900 that had to be rebooted daily for the first few months and problems came and went with different BIOS revs.  I dont use the phone apps so I cant comment on that, but I have used the Web based remoter interface and the direct router interface and both are fine.  If you are even remotely comfortable with tweaking settings youll have no trouble at all.  If you hate that sort of thing you might need to borrow your local tech geek (everybody knows one), but its really fairly intuitive.If you review the specs youll see there are better routers out there in terms of speed and multi-frequency support.  If youve got a house full of 4+ heavy tech users you may want to consider some of the expensive multi-band routers from Linksys, Asus, and Netgear.  However I think 90% of the people out there will be happy with this router, and in my experience staying away from leading edge tech is a good way to avoid technical headaches.  I wouldnt go much below this router, just because the feature set really drops off.  However cost is a really big factor Ive had good experiences setting up some of the lower-end Asus routers for people.  Otherwise I think this is a great choice for the average user.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDAYPKP45UQRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20T0#wasThisHelpful","RDAYPKP45UQRV","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past 10 years my go-to vacuum has been a Dyson DC28 Animal.  Its been the best vacuum Ive ever owned.  Technically its not as powerful as a previous Hoover Wind Tunnel, but unlike all the Hoover and Bissels Ive owed, its lasted longer than the warranty.  This Samsung costs less than pretty much any Dyson you can buy, so the question is how does it compare?I did some objective testing on hardwood and carpet by spreading out some rice and some sandbox sand.  I weighed out two equal amounts of both, spread them around, vacuumed, and then emptied and weighed the results.  The difference between them was minor and in repeat tests the winner varied.  That told me that how I vacuumed was probably a bigger variable than raw suction.For usability I found that the old Dyson was heavier and harder to maneuver.  This was an advantage in one case: when you are using the tools on the Samsung and stretch out the hose its easy to knock it over.  The Dyson can be pulled over but its much harder.  The lift-off feature was nice, though with the Dysons long hose I can achieve the same effect.The Dyson feels and looks sturdier.  The Samsung is lighter, but the plastic seems more fragile.  I also found the Dyson much easier to empty, though both are a pain to clean out if it gets too full of dirt and dust.  I also managed to jam up the Samsung roller with hair once.  It was easy to clear, but its something I have to do to the Dyson once a year.  Having it happen after a week of use with the Samsung was not inspiring.In the end the Samsung is a much better value.  For easily  the price you get pretty much all the performance (granted the test was against a 10 year old Dyson and from what Ive read the newer Dysons are more powerful than mine).  Time will tell, but I dont expect to get the same reliability.  Ultimately I think thats what you are buying with Dyson.  If money is tight this Samsung is the smart buy.  If your budget can handle it Id certainly consider the Dyson and whether the brand reliability is worth the increased price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAFFENXL6WOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDRI#wasThisHelpful","RKAFFENXL6WOG","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two king sized memory foam mattresses in my house.  One is a $2,000 iComfort Genius by Serta.  The other is from $1000 Parklane mattress (a great local mattress company).  I like both, though the Serta is perhaps slightly nicer than the Parklane.  Its not been $1000 better.  Ive checked out some of the cheap memory foam mattresses sold at places like Costco and just found them to be way too firm.  I like a firm mattress, but Im not interested in sleeping on a rock.So my hopes were not too high for this mattress.  I seemed unlikely that a mattress that sold for half the price of my cheapest memory foam mattress was going to compare.  Surprisingly it does quite well.  This mattress is firm, but with just enough give to be comfortable.  Definitely not rock-hard like some cheap memory foams Ive encountered.  The fabric covering it looks nice.  The stitching  seems to be well done.  I really cant find anything wrong with it.  And the price really cant be beat.

"It took me a while to decide to try out Kind bars.  Ive seen them in the store, and they look really good, but Ive always been a bit turned off by the high fat and sugar content.  Now I recognize that most of the fat is coming from nuts, and thats mostly good fat, but Kind does add oils like sunflower and palm kernel oil to their products.  Depending on the product the sugar comes from dried fruit, honey and good old plain sugar.  About 14G of fat and 9G of sugar seems to be pretty typical from my quick survey.I finally decided to try them out, and I cant say Im sorry.  They taste great, and theyve rapidly become my go-to snack food.  I dont kid myself: its a health-ish dessert but eating this is way better than hitting a bag of chips or having a donut.Staring with a variety pack is the way to go.  There are a lot of bars, and Ive loved some and thought others were just okay.  Ive yet to find one I didnt like.  In this pack my favorite flavor is the Chocolate Cherry Cashew.  My one complaint is that it is a Kind Plus Antioxidants which means theyve added Vitamin A, C and E.  If you are eating a healthy diet or taking a multivitamin, you dont need any of those things, so Id rather not have them added to a bar.  For example people who get too much vitamin E have an increased chance of getting cancer (for reasons not well understood and possibly not directly related to the vitamin E).  Id rather just let the ingredients stand for themselves.  Fortunately this is true of most Kind bars.The bottom line is that they have some great tasting bars, and once you dial in which ones you like, youll have a pretty decent snack option.  Their expensive, but if you use the Amazon subscribe and save service you can get the price down to a reasonable range.  Definitely buying these one at a time in a store display is not a good value, but if you can get them for $1 or so per bar, I think its a reasonable price for what you are getting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2THV748VIIV4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SV0K8PI#wasThisHelpful","R2THV748VIIV4X","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used the Simple Human and Oxo shower caddies.  Those are both decent, but neither is perfect.  Our SimpleHuman is starting to rust (we've had it about two years), and we weren't able to get the Oxo to be as stable as the SimpleHuman.  The Oxo hasn't rusted (yet) after a year of use.My initial impressions of this Zenna shower caddy are positive.  Using aluminum is a great idea - it won't rust and if it does build up a little oxide corrosion you aren't likely to notice.  Aluminum is light weight, and a little flimsy.  To some people this may seem ""cheap"" but the aluminum cost more than the cheap metal and plastic used by other brands.  You aren't going to want to try and bend this, because it will bend.  But since non of these shower caddies are meant to be hand holds, that shouldn't be an issue.Assembly isn't hard but it did take a little longer than I recall the other caddies.  Maybe fifteen minutes if the others took ten.  Depending on the height of your bathroom you may have extension pieces left over.I found all of the caddies to be pretty handy.  Each has some clever points.  The SimpleHuman has a nice hanging spot for washcloths and scub mits.  The Oxo has nice size plastic shelves.  This Zenna has lots of hooks for hanging things off of.  Like all of the caddies the shelves are that deep, so very large items could tip out.Overall these are all great ways to create more space in a small shower.  I would probably avoid the SimpleHuman just because I now know it will rust.  I was able to get the Zenna in tighter than the Oxo, but I think the Oxo otherwise a better design.  In the end I would focus on which one has the better price, but take a look at both and pick the one that seems to have the features you want.  They are both good designs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N1EPJLAC3BFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SN3FBZA#wasThisHelpful","R3N1EPJLAC3BFA","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our primary use for these is for the iPhone.  My wife and I end up in a lot of phone meetings in the morning in order to sync with international co-workers.  Doing that and getting the family out the door can be a real challenge.  We also end up in a lot of Lync meetings at work that require some kind of headset.The sound on these is excellent for meetings.  We've tried it a couple of times and peoples voices are nice and clear.  More importantly our voice sounds very clear, and background noises seem to be filtered out.  One thing that happens is that as we carpool to work, one of us drives while the other calls into a meeting.  We found that these did an amazing job of filtering out road noise.  We even turned the radio on low and there was only the occasional leakage into the phone conversation.  We were genuinely impressed.It comes with a variety of ear buds and we did find that they were almost too good.  They completely block out outside noise.  That can be good or bad depending on where you are using them.  We also found that they were good, but not ""great"" for music.  Of course we compared them to a set of high-end studio headphones, so the comparison wasn't exactly fair.  I would certainly have no qualms about using them for music, just don't expect perfect quality, especially on the low end.Overall they are a nice set of earphones for the price - definitely great for business users.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OA2G6XISXL3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH0YDY8#wasThisHelpful","R3OA2G6XISXL3O","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very handy tacker, and much easier than using a conventional stapler.  My first impression was that it seemed solidly built.  I took out to our community garden where we had quite a bit of trellis netting to put up for peas and beans.  This went through things much faster than a stapler though with netting at least you need to take a little more care.  Next it went to the kids school to help out on some sets for a play.  Once again we whipped through attaching fabric to a frame.  It's so much faster than a stapler you wonder why you've been doing it wrong your whole life.  Using it it's clearly more of a pro-tool than a home tool, but if you have projects at home, school, or in the community that usually involve a lot of stapling, this is a much better way to get the job done.  The one exception would be projects that require a lot of accuracy: it's swung like a hammer and just like a hammer  unless you use it a lot, your aim isn't probably all that great.  For example while I didn't try it on any upholstery work, I don't think it would be my first choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LSGL8W1SL009/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM3Y1GO#wasThisHelpful","R3LSGL8W1SL009","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After years of sticking with SanDisk and Lexas Ive started branching out a bit.  This is my second Centon card.  They arent as well known but theyve been around for years making a lot of industrial memory products and I noticed they were showing up on the GoPro site as one its few certified products.  On paper their specs often exceed SanDisk and Lexar at the same price point, but in some (subjective) usage tests I havent noticed any difference.  When I can find professional reviews, usually the SanDisk wins, but if I cant detect a difference in real-world usage, why should I care?My bigger concern is reliability, and thats what kept me with SanDisk and Lexar.  Ive only had this a few days, so all I can say it that it passed the Not DOA test.  However I have another Centon card thats seen heavy usage for a few months with no problems at all.  This card comes as a MicroSD card but it includes an adapter to use it the larger SDHC readers.  I dont need that adapter, but I did try it out with a few quick reads and writes and it worked just fine.  Ive also started using Samsung cards, but I did encounter a DOA card.  It was probably bad luck (ever vendors has them) but having been bitten Ive been reluctant to go back.  Ultimately the price is what is driving my purchasing now, so once you work out what level of speed you need, I wouldnt hesitate to purchase whatever brand happens to be on sale the day that you are ready to buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T7MW3R813KT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSYM3EE#wasThisHelpful","R3T7MW3R813KT2","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second one of these products I've tried.  I have a side yard where people let their dogs use the bathroom.  You basically do all the normal over-seeding prep (dethatch a little, loosen the soil) and apply this.  It comes with some mulch to help keep the grass in place.  Scott's doesn't disclose the details, but it has additives to help mitigate the salt, nitrogen, and acidity issues associated with dog urine.  The only ingredient I could pick out for this was the gypsum, which should help balance the ph.  Mine spouted happily in the wet, cool, spring weather typical of the Pacific NW.  If there was a down side it's that you don't get much product.  Much of the container is filled with mulch.  So while this is good for a few small spots, if you have a big issue you are either going to need a larger bag (they sell them) or you are going to want to just buy you own seed and mulch separately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUEON4AMG8P6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBIJSSW#wasThisHelpful","R1PUEON4AMG8P6","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little reluctant to buy this after reading the inconsistent reviews, but it was cheap enough that I was willing to give it a shot.  It turns out it worked perfectly for my Motorola MBP36.  It came with a built-in connect for the monitor and an adapter for the camera.  I plugged it into the monitor and it fit without any problems.  Based on the complaints regarding it's ""fickle"" connection I tried moving it around and it didn't have any problem with that.  It does have a small blue LED, but it doesn't really bother me.  It's nothing a piece of black electrical tape couldn't take care of.  Based on the reviews I'm guessing there must be a production quality issue, or some people are getting a different brand or model.

"Im an engineer working in high tech.  Because I know too much about whats going on inside these laptops, I tend to get more power than I really need.  Thats started to change and I find myself gravitating to whats replacing the old style of Netbooks.  Netbooks as you recall were the hot thing a while back.  The problem is they were cheap, but not usually in a good way.  They made laptops cheap by putting cheap stuff in them.  Inevitably they broke, and all of a sudden they $200 you saved by going with a Netbook didnt look like quite as good of a deal.  However now that the market has matured, you are seeing newer technologies come online enabling inexpensive Netbooks that actually last.  CPUs, frames, LCD screens and keyboards are being designed bottom up to go in these Netbooks.  These things are finally worth buying.This Asus is a great Netbook class 2-in-1 laptop (the 2-in-1 of course refers to the fact that you can undock the keyboard and voila, youve got a tablet).  Its well made, has great battery life, and is powerful enough for the sorts of things you want to do on a Netbook: surf the web, email, watching funny cat videos, and letting your kids play Minecraft type games.  Its *NOT* powerful enough for most 3D games, and not meant to handle compute intensive applications.  Its based on the Intel Bay Trail SOC.  This is a single chip that contains the CPUs, graphics, power management and I/O circuitry.  Depending on the exact speed, power consumption and number of cores this may be sold as an Atom, Celeron or Pentium SOC.  In general the Atom parts are little slower but less power hungry.  Which is perfect for a tablet.The Atom Z3775 in this laptop has four CPU cores (Silvermont if you care) running between 1.46-2.39MHz and using 2 watts.  Yes, 2.  Thats pretty powerful for a tablet, but on the low-end of a laptop in terms of performance.  On the other hand its off the charts in terms of battery life.  Asus claims around 10 hours.  Ive beaten that by setting more aggressive power saving targets.  On average though I get an alert after about 8-9 hours of use.Its has the same basic graphic engine as any 3rd Generation Core i3/i5/i7, just with fewer graphics cores: 4 vs. 6-16 in the Core CPUS.  It also has less aggressive graphics and frequency targets.  What does this mean to you?  Well you can play something like World Of Warcraft or Minecraft but you wont want to try running any newer high end games like Dragon Age or Far Cry.  Its just not that laptop.  Instead look at the games you find on the Microsoft App Center.Functionally its mostly great.  The keyboard is really responsive.  Its small, but unless youve got really big hands its really quite useable.  The touchpad is easy to use.  Its a giant improvement for Asus, which had previously deployed some really sub-standard track pads.  Note that the USB and HDMI ports (1 each) are micro-USB and micro-HDMI.  Buy any cables on Amazon.  Most big-box stores charge a big mark up on those cables.  The screen quality is really good and the capacitive touch screen is really responsive.  Windows 8 is, well imperfect, but its much better as a tablet operating system than it is as a desktop operating system.  The 32GB SSD is too small for storing videos, but there are plenty of cloud storage options from Asus to Amazon (or even better, get  a backup hard drive).Overall this is a great little laptop for traveling, school, or kids.  I almost didnt go back to Asus after buying a TERRIBLE Ultrabook they sold a few years back (very disappointing to a long-time fan of their motherboards).  But this 2 in 1 laptop has won me back over.  Asus is offering you something vastly more useful than an iPad for much less money (for something of comparable size, features, and battery life.  If you on the market for something small and already have a main desktop or laptop for more demanding activities, this is a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N0O9MZJ161RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7XT0S4#wasThisHelpful","R2N0O9MZJ161RR","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've gone through a lot of gates over the years.  We've noticed that the overall quality and usefulness of gates has gone up quite a bit since we had our first child (we're up to four).  Previously there just weren't very many good choices  when it came to putting up gates in wide spaces.  Our home office has double doors and we'd been getting by with a tension gate(Evenflo Soft N Wide Gate).  It was really just a blockage with no opening.  To get past you step over it.  While it was helping me stay limber it was starting to look a bit ragged after many years of abuse.We decided to try out this sliding gate.  The installation is pretty typical of most of the hardware mounted gates: they provide a template to guide you on where to drill holes and mount the hardware.  It goes best with two people.  One person will have a lot of trouble getting even and level, and that will mess up the sliding mechanism.Once in place it works reasonably well.  You can open it with one hand.  Not the easiest opening, but by far not the hardest.  Considering you don't want kids to work out how to open it, it achieves the goal of being ""useable, but fairly kid proof.""  The build quality is decent.  Considering the wide gap being covered it's pretty sturdy, but I wouldn't say it's the best constructed gate ever.  Overall a good gate for a wide area.  I think the price is fair for the functionality and the quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HECE8BTI4RAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCK40Q8#wasThisHelpful","R2HECE8BTI4RAR","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After four kids weve gone through several strollers and jogging strollers.  Prior to this our go to jogging stroller was a Bob Revolution.  Thats a great mixed-use stroller that can operate as a day-to-day stroller and its a decent jogging stroller.  It does both well but doesnt quite excel at either.  This Thule stroller doesnt really function as a day-to-day stroller but it excels as a sport stroller.  If you are on a budget and looking for one multi-role stroller, there are better options.  However if your budget has room for both, this is an outstanding jogging stroller and it would complement a smaller day-to-day stroller really well.Setup is super easy.  It comes well packed and its easy to get the few parts out for assembly.  All you need to do is unfold the frame and put the three tires on.  The front tire has a bike-like quick release and the rear tires have a button which makes it easy to pop them on and off.  They are big tires (air filled and inflatable with a bike pump) so if you have a small trunk you may need to do that.  That would be a pain for a daily stroller but as a jogging stroller, not such a big deal.  Folding is easy  theres a little flap below the seat you lift up to access the handle that will collapse the stroller.  It does require you to move from behind the stroller to being in front of the stroller.  Little things like that matter if you are herding around several children.  Despite the minor hassle (compared to a rear-collapse system) I did like how much more rugged it felt than other collapse systems Ive used.Jogging with it?  A dream.  It roles easy, the shocks are superb, and the big tires deliver a smooth easy ride for your passenger.  The rear brake handle works well for large and small hands.  Its super light (~22lbs).  Ive had my hands on a lot of jogging strollers and so far this is the hands down best.It has the standard baby features: View flaps, adjustable seat recline, under carriage storage, and a sun visor.  The sun/rain visor does a very good job of actually blocking the sun (too many strollers seem to miss on this point): it can come really far forward, so if youre jogging on a hot sunny day or a misty rainy day you can provide you child with a decent amount of cover.  The seat padding is nice, and seems pretty rugged.  There is a nice amount of mesh venting on the top and rear of the seat for hot days.  The foot rest is basic but it gets the job done well enough.So not what you want as your only stroller, but if you are serious about jogging, I dont know of a better jogger, especially at this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KF5C4BZ0QI7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNTHH2C#wasThisHelpful","R2KF5C4BZ0QI7P","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this to do some over-seeding of some bare spots in my lawn.  I had already dethatched the lawn.  My soil is fairly compacted, so I was curious to see how it did.  I put some new top soil down on most of the lawn but I picked one good sized spot and left it bare to see how important that was (though I did loosen it a bit).  So far it's pretty early.  I've just started to get some sprouts.  The bare areas are definitely seeing less new grass but they growth I'm seeing is acceptable enough.  I'd definitely recommend combine this with soil amendments if you've got hard ground, but it's not a ""must do.""I can't comment too much on watering because it's been fairly rainy here mixed in with just enough sun to keep the ground warm but not dry it out.  Pretty much perfect seeding weather.  Compared to previous years this seems to be performing better than other seeds I've tried, but the weather is really lending a hand here so I'm not sure exactly how much credit I can give to the Scott's grass seeds.  I think it is safe to say if you follow the instructions and provide adequate water you are going to get good results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ERLCNFNMBQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ZXLA5U#wasThisHelpful","R30ERLCNFNMBQE","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two elementary schooled aged boys who are really, really, really into Minecraft.  It's my preferred game for them as well, since the emphasis is on building things rather than fighting.  They've also started to get into using things like command blocks, Redstone ore, and hacks which is introducing them to things like basic programing and digital electronic theory.  There's just one problem.  And that's me.  I'm really trying to keep up, but we have four kids, two of them toddlers, and it's all a bit much.  They have a couple of ""everything you want to know about Minecraft"" books but they are either too basic or poorly organized for me to get much use out of (though my kids have poured over every page).Enter ""Minecraft for Dummies.""  The ""Dummies"" books are produced by Wiley, a major academic publishing company.  So this isn't just a book written by some enthusiastic Minecraft fans.  It's a book written following a very successful methodology honed through thousands of ""Dummies"" books and backed by a large professional editorial staff.  And that shows in the organization and completeness of this book.  So not only is the content thorough, it's organized intelligently and backed by a detailed index.  There's nothing worse when you are trying to find information than leafing through a book.  When I'm looking for something I want an in-depth index that will take me where I need to go, and this book provides that.So who needs this book?  Well, if your kids are just getting into Minecraft, this may or may not be the best place to start.  If your kid reads around age 7-10, a better choice would be the Scholastic series of official Mojang books, starting here: Minecraft: Essential Handbook: An Official Mojang Book.  It's not as complete, but it's a lot more accessible.  There's a whole series covering more specific topics and my kids loved them (make sure you get the Scholastic ones, there are some crummy copycat versions).  On the other hand a kid reading age 10 or above who is technically inclined may prefer this book.  Definitely adults and older teens will be able to pick this up and get started more quickly than with the Scholastic books.But there is another group that can benefit.  One that doesn't play, or rarely plays Minecraft: parents.  Partly that is thanks to ""Chapter 17: What Every Parent Needs to Know About Minecraft.""  It covers things like the different versions of Minecraft, using it as a teaching tool, and most of all, keeping kids safe (since there are online multiplayer options).  And as a parent, I can say being able to figure what my kids are doing using the other 20 chapters, is invaluable.So yes, this is a great book for beginners, but it's also a great book for all those parents like me, who are trying to figure just what the heck it is our kids are doing in Minecraft.  So even if you buy the Scholastic books for your kids, I'd suggest buying this for Mom and Dad.  And at some point your kids will be ready for it too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TSE06PVWVZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118968239#wasThisHelpful","R33TSE06PVWVZV","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a number of Fisher-Price Imaginext toys.  We like them because they are solid, safe, and usually don't require any batteries.  The kids love them: they always have a couple of ""surprise"" elements that keep them from getting boring.  This Spong-Bob ""Food Truck"" keeps up the tradition of being really well made.  It's very compact, and more appropriate for younger kids than some other Imaginext toys.  For most of their toys I would put the best age at 4-6.  This one is easily accessible to three year olds.  Though you might  pull off the flag on the top for younger kids, it's just going to get lost anyway.While this is appropriate for younger kids, they are less likely to be into Sponge Bob.  For older kids who watch Sponge Bob, I think this toy is a little basic.  If they are really big fans of the show or movie, this still might be worth your time.  Otherwise I'd probably go with something a little more interesting.  Probably the most popular Imaginext toy we've bought was this one: Fisher price Imaginext Black and Red Pirate Ship.

"My wife and I have four kids.  We saved so we could each take around six months off so one parent would be home for the first year (we both normally work full time), so we both got to have a fair bit of hands-on baby time.  After making plenty of mistakes during the first few months we got to a point where we felt like we had gotten the whole baby thing down fairly well.  To get to that point, we read or perused a number of baby books and found a few that were helpful, but in a ""three star"" sort of way.  Up till now if pressed, I pointed people to Dr. Sears book, but always with a few caveats.  I appreciate his approach, but I wouldn't say I agreed with everything he said.  I also think it's an approach that doesn't work for every parent and child.  DeSouza's book was the first one I've found that I would feel 100% comfortable recommending to another parent.Frankly I never would have touched this book had I not read an interview with her.  The fact that she is a ""celebrity nanny"" would make me doubt that she was passing out anything other than faddish advice.  However based on the soundness of what she said in her interview I sought this book out.  Our youngest is three years old, so we are past needing this book, but I was intrigued by how closely her advice meshed with our own experience about what worked and what didn't.I greatly appreciate that she's not laying down a dogmatic system of care.  If I had to summarize it would be ""follow the baby (but take care of yourself too)"".  None of our kids were the same, and we found we adapted our care accordingly.  She's one of the few people I've read that really seem to get how little babies actually feed and sleep.  My wife read this and remarked that she really wished she had read this before our first born (who nursed like no baby we've had since and rarely slept) - she thought it would have saved her a lot of confusion about what he was doing (compared to what the books said he should be doing).  It wasn't until she joined a new mom's group at the hospital that she started hearing the *real* stories about babies vs. the magical ""typical babies"" in all of the baby books.  We've yet to meet that ""typical baby"".And that's what this book give you: sound, practical advice you can use with real babies.  The kind of baby you are going to have.  And she writes in a manner that conveys to you the confidence that if you trust yourself, and respect your baby, things are going to go just fine.  Rather than some unrealistic ""routine"" she describes how to create a ""pattern of care"" built around your babies rhythms, and the rhythms of the day.I still recommend getting a book authored by a pediatrician (such as Dr. Sears or Dr. Spock), more as a reference for health advice than anything else.  But this is the book that will get you through those first months with confidence.  Yes, she was a celebrity nanny, but I've come to the conclusion that she really, really deserved her excellent reputation.  She was also a maternity nurse, and you do get that sense of roundedness that's missing from some of the ""non-expert"" books out there that sometimes pass out blatantly unsafe advice.  I've never before felt the need to endorse a ""baby book"", but if you're having  a baby, this is the book to have for those early care months.  And the tools you develop in those months will carry you forward for months to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGVISD8FUUZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451650922#wasThisHelpful","R1KGVISD8FUUZK","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are using a regular toothbrush then you aren't doing your teeth a favor.  If you buy a good quality electric toothbrush you can really improve your teeth and gum health.  I've had a number of these over the years and this model seems as good as any of them.  The main competition for Phillips is the Oral-B line of brushes.  Consumer Reports did a comparison a few years back and found the best models from Philips and Oral-B to be fairly equivalent: the both do a great job of getting your teeth clean.  There was a small but measurable difference between the high and low end brushes from Philips and Oral-b, but even the cheapest brush is much, much better than a traditional toothbrush.  So dont bust your budget buying the top-end brush.  I compared this to my wifes Diamond Clean brush and both seem to clean equally well, though that is a largely subjective opinion.In the end I prefer the Oral-B (if only slightly), which has a spinning and vibrating brush: though I have no evidence it helps, the spinning brush just seems to make sense to me.  My wife finds that the Oral-B is too rough and loud (and it is), and prefers this Philips, which is just a vibrating brush.  Though I prefer the Oral-B, I think most people would rather have the Philips just because it is a lot quieter.  Either way it's a major improvement over a manual brush.

"We've had four kids over the past 9 years so we've never quite ""un-baby proofed"" our house.  Between baby gates that didn't live up to our expectations and gates wearing out over the years we've manage to go through a number of them.  This Munchkin gate stands out both for being functional, easy to install (5-10 minutes) and for looking fairly nice.  The handle works well with a button easily manipulated by adults and older kids but way beyond what a toddler can manage.  The auto close feature works well and this is a must have if you have older kids: they inevitably forget to close the gate, so you really want an auto-closing gate.  This gate has a metal bar that goes across the bottom which makes it much easier to mount it in a stable position without having to pull out a drill and mount it to a stud.  The tradeoff is that it's a minor tripping hazard.  For most people that is a decent trade off, but if it doesn't work for you here is a wall mounted gate that we like: The First Years Everywhere GateI think the price is fair for what you get, but if you like the gate but you're on a budget (or just don't like the wood) we have this gate which is very similar (similar enough that I wonder if this gate isn't actually built by the same company): North States Industries Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, WhiteOverall this is a nice, effective gate that looks better than most of the gates out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZ2YCNZEG0I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INT0Y7O#wasThisHelpful","R2PZ2YCNZEG0I6","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I have four children, so we've gone through a lot of swings over the years.  We occasionally use the swing to entertain a baby so we can cook, clean or grab a shower.  More often we use these for the ""mid-day nap"" and nights where the baby has a cold (the seat keeps them upright which can help prevent ear infections, minimize post-nasal drip and the swinging motion can help settle them if a cough wakes them up).  For this, I've found that these large Fisher-Price makes are the best swings. They are the most comfortable and they last for years.Let me tell you about the things that matter when it comes to baby naps in these swings:1. You can plug it in so you don't have issues with batteries failing in the middle of nap time.2. It's soft and comfortable.3. It swings from side-to-side.4. It's safe.Let me tell you what doesn't matter:1. It plays music and has other sound options (they don't help - get a nice CD of waves or rain instead).2. It has toys for babies to look at (I just take them off.  I find they agitate little babies and distract older ones).3. What the ""theme"" is: babies don't care.Some of these swings (not this model) have a set of toys that snap across their lap with hard pieces of plastic on the side of the swing. These toys are fine for an awake baby, but for naps it's a distraction and the hard plastic piece that holds it in place makes it hard to tap the swing on the side. Tapping on the side of the swing rhythmically is a *great* way to put a wired baby to sleep (you can even just hold your hand so that the swing lightly bumps it).  That very soft ""jolt"" provided by your hand sooths a baby the same way that bouncing them does.  So I don't want a piece of plastic there, I want padding which is more comfortable for me to tap.  This might seem trivial, until that day when you are exhausted, and all you want in the entire universe is for your baby to take a nap.So this model is perfect as far as that goes.  I also like that this version doesn't have the old ""dial"" for setting the swing speed. Those were a little noisy to turn and could wake a napping baby. When you are sleep deprived yourself, anything that helps a baby sleep is gold. So get this model (or one like it, Fisher Price makes a bunch of them) instead, which has nice quiet buttons.Other things I like: the covers come off fairly easily and you can machine wash them (though the swings with the netting in back like this one add a minor amount of hassle - you will need to use a gentle cycle). The cord is well routed: your baby won't be able to grab it and even if they did, the exposed cord is short and has a quick disconnect that can help prevent accidental choking.  They are reasonably portable.  There is a bar in back that you flip up to enable the legs to fold together so you can fit it through doors.  Once you get it to your new location it snaps easily into place.  It's a little awkward to move but it's not heavy.Make sure you shop around the different models Fisher-Price has out: these swings change very little if at all over time.  Mostly they just change the theme, so you can save money by buying last season's model.  They also sometimes charge more for a more popular theme.  Remember: the baby doesn't care.Overall these are the best swings on the market, and I highly recommend having one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPWS9YL50VP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFETJLY#wasThisHelpful","R3VPWS9YL50VP6","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We buy a lot of these kinds of activity books.  Most of them we buy just as ""coloring books plus"" for the kids.  Which is to say 75% of what they do is color for fun and 25% of what they do is academic.  That's fine with us - we don't push academics too hard at this age, but it beats having them just in Elmo for the 200th time.  We do occasionally pick out a workbook specifically to teach something, and for that we usually go for a more specific title or set of titles.  Such as when one of my sons really wanted to learn to read and write at a very young age.  We started out with some alphabet and phonics books and worked up to some word books.This is meant to be a broader activity book for use over the summer to prepare your child for kindergarten.  To do it right you need to ready to sit down for 10 minutes at a time with your child twice a day.  Not a big deal if you have one kid.  Maybe a big deal if you have several.After looking it over I think it's good survey and you can get some value by following the format (which is 3 month long sections divided by days).  If nothing else you get a good assessment of where your kid is at.  I think that is particularly useful if you child hasn't been to a preschool with a specific curriculum.  I don't think kids need to master everything, but at least you know where their strong and weak points are.  It also get's them used to the kinds of activities the will do in kindergarten.  That important for kids who have never been exposed to structured academics before.  For the price I think this is a good value.The book is of good quality, not nearly as flimsy as our ""typical"" work book.  Price wise it's fair.  You can get slightly cheaper books (and more expensive ones) but I think it's a good value for what you are getting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFCTMM3FST8MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148381579X#wasThisHelpful","RFCTMM3FST8MA","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have four kids, and as a result, a lot of blocks.  I almost didn't get these, but I have two kids (a 7 year old boy and 3 year old girl) who really love blocks and I love that it's not a computer or TV screen.  Right off the bat, these were a hit.  They've got some shapes that are about bit out of the ordinary, and that really appealed to both of them.  It's not a big set, and that caused a little problem for my kids when sharing, but they worked it out by adding in some of our other blocks.  If this is your first set it's a good choice, but beware: they have some awesome, and expensive block sets.  Price wise these are a little expensive for blocks, but they are novel and very well made.  If you are on a budget I think there a decent and cheaper options, but if you've got a junior architect, there are well worth the money.  They're cheaper than a typical computer game and worth a whole lot more in so many ways.

"The first thing I did was take this over to my neighbor's house.  He's has the Hero4 Black GoPro camera, which is a 4K camera.  Exactly what this card was designed to handle.  There may be a tougher real world test but I don't know of one.  We checked out GoPro's web site and this card wasn't listed on their (very short) list of approved cards.  However we did notice that Delkin was one of only three brands mentioned on the list of supported cards for some of their other cameras (along with Lexar and SanDisk).Still, it's a UHS Speed Class 3 Card (which is rated to exceed the minimum performance as the MicroSD Class 10 cards recommended by GoPro for the Hero4), so even if it underperforms it should be able to do the job.  He mounted his GoPro on his dirt bike and put it through it's paces with the Delkin card.  The video played back flawlessly and looks absolutely amazing on a 4K screen.I looked up Delkin since I'd never heard of them (granted I used to ignore anything that didn't say ""SanDisk"" or ""Lexar"") and it's a US based company that's been around since the mid-90's.  It looks like they do a lot of industrial memory products along with consumer products.  Seeing that they are one of the few brands recommended by GoPro and having verified it can handle their top-end 4K camera I feel safe in recommending this product.  This may be overkill if, like me, you aren't shooting 4K video, but if you are in the market for a card you may want to look at this and other Speed Class 3 cards - they aren't that expensive and it offers some future proofing.  If you want to play it safe you can go with the Sandisk 64GB Extreme MicroSDXC UHS-I Card (SDSDQXL-064G-A46A) recommended by GoPro for their Hero4 Camera.  If money is no object then the SanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB UHS-I/U3 Micro SDXC Memory Card SDSDQXP-064G-G46A should be on your radar based on their excellent reputation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SEIYR8H2AVSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQX1GK6#wasThisHelpful","R2SEIYR8H2AVSL","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Speck case on my iPhone that I'm pretty happy with so I put this on my wife's iPhone which had some no-name cheap case on it.  Right off the bat it was clear how superior this case was.  The fit was perfect, and it provides just enough of a lip over the screen to protect it from a flat fall.  The interior is stamped with ribbing which provides a little extra shock protection and will minimize scratching from any sand or debris that get's inside the case (as opposed to a flat interior where the sand will constantly rub against your case).Now my wife spent about $20 on her cheap case.  Is this worth the extra cost?  Well it's definitely a well made case, and the iPhone 6 isn't cheap, so on one hand it's worth buying a decent case.  However if money is tight I think a cheaper case will do the job, just not as well.

"I have to admit I was dubious about the price of this thing.  I'm used to getting screen protectors that cost much less.  But then I found them to be mediocre and had kind of given up on them.  Still, I have small kids and I thought I'd give this a try to see if was really better than the cheap ones.  It is - by a long shot.  It goes on much, much easier than those cheap ones that you're constantly trying to smooth the bubbles out of.  The tabs on the top and bottom make it pretty much idiot proof.  The key is to clean your screen really, really well before installing it.  You don't want to trap even a single grain of sand between the cover and your screen.  I had no trouble at all getting my case on over this.  And it is crystal clear.  Once it was on I couldn't tell you it was there.  I've only had a week, so I can't comment on how well it protects, other than so far so good.

"This was a big hit with my black-hole obsessed seven year old son.  He's read it from cover-to-cover at least a dozen times.  It's clearly written, well illustrated, and provides the right level of information for elementary aged children.  What I like most is that it takes tough concepts and presents them clearly.  Not ""dumbed down"" just ""boiled down.""  A lot of easy to follow analogies are used that work well for kids.

"I won one of these at a school raffle.  I thought I would use it as a kids laptop - all it would need to do is run Minecraft and a few other basic games, access some kid web sites and run a word processor.  I am happy to report you can run a word processor.Okay you can access kid web sites.  Or you can run a high-end internet security suite with parental controls turned on.  But I haven't had much success doing both.  Though perhaps the long ""staring at the screen waiting for it to load"" experience could teach my kids what the internet was like back when it was delivered via a 28k modem...  If you don't have kids, and can settle for a little less ""internet security"" armor turned on, this is fine for web browsing.  But as soon as that virus scanner kicks in, it's time to go get a cup of coffee.Games.  Forget it.  After some tweaking I got Minecraft to run at pretty much the lowest settings possible.  The frame rate was in the low 20's.  Minecraft on ""high"" settings doesn't look that great.  On low settings it's pretty much pointless.  So having determined it wasn't going to work for kids, I looked around at some old games I had sitting around to see what would run on it.  If there is one good thing I can say is that this has a CD/DVD drive, which is being less common at this price.  You are going to need it to search out a game that will run on this laptop, because the first game I could get to run at passable settings was a five year old game called ""Risen"", which was only playable at low settings.So that made me curious, what is wrong with this laptop?  I did a little research and found out the basic problem is the CPU: AMD E1-2100.  This is a combined CPU/Grapics chip.  The graphics is provided by the integrated Radeon 8210.  A mediocre graphics chip, but one at least capable of running basic games like Minecraft.  Except that Minecraft is known to be CPU limited, and the CPU on this, is a 1GHz dual core chip based off their ""Jaguar"" low-power CPU architecture, just isn't up to the job.  It's not a bad architecture (a version of it is used in the Xbox One), but you need at least four cores running at 2GHz to make a decent laptop.  The slow dual-core CPU in this laptop ranks along side the CPU in an iPhone 5.  Great for a smart phone or even a Linux tablet.  Not so great in a 15 inch Windows laptop.The build quality is about par for the price range.  At this price point I think Acer and Asus make a better product than HP.  I do favor HP and Lenovo at the $500 and up range.  I appreciate that it has full sized ports unlike a lot of thin ""ultrabooks"" and has Ethernet and USB 3.0 ports.  I also like that it has buttons for the touch pad.  Battery life is decent: I easily got 3-4 hours of web browsing type activities before I got a ""low battery"" warning.As long as your a prepared to forgo anything but basic gaming, this is a passable light weight ""web browsing"" notebook, but for the price, there are better options that will at least allow you some basic ""app level"" gaming without having to drop your settings to the lowest possible level.What would I buy instead?  Prices change fast so this could go out of date fast, but as of the time I wrote this I would suggest one to these options:HP Pavilion 15-r030wm Intel Pentium N3520 2.17GHzToshiba Satellite C55D-B5241 AMD A4 15.6-Inch Laptop","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXM9NDS6P6U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZK06OE#wasThisHelpful","RGXM9NDS6P6U0","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Twenty years after discovering my first Terry Pratchett book I'm still always on the lookout for his next book.  There was a time when I would order them from England because they came out six months before the U.S. edition.  That's not to say I've loved everything he's written, but I have loved most of it and considering how much he has written that's no small feat.This is a collection of stories dating back to a story that first appeared in Terry's high-school magazine in 1963.  As such you run the gamut from brilliant stories most people will love to stories that are more for serious fans who enjoy watching his writing evolve.  There are both Discworld and non-Discworld books in this collection.  Having read it I can say this is a true must for Pratchett fans.  Again, not every story is gold, but some are teaming with the wit and brilliance that keep bring us back to Terry.  I especially enjoyed a couple of Discworld stories from the 90's.  That's when I first discovered Pratchett and the tone of the stories took me back to the fun of pouring over those first few books.I also really enjoyed bits like ""The High Meggas"", a story written in the mid-eighties that was the genesis of the ""Long Earth"" series that he co-authored with Stephen Baxter.  And in ""Rincmangle, The Gnome of Even Moor"" you'll find early elements of both ""Truckers"" and ""Rincewind"" from the Discworld series.I would not pick this as my starting point for Pratchett (the classic starting point is ""The Color Of Magic"" though I prefer ""Wyrd Sisters"" or ""Small Gods"").  But anyone who has read a few Pratchett books will have a good time here, and for any serious fan, this is a must, full of new gems and stories that will take you back to that first glorious Pratchett book.

"I got this to replace an older Linksys EA6900 AC1900 wireless router.  My experience with that router wasn't great though it did improve after many months of tweaking and several firmware patches.As with my previous Linksys router, set up was very smooth.  I find the Linksys router interface to be decent.  Not great, but I can find what I need without too much trouble.  The main selling point of this router is that it is supposed to be great for larger families like mine: unlike dual-band routers which have one 2.4GHz and one 5 GHz band, this has an extra 5 GHz band.  All three of these bands can operate at once.In theory this is great: a wireless band has to run at the speed of the slowest device on the band. With two 5Ghz bands, your fast devices can use one band and your slow devices can user another (the router dispositions these).  This also distributes the load so one band doesn't have to carry all the traffic.  Meanwhile your older, legacy equipment can still hang out on the 2.4GHz band.What I found was that the range was really good, but when I ran throughput test the results were... mediocre.  I can run the same tests on my neighbor's older Asus AC68u and get much higher throughput.  Especially on the 2.4GHz band.  Granted these are two different houses but they are by the same builder and have similar floorplans with the routers located in the same basic location.  Now, for most people this doesn't really matter, but if you are going to spend $300 on a router you want it to mop the floor when you compare it to a $150 router.Now to be fair, the Asus has been around for a while and the bios has been pretty well tuned.  The AC3200 is new and performance will improve as Linksys releases new bios updates (which the router will automatically download).  So if you have a big family with lots of newer wireless devices this may be a good long term investment.  But if you are looking for the best performance you can get today, this is probably not your router.Overall I'm still pretty happy with this router.  It out performs my old router and despite being new I haven't had any technical hiccups (in my experience most new top-end routers are not that stable).  Just make sure you value what this has to offer (support for lots of users and better performance as time goes on) before you spend you hard-earned money on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQNNA3FDNZOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON7AX3U#wasThisHelpful","R1NQNNA3FDNZOV","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After switching over to Bosch I've given up on cheap wipers.  I've used both the Bosch Icon blades (which cost a little more) and the Insight.  For me the performance seems to be about the same, though the Icon's do seem to last a little longer.  If the Icon is on sale when I need a blade that's what I get.  Otherwise I go for the Insight.Like pretty much any wiper you get the installation is easy enough.  These are vastly better than the cheap wipers they'll put on for you at an oil change place.  If you live any place with a lot of rain, you are going to want these over some super-cheap wiper that's not going to get the job done.  Overall a great wiper that's not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36NCVH1V1DBVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ4LS#wasThisHelpful","R36NCVH1V1DBVY","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my kids and I have not been disappointed.  Overall is a really well built laptop for the money, though it is a little under-powered.  The Intel Celeron in this model is basically a high-end Atom CPU and it based on the new Bay Trail architecture designed for tablets.  So for starters, think of this as a high-end tablet with a big screen and keyboard.  Thats not really a bad thing.  You get really good battery life (they claim six hours, my kids are getting around that) out of a pretty small battery (3 cell).  That helps keep the weight and cost down.  The graphics are only suitable for web browsing, Office-type programs and basic gaming.  Anything like Minecraft and similar App type games are fine.  You will not be able to play anything close to a new, high end 3D game on this (though older 3D games will run okay).What this is really built for is basic web and productivity apps.  This is a great laptop for a student, because you can be sure they wont be off playing games on it.  And if they break it, you arent out much money.  The screen is not 1080p (its 1366x768) but you dont really notice it much: it has no trouble with HD movies.  It is NOT a touch screen.  Frankly there are no good touch screens this size in this price range, so for me that is a plus (good touch screen 15 laptops start at $500).  Note that there is *NO* DVD or CDROM drive.  Again, for kids this is almost preferred, because they tend to just break them.  Theres not much out there you cant download (in fact Ive grown to love Amazons software download service because the program stays in your software library on Amazon which makes it easy to re-download when you buy a new computer).  You can buy external drives for about $40 (I have one, but I havent had cause to use it in years).  This should only matter to you if you have old software thats on CD or DVD or wanted to watch movies that you had on DVD or Blu-ray.This laptop has wireless (including Miracast which allows you to wireless transmit video to many TVs and set-top boxes such as Fire TV) and plenty of USB ports.  It does not have Blutooth.  Thats not a big deal for me, as Ive never had a reason to connect Blutooth to a laptop, but if you had a reason to want Blutooth then you are going to want to look for a different model.  It has three full sized USB ports (including one high-speed USB 3.0 port).  It also has a full-size Ethernet and HDMI port.So why buy this?  For the price of a 8 tablet you get a 15 screen, full Windows support, full size ports (instead of mini or micro ports you cant find a cable for) and a much more powerful CPU.  No its not as powerful as an core i3 laptop but frankly theres not much more you can do on an i3 that you cant do here (youll enable a few more games, but its still not a gaming laptop).  If you want more power youll really want to bump up to a Core i5.  To be clear if 3D gaming matters to you a $800 Core i7 is pretty much your starting point.  But if you are looking to find a good basic laptop Im not sure you could do better at this price.  And you are definitely going to have trouble finding this kind of battery life in a laptop at this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J7IFFOVQZBJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RD8HFXM#wasThisHelpful","R3J7IFFOVQZBJP","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I took it out of the box I knew one thing: the sound would be terrible.  It was clearly too small to put out much sound.  Hooking it up was easy.  It's Blutooth so just make sure you have Blutooth turned on (PC/Phone/Tablet/Whatever) and hit the one button on this device.  A few second later you see it on your playing device and you're up and running.And the sound is... decent.  Considering the size... amazing.  It's much better than what my phone or laptop speakers can put out.  Now it won't compare to a nice stereo, but for the price and size it does a really good job.  I played music on it for well over two hours on a medium volume setting and on battery without any problems.  You can connect it directly to laptop USB port if you want to power it that way.  Overall for $19 this is a great value and an easy to share music on your phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6O02ZBVGY4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7XTWDG#wasThisHelpful","R2A6O02ZBVGY4M","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have four kids: ages 3-8, so we were right in the target range of this reading program.  For your money you get access to a 1 year subscription to their reading activities.  You can run it off just about anything (PC, Mac, tablet) but we stuck to a good old fashioned PC.Our kids have just started on this and they are (so far) interested and engaged.  Your typical 3 year old is going to need help with this, but beyond that most kids can handle this pretty well.  Our 7 year old is a really strong reader and he isn't getting much out of it, but I can see where this would have helped his older brother a lot when he was younger.  Regardless of whether they are learning anything, all my kids like to play with it.  I think the ""optimal"" age for this is 4-6.  Old enough to be comfortable following along with the rules and with enough attention span to follow through with it.There are a ton of activities, so I can see it being worth the price.  Still as a yearly price it's not cheap, and it's not obvious looking at this page that you are only buying a subscription.  This package also includes a story book but I'm not sure it's worth the extra $20.Overall a good product and certainly a far better use of screen time than just sitting in front of a TV.  If you've got a 4-6 year old who's not that driven to read this might help get them jump started.  If you've got a 7 year old who is struggling with reading, by all means try this out.  If your child is already a strong reader I'm not sure you are going to get a lot out of this, but again, there are worse ways they could be spending their time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJ7SAAIZ96CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2KAI2Y#wasThisHelpful","R2FJ7SAAIZ96CU","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a small, fairly portable document scanner.  Good for a small setup or anyone who wants to avoid clutter.  Two things to know:1. It doesnt come with a power adapter, instead you power it via a USB cable.  If you dont have a newer USB 3.0 port you will need two USB cables: one for data and the other for power.  You can alternately purchase a power adapter.  For some this is a pain, but I love that I can connect and power this thing with one USB3.0 cable.2. While it will scan without loading the drivers off the disk it will work better if you install the Canon drivers.  Canon has a lite version of their CaptureOnTouch software that can run directly off the scanner, however to enable all of the features you need to install the full drivers off the disk or download them from Canon (go to the product page on Canon and click on the Drivers and Software link.Functionally it works well and will get the job done for a small office or home use.  If you are scanning documents all day you probably want something with faster throughput, but if you are just looking for a portable document/card scanner with a small footprint this is a pretty good option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U55XT813C3UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPRQW86#wasThisHelpful","R2U55XT813C3UY","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a large family so we end up putting a lot of mileage on our printers.  After discovering years ago that Canon printers were faster at printing PDFs than HP (a big deal when my wife was in college) we switched primarily to Canons.  HP has since fixed their PDF printing problem but Canon remained our ""go-to"" printer brand for home use.This MG6620 is a really good printer for your typical user: somebody who prints only occasionally but needs support for a wide variety of print sources (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone) and some basic ""office"" functionality (namely copier and scanner).  Note that this model doesn't have a fax, but there are fax services which let you scan a document and fax it (such as efax, HelloFax, and FaxZero).  For the price you get a fast text printer, a good scanner and copier and a decent photo printer.  The footprint of this printer is reasonably small so a student should have no trouble fitting this onto a small desk.  It is a little noisier than I'd like, but it's by no means the nosiest printer I've ever owned.For $50 you can bump up the Canon MG7520 which will bring you slightly better spec that most people will never take advantage of:MG66205 Individual Ink Tanks100 sheet capacityScanner= 1200x2400Max Print Res= 4800x1200 (Color) 600x600 blackMG75206 Individual Ink Tanks (adds a gray ink tank which is supposed to help ""balance"" text and photos)125 sheet capacityScanner = 2400x4800Max Print Res = 9,600 x 2,400 dpi (Color), 600 x 600 dpi (Black)Feature wise this printer is pretty standard.  Which isn't a bad thing: for not much money you can buy a really good multifunction printer with a smartphone/tablet printing app.  I do really like the new interface on the Canon photo printers (HP is doing something comparable).  It's more intuitive than what they've done on their office printers.  All-in-all a printer that does pretty much everything a typical user will want to do for not much more than the price of filling up your car with a tank or two of gas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35W94233RHYJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGRDK#wasThisHelpful","R35W94233RHYJ9","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never been one to bother with a gym.  When I was in the army we had no problem getting a good work out without expensive equipment and that's kind of informed my thinking ever since.  However with a growing family it's not always easy to get in a good workout.  So I've had my eyes open for some basic equipment that would allow me to expand the range of exercises I'm doing.I decided to try out these resistance bands.  Now I've never used them before, so I can't really compare them to anything else.  I can say that I was quickly able to find ways to get to muscle failure much faster than with my old basic workout.  I'm also finding I'm able to expand the range of muscles I can exercise, which is good I suppose, but it does mean more aches...Getting up and running with these is simple.  You've got two bands and a door anchor.  It takes just a few seconds to put the bands on and get going.  I did go to the Perfect Fitness website and under ""Workouts"" they have a special section on using bands.  I printed out a six page brochure that shows a good range of exercises you can do.  For twenty bucks you can get a pretty good workout.  For the money it's a pretty nice setup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDDAM82YXQ1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW0V2EW#wasThisHelpful","R1NDDAM82YXQ1V","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have four kids, so I've been through a lot of wipes.  These are not bad as wipes go.  I find the size and thickness to be perfect.  The package is durable and so is the adhesive flap.  In fact I'd go so far as to call the packaging the best I've seen in a soft-pack that doesn't have a plastic lid.  I've used them on our toddlers and they don't seem to bother their skin.  I've wiped them on my face, arms and hands first and I didn't have any reactions.  I've tried them on my kid with allergy and eczema issues and they didn't bother him either.My main problem with these wipes is that I don't like how they smell.  I usually buy unscented wipes and they generally don't smell like much.  These wipes have a strong smell that I do not like (something like a household cleaner smell).  I can still barely smell it on my fingers but it's not enough to bother me anymore.  Still that alone makes me not want to buy them.  Why when I can pick up something that doesn't bother me?  Now smell is a rather individual thing and I'm not a fan of scented anything, so what bothers me may not bother another.  Still, I'd suggest if you are picky about how things smell this may not be the best choice for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRGCMJS1BURO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXARZ8C#wasThisHelpful","RSRGCMJS1BURO","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've used Aquaphor for years as part of our care for our son's eczema under the direction of his dermatologist.  He's mostly grown out of it, to the point where we rarely need things like topical steroids, but we still use Aquaphor and Cerave to treat dry spots before they get worse.Aquaphor is our first stage of defense and it does a good job.  If we catch things early enough a few treatments usually does the trick.  Depending on how he's doing we will alternate with Cerave.  We've also used Aquaphor to help prevent diaper rash on our toddlers if we happen to run out of Vaseline and it does a pretty good job.  Overall Aquaphor is one of our go-to products.However the ""Touch-Free Applicator"" on this leaves a lot to be desired.  It's no less messy than a normal tube and since the lid isn't flip top you can't use it one-handed.  Instead you have to use one hand to take off the cap, squirt out some ointment and then put the cap back on.  If it's just you, that's a minor hassle.

"I live in the Pacific Northwest where it is cloudy and gray for much of the year.

I instantly found the default light setting too high so I turned it down quite a bit.  Ive found over the course of a week that Ive been able to turn it up, though still not on full.

"This is my second Kwikset 913.  I got this one for the door that leads to my garage.  I had previously installed a 913 electronic lock and a matching handset on my front door.As for the installation of the lock: if you are modestly handy this won't take more than 30 minutes to install (assuming you are replacing an existing deadbolt).  The instructions are reasonably clear, better actually than the handset I installed.  I found it helpful to Google ""How to install a Kwikset 913"" first.  Watching a walk-through video will make things go that much quicker.  I chose to use the SmartKey feature to allow me to keep my old house keys, but thats optional if you prefer to use the new set.Its a nice convenience to have the keycode option, especially if you have little kids in the house.  I no longer have to sweat being locked out by a toddler when I run to the mailbox, or when Im taking my toddlers out to the car one-by-one.  I dont have the autolock feature enabled right now, but I can see that being handy once my kids are older.  For me the real winner is that I can create a code for the family and a separate code for the local college kids we hire to help get the kids ready for school.  Since they are students they tend to last a year or two before school or a real job takes over.  So far we havent had any bad apples but if we did it would be nice to know we can change a code without having to worry about a key.  I think that would be enticing to anyone who has any kind of domestic help coming into the house.Probably the only negative I can give it is that its a little loud.  Ive checked out other brands and that just seems to be par for the course.  If you live in a high crime area these locks just arent as secure as a regular deadbolt.  If thats an issue your may not want to stick with a top rated manual deadbolt.

"If you are looking for something a little edgier than your typical cookbook, this is a pretty good choice for you.  The authors embrace a trend I greatly approve of, which is moving away from pretty and excessively sweet desserts and focusing on flavor.  While not quite a savory desert book, is does lean towards a more rustic and European style of baking, with a heavy dash of ubran hipness.  For example their espresso-burnt sugar shortbread recommends you use Stumptown's Hair Bender Expresso and Stumptown Cold brew if you can get it.  Unless you live in New York or Portland, those are probably a little hard to come by.The recipes range from simple to complex.  The photography is good, and for particularly complex steps (such as making pie dough by hand) there are special sections with step-by-step instructions and photographs.  So while not really for the novice baker, any modestly skill baker will have no problem using this cook book and my wife and I have found it to be a nice way to ""up skill"" our baking a bit.Overall this is a great cookbook for people looking for something a little different without getting into crazy-complex baking.  I do wish they included weights, but not many recipe books do so I can deal with that.  For recipes I really like I end up weighing the flour on my first batch and put sticky notes in and adjust as I go along.  Mostly I just deal with it.  I'm not a professional baker and I'm not trying to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PLLS3S85V9FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373892950#wasThisHelpful","R2PLLS3S85V9FZ","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you have a coffee table then you may not really need this table, but it does allow you to move the fun from one room to another.Its a small starter set and I can already see needing to get a few more pieces.  However its the perfect size for trying this out.  I have twin three year old girls and I am going to need to add some more pieces right away.  If this is for one kid you should be fine for a while.  While the block pieces are really sturdy, the table is just okay.  I would not get this for a young toddler who isnt standing comfortably  its not strong enough to reliably support their weight.  Overall this is a really good construction toy that kids will just love.  For the price I think its a really good deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R9ASI6DH9CUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C94C1YS#wasThisHelpful","R2R9ASI6DH9CUU","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive got four kids: two boys and two girls.  And each one has wanted to beat stuff up as a baby.  Mostly me.  So its a good idea to find a nice hammer type toy for them, and this is a really nice choice.  I like the whole look of it.  Im not so sure it matters that much to a baby or toddler, but it certainly looks nicer than some of the plastic junk Ive had around.  Its got really good tolerances: the pegs are just tight enough to hold in place without being too hard for a baby to hammer and see some progress.  I really like that you can just flip it over and start again.  I had one toy (Melissa and Doug I believe) that involved pounding a ball through a hole.  Invariably the ball would get knocked off the toy and I would have to find it and put it back.  Or some of the balls would get separated during cleanup and Id have to track them down.  Or worst of all, an older sibbling turns the ball into a TV seeking projectile.  So having a toy that can be hammered, flipped, and hammered again without coming appart is a nice convenience.  For the price you are getting a toy that looks nice, works well, and seems to satisfy that young need to clobber stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EVXHQVCUMGN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZHC1GC#wasThisHelpful","R1EVXHQVCUMGN2","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two daughters, and while Barbies arent too high on their list, mermaids are, so I thought Id give this a try.  Like most Barbies the construction is okay: far better than what you get in a dollar store, but not nearly as nice as something like an American Girl doll, but then its a whole lot cheaper too.My daughters did indeed like the whole girl that can change into a mermaid deal.  While not an instant favorite it has been integrated into their regular play with the Mermaid Girl coming by to visit with their other dolls.  If youve got a kid really into either Barbies or Mermaids this is a sure winner.  If you are looking for a doll as a gift this wouldnt be a bad choice since you kind of get two dolls for one.  I have noticed however that Barbie in general seems to be on the way out with girls.  I think the look is a bit 1950s and kids seem to be more interested in dolls that are a little more up-to-date.  So while this is a good doll for the price, youre may be better off getting something along the lines of an Elsa or Anna doll.So a good choice for a Barbie fan, and not a bad choice for most girls, but not exactly a slam dunk winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSDDRUGB3RC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVOUEE4#wasThisHelpful","RWSDDRUGB3RC6","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have seven or eight of these Laser Peg sets and the kids have had a good time with this one.  For us Laser Pegs are a great creative play toy, pretty much Legos with lights.  We like that they that can entertain all four of our kids and it's something they can do together.  Any kid old enough for Legos can handle these.  My kids enjoy just having a box of these to play around with, so they don't stay a separate set  for long.  My kids had a good time playing with the car but it's just mixed in the bin with the other pieces now.  These are really just an extension of their Lego toys - a way to light them up.This is a good enough starter set.  It's not too expensive and it's fun to play with.  So far the hands down favorites were the Laser Pegs 6-in-1 Monster Truck Building Set and the Laser Pegs 57-in-1 Dragon Building Set.  If you are just starting out with Laser Pegs I'd get the Dragon set first, but this is definitely a fun addition that will give your kids plenty of fun and creative play.  They are a little pricey, but it's cheaper than a video game and much better than having them sitting in front of a screen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AU0SU0OSRW82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6EYMA4#wasThisHelpful","R3AU0SU0OSRW82","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice compact all-in-one.  The emphasis here is on compact.  This thing is much smaller than my Canon MX922.  Feature wise it's pretty much the same except for the lack of a second paper tray.  That means with any paper size switch you need to change the paper.  If you spend 99% of your time printing one size that's no big deal.  If you do switch paper sizes a lot you probably want another printer.  The tray it does have is generous for the size of this thing, easily holding 150 sheets of standard 24lb all-purpose printer paper.It has all the features I would consider ""standard"" in this class: printer/copier/fax/scanner, built-in wireless, easy-to-use touch screen and printing from your phone or tablet.  Ease of use wise I find this as easy to use as my Canon and easier to use than the HP in my office.  I did some quick side-by-side comparisons and the print quality looks as good as my Canon.  My Canon printed a color photo faster but the Epson was a tad quicker printing high quality text.I think the footprint of this makes it perfect for a student or anyone with limited space - for you this is a Five Star printer.  If you've got the space getting something a little bigger with two paper trays is probably a better option.  If space isn't problem this is more of a Three Star printer: good, but not remarkable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6E2XOKTNG1DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV8QC2K#wasThisHelpful","R6E2XOKTNG1DB","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have four kids, but none have hit their teen years.  I did however have a teenage nephew live with me for a while many years ago and that showed me how little I really understood teenagers.  I would have though the experience of being a teenager would have been sufficient, but really it wasn't.When I started having kids of my own I read What's Going on in There? : How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of Life and watched Baby Human: Geniuses in Diapers and it really transformed my approach to child rearing.  All of sudden I felt informed.  Not that you need to accept everything as given, but having a science based reference point really just makes things easier.  When you understand the mechanics behind a tantrum, it's a lot easier to keep your cool.  When you understand how the brain develops you start to understand eating habits and how to make healthy, age appropriate choices.  Not that I'm trying to be the perfect parent, but perhaps because my wife and I are engineers, we like to understand ""what's going on behind the scenes.""So I was pretty excited to get this book and I haven't been disappointed.  Again, I'm not saying this is the last word on teenage parenting, but giving yourself a better understanding of what's going on inside their head and why really does make the whole process easier on you and on them.  Let's face it, teenagers can be half-crazy intolerable beasts at times and the sweetest, kindest people on earth the next.  This book gives you some reference as to why their sleep patterns shift, why they eat the way they do, and what's really going on in terms of brain development.  And we are talking about development.  Teenage brains are still completing the work that I used to thing was done by kindergarten at the latest.  I really wish I was armed with this information when I was looking after my nephew: it would have made me a better guardian.The book covers a lot of ground, but it's well written with an enthusiastic tone.  I would encourage any parent to read this.  If nothing else you'll come away with more reasons to keep calm during the stormiest teenage moments and in the best case you'll be better equipped to manage or avoid them.  Oh and the talking point tips would have been handy to me if I had them and I expect they'll prove useful in the future.  Even if you don't use them verbatim (I probably wouldn't) at least you have a starting point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9HE3TKW0EU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062067842#wasThisHelpful","R2J9HE3TKW0EU4","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have four kids.  I've gone through a few baby baths, and none have been ""perfect.""  This one isn't bad with mostly good things to say:I like that it has two size options so you can start off with the baby in the smaller insert and then step up to the larger tub.  The shape of the smaller tub is really good: it positions the baby's head into a stable position and the baby's bottom rest against a stop to prevent slippage.  There are little drain holes that are modestly effective.  If you use too much soap it will get a bit slippery.  You really need almost no soap for a baby, so if it feels slippery, you're using too much soap, or the wrong kind.I think the larger tub isn't quite as well designed but it works well enough for a baby that can sit up and be reasonably stable.  If you have a low tub, you probably won't need it as a tub much, but if need be I think it would suffice through the first 12-18 months or so.While not as cushy as some padded baths we've had, it cleans up way easier.  And babies don't notice if they are briefly sitting on plastic thanks to their chunky bottoms.  Sprinkle them with warm water and coo at them and they're happy.  As long as you have a tub that can keep the baby upright at a good angle, you've got 99% of what you need out of a tub.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJHJOJC0WDI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP8AC7K#wasThisHelpful","R2KJHJOJC0WDI4","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an okay sketch book but I think it's overpriced.  I long ago gave up trying to decode the arcane minutiae of paper weight, but there are differences between how different types are measures and ""50lb"" doesn't mean it's always thicker than ""25lb"" paper.  That's definitely the case here, were the paper feels no much heavier than a sheet of 20lb copier paper.  If you are looking for a light weight sketch book for jotting down an idea in pencil, this will service.  I would not bother with pen, marker or charcoal.  The paper has little texture and too much bleed through.  If you come across this pad at a 1/2 price sale it's a good value.  At the full price there are better options.  If in doubt, head down to a store an touch the paper.  Once you find a brand you like, stick with it.  This pad is being consigned my 8 year old who will make good use of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RW4PO80CXHYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSEAUAS#wasThisHelpful","R2RW4PO80CXHYK","A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IBKN1GXYJ3K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a couple of these Laser Peg sets and this has proven to be a great addition.  For starters Laser Pegs are a great creative toy, think Legos with lights.

My kids seem to enjoy just having a box of these to play around with, so it didn't stay a separate set  for long.  My son built a car.  The wheels don't roll all that well but it was fun for the five minutes it stayed a car.  Now it's part of some kind of transformer looking dinosaur thing.  All I care about is that he's using his hands and imagination instead of sitting in front of a screen.I think as a starter set it's okay, but maybe not the best ""first set"".  We have about six other sets but the hands down favorites were the Laser Pegs 6-in-1 Monster Truck Building Set and the Laser Pegs 57-in-1 Dragon Building Set.

" 4:51 Mins First lets cover the size chart..yes its  a bit weird..but it is right...use the weight chart. I weigh 202..my size on here is 4XL when I normally wear an XL. Now the jacket is awesome...used it the morning I shot this video when  I went mountain biking with a buddy of mine. It was around 42 degrees when we left and I felt comfortable for the 3 hours we were out. The jacket breathes well but also keeps you warm. The elastic on the waist is great..plus the front is cut a little higher to avoid material getting bunched up while you are on your bike. The back is a bit longer so it stays down on your pants better. The elastic around the sleeves was great too..it stayed over my gloves with no issues at all. Yes is is a left handed zipper..that is no mistake...its a cycling jacket. The zipper is easy to use and doesn't get hung up. Perfect! All in all I am impressed with the jacket and can recommend this one if you are in the market for one. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

" 5:03 Mins I've been using shakers and separate infusers for years now..I love them...girlfriend loves the infuser a little more than I do but I will make cucumber water every now and then...her on the other hand..everyday! My thing is the shaker...for my protein/creatine shakes. Now...we have bottles that incorporate all. My new go to bottle. Nice hand grip on the outside..easy open/close lid that actually seals..infuser..shaker whisk ball...Awesome! Even comes with a sports bag...very cool.If you can screw a lid on a jar, you can figure this out. All of the parts are twist on lids or attachments, anyone can figure this out. The infuser itself isn't required nor permanently built in. It can be removed for if you just want to use it as a regular water bottle for a time. The loop at the top of the bottle is very sturdy, I attached it with my backpack and had no issues whatsoever.The shaker whisk actually blends my protein shakes with no issues...way better than the old plastic ball I have in my other bottles that leave clumps ..this one doesn't and its easy to clean.We have ordered more for our friends and family...great gift ideas too! For this price you aren't going to beat having all 3 in one bottle with a bag...Like I said before..my new GO TO bottle for the gym.

" 5:39 Mins This headphone is nice and sleek. Very clean and easy to use. Overall I am loving them, especially that the call control buttons are conveniently placed on the headphones and gives vibrations when you get incoming calls. The sound quality is quite impressive for these..They are durable, strong and able to do functions like the bluetooth and phone calls. You can actually walk away from the bluetooth device and still get a nice sound. It's loud enough and has about 80% noise cancellation. That I need because when I'm in my zone I dont like to be disturbed. On the headset itself, you can turn the volume up and down, track fwd track bk...nice!! The battery life is AMAZING quality, and lasts throughout an entire jam session. All you have to do is pair up the bluetooth with your chosen device, turn it on and go for it. It is simple to use, comfortable and attractive looking. The ratcheting earbuds are awesome...click the button and they retract back into the headset...no dangling wires and earbuds when you are not using them.

" 4:35 Mins This is a wonderful Aroma essential oil diffuser. The black design is awesome...and you can still see the lights in the ring and the top..very cool.  It has mist, light and high/low button. Basically there are two main modes. Mist and Light. You can set mist high/low intensity. For mist, you can set the timer for 60, 120, 180 or ON. The green indicates which option is selected. The light changes the color into 7 different colors/shades.The diffuser is very well made. It is durable and sturdy. I recommend reading the user manual. It requires cleaning and little care. Make sure when you drain the water, you drain it from the correct side. You can add few drops of essential oils. The mist keeps the place scented and calming. The diffuser is great to relax and calm down the atmosphere around you. I use essential oil diffuser everyday in just about every room in my house.The mist also helps for dry cough, dry skin, sinus. It purifies and works as a humidifier to improve the quality of air and makes breathing easy. It really really helps in winter. If you have a diffuser on in winter, you do not get the dry nose when you wake in the morning.Please watch my video for my full review.I would highly recommend it because it works perfectly.A Very high 5 star review from me.

" 4:43 Mins So far I like it a lot, it is small, great to hang on the outside of my backpack.. good sound for its small size, easily pairs with my phone.  The rubberized encasement looks durable and likely to survive a drop. The ports have rubber flaps to seal out moisture. It has external power, volume and previous/next song controls on the outside edge around the circumference of the speaker but I find it easier to use my phone for those functions after powering it on and pairing. While using it you just have to be careful how you grab ahold of it since the controls line the outside rim around the circumference. Either use a light touch to pick it up or grab with fingers on the front and back. The sound quality is awesome..deep bass and the mids and highs are strong..Pretty impressive for the size. Hang it in the shower...sounds even better!! Built in mic too?? yes!! Took phone calls outside the shower just fine...didnt get any calls while in the shower so I cannot comment on that. No connection issues either..pair it and it stays paired. Nice !!!

" 6:27 Mins The sound quality is amazing...and extremely comfortable headphones especially for its price point. Device pairing is very simple and best of all there is automatic pairing for devices you've already paired. Alternatively you can just go the old-fashion way with the 3.5 mm headphone jack.The sound on this baby is pretty amazing as well for its price, my only quip here would be that it doesn't have noise cancellation, but this takes nothing away from the experience. It's capable of going very loud so you may want to keep that in mind for your ears' sake and for the peace of those around you as they may hear what you're listening to.Being able to easily accept calls while using it is also an added benefit...no disappointment there.  Very good call quality and its range is decent as well...walked around my entire house with no issues.For the price these will be hard to beat. They are comfortable and sound great.

The stitching is well done and the zippers are heavy duty...plus they don't snag...nice! With the large zipper pulls it is easy to get in and out of the bag quickly and effortlessly.

I wouldn't worry about dropping it or anything. Its easy to use...4 led lights shows how much juice is left in it and a single button on/off switch. It even comes with a handy little LED light you can plug in...great for reading... This would be excellent for a long weekend trip or to even keep in your vehicle for emergencies. I ma giving this a very high 5 star review as it does exactly what it is advertised to do and with the smart charging it wont over charge your devices. Perfect!

" 4:19 Mins I'm quite into my music, and I like trying and buying a range of well-regarded earbuds and headphones to make sure that whenever I listen, I'm getting the best possible quality sound. No need to waste my good years listening to sub-par sound, or missing depth and detail in my favorite music! All of which is to say, I have quite a few headphones and earbuds and I like listening quiet and loud, while exercising, mowing the lawn, working, cooking or at work.I like full bass. Hearing the lowest bass merely mentioned in the range of sound isn't enough. It can't be blaring and distorted, but it can't be just a hint. Lots of cheap and mid-priced earbuds/headphones can make reasonably crisp highs, but the real trick is getting a full-bodied bass out of a little tiny driver.Now, down to the headphones. I use my phone (Galaxy) and listen to the same tracks to compare apples to apples. These hit a homerun. The sound quality in all 3 ranges is there..nice lows/mids and crisp highs.  Furthermore, they fit comfortably and are well-balanced  and the added bendable over the ear hook is great. Perfect for when I am being very active in the gym...they stay put and I don't have to spend a bunch of time putting them back in...perfect! This is easily a 5-star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y60AANF1NR03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMZ746#wasThisHelpful","R2Y60AANF1NR03","A2SWGQVH78I33R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SWGQVH78I33R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:50 Mins For an ""on the ear"" style headset I have to say I ma pretty impressed with these. The sound quality is pretty nice for a pair of headphones in this price range. The drivers in these provide a pretty well rounded sound. Now I do have a 3rd party EQ app on my phone so I think that helps with the lower ends..When I ran the drivers through my tests for distortion these played well...no distortion at pretty high volumes...id say higher volumes than I would recommend ever listening to music at.  They paired easily and stayed paired. I didnt have any issues with walking away from my phone around my house. Another cool option is having the cord...you can plug these in to any 3.5 mm jack and use them. Nice if your battery is getting low. They charged up fast and I used them for well over 7 hours now and I still have power. Three buttons on the side are easy to use and easy to find when they are on your head. No head fatigue to report. They have enough pressure to stay on but not too much to hurt after wearing long periods of time. Really lightweight.

"I have to say up front this was the first time we had used a product such as this Cupider. Everything worked fine after removing the white tab inserted in there to keep it from coming on during delivery. ( battery included)  The vibration bit is near the small handle also where the power button is. Click it on and you're ready to go. The vibration was indeed strong enough to feel throughout the entire vibrator. You have 3 speeds and by doing a long hold on the power button you turn it off. Easy to operate or even change speeds during its use. It hits the G spot very well I might add. There isn't much to hang on to after you start playing..The bit that sticks out the end where the button is, is really all you have to have move it around with...It gets the job done though and added a very nice zing to foreplay..It is indeed waterproof and easy to clean. For the price and fact that it works so well I am giving this a 5 star review and can recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPT69M4HWBBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XA1QZ4#wasThisHelpful","R2DPT69M4HWBBL","A2SWGQVH78I33R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SWGQVH78I33R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me begin with saying that I have been taking Omega 3 Fish Oil as a supplement for 10 years. I take it for the same reason most of you do -- it has been identified and proven to good for your health and heart. There are so many benefits to taking Omega 3 that they all can't be listed. Over time fish oil products have been getting better and better -- meaning that they have been containing higher levels of the good stuff (DHA and EPA fatty acids). One of the main reasons I use fish oils is to aid in muscle healing after weight training.The issue with most fish oils softgels is the after affects -- fish tasting burps or fishy breath. I have acid reflux and many times fish oil softgels don't sit well. Well,Omegaboost Omega-3 Fish Oil adds a nice twist to their soft gels by adding Lemon Oil and a thicket Gelatin for better digestion. After several days of use I can claim that I have not had any fishy burps or other issues. Even sniffing the inside of the bottle is not as strong fish smelling as other brands...All in all...

"I happened to run across this product through a fellow work-out buddy. I was noticing that after several weeks, he seemed to be upping his game when it came to how much he was lifting and endurance on the treadmill. I had to ask what his secret was. That is when he introduced me to this product. I was of course skeptical like everyone else. Perhaps it was just supercharged caffeine or a product that was habit forming. I wanted to avoid anything like that. But he insisted it was nothing like that. So what's the harm in trying in out for a few days, right? Well it was the best decision I could have made. All I can say is that now I take this product regularly and it has definitely upped my own game in the gym and in life in general. If you have been feeling sluggish and stuck when it comes to performance in life, at work, at the gym and at home, then I definitely recommend you take this product. It's all natural, non-addictive, and basically just a daily supplement to give you an edge.

"I have been a gym rat for over 8 years, but I have always limited my supplements to only Whey protein and creatine until recently. Then I decided to give SHEER STRENGTH BCAA Capsules a try after doing some research.. The bottom line, these BCAA supplements worked really well for my body after about 2 1/2 weeks of use. I usually work out about 4 times per week for 1 hour of intense circuit training followed by a 20 minute stretch and cool down. Near the end of the first week, I could tell my body wasn't as sore as it used to get and my endurance on the treadmill was getting stronger each workout. I've read on various forums from other gym rats that take anywhere from 12-20 grams of BCAA supplements. So all in all, I guess it depends on how hard you work out as to how much to take and my recommendation is to take Whey Protein for the other 6 remaining Essential Amino Acids. I do need this supplement to help my body recover after lifting heavy weight. This definitely helps speed up the muscle recovery process; instead of being sore for three days I may only be sore for two days and I have no bad side effects to report either after using this product.

"I have to admit I have been working out for over 8 years and while I never thought much about a pre workout drink mix I was intrigued to see the effects. I took this for the first time last Sunday before hitting the gym and while driving to the gym I started feeling a burning feeling in my arms and legs..kind of tingly more than burning...It reminded me of the after affects of taking Niacin. This lasted about half way through my  one and half hour long workout...Maybe longer but I didnt really notice once I got a full pump and my workout was getting more intense. Did I have an increase in energy? Yes I think I did...I was stoked by the time I got there. Not many supplements do that for me anymore. Now this does have a dose of creatine and also your BCAA's for helping in recovery...All in one shot. The scoop is small but it packs a huge punch. Its tart tasting but mixes well in a shaker bottle. After taking this for a week now straight I am satisfied in the product and get the same results every time I take it. Tingly feeling you can feel all the way down your legs...extra boost of energy and the other 2 most important supplements you can take while training...creatine and BCAA's. Nice!

"If you serious into getting the results you want at the gym, then BCAA and Whey Protein should be the two top supplements on your list.  I got more serious into working out in late this year after a long hiatus and knowing from the past that I needed BCAA to help with recovery. I gave this a shot.. I noticed immediately that I was able to lift more with less soreness the next day. Those are primary hitting points for any BCAA - Less muscle fatigue and speedy recovery. It is not an exact science though as far as what I am experiencing. There are many variables to consider such as eating right, other supplements, and intensity/duration/repetition of workouts. While I believe this product works, you should always do your research because at the end of the day, it is still a SUPPLEMENT.

I'm always looking for a libido enhancer, so this was great!Looking up horny goat weed, it has soo many other uses. Horny goat weed is used for weak back and knees, joint pain, osteoarthritis, mental and physical fatigue, memory loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, bronchitis, liver disease, HIV/AIDS, polio, a blood disorder called chronic leucopenia, viral infections of the heart, bone loss after menopause, weak bones (osteoporosis), and as a tonic.Some men use horny goat weed for sexual performance problems including erectile dysfunction (ED) and involuntary ejaculation.

"DHEA supplements are used by some people who believe they can improve sex drive, build muscle, fight the effects of aging, and improve some health conditions. DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone produced by your body's adrenal glands. These are glands just above your kidneys. DHEA functions as a precursor to male and female sex hormones, including testosterone and estrogen. Precursors are substances that are converted by the body into a hormone.I am in my early forties and wanted something that would give him an extra boost. I recently started working at a new job which consists mostly of physical labor and I was coming home completely drained. I've been taking DHEA for a little while now and am starting to feel the effects as of a week ago...It gives me more energy and I can definitely endure much more physical activity.

" 7:13 Mins As usual I am very impressed with Senteys products. We have keyboards, mouse, headphones, headsets, bluetooth headsets..on and on all from Sentey and once again they have provided a very nice, stylish and great sounding headset. Please watch my video for my full review. I love the brushed aluminum look of these and they are quite comfortable wearing long periods of time..no head fatigue at all over a 4 hour period of wearing them.  Just enough to pressure on ear pieces to keep them on and block out ambient noises but not cause the head fatigue I have experienced with other headsets. The drivers in these are amazing sounding...nice mids and highs and even the low ends hit pretty good. It does help if you have a EQ on your device to adjust this...I pushed them to their limits and got no distortion at all from these. Highly impressed with that. The inline cable works great although you will get more functions on the buttons when using this on an iPhone vs using it on an android or windows phone. The mic worked great...I took a few calls using them and everything functioned as it should. I am highly impressed with this headset and it will continue to get plenty of use so if anything changes during that time I will update my review.

I put my very heavy Canon camera with an equally heavy lens on this thing in every position..make sure you have the camera facing one of the legs if you want to put much forward lean on your shot...it will topple if you don't.  The legs lock with a very easy clip system and the tripod has very few plastic parts. The majority of it is made out of Aluminum.  For the price you can't get better. I own a couple very expensive tripods and I am excited to say that this little guy will be in my travel pack or hiking pack for sure!

" 5:16 Mins This is a great product for everyone who has ever suffered a knee injury, have weak knees or play a lot of sports. Unlucky for me I have had knee problems since I was in the Army many years ago and I play a lot of sports and weight train to which i always have to wear knee support. I also walk about 8 to 10 miles a day for the post office carrying mail.  I currently use few kinds of knee support, it depends on what I am wearing on top and what I will be doing to chose which knee support I will wear. So when I was offered this knee sleeve for discounted price to test and review I was very excited. I fall in love with this knee support the first time I wore it to work. It is amazing. I gives you great support yet doesn't feel too tight. It is very breathable and doesn't get sweaty...A huge plus for me. There was a bit of bunching after I wore it for 8 hours walking the streets delivering mail..I dont consider that bad..What I do is an excessive amount of walking. I expected that. Overall I am very happy with this sleeve and would buy it again if I had to. 5 stars from me on this one. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

"Excellent Product. Period. This beard oil softens, tames and conditions my beard with BETTER THAN EXPECTED results! It also conditioned the underlying skin, leaving my face feeling smooth and hydrated. I worked the oil in on both a dry and wet beard. The results were the same, although a wet application seemed to yield quicker coverage. A little goes a long way. My beard is very coarse, so I was surprised at how quickly this oil SOFTENED and eliminated the wiry, wild hairs. The amber bottle protects from UV and there is no leaching of toxins like you would get from a plastic bottle. Amber glass is the perfect bottle for oils. The lid stays on tight too...don't worry it won't leak out in your overnight bag fellas..Guys with beards get free stuff all the time and this was one of those times.

" 5:49 Mins I have a ton of these little diffusers...I am familiar with them and use them on a daily basis. I have one in every room of my house and keep them running all the time. Since I began using them, I have had significantly less health issues.  Along with being an EO diffuser, they also work as mini humidifiers as well! The quality of this one is great - setup took only a couple of minutes and this runs perfectly every time I turn it on. The balance to it is great, so it doesn't easily tip over if you accidentally brush against it. The size is nice too - you can keep it most anywhere - at home, in the office, even into a hotel room, with no issues. You have options of having the LED light turned on - or not - while you are using this. You can also select whatever color you want to have it on AND whether you want it to be the bright or the dim version of that color. Or you can just let it continue to rotate through all of the colors. So you can make this fit wherever and however you want it to. I love all of those options, because many EO diffusers do not offer all of those options. Overall I am really pleased with this!!!If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

"What attracted me in the first place to Old Rons beard oil is the fact that it's organic and completely natural, leaving no room for any side-effects or issues. The oil came well-packaged and comprised of a combination of essential oils... When used in such a combination and after a little bit of research, it becomes apparent how these oils are essential to promote both hair growth and to provide replenishment to the hair. A little of the oil goes a long way and applying it to the beard, leaves it being very soft, gentle and smooth. It has eased the skin irritation that I normally get during the cold weather days...My skin under my beard is crazy sensitive and dries out easily...this oil takes care of that and I don't have any goofy smells..Its perfect. The eye dropper is very easy to use and the lid stays on which is important..I have had oils leak on me..this one does not. The green bottle is perfect too...protection from UV light and no leaching of chemicals like a plastic bottle would produce.  A very high 5 star review from me.

" 7:13 Mins As usual I am very impressed with Senteys products. We have keyboards, mouse, headphones, headsets, bluetooth headsets..on and on all from Sentey and once again they have provided a very nice, stylish and great sounding headset. Please watch my video for my full review. I love the brushed aluminum look of these and they are quite comfortable wearing long periods of time..no head fatigue at all over a 4 hour period of wearing them.  Just enough to pressure on ear pieces to keep them on and block out ambient noises but not cause the head fatigue I have experienced with other headsets. The drivers in these are amazing sounding...nice mids and highs and even the low ends hit pretty good. It does help if you have a EQ on your device to adjust this...I pushed them to their limits and got no distortion at all from these. Highly impressed with that. The inline cable works great although you will get more functions on the buttons when using this on an iPhone vs using it on an android or windows phone. The mic worked great...I took a few calls using them and everything functioned as it should. I am highly impressed with this headset and it will continue to get plenty of use so if anything changes during that time I will update my review. As of right now..a very high 5 star review from me on the Sentey ThorX headset with mic. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

" 8:47 Mins Please watch my video for my full review. This little tripod is pretty amazing. It is very lightweight and folds up into nothing. I put my very heavy Canon camera with an equally heavy lens on this thing in every position..make sure you have the camera facing one of the legs if you want to put much forward lean on your shot...it will topple if you don't.  The legs lock with a very easy clip system and the tripod has very few plastic parts. The majority of it is made out of Aluminum.  For the price you can't get better. I own a couple very expensive tripods and I am excited to say that this little guy will be in my travel pack or hiking pack for sure! The only issue I had with it was the one single knob to control pan and tilt..I would like to see separate knobs for that. Outside of that I am giving this a 5 star review...

"Let me start by saying I have about 15 bottles of beard oil..I have very dry skin and I love my beard..I have to take care of it. When I first got this bottle I wasn't impressed with the plastic clear bottle..or the pump style top. The pump works...the eye dropper style is a lot easier though...there is a reason most companies put their oils in amber bottles..Protection from UV and other types of harmful light and Glass will not react with the essential oils or leach and release any sort of poison and toxins into the product. Reason for knocking one star. The oil on the other hand is very tea tree smelling..Very minty. Be sure you like that before ordering this. I don't mind it but it isn't my favorite. The oil itself works great..it kept my beard soft and manageable. Most importantly it kept my skin from drying out and itching. It has all of the essential oils in there that most have. I will add it to my oil arsenal and use it. I am happy with the product just not the bottling. So a 4 star review from me. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

" 7:33 Mins Looking for a bad*ss backpack? This is the second bag I have ordered from ArcEnCiel..Ill tell you right up front for the price..this is hard to beat. This bag is tough. I have packed this thing tight and lugged it around the range..tossed it, ran drills in it, slammed it...it has held. There is plenty of molle webbing on it too..I had about 5 molle attachments on this and they all stayed put. Please watch my video to see my full review of everything you get in the backpack itself. The fact that they have this backpack in multiple colors and camp patterns is awesome too....My buddy got one of the camo ones after seeing mine at the range. He loves it. Everything about this bag is tough...the stitching, the webbing, the molle system the zippers..I have no doubt this bag will outlast me. The H style shoulder straps are great too...keeps it from falling off if you are getting crazy running drills...the extra padding is a plus too..you have shoulder padding and also a lumbar pad for your lower back.

" 5:00 Mins I was looking for a nice heavy overnight bag and I actually ended up using this bag as my gym bag...I love the heavy duty canvas and leather and the added heavy buckles. I pack a lot of stuff in this bag and use it everyday. I went over the stitching the best that I could and the buckles and they all seem to be sewn on well. That is usually where most bags fail..right where the straps are stitched on. SZone has never failed me in the past and I have a few of their bags. Everything I have got from them has been very high quality. This bag is no exception. I can pack it on my shoulder or just use the hand straps.. The leather is always of high quality as well. I just love this bag overall...Perfect size for the gym or even if I wanted to pack for a weekend. I would even take this camping with me..I have other canvas bags for camping but this one would work for that too. I am giving this bag a very very high 5 star review. It is made with care and the quality is outstanding. If this bag is not your cup of tea then check out there other bags..they have a ton and i'm sure something that will fit your needs.I say that because I have a few of them and they are all excellent.

" 5:42 Mins For over a year I've been testing different bluetooth headsets to find the best product for my needs. I primarily use the headset when working out, and working in the lawn, and I listen to audiobooks and music. Noise cancellation and stay are big factors for me. I'm pairing with an Galaxy s3 and I've had zero cut out with these and I have used them for the last week and a half, everyday. Typically, I've been forced to have my phone in my front pocket and on the side of the earbud receiver to avoid cut out- With this unit I've not had any cutout in back pockets.This microphone is nearly perfect, after having multiple calls with the unit, I've never had a complaint and generally I'm told that it is clear that I'm on a headset but there's no cut-out or excessive background noise.Noise Cancellation I've tried active noise canceling headphones for lawn equipment and airplane noise. In addition, I've tried the in-ear units. For me, I think the in-ear solution does as good of a job to block external noise. Once you properly size the buds, these do a good job of in ear cancellation--like ear plugs.Stay in the Ear....It is important to size the buds correctly and use the the ear wings. During very strenuous workouts I have lost one...I think a set of over the ear hooks would benefit these but I am not knocking a star for that...I was being very aggressive when I lost one. Outside of that they stay in the ear very nicely. The sound quality of the drivers are amazing as well...they seem to have some much needed lower end notes that most headsets dont have in the price range. The sound is very balanced. The voice prompts inside the headset are nice as well. Overall I am very satisfied with this headset and they go to the gym with me everyday.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

"We were looking for a good massage oil and since we have several other products from Luseta we decided on this one. I have been impressed with everything they have had to offer and this one is no exception...the oils are not only great for your skin but also as a couple we enjoy giving body massages...we have tried others in the past and to be honest...If the oil is crap then the massage doesn't go well...kind of defeats the purpose if you know what I mean. Now we haven't used this in our hair per se...but it can be used there. Honestly it has been used solely for the massages...Its a Win/Win for us and the oil does its job. We love it. A very little goes a very long way so for the price is spot on and we will order more. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

"I have several of Lusetas products and I have to say I have been impressed with every single one of them. Thier shampoos and conditioners are elite in my opinion and at a very good price. I have short hair and it works great for me...no itching, flaking and leaves my hair super soft...now my girlfriend on the other hand has long hair....middle of her back long..She said she noticed an immediate difference after using this shampoo and conditioner...easier to comb through and very manageable for her. She has used many high dollar products on her hair in the past & after using this she said she will never go back.We also changed shampoos frequently in the past because my scalp would begin to itch. I've had no such problems with this shampoo. I can honestly recommend this and any other product by Luseta. Another 5 star review from me.

"I really like this Bear Oil. It's become part of my routine to add it to my beard in the morning and I do notice a difference. It does make my beard feel softer, which I like, but even more important my girlfriend likes that it's softer. Then it has a subtle smell that I like too. I make a point to apply it last to my mustache, so that that area has less applied to it and then I'm not only smelling my beard, if you know what I mean. But again, the smell is subtle and some people might like it more heavily applied to their mustache.I was worried about the size of the bottle and that it might get use up quickly, but after a week of using it I've not notice that the fill level has gone down that much. That's nice to know, since I don't want to be ordering it too often. It kind of reminds me of my cologne; it's nice and it lasts for a while. Definitely an amenity you want to keep around. It makes my beard and skin feel softer while giving it a pleasant and subtle aroma. I am giving this a very high 5 star review...it works great and last a long time...a little goes a long way.

"If you are looking for a great oil that will make your beard shine and promote growth without any fragrance then I can indeed suggest you give this a try. I have well over a dozen beard oils and balms in my arsenal and this is one of my favs...The pump top is awesome...most come with a dropper..this one you just pump some in the palm of your hand and spread it through...Now I use a beard comb so once I get it in the beard I can distribute it more evenly...This has a very faint smell of all of the oils that are in it but it is not overpowering...its just right.

"This stuff is the great! I've tried other products that was okay & was about to give up beard conditioning when I decided to try this beard butter.. This Beard Balm breaks down quickly in your hand & a little goes a long ways. I had bought another brand of Beard Balm & it didn't break down quickly in the palm of my hand & a couple hours later I noticed flakes on my shirt that looked like wax. I must put too much of that product on. That happened twice & tossed the product. This stuff doesn't get waxy like the other brand. There is no doubt my beard is softer to the touch. This stuff is the real deal. It changes the consistency of my face-hairs to the point they're actually manageable and soft enough to ""style"" if that's a thing. Before, I was kind of at the mercy of how I trimmed my beard, and it was a constant struggle. This formulation really allows you to manage that facial hair.

"My first actual beard in over 20 years and I needed a comb when it started getting thick..this seemed to be the ticket after reading reviews. I got the comb in a few days ago and it has done what it is supposed to do...it easily works out any little tangles I have plus its just good for your beard. I use ti to work in my oils...it seems to spread the oils out more evenly. The wood seems a little brittle so I would be very careful if you have a super thick beard...I have read before about other brands snapping in half..I would put to much pressure on this one either. The ends a little stabby for me..My neck is really sensitive though so I have to be careful when brushing down my neck...it pokes a little...nothing to knock a star off for...its just my neck..very sensitive there. The bristles seemed to be spread out perfect for my beard and my stash...goes right through and distributes my oil or wax I am using. I am giving this wooden comb a 5 star review as of right now.

" 5:24 Mins Please watch my video for my full review. Key things I like about this headset. This headset is very unique in design as it folds up kind of like a pair of sunglasses. I have another set that is like this but it doesn't fold. However I like this because it stores away nicely and doesn't need a huge box to keep them from getting damaged.  The sound quality is excellent and even the mic. Very easy to use and pair with your device. Stays in my ears comfortably. The buttons are easy to find with your hand and easy to use after a few times practicing which buttons are which just by feeling for them when it is around your neck.

" 4:27 Mins Please watch my video for my full review. This light is has been a nice add on to my video lighting arsenal. The battery and charger are awesome because it makes it cord free..I can move it anywhere I want mounted to my tripod and I don't have to worry about cords. Its LED so the power consumption, even on high, is low so the battery lasts for hours. Its also dimmable ..perfect! On its highest settings I can add light to my project from up to 8 feet away...Of course the closer you are the brighter and more harsh the light will be. The 3 filters are going to help with that though. The clear filter will just knock off the harshness if you are using it up close like I do for product shooting. The other 2 provide warm and cool effects to your light. All in all I am extremely happy with this light...It does exactly what it is described to do and it it works perfect for what I need it for.

"I'll be honest with you guys, I haven't used a condom in many years. I have recently needed to start using them again and I was in the market and doing my homework..A lot of years had passed that I had not even payed attention to them to see what is even out there. I got the chance to test and review this product and it was perfect timing. This is one of those things I guess we put our faith into that it is going to work.  As far as ""ultra thin"" goes I can say that I had a lot more feeling with these than the ones in the past. So that was a huge plus for me. That extra layer always seemed to take so much away from the ""feeling"". In a way that can be a good thing if in the end you can still feel enough to manage to finish. With these I really had no issue with that. They stayed on properly, they were thin enough that I could still very much feel and in the end and most importantly, they worked! It is very cool to read the backstory on this brand as well. For the price I am giving these a very very high 5 star review.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

" 2:32 Mins Now I am sure there is a million uses for this towel but we are avid camper/hikers and this is perfect us. The fact that it stows away so small in its own bag is awesome. Use it, let it dry, put it back in the bag and go. I can hang this bag off of my hiking pack on the outside and with the mesh it will help dry it even if I have to go before its completely dry. This towel is huge and soaks up tons of water. The added hand towel is great too. It does soak up water a little different than cotton towels..but I have had these towels in the past and I already knew that. Not that is soaks it up any less it just feels different. Three times more compact than similar size cotton towels! Take it everywhere with you as it doesn't take up much space. Even more impressive is how fast you can dry the towel after use, almost 4 times faster than regular towels. Just hang it outside for a few minutes and you can quickly use it again. Although large when spread out, it weighs less than 8 oz .Super-lightweight. The towel itself has a sewn-in loop so it can be attached to a small post, shower rod, chair leg or small branch to permit it to dry...all in all this worked great for us for camping and I am ordering 2 more for us.

" 4:35 Mins If you're looking for a mid-level headset that won't break the bank, this would be a smart purchase. Ive used many other mid-priced headsets and the this eTopxizu model is among one of the best of them. Since this is a regular 3.5mm headset and not USB  there are no need to install any drivers and it is compatible with all devices.The ear cushions are very large and generously padded. I wore them for a couple of hours listening to music and playing games and did not feel any discomfort at all. This is because it fits completely over your ear, causing less pressure on your head. No my son wore them for over 6 hours the first night and he said they were pretty decent..He games on steam and said he had no issues with the sound or the mic while gaming online. The microphone works well and people were able to hear me just fine. It rotates as well so you can move it out of the way when not in use. The bass on these headphones are amazing. Explosions feel like youre really there. Gunshots are clear and crisp.Overall, this is a very high quality headset that won't put a dent on your wallet. If you're a new or casual gamer, this is a good headset to start you off on your gaming adventures. 5 stars from me.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

" 1:56 Mins I have looked at these bracelets in the mall and put them right back down after seeing the price. Well over 20 bucks for these. So I was shocked to see the price on this one and the quality of it when I got it in.  The leather and the rope make a great match on this with the alloy copper colored clasps. Everything flows together real nice. This looks great with jeans and t shirt which is perfect for me. I am giving this a very high 5 star review because it is well made and looks great!

" 3:28 Mins We needed a good light for my sons sheet music as he is just starting reading music for the snare drum. Ive been playing for years and I now I have the chance to hand the craft down to my 10 year old son. The snare is set up pretty much in the center of his room and I needed a good light for the music stand..the cool part about this one is I don't have to drag out an extension cord for the light...it has a battery in it and he can clamp the light on the stand and go. It does come with a USB cord and a wall wart kind of USB adapter with a standard US plug on it.....it can be used with those or the battery. Now I know he has had this one for well over 6 hours now while he was practicing and it still has juice in it...all be it he uses it on low mainly. The clamp is strong and of course being a guy I clamped it to everything in the house...it stayed no matter where I put it...very cool. Getting a very high 5 star review from me.

" 1:25 Mins For the price of this light I am pretty impressed at how well the motion sensor works and the brightness of this little guy. The 6 LED lights produce a very bright white light and will light up our entire long hallway... I placed this in several places throughout the house before I decided where I wanted it. I had it in some cabinets and it worked great there, perfect as a matter of fact..even in our walk in closet. I really didnt need it there though so I placed it in the hallway kind of as a night light for my son. As soon as you turn the corner it pops on..very nice. Even with guests coming over and needing to use the restroom and having to walk down a dark hallway it has came in handy..had some guests compliment the light and how nice it was...so it worked well there. The plastic construction makes it lightweight and easy to hang. You can use the double sided tape that is provided or the screws it comes with. I choose the screws. The batteries should last a great while since it is LED and they very little power. I have since placed rechargeable batteries in there and have more charged up ready to go in case these loose power. Excellent little light and I am giving it a 5 star review. It works great! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

" 5:24 Mins Please watch my video for my full review. Key things I like about this headset. This headset is very unique in design as it folds up kind of like a pair of sunglasses. I have another set that is like this but it doesn't fold. However I like this because it stores away nicely and doesn't need a huge box to keep them from getting damaged.  The sound quality is excellent and even the mic. Very easy to use and pair with your device. Stays in my ears comfortably. The buttons are easy to find with your hand and easy to use after a few times practicing which buttons are which just by feeling for them when it is around your neck.

" 3:19 Mins With today's cell phones getting bigger and bigger I was having a hard time finding a good molle case that would fit my Galaxy with a rugged armour case on it. This one is pretty big guys..My phone goes right in..no issues..no issues getting it out either. My buddy saw this and he has a Note 4 which is huge and it fit right in there too...now his does not have a case on it but its a big phone ...he ordered one right away after he saw this one. I have several products from Onetigris and they have all been exceptional so I had no doubt this one would be too. They have a ton of molle system items so check them out if you are looking for anything in particular. The stitching on this is superb as well..heavy duty material and velcro will make this last for a good while. The snaps on the molle straps are large and tough..strong so I am not worried about it coming off. I have field tested this 3 times now since I did the video and it is there to stay..no issues and does what it is described to do.

" 2:55 Mins Having a Bright LED lantern around the house is going to come in very useful. I live in a pretty rural area and we do have some power outages in the spring and the fall..sometimes in the winter too with heavy ice storms. I have always grabbed a few of my LED solar yard lights and brought them in the house at night to carry around..kind of as a candle if you will. This lantern will come in very handy for those situations. Plus we do a lot fo camping and hiking..so I know very well it will get used there. For the price of this I couldn't pass it up. It does run on a  3 double A batteries but LED's use very little power so they should last a great while. I have put 3 Amazon Basics AA batteries in mine that I can recharge. Works great. This is not a chintzy lantern by any means either..I kind of half expected it to be because of the price and I was quite shocked at the heft and the feel of this. Very well made.

" 4:16 Mins I've been using it solid for the last couple of days. So far my impression is that these are amazing. The comfort, sound, ease of operation, consistent reliable pairing. The battery life is long as well. Durability is the only thing pending on this device, it's only been a couple of days of solid use after all. The construction, fit and finish of these is outstanding. The drivers sound great and the mic really cancelled out the wind..I was quite shocked to see that actually worked on a headset in this price range. The fact that I can make a sort of necklace with the strong magnets if I am not using this is great. I can pop them out and they will stay right on my neck until I am ready to put them back in.

" 1:51 Mins This little dual charger is great..the best part is..when you stick it in the aux port on your vehicle..it stays. I had so many of these are sloppy and fall out or don't get a very good connection ..this one however stays put. Plus you have the lights to give you the visual letting you know you have a good connection.

" 5:55 Mins So my son and I both use this keyboard for 2 very different reasons. I use this for editing video, designing websites etc..Him on the hand uses it for gaming. So this keyboard has  got some serious use in the last 2 weeks. I really wanted to wait just a little bit and really use it a lot before I left my review. I ran the install disc...easy..set up profiles for him and I and we got busy on it. It did a day or two to get used to the keys because it is slightly different than the one have been on...that's just muscle memory and after a day or so we were both quite comfortable using it. The keys are pretty quite..actually much quieter than the one I had been using. But they are also a bit softer feeling on the press. The program itself allows you to assign any key and function. Plus you have additional 6 G keys on the side you can program. I can set up profiles for my editing and he can set profiles for his gaming..Lots of cool factor stuff going on here too..the breathing or steady light and 7 colors to choose from is very cool. The letters on the keys are cut out of the black so no chance of the lettering coming off after heavy usage..plus the light goes through the keys. Awesome. We abused this for 2 weeks and it worked great. I encourage you to watch my video to see my full review. I am giving this Scroll K9500 a very high 5 star review.

" 1:41 Mins This 4 pack is excellent and just what I needed. I have about 10 things in my house from headlamps to flashlight that take these batteries and now I can always have a fresh pair ready to go when I need them. I can also pre charge them all and take them with me camping. I always have a few extra laying around just in case. The charger worked perfect on the batteries. put them in, plug in the batteries and forget about them. When the light turns green they are ready.

" 3:48 Mins we use this lamp about 3 days a week..my son and I race hobby grade rc cars and they need a lot of attention...before we got this lamp I was using a headlamp to see all of those little parts we were working on. This thing has came in so handy..More handy that I originally thought it would. Don't have to wear out batteries in the headlamp anymore..its very bright..It is a very bright white light too...my video camera will show some blue but it is not there..that is just my camera settings. The metal pieces that hold everything are very flexible and they stay put...when you place them where you want them...they stay. Very nice. The magnifier and led lamp have been used a lot.  The clip not so much but I ma sure someone can find a use for it. It does pop off if you dont need it there which is cool. The base is a plastic material but has enough heft to it to hold everything up nicely. It does run on batteries as well as being able to plug it in. The LED lights are very low consumption lights so those batteries should last quite awhile. I encourage you to watch my video to see my full review but I am giving this a high 5 star review., It is well worth the price if you need a good lamp with magnifier and clip. Highly recommended.

" 7:01 Mins When I make a purchase of anything tactical I like to field test it before my review...I have this bag at the range 4 times now..Its an outdoor range and things get tossed around a lot more than I would like to admit. But something like this should endure that tossing around. This bag indeed do that. This bag is tough. I had this packed to the breim with gear ..made our one mile hike back to our range and it was comfortable to wear..it got tossed around quite a bit...emptied filled..dug in...everything worked great. The molle system on the back and the sides came in handy too..I had the entire outside of it packed with molle equipment.

" 4:07 Mins I have been around leather most of my life as my dad has worked it for years and its really nice to see a genuine leather bag come out that so well made. This messenger style bag is perfect for me to have around for when I go out on photo shoots..I can store my tablet in there for research..some battery packs and cables and hit the road..I don't have to worry about anything getting torn up in this bag. My gear gets tossed around more than I would like to admit but this bag has done its job well in protecting my stuff. The stitching is generally the first thing I look at when getting a leather bag..it's real leather and it's thick so no doubt that will last...but what about the stitching? This bag is very very well made..Inside and out the stitching is dead on and they used some pretty thick thread too...perfect. I don't have to worry about the strap popping off..I've had that happen on more expensive bags then this one...not good. I have used this bag for the last 2 weeks everyday.

" 4:11 Mins This glowsand stuff is pretty cool. I got my son some of that little micro sand stuff last year and it was a mess..this however cleans up really easy...so that makes my life a little easier and he loves it. In addition to getting this starter kit we got the car crasher kit too. He has a ton of sand to play with and has a blast. Its very hard to describe this stuff..kind of like dough..kind of like sand..With the included glasses and pen that make it glow he has created some cool stuff. Blows my mind how kids can be so creative and the glowing part just adds that much more to it. The tray that they give you is a plus too..easy to keep it all together but really he has had this out on the table and its just fine..like I said it cleans up easy so that its not going all over the place. We store it in a plastic ziplock bag in bewtween play sessions in the box it came in. Works perfect. I encourage you to watch my video review to see my full review but I am giving this glow sand a 5 star review. He loves it and it doesnt make a huge mess.

" 4:18 Mins The four modes that the product description cites are the sequence of lighting from pressing the on/off button successive times. One press illuminates the middle, large light. Two presses turns off the middle light and illuminates the two smaller red side lights; three presses illuminates all three lights. A fourth press puts the lights into rapid flashing mode for emergencies.Illumination, even with a single light on in Mode 1 is bright and relatively wide. It will easily light a path for bicycling or hiking. Using the Red lights are great for keeping your night vision...red light does not dilate your pupils so if you have to kill the light you will still be able to see. The red lights are very bright as well. I am not sure that i would ever use mode 3 which lights up the center white light and the two side red lights.Wearing this is surprisingly comfortable, especially considering that the battery pack contacts the back of your head. That component is made of soft rubber or neoprene and is water resistant. A nice feature is the small green light that is on the back of the pack that provides locational guidance if you are hiking with folks behind you.I did not test the life of the batteries, but since they are 4000mAh each I am guessing that they will stay on around 6 to 7 hours..The included wall charger has a fixed cable with a barrel connector.Overall, this is a handy light set for numerous applications.I am giving the light a 5 star review based on its performance and price.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

" 4:30 Mins I will tell you right up front I was very impressed with this bluetooth headset. I have about a dozen headsets and this one ranks right up near the top of the list for me. The sound quality for calls and for music is really nice. It does block out most background noise but it does pick up wind...I have way more expensive headsets that pick up wind too so I didnt expect this one to handle that much different. It is very lightweight too. Comfortable to wear over 8 hours as I did. The additional ear pieces are nice too...find the one you that is your size and it will stay in all day. I'm pretty active and I had no issues with it at all. The battery lasted pretty well..I talked over 5 hours on it one day and it never went dead. Im sure it was close but it lasted. Everything about this bluetooth is great. The price is even better! A very high 5 star review from me.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

" 5:03 Mins Hey guys I have literally done about 10 car charger reviews on here but this thing is awesome. Let me just say the one I had in my truck, that was my GO TO charger..Is now in the drawer in my house and this one is staying in there. This is a 3 in 1 charger..It does have smart charging so your device will tell it what it needs and it will supply that amp to the device to charge it. Pretty common on today's chargers. However what is not common in this is the Real time TEMP and VOLT metering of your autos battery. Guys I have seen Voltmeters alone sell for upwards of 20 bucks on Amazon. This is built in. And the real time temp reading. it was spot on after it took a minute to adjust to the temp from taking it outside from my house. I did test the outputs on the charging ports with a drok tester and they were dead on.All of this for around 15 bucks at the time of this review. I don't know a dude out there that wouldn't want one of these gadgets in his auto..seriously..Perfect affordable gift idea..My buddies are getting one for Christmas..no doubt. Hey guys a very very high, 5 star review from me. This thing is great for the price. Like I said it replaced my go-to charger in a matter of minutes. Lifetime Warranty too?? You better believe it..Thats a no brainer right there.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. Let's keep making better buying decisions together.

" 5:37 MinsThis one is the biggest LED solar lights that I have out of 4 so I wanted to show you what you are getting in the video. It is a very bright motion light. I have this one installed over my side door so it kicks on when I pull up in the driveway. It lights up my entire driveway and surrounding porch area very well. After about 10 seconds it kicks off. The large lipo batteries charge via the solar panel during the day and I have had no trouble with it holding enough juice to last all night. My security camera system has benefited from this light as well. The side of the house lights up pretty good with this and makes things much clearer when I am reviewing the footage. It has been rained on several times and it is under my gable end where the soffit kinda covers it but it still gets plenty wet when it rains hard and I have had no issues with it. The inside of the battery compartment has a switch..3 modes that you can choose from. A on at night mode, a battery saver mode and a standard mode. I encourage you to watch my video to see my full review. As of right now I am giving this light a 5 star review. Its super bright and does what it is advertised to do.There seems to be some trouble with Video Reviews right now and I will upload my video review when I can.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

" 6:30 Mins We had a pretty expensive 9"" dvd player in our Tahoe for about 5 years and it finally just wouldnt read discs anymore and I needed to replace it. This one being larger and coming with way more stuff at about half the price as the other one seemed to be the way to go. About 2 weeks into having it now and using everyday, it has worked flawlessly. It has a remote, a gaming pad with a gaming disk, a car adapter and a standard us wall outlet to pin style adapter so you can use it in your home or just use it to charge the battery. now we did get about 2.5 hours out of the battery the other day and there was juice left over. I was impressed with that as my last one was advertised to do the same and would about 30 to 40 minutes. This one however worked great. The added benefit of being able to plug in a USB stick or SD card is very cool. We can play files from both of those. The gaming disc is there and its very ""Atari"" style arcade games but its neat they added that in. All of the buttons work as they should and the screen rotates as its advertised to do. The sound quality is very nice with no distortion at high volumes. I would say most people use the headphones while traveling though. Some days my son does and others he doesn't and the speakers are loud enough to not have to use them as long as you aren't driving around with the windows down. This is getting a very high 5 star review from me and my son both. He loves it and is happy I replaced the old one that went out on us.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know.

" 6:18 Mins I am pretty impressed with the sound quality from this of this speaker guys. For the price range that it falls in it will be hard to beat. It has the mids and highs as I expected but the bass is really there too. I am no audiophile by no means but I love my music and I love my bass too. I threw just about every genre of music through this over this last 2 weeks and it performed well. We had a bonfire the other night and I paired this to my phone and set Pandora on and just let it play..a good 5 hours..No issues at all with this. The battery lasted the full time at moderate listening levels.. It is splash proof so you don't have to worry about a little water or rain getting on it..I wouldnt dunk it in water but I trust it is safe if it gets a little rain on it or some water splashing on it. The buttons are easy to use..easy to pair and it has Voice Alerts that let you know when it is on, off, paired, volume max volume min etc...very nice touch. It is very well made and seems pretty rugged too. I am going to throw this on my pack when we go mountain biking this weekend. So far I am extremely impressed with it and giving a very high 5 star review. I love it!!If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

" 5:07 Mins When I first got this I kind of thought it was bit gimmicky..BUT..We have actually used this bulb everyday. We have had it a few weeks now and between my son and I we have used it a lot. By the way it has worked flawlessly since we added it in. We have it in a Post lamp right next to our entertainment system...We do have color changing LED lights behind our 55' TV used as biased lighting when gaming and just watching movies. This really adds to room ambience. We can match the colors depending on what we are doing at that time. It can also be used as a bright white bulb or even a warm white light if you have warm whites in your home. There are several preset flashing modes, a camera setting that reacts to whatever is front of your phones camera, even a voice and music section..so it reacts to everything you throw at this thing. Very cool. The app is easy to install and easy to use. This bulb is getting a very high 5 star review from us. We love it.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

" 3:58 Mins I have a pretty heavy duty organizer in my tahoe and I love it but it is just that....an organizer..I needed a trash can for the back seat and this is the ticket. Very heavy duty and well made...It can store several things in the pockets on the outside and my son and I can use it for our trash ...easy to clean, easy to hang and it stays put with the straps. I do use another bag inside there just so its easier to empty but it is waterproof..so nothing is going to spill out through the bag if it does get in there.

" 5:12 Mins I have about 8 or so of these diffusers now as I love these things. With a few drops of very inexpensive oils you can make your house smell great. They are so simple to use and very easy to clean. I clean mine with citric acid about every two weeks and they stay running great. This one is very quite too. The buttons on the front are for your light and the timer for your humidifier. One click on the light and it cycles through the colors. Or you can manually choose your color by clicking the light button and cycling through yourself. The mist button gives you a few choices on times to run it or you can run it until it manually goes off when it is low on water. Very easy. The wood grain gives it a nice stylish look that can go in any room. Been running it a few weeks now everyday with no issues. 5 stars from me.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond.

"3.5 starsI was enthused when I read the blub for Life Under New Management. Excited to see just what was in store for Andy and just how perverse Ethans consequences were. Dominance in a M/m relationship would be interesting and new to me. However, I was a little bit disappointed with how the story went since I was expecting something totally different than what I got.Andy was a true submissive at heart. Right from the beginning he had me scratching my head as to where his character was going. He came across as wishy-washy and couldnt tell the truth to save his soul until he was given the ultimatum by Ethan. Once the truth was out and he was given a trial run at the hotel, he continued to be a jerk. Seemed that the only thing he wanted to do was get the attention of Ethan, not do the job that he was hired to do.Andy intrigued Ethan and had him wondering if he could reform him, make him into the person he thinks he could be. There would have to be some concessions made my Andy. He would have to clean up his act, dress better, follow the regimen set forth by him. If hes good and makes Ethan proud, hell be in for the sex of his life . If not, consequences.As things progressed between Ethan and Andy, I was totally disillusioned. I thought there would be more of a BDSM dynamic between the two of them. What I got was a kinky man and a spoiled brat. Now, I like fun brats but Andy just rubbed me the wrong way. One minute it was yes, sir then next he was pouting because he didnt get his way. I will agree with Ethan on one thing though, there is definitely a fine line between begging and nagging  and Andy came off as nagging more often than not. Ethan was very clear on what he wanted from Andy, how he planned to help him take control of his life, his looks, his personal decisions. He gave him the choice of total control or just control in bed. Andy knew what was what when he went into this but couldnt stop himself from being selfish and bratty.When everything went down with Ethan and his job, Andy finally stepped up and became the man I was expecting from the beginning. He finally showed his real love for Ethan and his commitment to the relationship. Yea!The highlight of this story was definitely Henry. He was the comic relief. An anal virgin, when he finally gave it up to Mahito it was fun and cute. Nerdy Henry finally found out what he was missing and the banter back and forth between Andy and Henry was wonderful.So, unfortunately, this is not a Five Star review for me. I would have liked a little more of the BDSM dynamic between Ethan and Andy. I would have like Andy to be a little bit more giving and less spoiled. As for the writing of this new-to-me author, Jane Davitt, I thoroughly enjoyed it. She did keep the story moving, threw in a little suspense and did give me a few good chuckles. I just wish she wrote Andy a little bit stronger.Review copy provided for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEHG9JLUO40G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VM2L10S#wasThisHelpful","RIEHG9JLUO40G","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsI loved returning to the town of Holly Point and author Jeannie Moon offers up another spectacular, moving and magical story in Finding Christmas. There is always something special when two people meet and connect on a deep level from the start and this couple did just that; perhaps it was because theyd both suffered a career ending injury or maybe they were just destined to be together. While one hoped to find someone to settle down with, the other was convinced that part of life was over; it just took the right person to make all their dreams come true.I am not going to lie Maggie Bensons life has not been easy. As a Navy aviator having her plane struck by a missile and ejecting out of the cockpit because of fire Maggies life was forever changed. Bad enough she suffered burns on a good portion of her body but losing her foot and part of her leg due to infection just added insult to injury and led her down a very dark place. Maggie has come home to her family two years after the accident and one year after the amputation trying to figure out what is next in her life; what she doesnt expect is to meet a man who seems as crazy about her and she is about him.Will Fitzgerald is the best kind of man. From the moment they meet he treats Maggie like a woman, not like an invalid. As time goes on and he gets to know Maggie he respects her wit, her intelligence and her willingness to share her trauma with him. I loved that Will didnt baby Maggie, but he was there for her when she needed him. He never sugar coated anything but gave her his strength and stood by her side and most of all he made her feel desirable and sexy.Maggies large and overbearing family are of course concerned about her as are her friends, but not only does Maggie make them understand shes strong enough to make her own decisions, Will lets them know he will be there for her through everything. As they explore a relationship their feelings run deep quickly, but Maggies fears and her PTSD keep rearing their ugly heads.It was very easy to love this novella and watch as Maggie found happiness and a reason to enjoy the Christmas season again with Will by her side. While there were moments of doubt and some emotional struggles, there was way more moments of sheer joy and so much love.A beautifully told story of loss, healing, hope and love all set in a small idyllic town with a holiday background made Finding Christmas another amazing offering from author Jeannie Moon and a story not to be missed.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NE80IDLVYATA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017L6YJ16#wasThisHelpful","R1NE80IDLVYATA","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joanne Rock brought the small town, Northeast Christmas to life in Last Chance Christmas. The snow, the ice rink, the friendliness of off the towns people  it all brought back memories of winters past for me and made me wish for the simpler times that I grew up with.Shea has convinced herself that its time to face her past and make peace with her father. She didnt follow the path that he set for her in life. Forgoing the hockey career that her father wanted to go into fashion left her spending her Christmass traveling and, as she is finally figuring out, lonely. While coming out of anesthesia she hears a talk show about making amends, facing your past before you could move forward. Being on crutches and having some broken ribs, she decides to head home for the holiday, especially after the final blow from her employer. Finding an empty house and her ex-boyfriend at her home when she pulls out, she feels like the universe is totally against her. Then finding out that the one thing that the whole community looked forward to every year was not done by her father for the last two years, she knows that she has no choice but to stay.J.C. cant believe his eyes when he turns the corner and the one that got away was standing there. Shea. His first and only true love. Looking dejected when she finds out that her parents decided to go to Hawaii for the holiday, he cant help but convince her to stay with him. Hey, theres a new door on the house and she cant get in. There is enough room in his big house for both of them, and the sauna, and the hot tub and the fireplace ... should I keep going?Well, as the towns people gather around and the festivities begin, Shea finds out the truth of just what J.C. did and she doesnt know if she could handle him manipulating and lying to her again like he did so long ago. But, theres a big problem, she never got over him, shes still in love with him. Doing what she does best, she starts running. But this time, C.J. isnt going to let her. Hell make her listen to him and get her to understand this time around. He cant lose her again.Joanne Rock really rocked my world with the ending of this story. C.J.s Christmas gift to Shea was so thoughtful, so romantic and so made me shed a tear. I was like, Oh my God, how romantic! C.J., even though he was a wee bit manipulative, was really a sweet and loving man. Shea definitely had a chip on her shoulder and it really took a lot for her to finally give in to her feelings. But, I really did enjoy this Christmas story. Like I said, it reminded me of growing up in the small town, of going to the outdoor skating rink that our school made, of snowball fights and just fun happy times with friends and family. So, thank you, Joanne Rock for bringing a smile to my face, for bringing back some wonderful memories and for writing a beautiful story about love lost then found and Christmas in a small town.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRW9KC030ZGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017CFC6E8#wasThisHelpful","R2YRW9KC030ZGF","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsChristopher Rice combines the worlds from his first novella The Flame with his Desire Exchange a novel, The Surrender Gate and in doing so give us some insight into how the Desire Exchange came to be, but he also has readers asking questions about the man whose candles have strange powers and entice the owners to embrace their fantasies. In addition one couple whose relationship might be considered taboo decides to take a chance, but not without some interesting visitations along the way. Kiss The Flame pairs a man willing to risk it all, a woman determined to make a better life for herself, an attraction they cant deny and some interesting visits that make it all work.Lacey Foley is a bit older than the normal college student but shes making the most of her education and doing everything she can to make sure she keeps the impressive scholarship she earned. So when Michael Brouchard, the hunky teaching assistant in her Art History discussion class defends her to an overbearing idiot student Lacey is thankful but it also brings to light that she spends way too much time thinking of him in inappropriate ways and then she finds out hes fighting those same type feelings things get complicated yet very interesting very quickly. Despite the teacher/student issue, Lacey agrees to dinner where Michael shows her how real men treat women.It was very entertaining watching Lacey and Michael try not to give into the attraction that is so evident between them but failing miserably. I loved their banter and the fact that Lacey didnt hold back her real self from Michael from the start and that he was enamored with her all the same. While Lacey has some trust issues with men that made it hard to believe that Michael truly is a good guy, he proved over and over again he was someone she could trust. Lacey needed a bit of spiritual help to guide her, but in the end she decided to take a leap of faith and see where she lands.Once again I was impressed with the intimate scenes even one in the backseat of a Kia Soul (and on this subject my opinion and the authors dont mesh, because Souls rule) are intense and sexy, but they also seem to connect Lacey and Michael on a deeper level and my very dominate side really appreciated seeing a woman take charge and give the man something he didnt expect but thoroughly enjoyed.While I enjoyed this book immensely, at times I felt like I was reading two books; one centering on the candle maker, Bastain Drake and the proprietor of the Desire Exchange, Lilliane Williams and one about the romance between Lacey and Michael. Yes, Bastain and Lilliane in their own way helped Lacey to see the light regarding what she wanted with Michael, but there was a lot of byplay between Bastain and Lilliane leading the reader to wonder what really happened between them years ago.My one complaint is that I didnt have enough time with Lacey and Michael as a couple or get to see them as they learned all about each other and as their relationship progressed. Im hoping Laceys friend Cat might get a story one day and well get to see this couple again.Two people exploring their attraction and fantasies despite initial reservations made this an intense and sexy story, add in a bit of New Orleans magic and there is no denying that Kiss The Flame is another fantastic offering from Christopher Rice.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DD5PG83QBHMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSR5Z04#wasThisHelpful","R2DD5PG83QBHMR","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsTryst was unlike any love triangle I have read before. It was unabashedly truthful and insightful, and made me love and hurt for each of the participants in turn.Heidi DuCane is the publicist to the stars. Having first met her in Thrust as Justice Drakes publicist and friend, she is still as razor tongued, still as no-nonsense. But now we get to see the personal side of her.Heidis psychiatrist husband, Tucker, is the glue that keeps Heidi grounded and the calming influence in her life. He is smart, handsome, gentle and loves Heidi to distraction. Their life is perfect, except for the fact that Tucker does not give her what she needs. He does not give her the roughness, the carnality, the dirty sex she craves. But when an opportunity arises to give Heidi what she needs, and they invite rock star Ransom Reed into their bed, they open Pandoras box that cant be closed again.I have to say that I just loved this book. It was completely not what I expected, but it had me riveted nonetheless. The raw honesty pulled me in and wouldnt let me go because the feelings throughout this story were so real and open.Heidi knew she had a good thing with Tucker, she knew she loved and adored him. And yet she couldnt get Ransom out of her mind. The line of cheating was so blurred in this story because the sex with Ransom was had with Tuckers permission and urging, with him there. But the emotions that arose after a stranger was invited into their marriage were unanticipated by everyone involved.I loved that this book had no clear angels or devils. No one was wholly without fault in this odd relationship, and everyone played an equal part in the destruction that took place. Everyone was hurt and came out a different person than they went in. It was dark and real and sexy and sad and everything you could ask for when you pick up a book.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CH3X4OVZ83GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY3SVA0#wasThisHelpful","R3CH3X4OVZ83GX","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 starsMallory Kane did a nice job of bringing Montana to life in Her Secret Christmas Hero. Unfortunately, she had a hard time keeping me involved and invested in the story.Allie had me confused. I wasnt really sure where she was coming from or where she was going. One minute she is holding a gun on Jacob, the next she is begging him to make love to her. She felt scattered, not well thought out and well, just confusing.As for Jacob, he was a little more settled for me. He knew what his life was going to have in store for him once the snow storm passed. He didnt expect to be saved by a woman with a big heart. He didnt expect to be delivering a foal in a snow storm. He didnt expect to fall in love. Walking away from her and making the decision to either testify or not against his father and brother were the hardest decisions he ever had to make in his life.Maybe I am just used to strong female characters and Allie just didnt come off that way to me. She actually depressed me. Granted, she had a rough time with just losing her father but I wasnt drawn into that part of the story and that seemed to be the premise behind her. Well, that and her horse CeCe. Also, the timelines were confusing to me. At one point I thought it was 1 am on Christmas morning but then Christmas Star was born on Christmas Eve. Again, confused.The story itself was cute and interesting. It would have been nice to have had a little bit more of a background on the town itself, its occupants and how they all fit together. I just felt cheated in some way of not knowing more about what really brought them to the places where they were at in life. I would love to read more from Mallory Kane to watch and see how she evolves. There were times in this story that I became really involved and then others when I felt disconnected. But, as I said, the story was cute and had a really nice happily ever after.Review copy provided for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DOFJ9E4V6ZYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016Z5ODM4#wasThisHelpful","R2DOFJ9E4V6ZYV","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Did you hear the explosion that just rocked Storm, Texas? While it wasnt a physical explosion, the town of Storm will never be the same after some strong accusations were made at the Founders Day celebration. Lives have been torn apart, relationships shattered, careers possibly ruined and while one woman got her revenge time will only tell if it was worth it.This is the last episode in this years season of Rising Storm and author Dee Davis certainly knows how to leave the audience wanting more and wondering what the fall out will be when the smoke clears. This was nail biting, edge of your seat drama and while anyone whose read this series wasnt surprised by the information shared by a woman scorned, the rest of the town is reeling and scrambling to figure out how to reconcile what they thought they knew and what one person claims is true.I have thoroughly enjoyed this season of books from 1,001 Dark Nights and the very talented authors that have brought this series alive. While Im not a fan of serials, I think because Ive been in on the secrets from the beginning that I havent minded the way this series has played out and even now waiting until next years season Im okay with it all. These writers have done a fabulous job of creating an intriguing and unique series all while maintaining continuity throughout despite each episode being written by a different author.Thank you to Evil Eye Concepts, Liz Berry, MJ Rose, Julie Kenner and Dee Davis for giving me the opportunity to explore this fabulous series and to all the authors of this season and seasons to come; thank you for this one of a kind and truly fascinating world that reminded me what I loved so much about those 80s night time dramas.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF45W57D5K2D0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJKGEI#wasThisHelpful","RF45W57D5K2D0","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsThe story starts out in a busy airport where Claire Iverson meets and begins playing with the cutest little girl who happens to be traveling with her inattentive dad. A dad who is, of course, sexy as hell. Drake Driscoll is on his way to a two week working vacation in Jackson, Wyoming over the Christmas holiday with his three year old daughter. He doesn't get to spend much quality time with her and is hoping to have the best of both worlds in taking on being a full-time dad and being a businessman. His potential client has promised a full time nanny to care for the children while Drake stays in the guesthouse. Little does he know that the sexy and sweet, yet tough as nails, young woman who has helped him in the airport with his daughter is going to also be staying with him in the guesthouse for the next two weeks.Unfortunately, his former best friend's ex-wife, Sharon, and their young daughter are also staying in the guesthouse and man oh man is SHE a piece of work! Sparks are flying left and right and not always the good kind. Everyone in the house is carrying around some serious emotional baggage. So even though the attraction between Claire and Drake is mutual, Claire is scared to death of getting hurt again and tries to thwart Drake's advances.Drake is swoon-worthy in that ""imperfect but great dad"" sort of way. As the CEO of a successful security business, he is effective at getting what he wants. He has Claire in his sights and he's not taking ""No"" for an answer. Drake's seduction game is on point because he is more than ready to break the dry spell he had been in since his divorce. Claire doesn't stand a chance of not ending up in his bed.Their coupling was yummy, steamy and cozy. I thoroughly enjoyed them falling for each other. The sex scenes were like the blasts of heat you get when you open the oven while baking. They weren't elaborate and drawn out, but went on just long enough to make you feel it, then the story would proceed.There was a fair amount of drama, angst and insecurity, but like the sex, it wasn't drawn out and resolved itself in good time. The story moved along at a brisk pace but felt believable. Drake and Claire's wounds were compatible enough that they worked for them instead of against them and that really eased the tension for me.I love romance novels because no matter what happens I can count on the ""happily ever after."" This novel was classic romance at its finest. Sweet, nostalgic and sexy, it's perfect to curl up with on a cold winter day. Or in my case, a four hour flight. I loved it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17C8BSOF6TJ21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CEIPLM#wasThisHelpful","R17C8BSOF6TJ21","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could always depend on Bella Andre to bring me to a magical place. Teaming up with Jennifer Skully to write the Maverick series was ingenious. Harper and Wills story was enchanting and filled with love, but Sebastian and Charlie really pulled me in. I was awed and inspired by the woman that they wrote and the love that just flew off the pages.I really loved Charlie and her dedication to her mom, her art and to herself. When she sees Sebastian for the first time, shes stunned and intrigued. She knows who he is but cant wrap her mind around how he sees her or her sculptures. Magnificent isnt a word that she would describe her garden or the elephant or her junk pile. But, this was her way out and up, on her terms. Shell finally could take care of her mother the way she deserves and maybe even get to know the man that has her head spinning.Love is a word that is not in Sebastians vocabulary. Even though hes seen true love at its finest with Bob and Susan, hell never trust himself to love again. Its toxic, its hurtful and its definitely not for him. But, there is something about the quirky artist that just draws him in. Shes beautiful, sexy, and smart and the cutest thing he has ever seen in her welders mask and apron. There is no one that he more to do the sculpture or in his bed.As Sebastian learns about Charlie, her mother and her imagination, he cant help but try to help her, try to give her everything that she and her mom deservesmake her a star in the art world. But, as they start moving forward with their relationship, secrets come out and Sebastian messes up only to find out just how forgiving love can be.Heres a man that has everything, has the world on a string and he cant move on from his childhood. He doesnt know how to take his own advice and falls into micromanaging this wonderfully independent woman. His story was extremely depressing and uplifting at the same time. Charlie was just unbelievable throughout the story  she was a true inspiration to all woman. She not only knew how to get through to Sebastian but she also saw a side to him that even he refused to acknowledge  the little boy lost. But what got me most was how she stuck by him, how she fought for him and made him see his true abilities, made him finally believe in himself.There really is no way to express how much I look forward to reading Bella Andre. Whether she is writing as herself, Lucy Kevin or collaborating with another author, I absolutely love the stories that are told. And, I have to hand it to Jennifer Skully. You really cannot tell who wrote what in the book. The whole story is seamless so you never know where one author began and another picked up. They always kept the story moving, they wrote characters that were interesting and fun. The romance level was off the charts and the love they had for each other was written with such style. I am definitely waiting for the next book in the Maverick series and it looks like its going to be Matts turn. Hopefully we will get rid of Whitney in this one and give Evan a true happily-ever-after.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBSSOQRT6GJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017M768NG#wasThisHelpful","R2UBSSOQRT6GJR","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fine addition to the Nauti series, with a complex plot, interesting, likable characters and off the charts sex scenes.Zoey McKay is the youngest of Dawg's sisters and the one most likely to leave Somerset for good if Dawg doesn't let up on his over-protectiveness. Especially when she connects with the one man guaranteed to make him intervene, Brom Doogan. But Doogan knows things about Zoey that no one else does-like the fact that someone has targeted her for destruction after injecting her with a hallucinogenic drug. He also knows he's beyond attracted to the little nuisance. When he first met her, he was married, but now he's free under horrific circumstances.Can he move past his emotional demons and really connect with Zoey-and still keep her safe?Zoey was a kick-ass heroines, feisty, strong and funny. Doogan is yummy even though his connections to Homeland Security make him a bad risk.Following the plot takes a bit of concentration but its very well done. The book could use a bit of editing, but overall was extremely readable, although it helps to have read the previous books to keep the characters straight.

"4.5 starsThe Strength of the Pack is a continuation of an earlier book, Vulnerable, and brings that story to a satisfactory conclusion. In a strange way, it is better than the first book, not the least because I liked all the characters, all but one of whom are the same in both books.Vulnerable is the story of Leo and Jesse. Leo is trying to divorce his wife, Eva, because he has discovered he is gay. But Eva, who has a history of abuse by her father, is still trying to cling to the marriage. Eventually, things work out so that Leo and Jesse are married and living with Eva and her daughter and they declare themselves not just a family, but a pack. This is where the next book picks up. Members of the Suncoast Society, who brought Leo and Jesse together, decide to find someone for Eva-and what a someone they come up with. Nate Crawford is a massage therapist and acupuncturist who values family above all else. He and Eva strike sparks off each other, but can the two of them move beyond her dark secrets-and can they rely on their pack to support them when tragedy strikes?My problem with Vulnerable, and it carried over just a little to the next book is Leo. I found him to be self-centered and focused only on his own desires.Eventually he mans up and supports the woman he married, but his need to divorce this vulnerable, loving woman is focused purely on his needs, not hers and not their daughters.That being said, both books are well written, with all the emotional draw that Tymber Dalton is so capable of writing. The sex is incredibly hot and the plots of both books are captivating. While Strength of the Pack really should Vulnerable Part 2, it is a good read and and enjoyable story.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGIX2NV4OR027/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167JG1ZU#wasThisHelpful","RGIX2NV4OR027","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsReaders of the Reapers books have seen Painter for years and if theyre anything like me, theyve formed a sort of love/hate relationship with him. When we first met him as a prospect, way back in Reapers Property, he was just a little baby Reaper, lusting after Em, the Presidents daughter.Watching him infatuated with Em and doing nothing about it was frustrating and annoying. But in Reapers Fall, we get to see a completely different side to Painter. He truly grows up, takes on responsibilities, and even though he makes a lot of mistakes (and still causes some of those love/hate feelings), we get to see him grow into a man.I have to admit, at first I didnt really recall who Melanie was. I naturally assumed that Painter would get paired up with Jessica, and I was thankful for Joanna Wyldes Reapers and Bastards anthology which contained a story showing the beginning of their friendship. I needed it to jog my memory! And I found that I liked Mel. She wasnt from the MC world and she reacted the way any normal person would to the idiosyncrasies of club life. She was perplexed by the decisions Painter would make, seeming to choose the club over family, and I liked seeing a heroine that asked the same questions that I would, got angry over the same things I would. She didnt put up with Painters nonsense and I think thats the reason Painter fell in love with her.She was just flat out good for him and what he needed, and I felt that she made Painter into a better man. He grew from a newbie club member to a man with obligations and responsibilities and a future.I actually found this book to have a different feel than any of the other Reapers books. Maybe because it took place over such a long span of time, but it felt more all encompassing than the prior stories. And while this book could be read without reading any prior Reapers novels, a lot of things would be missed without knowing the other brothers and their old ladies. Knowing and loving them all, and getting to see them again definitely added to the appeal of this book.Fans of the Reapers and the Silver Bastards will not be disappointed by this story. We get more Horse, more Ruger, Puck, Hunter and Picnic. Did I mention more Horse? And more of Picnics crazy daughter Kit, who sounds like a blast! But we also get a better introduction to more of the brothers that havent had much attention paid to them before, especially Gage and Taz. While makes me hold out hope that well get books on these guys next!Reapers Fall was truly a pleasure to read. It was a trip back to see all of the men I love, in a world that Ms. Wylde has made so real, I can almost smell the leather, testosterone and motor oil, and I impatiently wait for the next installment to come.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D17VZZ0F65DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFM0#wasThisHelpful","R3D17VZZ0F65DE","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reap is the follow up to the raw, brutal and incredibly passionate story Raze. Read it before cracking open this story.This part of the Volkov Bratvas story centers on Talia, sister to Luka and best friend of Kisa. Luka and Kisa feature prominently in this story, as well, because Luka/Raze is intent on fulfilling his promise to 362, to exact revenge on his captors. Upon finding out 362s true identity the story really takes off.Talia is weary of the gilded cage she exists inside. Scrambling to get away from the mafia lifestyle and feel normal for a change, she moves into the familys summer home in the dead of winter. Unfortunately, mafia business finds her there, too, and she is confronted with a situation that causes something to snap within her.221/Zaal has only known torture and agony at the hands of his Master who orders him to kill on command. After his reluctant liberation, he finds himself chained in a basement, cold turkey detoxing from the experimental rage/obedience drugs that have been pumped into his system for as long as he can remember. His suffering knows no end until he has a brief encounter with Talia.This is another grimy, yet romantic love story in the Scarred Souls series. The characters are anti-heroes in a way because of the violent lifestyle they lead and are positioned to inherit. One of the things I love about this series is that there is no moral dilemma to the tragedy that unfolds. This is just what happens in the in the upper echelons of the Russian Mafia. Everyone accepts their role and are loyal to the family, no matter what. It makes for two very strong female characters in Kisa and Talia. They have lived with these hard and brutal men in their family and its no surprise they end up with these heroes that are only one step up from barbaric gladiators. Somehow their scarred humanity is brought to the fore and an honest love story follows.The beauty of Tillie Coles writing is that she makes me believe these characters and the horrors theyve experienced and the damaged, yet innocent, souls they are. It pushed all my caretaker buttons and I rooted for love to conquer all. At times it felt like a comic book-like alternate universe. At other times a soft-focus Hallmark Channel love story. But it worked for me and it all balanced out in the end. Loved this story and couldnt put it down.

"Every book in Heidi Cullinans Minnesota Christmas series has been special in its own way and I find that especially true with Winter Wonderland. From snow penises erected on one mans lawn to nosey but well meaning neighbors, to a town divided, and to two people who want the same thing even though one isnt quite sure of it. Holidays are a special time in Logan, Minnesota and this year is even more special because Logan is well on its way to becoming Christmastown, USA. Amusingoh who am I kidding? Sometimes hysterical, often touching, filled with characters you can imagine as friends and a very special love story Winter Wonderland is a holiday romance you dont want to miss.Its tough when the one man in a group of friends is the only one who has wanted a relationship and a family is the last one without a special someone and no prospects in sight. Now someone is leaving penis shaped snow sculptures on Paul Jansens lawn and not only does it bother his elderly neighbor his conservative and unapproving of his lifestyle family lets him know just how much this embarrasses them. When he finds out that the man leaving them is Kyle Parks, a man ten plus years his junior and one that is out, proud and a bit to effeminate for his tastes.Im going to admit I have a real soft spot in my heart for both men but especially for Kyle whose boyish looks have put him at a disadvantage most of his life, but Kyle proves over and over not only how mature he is but that hes a man who knows exactly what he wants in and out of the bedroom. Kyle is one of those men who takes people by surprise; they see a young face and they think kid but he is a nurturer to the core and it shows in the way he takes care of his patients at the nursing home he works at, with his Down syndrome twin sister and with Pauls elderly neighbor when she needs it the most. I flat out loved this character and it was easy to see he was a wonderful man and he got that way because he had a large and beautiful, loving family who taught him how to love, cherish and help others.I liked Paul because he puts on such a gruff exterior but underneath is a man who craves a loving family, intimacy and who loves Lifetime movies especially the Christmas ones. Hes got a lot of baggage that stems from the hate spewed from his family; the family that thinks him being gay is a phase, the family that continually tries to set him up with women, and the family who loves to tell him his lifestyle is wrong. He doesnt really let anyone get close because while he craves a normal life he doesnt think he deserves it and thus he pushes people away. He has great friends and an ex-lover who is his best friend but even they havent been able to prove to him that he is worthy of having exactly what he wants.I loved that Kyle was the dominate force in this relationship and that Paul relished in it (well after an initial freak out). There was an ease to the way these two meshed their lives and how Paul was so very accepting of Kyles family especially his twin sister. It wasnt easy as Paul had some very big hang-ups and Kyle was proud and happy to be a part of Pauls life and wasnt afraid to show it. I loved that despite being younger Paul was settled, he was patient and he knew when to push and when to back off and I relished in the fact that he wasnt afraid to talk to his family about his relationship and his concerns and that they were there for him with good advice.Working together with their friends on the towns big Winter Wonderland celebration added a fantastic backdrop to this story and it was fun watching as not only these six men found a way to help out the town but their friendship grew deeper and as they accepted Kyle into their group. I liked that their friends were there for them to offer advice or sometimes a strong nudge, but they also understood their relationship was something they had to figure out on their own.A wonderfully addicting small town romance filled with lots of crazy and fun characters, a bit of drama and a whole lot of love made Winter Wonderland a perfect holiday story. So grab your favorite cup of hot chocolate, some holiday cookies, stoke the fire and get ready to be transported into this amazing world.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KABUP1DK4WG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZTT9SR8#wasThisHelpful","R1KABUP1DK4WG5","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsFrom the first moment the hero and heroine meet in Kissing Her Crush before the conflict was revealed before their baggage came in to play, I was hooked. Every book Ive read by this author has been the same way; she hooks you from the start, reels you in and then keeps you there were her fresh plots, crazy but loveable characters and simmering sexuality.Smart, sassy and confident, Natalie Holden loves her job as a chemist in research and development for Hershey and getting the funding to prove for a trial to prove her chocolate recipe can help teenage depression is just the chocolate whipped cream on top of her hot chocolate until she finds out the National Institute of Health is sending someone to proctor her research is a bit of a wrinkle especially when that proctor turns out to be the object of her teenage dreams, Luke Elliott.I loved their playful banner throughout this book laced with sexual innuendo and chocolately goodness. Watching them try to keep their lips, hands and other body parts away from each other so as to not compromise Natalies research and Lukes job was at times funny and at other times frustrating, especially to them! I enjoyed the time they spent with each others family both of them realizing how important their respective families were to them and I especially enjoyed that as they got to know one another better their respect grew for one another and did their insight into each others lives.This is a romance on the sweeter side so while we saw Natalie and Luke enjoy each other often giving the reader the impression they were headed towards a more physical relationship, it didnt happen in this book, but in my opinion that only made their story better and there was no doubt when they finally got there it was going to be spectacular and who knows maybe Natalie wont need to depend on chocolate as a mood enhancer anymore!Sweet, sensual, playful and witty I loved Kissing Her Crush by Ophelia London!Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FOZ83KZQ05L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166RDA7K#wasThisHelpful","R31FOZ83KZQ05L","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OMG, I thoroughly enjoyed this story. It was fun, witty and, interesting. There may not have been a rose ceremony, but the dates leading up to the Sweet Pea bouquets were hilarious. Anna Banks kept me entertained and interested in wanting to find out how everything was going to play out between Grant and Chelle both on and off screen.Rochelle was a riot right from the beginning. Her hijinks trying to get off of the reality show, Luring Love, were nothing short of classic. When she ordered Fireball shots, she won my heart! I loved her little tricks, I loved why she stayed on the show, I loved the way she finally came to Grants defense, faced the past and looked forward to the future.Grant was no slacker either. He enjoyed Rochelles torment and understood why she was trying to get voted off the show, but he had no idea as to why she was sticking around and not just quitting. Try as he might, no matter what he did or said  no matter how much she disgraced him, herself, the integrity of the show, she stuck around. When they finally reconnect and start realizing exactly what went wrong with their relationship, he knows that he never fell out of love with her and will do whatever he has to to keep her on the show. Even face the threat of death by lethal walnuts.When the two of them got together, you had no idea what was going to happen. Were they going to argue? Were they going to try to make each other jealous? Were they finally going to clear the air and talk about what really happened ten years ago? It was anyones guess as to what would happen. And, thanks to meddling directors, unsavory producers and girls out for blood, everything did happen.So, I really did have fun reading How to Lose a Bachelor. The women were cut-throat and the bachelor was a real pushover that knew exactly who and what he wanted to happen  well, once he got over the shock. Anna Banks really won me over with the humor and wit portrayed within the pages of this story and I am looking forward to reading more from her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4XTHNGIKDUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CR0OZM#wasThisHelpful","R2B4XTHNGIKDUR","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsNo one likes being dumped and having it happen right at the holidays is tough, but sometimes things work out for the best and thats exactly what happens in Rebound Remedy by Christine DAdo. Sexy and funny I enjoyed the strange and complicated story between two men who find each other when they least expect it.On his way with his current partner for a romantic two week holiday Cole is stunned to watch his boyfriends ex propose to him as he watches on.Determined to not wallow in his breakup Cole winds up at his favorite bar where he cant help but notice Owen, the bartender and bars owner, who not only listens but makes him feel a bit better and whose smile lights him up like no other.I really enjoyed Cole and Owen together and found that their adventures and even their mishaps made the time they spent together feel very real. I think had they started up a month or two after Coles breakup or even if there hadnt been the breakup I would have enjoyed this story much more. Coles insistence to not get too invested with Owen bugged me and while Owen didnt think he had time to date, he made time which made me love him all the more.Thus for a good part of this book, I felt like the relationship was kind of one sided. These two jump very quickly into a physical relationship and while they both knew the score, that too even seemed strange and Cole thinking about his ex so much while with Owen just seemed disrespectful to him.If I remove Coles ex from this story in my mind, it is really a good story. I enjoyed their banter, their odd ball dates (especially the one that ended with them in the emergency room) and their sexy times were off the charts hot. I do feel there was too much of a rush to the declaration of love stage especially given Coles situation, but overall I still enjoyed their story.Sometimes a rebound is just a rebound and sometimes it can prove to be the best thing that ever happened to you.Review copy provided for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W33OBLU3FJLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017QGLGOY#wasThisHelpful","R1W33OBLU3FJLG","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, so the cliff hanger did not end the way that I thought that it would. Bash and Angelica are good together, great friends and completely, well almost, totally in sync with each other. Now, to jump the hurdles that could possibly be their downfall.As you all may know, this is a continuing saga  Volume II came with some surprises, ends in another cliff-hanger and has us learn a few things about both Bash and Angelica. The biggest surprise to Bash may just end up to be the hottest scene in Volume 3. I cant wait to read it.Now, there was plenty of action to keep me riveted to my seat in Volume II. A break up, a mnage (well a couple of them), a spanking, a DA that wont give up and the set-up of what is going to be an explosive ending. Love getting to know more about Bash and his past. Love the interaction between Dawg and Girly. Love that Bash and Angelica are getting back to the way they were and exploring where they could go. But I absolutely love the direction this story is going in.In reality, I have no idea where Ms. Blevins is taking us. There are so many outcomes of this cliff hanger that could happen that she really has me guessing. Who is going to be the hero? Who is going to pay and how? Just how is Bud going to take everything that has happened? Wow, I have a funny feeling that, to get answers to all my questions, we are going to have to go through a hell of a lot to get there.Candace never let us rest in Bash Volume II. Something was always happening, and it moved as fast as a well-greased motorcycle. She never kept us guessing, got right to the point. We always knew what Bash or Angelica were thinking or feeling. Maybe she knew that the ending was going to be enough of a guessing game or maybe shes just that good of an author. Satisfying both the mental and physical needs of her readers is her number one priority. Telling a story that not only brings you on a journey but into the lives of her characters, making them and the storyline true to life is a trademark of Candace Blevins and I am thrilled to have the honor of reading and reviewing her work.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343TODUW26N2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016989C82#wasThisHelpful","R343TODUW26N2H","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a hard review for me to write because I have loved this series so much and have watched this authors career from the start and I wanted so very much to love Home Free by Laramie Briscoe, but unfortunately this book missed the mark for me. Ten years after Charity Thomas left Bowling Green, Kentucky and the love of her teenage life, Drew Walker, she has come back to repay a favor to a friend not knowing if shell stay or how shell react to being near Drew again or how hell react to her being back in his life.In several previous books of this series we had glimpses of the teenage love between Drew and Charity and we saw a bit of the aftermath when she left town to pursue college and a career. The thing is, I wanted to see more of the time they were apart. We didnt see Charitys struggles and we only saw Drews struggle on the surface. I was disappointed that these characters werent developed more fully and we never really got to know the adult version of them. Their childhoods were no doubt messed up and several events in their lives shaped them into the people they are, but there was a huge chunk of time missing, important time in which they grew into the adults they are. This unfortunately made them feel somewhat one dimensional to me and I never really felt connected to either one of them during this book.Charity comes back to town at the request of Meredith Blackfoot to help a mother and daughter with some legal issues involving a man that Charity has dealt with in the past. As an attorney and because she feels she owes Meredith a debt of gratitude she agrees to return. The ongoing case and the resulting investigation seemed to overshadow their relationship and to be honest I felt they slipped way to easily back into a relationship especially give how very little they talked about their lives. I get that they had an intense connection and they believe they never stopped loving one another, but on the other hand I question how well they really know one another given theyve spent 10 years apart and never talked about that time. While I didnt expect Drew to be a hearts and roses kind of guy there just seemed to be so much missing, very little romance and they both just turned a blind eye to the past.I enjoyed seeing many of the characters from previous books and it was kind of wild seeing the young kids from previous book now pre-teens and teenagers giving us a good look at to what might be possibly coming in the future.I am thrilled that Drew and Charity are back together again and while not my favorite book in this series; I still wouldnt have missed Home Free by Laramie Briscoe for anything.Review copy provided for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UBKCYYXVCNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E3CS74#wasThisHelpful","R28UBKCYYXVCNP","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Im nervous, excited and on the edge of my seat as we approach the end of this season of books in this series.Finding out their young son has been diagnosed with autism sends Pastor Bryce and Tara Douglass life into a tailspin. While Tara is trying to remain positive and work on finding strategies what work with Patrick, Bryce is feeling helpless, alone and very scared it is his fault. This was really a touching segment to this series and it did a fantastic job of showing how different people react to such a diagnosis, but one I loved most was the outcome for this couple. Seriously a big sigh moment!Ginnys pregnancy is beginning to become more noticeable but so is her relationship with the newly returned Logan. Its evident that the town is talking about how shes bearing one mans child and shes dating someone new, but Jacob is determined to be there for her. Ginnys secret though could send him packing and unfortunately Dakota Alvarez whose affair with Senator Rush has run its course is starting to piece things together which could spell disaster for more than just Ginny and Logan.Amid the Founders Day preparations there are several couples struggling with relationship issues, secrets are beginning to unravel and theres an overall feeling that something big is brewing and the town of Storm is in for a wild ride. I am so enthralled with this series, this town, its residents and their crazy lives that are somehow all entwined and have a feeling once things begin to unravel the town will never be the same.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CAZOVIC2MVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJ07PG#wasThisHelpful","R15CAZOVIC2MVO","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 starsThis second chance at love story Some Girls Dont by Amy Andrews was a bit of a disappointment after the first book in this series, I enjoyed reading it but there was too much focus on the past and not near enough focus on the here and now or the future.Selena Durrum has returned to Jumbuck Springs 15 years after she left basically in the dark of night without a word to the man she loved with all her heart. Back in town to deliver a speech at the request of her grandmother, Selena knows shell have to face Jarrod she just doesnt realize how much he will affect her and how hard it will be to stay away.These are relatively mature adults in their 30s yet they insisted on rehashing their past over and over and Ill admit that made it difficult for me to really understand why they wanted to be together when they couldnt move pastwell, the past. While I dont necessarily agree with the way Selena left town I do understand why and in reality her reason for leaving the way she did was an out because she didnt want to have to face Jarrod. I believed that Jarrod had a hard time finding love again, but honestly I think it was more to do with not having that closure he needed. Jarrod is a passionate, handsome and friendly guy, but Selenas actions left him a bit broken and unable to move on fully.Selena came off as a bit of a flake; she claimed she left the way she did so it was easier for Jarrod but in reality she did it because it was easier for her and because she had dreams she wanted to fulfill, something I support but she was cowardly in the way she did it. Jarrod was an easy character to like most of the time although some of his words and actions were harsh at times (again over something that happened when these two were teenagers). I had a hard time liking Selena, I understand her ambition and her drive, but she was so unwilling to even work with Jarrod on a solution for them to be together.Their chemistry was undeniable and when they were in the moment it was easy to see their feelings for each other had never completely gone away, but these scenes were too few and the scenes where they went round and round on past events were far too many. There were some excellent scenes with the secondary cast of this series which makes me hopeful for the books to come.This is one of those books that I just didnt feel like the romance blossomed at all; these two had feelings in the past, acted on the attraction that was still between them, but in all honesty they didnt spend enough time getting to know one another as the adults they are now. It all seemed very superficial with the exception of a few key moments. While Some Girls Dont was a miss for me, I am looking forward to what comes next in this series.Review copy provided for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25SZTBYXP3CGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163NLW90#wasThisHelpful","R25SZTBYXP3CGR","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsSky of Dreams is a complete departure from Jenna Jacobs past work, but none the less an excellent read for all that.Kaitlin Grant returns home to Connor, Iowa to lick her wounds and recover from an abusive relationship with her boyfriend and business partner. She hopes to rediscover the strong person she used to be, but she is not prepared to have a run in with the boy she left behind, Sky Whitefeather. ButSky is no longer a boy and he has his own demons to battle as well as a daughter to raise.But both parties find the connection they had as children and then teenagers has continued in spite of time and trauma. Can these two tortured souls find their way back to each other while battling their inner demons and dealing with the danger trailing after Katie?The main characters were both likable, flawed but honest, strong yet vulnerable, and the secondary cast was no less fascinating. The sex scenes were scorching, but vanilla, unlike the authors earlier work which is set primarily in a BDSM club.My only concern is the fact that Katie has worked hard to build up her advertising agency and to just dump it and her success runs against the grain.Still, this story will grab your attention from the very beginning and keep it throughout. Well written and captivating, this is an enjoyable read.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNSDRIPYPHDJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153GXMGY#wasThisHelpful","RNSDRIPYPHDJT","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 stars overallKnockout by Cari Quinn 4 stars (Reviewed by Slick Reads)Author Cari Quinn continues her Tapped Out series with Knockout and it was pretty damn delicious. Up and coming MMA fighter Emerson Knapp has wanted his best friend Lily for a long time, but given that her overprotective police officer father is like a father to him hes put his feelings aside until her friend JC invites them to a housewarming party which turns out to be a party for three. Emerson not only finds himself finally getting his chance with Lily but also coming to terms with his bisexuality. I loved this complicated and sexy story between these three. It was interesting watching Lily show both Emerson and JC that she knew what she wanted and was ready to take it. KCs take charge attitude and refusal to let any of them hide what they wanted from one another was refreshing. And watching the very closed off Emerson open up to both Lily and KC was a thing of beauty. While I was perfectly happy with where this book left this triad, I really would have liked to see how Lilys dad handled their unusual relationship down the road and how their friends reacted to them as well but overall a very enjoyable story.Hot Summer Nights by Cathy Clamp 4 stars (Reviewed by Rosalie Belle)Sophie, going to inherit the hotel her favorite grandfather, Mr. Will, left her in his will, finds that she has been set up with one of her grandfathers favorite friends/coworkers, Gabe, who has also been promised the same hotel, The Starlight. Learning to work together to make the live in hotel for all Mr. Wills friends turned family, and make the best of a seemingly awkward situation from the beginning, turns out to be rather steamy. The two know each other from photographs, and for years, have longed after the other, due to the pictures. Finding how exactly compatible the two can be in a working environment leads to a super steamy bedroom environment where the two are even more compatible and finally found home.Marked for Love by Anna J. Stewart 5 stars (Reviewed by Rosalie Belle)Meeting under rather unusual circumstances at Brodies tattoo parlor, Marked, both he and Regan knew there was something special about the other. Neither wanting to date, Regan have to be the matriarch and take care of all of her younger siblings when her mother passed right after having her last sister, and Brodie the sole provider for his daughter, Cilla, but both too hard headed to stay away from each other. When Regan finally agrees to go out with Brodie, from the beginning, the sparks are inevitable and the two know that the strings that are pulling them together cannot be denied. The back and forth and suspense in this novella kept me engrossed and waiting for what would happen next. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, you would be thrown for another loop. A great read that pulled me into the Lantano Valley community and leaves me wanting more.Knotty Magic by Jodi Redford 3.5 stars (Reviewed by Slick Reads)So Jodi Redford added a bit of magic into this contemporary story of two people who have had a love/hate relationship for most of their lives, but with a little help from a magic tree that he plans to sell and be cut down their lives are changed forever. I have to admit I loved Tully and her smart mouth and no holds barred opinions and I admired her for finally admitting to Huck that shes loved him for years. Huck was a little harder to like, but it was obvious his ex-wife had done a number on him and his scars were deep. Forced to help Tully when she appears at his place following a strange car accident, Huck finds it hard to not admire every little think about Tully. I liked these two together and found their verbal banter to be fun and entertaining and even sexy at times. While I had a bit of a hard time with the way they were ultimately brought together it was still a cute story and in the end they both got exactly what they wanted.Against the Wall by Amie Stuart 4.5 stars (Reviewed by Rosalie Belle)Alex is not the girly girl that comes with almost every romance novel. She is a tough, hard as nails, crew supervisor in construction. She has worked her way almost to the top, through hard work, and will do nothing until shes there. Until sexy as sin Wade comes along. Meeting up with him, accidentally, during a girls night, turns into a night neither will forget. After literally taking care of herself, with Wade the center of her fantasy, Lexi takes the bull by the horns. Trying to balance out the job that the two love and need, and find a way to keep up the hot as hell sex leads to a great read with Ms. Stuarts novella.Unashamed by Leah Braemel 4 stars (Reviewed by Slick Reads)Im a sucker for a good M/M/F mnage and Leah Braemel offers up an interesting one in Unashamed. Best friends and business partners for years Max Moretti and Noah McNaughton are both attracted to Hayley OConnell the house flipper they do contract work for, but until recently Hayley was with someone and now that shes not both men intend on making a move. What I really loved about this book is both Max and Noah admitted to each other they were interested in Hayley and agreed they should both date her and see who she clicked with.There wasnt really any jealousy and while Max worried that shed prefer Noah because of his rich father, he put forth every effort to make sure Hayley knew he was interested. When they become aware she has a mnage fantasy they are both on board to make her fantasy a reality but in doing so Max and Noah much confront the feelings between them and an incident in their past. I loved that Hayley wasnt judgmental about Noahs pan sexuality or the fact that Max was coming to terms with his feelings towards Noah. I felt the intimate scenes between them were sensual and sexy and absolutely showed the bond between them all. Most of all I liked that there was some time between their first encounter to them making some big life decisions, but to be honest I wanted to see what happened in that time (because Im nosey and I cant help it). While it seemed they rushed to the I love you stage especially where Hayley was concerned; I had to remind myself that theyd worked together for years, they shared meals, off time and talked during that time so while they may not have dated in the traditional sense these three knew each other and thus went easily from friends to lovers to more because of that relationship. Unashamed is a beautiful story of three people finding and accepting love even if it is a bit unconventional.Love In An Elevator by Chudney Thomas 2.5 stars (Reviewed by Rosalie Belle)The plot in this novella seemed to start very well laid out. Micah, striking out on her own from under rather affluent parents, meets the elevator repairman, Cam, when she keeps calling in elevator issues. Most of her issues revolve around her panic attacks and hyperventilating due to claustrophobia, but do lead to meeting Cam. Their brief courtship and relationship lead up to one steamy sex scene, but thats it. The ending happened so quickly, out of the blue, leaving so many questions. There was an ending, but nothing that led up to the ending. I feel that if the relationships in the book could have been explored more, and blossomed, this could have been a great novella.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9S6XRKX0LOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013J85PQS#wasThisHelpful","R1R9S6XRKX0LOT","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cara McKenna never does the expected, and she certainly doesnt follow any romance novel formula. Her characters, one of my favorite things about her novels, are often blue collar, ex-cons, criminals, other shady types, and even the occasional regular person. Burn It Ups Abilene Price and Casey Grossier are no exceptions. Both Abilene and Casey have many secrets, and honestly, their secrets are pretty bad. Some readers may not like characters with such dark histories, so much damage, and questionable morals, but in Ms. McKennas deft hands, these characters really come to life. We see their flaws, and bad decisions, but we also see the good. We see their actions, we are privy to their thoughts and motivations, their desires to be better people. Their friendship has grown, and Abilene has come to rely on Casey more and more since the birth of her daughter, Mercy. The book takes place over a brief period of timeabout two weeksbut the pace of their relationship grew in a way that felt completely natural, never rushed or forced. I like that Casey is a very different man from his brother, Vince. I loved his introspection, and the genuine effort he made to be honest and real with Abilene, and the other people in his life. There is a noticeable difference from the Casey who first showed up in Lay it Down. I found his confessions and admissions profound and moving. Unexpectedly, I found myself crying several times while reading this book.Change, growth, and forgiveness, accepting responsibility for past decisions and moving forward are the prevalent themes here, and it was a joy to watch these characters, as well as a few of the secondary characters, come to these realizations.If youre looking for lighthearted and fun, this probably isnt that book or series, but I love these characters with all their flaws and imperfections, and the ongoing mystery surrounding recent murders, the casino project and government corruption is no less intriguing three books into the series. In fact, there is even additional intrigue to be found in Burn It Up. As always, I eagerly await the next book in this series from one of my favorite authors.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFHXTLTODS13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75RY9U#wasThisHelpful","R2YFHXTLTODS13","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book Gripped me tight and didnt let go. I am still tingly thinking about this book after Ive read it. This book was offered to me by one of my fellow reviewers. She knew I liked darker reads and thought I would be a good fit for this book. I seriously could not thank her enough when I was finished. This book was amazing in so many ways.This book is scary for me, with the times we live in this book could be someones legitimate nightmare. It involves so many real day issues and fears and concerns and was so realistic I can only imagine how these scenes came to beThis book had a Heroine Ally/Sara that was so realistic. Shes thrown into a nightmare and is definitely strong and perseveres but she shows her weakness.Who wouldnt have panic attacks, depression or thoughts of just ending it all in the face of what she faced. The mind control and manipulations put in place against her, the physical and mental blows she sustained would destroy people and make them build themselves into something or someone new and this book showed that through the good and bad it took her to get to be the strong person at the end. David her husband shows the love and strength of a true Hero but he is human and this book was written to show the human side of human trafficking. There was no hero without flaws, there was no allies without reason or personal gain for what they did to help or hurt the situation. Almost every player in the book had reasons for what they did and you as a reader could not blame them and in some instances could not judge their decisions based on what they faced.This book shows love and patience wins but the cost is so great you almost have to question if the prize is actually winning at the end?I cannot think of another book Ive read this year that moved me, made me gasp or still make me full of emotions days after reading it. So thank you Kishan Paul, this book was my favorite and will be one I will re-read often to feel the feels and emotions again.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141UJTCRF3MLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144W7QEW#wasThisHelpful","R141UJTCRF3MLA","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsEverything I Left Unsaid is a cliffhanger, a fact I wasnt aware of when I chose to read and review it. Im not a fan of cliffhangers, and I feel strongly that readers should be warned about them in the book descriptions, BUT, I loved this bookthe writing, the characters, the ploteverything about it, except the cliffhanger ending. So, Im a little conflicted. I wouldnt have chosen this book had I known about the cliffhanger, and I would have missed out on a wonderful story, beautifully written, with interesting, well-developed characters whose journeys truly captivated me. Everything I Left Unsaid is refreshingly different and appealing. From M.OKeefes word choices, humor, and the way the main characters interacted with one another, I genuinely was enthralled by this book. What kind of romance novel has the H/h not meeting face to face until 70% into the book? Dylan and Annies contact up to that point is solely via telephone. These conversations between two broken strangers are anything but simple; the calls are revealing, provocative, sexy, and heartbreaking, yet cathartic and healing.I couldnt help but want more for the two of them, yet I completely understood the author keeping them apart. The secondary characters, and there are quite a few in this book, are equally as intriguing to me. Small pieces of their stories and their relationships to the other characters are slowly revealed, just enough to leave me with a burning need to know the rest.Im still not a fan of cliffhangers, but I am beyond thrilled and excited to have found M. OKeefe. Im dying to read the next book, The Truth About Him.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FA6S7FAMOIQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WM#wasThisHelpful","R1FA6S7FAMOIQT","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes a book just seeps into your soul and that was A Fortunate Blizzard by L.C. Chase. This is my first book by this author, but if this is indicative of her work, Im pretty sure Ill be fangirling big time. Poignant, sweet, beautiful and sexy all describe this most delicious holiday story that turns a chance meeting into the love one man thought hed never have and one man thought time had run out on. I loved this story from beginning to end and honestly I feel certain this will be one I will need to read every holiday season from here on out.From the first moment we meet both the heroes in this book, I was hooked. I felt a connection with them both and felt this sense of how lonely they both were and how much they needed a connection to another human being. Marcus appeared to have it all; a highly sought after attorney on way to making partner, handsome, and well off but his work consumes him. He doesnt really have any friends and his family turned their backs on him long ago. Without his paralegal hed have very little companionship at all and even she is disgusted because he wont take time to go out and interact with the others in the office.Trevor Morrison is an artist who loves his work and enjoys the trips he takes to see his wild, crazy and eclectic family but Trevor is living on borrowed time. His kidneys are failing and with his blood type a donor match is hard to find. He has some big decisions to make about what is left of his life and how to tell his family.The immediate connection between these two was obvious and that was even before they slept together. I enjoyed their easy banter, the way they shared things with each other and their sexy times were off the charts. There really wasnt any denying these two felt something big between them but as Trevor refused to share his health issues with Marcus he simply told Marcus it was such a hook-up and nothing more. I felt for Marcus as he tried to make Trevor see there was something for them to explore and while I admire Trevor for believing he was sparing Marcus any hurt, he didnt realize how invested Marcus already had become.What I absolutely loved was Trevors big and loving family being there for him and helping him through some tough times and decisions and Marcus finally opening up to his paralegal, Kate and the way she and her friends rallied with him to find a way to make a difference.There were so many touching moments in this book and while at times it was sad almost to the point of despair, there was also a since of hope and rightness and thats what made this book so wonderful. Like Lifetime Christmas movie wonderful, if only theyd get with the times and make a gay romance movie.The spirit of the holidays and the wonder of mankind rising up to help someone they didnt even know made A Fortunate Blizzard one amazingly touching yet incredibly sexy story and one that I am ready to read again and again.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HH9XMRQW2XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GHTD3Y#wasThisHelpful","R18HH9XMRQW2XO","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im always excited to catch up with the characters from one of my all-time favorite series, On Dublin Street. One Kings Way, the latest novella in Samantha Youngs recently ended series left me with mixed feelings. The last few novels in the series have been set many years after the first book, On Dublin Street. One Kings Way takes place during the same timeframe as the first couple of books, when Joss and Jo work at Club 39. It focuses on their friend and co-worker,Craig Lanaghan and Rain Alexander, a woman he meets in the bar. I really enjoyed getting to know Craig and his family. His backstory was interesting, and his reaction to his widowed mothers decision to begin online dating was very entertaining. Craig is charming, flirty, hardworking, and devoted to his family. There really is much to love about him.Unfortunately, I didnt feel the same about Rain. The banter between the two of them was smart and fun, but I found her to be frustrating, and at times, unrealistic in her demands and unwilling to compromise, even a little. Her backstory is heartbreaking, but her guilt and lack of communication with her younger sister, combined with her martyr complex, didnt work for me. Fans of this series will want to read this one, but I was a little disappointed.Review copy provided for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PNI4SQ66DNF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOAZYYY#wasThisHelpful","R3PNI4SQ66DNF2","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsWild About the Wrangler is the second story in the Sexy Texans series and it is a very comfortable friends to lovers story. Anastasia and Mac have developed a friendship over the last 6 months since hes come to town and they enjoy their time together. He was her inspiration in getting her artistic juices going again and he helps her by taking pictures of the wild stallions.But when someone points out to Mac that she has a crush on him, he starts to see things in a different light. Should he put on the brakes or let this play out? Helping her with riding lessons became a true test of their friendship and she didnt make it easy on him.Mac has his reasons for not letting things go to the next level with Anastasia, even if they are pretty weak. Anastasia deals with him by calling him out, and lets him know that shes a big girl and knows her own mind. Once he goes all in things definitely heat up and those scenes are steamy. Its just a little disappointing that they didnt heat up the sheets sooner than later in the story, but it took time for them to get to that point. It was nice seeing both point of views and how they both didnt want to wreck what they had established.Both Mac and Anastasia were endearing in their care for their friends feelings and you could feel it from page to page. The more time they spent together with her riding lessons, the more right it felt. They just couldnt deny their physical attraction and how softly their friendship turned into love. The story is told with humor and flowed easily from beginning to end. I like Ms. Thompsons stories because they are light and fun reads and can be read fairly quickly. I enjoy the small town shes created in Bickford, Texas and the many inhabitants who make it their home. I also love the canyon and how she describes such a beautiful place. It is always a delight when we catch up with Georgie, Vince and Travis and see how they are doing as well. The ending came too soon, a bit predictable, but a very happy one.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMUZE2XQNU6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OKX8#wasThisHelpful","R1EMUZE2XQNU6M","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes you get way more out of a romance than you expected and that is the case with Forever This Time by Maggie McGinnis. Ive read this author in the past and enjoyed her work so I expected a well written, enjoyable, fun, sweet romance and I got all of that but I also got an intense and emotional journey between two people changed by two incidents that left them both reeling as teenagers. This was a complicated story packed with emotion but there were many moments of fun, hilarity, hope and a whole lot of love.Josie left her hometown and her familys business after high school and hasnt looked back escaping the dysfunction of her family and leaving behind the man she loved when she saw him offering the same type of life she wanted to escape. When her father has a stroke, she returns home to find that while some things have stayed the same, others have changed drastically.Josie was such a complicated heroine, I liked her but at times she was just so standoffish that she made it hard to really understand her. As her story unraveled it became clear that her childhood and teen years were not stellar, but I also admired her for how much she gave to a very special young girl named Avery. I dont like the way she left town or the people she hurt, but I could sympathize with her and understand why she did what he felt she had to do. It was interesting watching her meld back into small town life and into life at Snowflake Village her familys Christmas themed park. As she came to realize just how many people had helped her as a teen without her even realizing it, the ice wall shed built around herself began to melt and it was interesting to watch her see life a whole new way. While her being back affected Ethan probably the most, he really did his best to be civil and it was obvious they were both having problems containing their feelings towards one another from the start.Ethan impressed me with the way he handle Josies return and while he did have a bit of fun at her expense with the jobs he assigned her at Snowflake Village, I really dont think he did it to be mean; it was more self preservation and I think he was secretly hoping that Josie would begin to remember the magic of the park. I loved that there was so much more to Ethan than met the eye and that he didnt share a big part of his life with Josie because he wanted her to want him for him and not for the things hed done.Every interaction between these two was important from the confrontational ones, to the sweet ones, to the angry ones to their walks down memory lane. They shared a past that was riddled with so much good, but there was also a lot of disappointment and pain and Josie had suffered so much that she did the only thing she felt she could and left. I hurt for these two young people who endured so much, but seeing them as adults I cant help but think that those incidents made them stronger, made them better people and made them capable of forgiving and reaching for the love they both so desperately wanted.I enjoyed most of the secondary characters immensely with the exception of Josies ex-best friend Molly who just came off as mean, angry and a bit self centered. I get that she was hurt by Josies disappearance but talk about living in the past, I just really had a hard time with many of her actions in this story.Despite its moments of grief and sadness this story was truly an uplifting story and while there was no doubt Josie and Ethan still had feelings for one another, I liked that it took time for them to repair their relationship and move forward. A heartwarming and delightful story Forever This Moment is another fantastic offering from author Maggie McGinnis and a great start to a new series.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXX97YHBBJUU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1CO6IC#wasThisHelpful","RXX97YHBBJUU5","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 starsWhat in the heck did I just read? I am still so confused and my mind has been totally messed up by not only Lux but this entire series. Shouldnt I have answers instead of more questions? Normally when you come to the end you arent supposed to be even more confused than when you started. It felt like a twisted, mind blowing, version of Groundhog Day. I still dont know what was real, what wasnt or who is who. You might think with that description of how I felt once I was done that I hated it, but in fact the opposite is the truth. I loved it, I may not totally understand it all but I loved each and every twisted word I read. This is one book and series that I will never forget because my mind just cant stop trying to figure out what actually happened.Dare and Callas story is one filled with twists, turns, darkness, light, truth and lies. I am not exaggerating when I say this series will mess with your mind. I couldnt wait to get my hands on Lux because I needed to see what was going to happen. I figured out one or two plot things before they were confirmed but even those small little victories didnt last long because within a few pages, heck even a few sentences I was confused once more.Lux is unlike anything else I have ever read. Courtney Cole even warns us that this will be unlike anything else and she was right. I cant believe I am even about to type this but if there was even another book, I would sign up for my mind to be totally blown once more. I cant help it, there is just something about Lux especially that has me in its vortex and continues to suck me in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JHXVPIDCYYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178IC9OG#wasThisHelpful","R21JHXVPIDCYYD","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone looking for a snappy legal drama mixed with dirty sex and a true romance, have I got a book recommendation for you!Leary Michaels is an attorney extraordinaire.  Shes smart and sexy and she knows it.  She uses all of her assets to win her cases, and she wins at any cost.  Working at a firm that caters to the little guy, she goes against the larger companies to protect her clients rights, and she lets nothing get in her way.  But she may have met her match in fellow attorney, Reeve Holloway.Reeve appears to be Leary, in male form.  Hes sexy, driven, and wins cases.  But what happens when two people who never seem to lose wind up on opposite sides of the same case?I have to admit that it took me a few chapters to really get into the story.  I was not a true fan of either of these characters at first.  Leary came off as too brash, too aloof for my tastes.  And my first impression of Reeve didnt fare any better.  He seemed taken with a pretty face and had to be goaded into action, not the take charge kind of guy that I typically like.But the more I read, the more I genuinely liked these two.As we discovered more of Learys background, more of her reasoning for taking on the case that brought her and Reeve to opposite sides of the courtroom, she became more sympathetic and human to me.  Her actions seemed to be less flash and have more meaning.  For a woman that I initially thought was cool and stand-offish, she had more substance that I gave her credit for.  The same went doubly so for Reeve.  As the case between he and Leary went on, we see that beneath the brash exterior that Reeve portrayed, there was a good man who genuinely cared for Leary.  And as he finds his obligations at odds with his personal beliefs and his feelings for Leary, Reeve was caught in the unenviable spot of having to choose between doing his job and following his professional ethics, and risking losing a woman with whom he was falling in love.The legal nerd in me enjoyed the courtroom drama, my voyeuristic self loved the sex, and my more sensitive side enjoyed the unplanned romance that blossomed between these two.Dont let the #8 in the (Legal Affairs #8) scare you off.  It wasnt until after I was done reading the book that I realized it was part of a series and I was late to the party.  This story is a stand alone, and at no point did I feel that I missed something by not having read any of the prior books.  This book was a triple threat.  It was smart, it was hot, and it was sweet.  A perfect combination.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UEFXDAMHNB6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCAOXI0#wasThisHelpful","R3UEFXDAMHNB6J","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a serial novel and while this novel could be read as a standalone the story is better understood if you read Wicked Shots and Wicked Exposure first.After her sisters untimely death, Jessica returns to her childhood home of Portland Maine to wrap up her sisters affairs. She soon finds out that her sister had a TON of secrets and each new discovery Jess makes about her sisters lifestyle takes her further down a dangerous road. Soon she finds she doesn't know who to trust and that her life may be in danger, especially if she keeps gathering more clues and evidence that her sister's death was no random act of violence.Sam is the detective investigating Cass, Jessica's sister's murder. He also happens to be A childhood friend of the family and Jessica's former flame. Their relationship is complicated and didn't end well. Now that they've been reunited the sparks fly and their steamy romance takes off. But all is not well and as the case unravels both Sam and Jess find themselves fighting for their lives.This novel is a classic ""whodunnit"" with more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti! I didn't know who to trust because it seemed everyone had something to hide. I enjoyed the story and the sex was steamy. The BDSM aspects of the story gave it some spice, but seemed irrelevant at times. I will reiterate what I said in the beginning. Read Wicked Shots and Wicked Exposure first because this story will make more sense if you do.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OBFGTO276Q4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE7O8ZI#wasThisHelpful","R2OBFGTO276Q4S","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the first book in Shannon Stacey's Boys of Fall series, I liked it quite a bit but I was a bit disappointed in that the romance seemed lost in the story. Don't get me wrong, the story was wonderful but I didn't feel like I had enough time with the couple to really love it. In Defending Hearts, Ms. Stacey gave me everything I could want in a romance and more. I loved this book; the out of sorts hero, the strong and somewhat stubborn heroine, a feisty matchmaking grandma, the backdrop of a small town and two people so very different finding common ground.In the first book Alex Murphy an award winning photojournalist returns to his hometown, Stewart Mills, New Hampshire, to help raise funds for the football program as a tribute to the coach who taught him much about life. After a particularly grueling assignment Alex feels the need to return ""home"" again and ends up renting a room at a farm from a woman who was a few years behind him in school and her grandmother who raised her. The last thing Gretchen wants is a boarder in her and her grandmother's home but it is money they can use and he's not a complete stranger but finding him handsome and charming isn't what she expects or the fact that he seems every bit as interested in her as she is in him.I was fascinated by how different the lives of Alex and Gretchen were but how they found so much common ground. Alex couldn't wait to get out of the small town he grew up in and he has traveled the world, lived in some great and not so great places, and had experiences most people dream about but finds himself wondering if a chance at happiness has passed him by. Gretchen has spent her life on her grandparent's farm after she went to live with them as a small child. Following her grandfather's death she took over managing the farm and earning the money to keep it going. She honestly loves the town and the farm and doesn't mind the hard work but meeting Alex and listening to him talk makes her wonder if she's missed out by not having any adventures. Truly opposites in so many ways yet the minute Alex stepped into her home it seemed like he'd been there forever he charmed Ida (or Gram) as well as their dog, Cocoa and he even managed to rankle Gretchen a bit from the start. I enjoyed watching him go about working on a piece about the town and the football team and rediscovering the joys of his hometown as an adult. I felt like I watched Gretchen blossom when Alex was around and even though she went down kicking and screaming it was easy to see that he made her happy just as she did for him.While we saw quite a few secondary character in this book from both Gretchen and Alex's friends to her grandmother and the football coach and his wife they added to this story. They offered some very wise advice; they were a shoulder to cry on and sometimes delivered a much needed push in the right direction.While it took some time for them to explore the physical side of their relationship, once they did they had some interesting and extremely sexy encounters that I think took them both a bit by surprise.I appreciated the depth of this story and the fact that both the hero and heroine had to make some tough choices about their lives to get to their happy place. Completely entertaining, wonderfully written and surprisingly sexy Defending Hearts is a fantastic addition to this series and I am very excited about what's to come next!Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33HMVAV73X25J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028JK#wasThisHelpful","R33HMVAV73X25J","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Creative, innovative, imaginative are just three words that pop into my mind when I think of the pairing of Cari Quinn and Taryn Elliott. The Boss Vol 1 was all that and more and had me so engrossed that it only took me about three hours to read the story  I honestly couldnt stop until I finished it.Blake is an enigma  I have no idea exactly what his game is or what hes thinking. Why the fascination with glass? Why hire Grace when she wasnt on the list to be interviewed? He has an agenda and I have no idea what it is. I honestly cant wait to find out just what it is, how much he really knows and how hell handle the situation. I know it wont be with kid gloves since that, in no way, would be his style. Hes the Boss  there are reasons why all those other girls left in tears.Graces agenda is abundantly clear  revenge and get her childhood home back. Blake Carson can have anything that he wants in this world. Why would he want her grandmothers beach house? Why buy it out from under her? Where is she going to live? She had no intention of working for him. But, when the opportunity presents itself, she decides that shell do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of things, find out the truth.Hes a slave driver, she puts him in his place. She just cant figure out why hes so cold, so driven. Then, she finds out just how warm he can be and just how much her body craves what only he can give it.So, theres a cliffhanger  I was not a happy person with the way they ended this part of the story. Then, they have the nerve to tell us that Vol 2 is going to be Blakes POV and not a continuance of the storyline. Ugh  at least Ill find out what hes thinking and feeling; just what he knows about Grace and her life. That was the only thing that stopped me from throwing my Kindle.I cant say enough good about the collaboration of Cari Quinn and Taryn Elliott. Their imaginations ran wild in this story. Alone, they are wonderful writers and I love their work. But together, they are spectacular. They wrote intriguing, interesting characters and a story that just flew off the pages. They brought us into the heart of Boston and to the shores of Marblehead. They gave us a strong, independent woman who showed that she could hold her own against the man who is taking everything away from her. They gave us a man whos mysterious, a slave driver and definitely  The Boss.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8UWXHXEZQCY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OBIIVC#wasThisHelpful","R8UWXHXEZQCY7","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsWalk Though Fire is the first Kristen Ashley book I have read that I absolutely didnt love.  I liked it okay, but it just didnt have a love connection with me for some reason.Its a second chance romance but you dont really get into the details of their split right away.  This leaves a lot of chapters open for him to spew hate towards her and the reader not fully understanding the background.  When I say he threw hate her way, he did it in a way that was hard for me to get over once all the details came into play.  Im sure it was just a personal issue, but it didnt sit well with me.This story is a combination of many pieces coming together and its a slow process to build the final puzzle.  There is the history between Millie and High, the addition of his children, MC club business causing issues, the re-connection of a lost love and all this mixed around side characters that play a huge part of the story.  Its a very busy book.Millie was a strong character who sacrificed her own happiness for Highs.  Shes lived her life for everyone else, but hasnt seen her own kind of happy since she let High go.  Once she decided to come clean with him and let him know why she pushed him away, it opens their lives up to one another again.  They have a lot of issues to work through and they eventually get there, but its not an easy road they travel and its full of road blocks.High eventually married and had two girls.  He and Deb never had a love connection and divorced years later.  I thought it was refreshing reading about an ex who was cool and not out to cause s***.  That is a totally new turn, and it worked so well in this story.  I also really like the way his girls were portrayed.  It was an emotional and  very honest take on how children feel when a parent is ready to move on and make a new family.As you can see, there were a lot of things I enjoy about this book, but I just didnt feel a connection to this couple like I have with other books.  I feel like too much time was spent trying to figure everything out and it took a little away from what they needed to build.There is still a lot of unfinished business in the club.  I cant wait to see where the journey of the Chaos crew takes us next.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X6Q0JI7OZ0G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R2X6Q0JI7OZ0G5","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed Cathryn Fox's In the Line of Duty series quite a lot and His Best Friend's Girl is another fine offering in this series. Best friend's since childhood Skylar Redmond and Matt James have been there for each other through life's ups and downs but Skylar is ready for a relationship with someone and enlists the help of Matt not knowing he has had it bad for her for years. Sweet yet sexy with a good dose of complicated His Best Friend's Girl was an entertaining story.I'll admit I'm not a fan of game playing in relationships, I think it kind of devalues the importance of honesty in a relationship, so I wasn't thrilled when Skylar decided to take her friend's advice and ask Matt to help make his other best friend Caleb notice her as a woman and not as the girl who has always been in his life. The thing is I really liked both Skylar and Matt and I flat out loved them together; yes there was an obvious closeness brought about by years of friendship, but it was also easy to see the admiration, trust and love between them even when they didn't recognize it as being ""in love"" as opposed to the love they shared as friends.Matt is one of those quiet but intense heroes and there was no denying that he would do anything for Sky and wanted her to be happy in all aspects of her life. It bothered me he didn't think he was good enough for her and that he didn't feel he could be honest with her about his feelings given their long standing friendship. I get that he didn't want to ruin their friendship but I don't think he realized that her being with someone else would possibly ruin it anyway.Smart and sassy, it was easy to like Sky but I also wondered how she could be so clueless that Matt's attention and his insistence on making sure she was always safe was just out of friendship. It was easy to see her confusion throughout this book especially after their first night together as more than friends.I genuinely liked this story, but I also felt like Sky and Matt got cheated out of the romance of the relationship. They spent so much time talking about Caleb, dealing with Matt's elderly grandmother and feeling awkward after being together physically that they really didn't have time to enjoy each other as a couple in love instead of best friends who slept together ""accidentally"" twice. I'm also going to admit that I found it odd that Sky's friend Kat was so focused on the fact she thought Matt would be kinky in the bedroom and the way it was discussed throughout this book because in honesty Matt wasn't all that kinky and it just seemed unnecessary and strange the way it was brought up and continued throughout this book.While not my favorite book in this series His Best Friend's Girl was still an enjoyable story and getting to see many of the couple's from previous books just added to the enjoyment.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16SKWCXKNHORQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IR66SK#wasThisHelpful","R16SKWCXKNHORQ","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to hand it to Elle Boon. She has one hell of an imagination.  Besides her characters being extremely hot and interesting, she pens a story that has you wanting more and wishing that the next book would release the next day.  Honestly, I couldnt believe how quick this story moved.  I felt like I just started it and I was reading the HEA.  Damn, I really wanted more of Rowan and Lyric and the rest of the Iron Wolves MC.  This looks like it is going to be a fun and interesting series and I can only hope that Syns story comes out soon.Rowan and Lyric were wonderful together.  She has sass and he has a heart of gold.  Ex-military and alpha as all get out, Rowan just grabs you from his first appearance in the story and has you falling hard for him in not time  Fearless, doesnt back down from anyone or anything.  Compassionate, caring and oh so dominant in bed, he is definitely a match made in heaven for the Iron Wolves MC and Lyric.Lyric doesnt take anything from anybody either.  Her brother is very protective but there isnt much he could do about Rowan or the accidental turning of him.  He can push around his weight and be immediately told off by Lyric and Syn. Lyric is fearless and just as caring as Rowan.  She really felt bad about turning Rowan about not being able to get him through his first shift without any pain, about not giving him any choices.  But, she wanted him and was not about to walk away from that.Together, they face the threats, her brother Xan, Kellen and the rest of the MC to be together.  Together they explode in bed.  Together they will make a life for themselves, acclimate Rowan to being a wolf and in the MC.Lyrics Accidental Mate was actually fun to read.  Elle interspersed the fun with the serious, the sexy with the erotic.  All the characters were interesting and have me looking forward to more of the Iron Wolves MC.  Syn is next and I cannot wait to see who she ends up mating.  Elle left a lot of room as to who it will be.  Now, I know who I would love to see her with but Im not sure if she will take the easy way out and put her there.  And, thats the other thing that I adore about Ms. Boons writing  she writes what we least expect.  She makes sure that you have to wonder where she is taking the story and the characters.  Nope, didnt expect Rowan to just accept the supernatural being he became  see, logically, he should have fought it, asked more questions  thats what I was expecting and didnt get that at all.  I got a fun story with two characters that were totally hot and adorable.  Thank you, Elle for keeping us on our toes, keeping us guessing and giving us wonderful stories.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R251Q3SX3UHX6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MCEQSC#wasThisHelpful","R251Q3SX3UHX6I","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsPrevious books in Pamela Clares I-Team romantic suspense series are fast-moving, full of action with unexpected twists and turns, and her latest release, Seduction Game, is no different. It was everything we know and love, and over the years have come to expect from this gifted storyteller. This is a story of deceit, regained trust, ultimate sacrifice, and of course, love.I love when an author takes a character and completely changes everything you thought you knew about them. Holly is that character. Although shes a great friend, loyal and always there when you need her, she also comes across as shallow, materialistic, and tries to live up to her Horny Holly nickname.However, things are not always as they seem. On the surface, she is fun and care-free, but once we delve into this seemingly artificial bombshell we find a complicated and multilayered woman. There are secrets about her I did not see coming. She is my favorite type of heroine, a fearless kick-ass woman with lots of spunk, confidence, sex appeal, and intelligence.Nick is someone the fans have not met until this book. Hes not exactly in a good place, driven by revenge after his girlfriend and fellow agent was killed in a CIA mission gone badly. Now Nick is on his own mission with an agenda to kill the man responsible for her death. Nick is a conflicted guy and even as the story intensifies he cant decide if Holly is who his agency says she is. The fact that she turns him on and inside out with her wit and beauty isnt helping matters either.Hold on for a wild ride while Nick and Holly butt heads, heat up the sheets, and do everything in their power to stay one step ahead of the bad guys who just so happen to be on both sides of the law. Its a keep you on the edge of your seat kind of read, a real page turner. Not only do I highly recommend this book, I recommend the entire series.I can honestly and without hesitation say, Ive never read a Pamela Clare book that I didnt like. She is a hardworking, true professional, and Im thrilled to have her well and writing again. I cant wait to see what she has in store for us next.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVKF39FKUPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KUWWAM#wasThisHelpful","R3VVKF39FKUPE","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series is killing me! I can't take it every time I read one of the books I fall for the Billionaire, then the next book comes out and Darn you Jessica Clare I find myself loving the newest Billionaire more.  I was so ready to HATE Chelsea.  I mean a hot girl who does Roller Derby is not worhty of my time, I mean the billionaires time.  But she was written so perfectly I fell in love with her too.  Darn you again Jessica Clare.Sebastian was written so perfectly and he truly had the ego to match his bank account, but had the humble shy quiet loving nature that made me want to jump into my kindle and cuddle.  Chelsea had the beautiful heart, the truly heart breaking broken girl issues, but she smiled and she laughed and she loved loyally.  It was impossible not to close your eyes and wish for the happy ending at the end.  I am sure I'll eat my words but I dont see how the next couple can compete with these two.  Together they were by far the most enjoyable couple to read about this year!Review copy provided for an honest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J8FLGCZBVY1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV124TO#wasThisHelpful","R1J8FLGCZBVY1O","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Annnnnd, Kristin Daniels did Leave Me Breathless, sexually frustrated and oh, so happy that I read this compilation of books by a new-to-me author. She really is making me want to go and get her other books.Three very different stories with one main theme . Three hot men and the women that they will do anything for  will do anything to win their love  will love and protect for the rest of their lives. Throw in the hot, kinky sex and you have three stories that will fill your heart with love and wishing for more of these three awesome couples.Brynn and Ryan were a match made in heaven, until he ruined it all. Now, blindsiding her as her leading man in her new movie and trying to win her back, he has to prove to her that he has changed and will love her the way she deserves to be loved, forever.Eden and Shane. The hot rocker and the graphic artist that has had nothing but wet dreams about him for as long as she could remember. But, when the past is revealed and their tryst is captured by the paparazzi, will she let go of her control for long enough to grab the brass ring in front of her and jump on the roller coaster ride that is waiting for her with Shane? She just may enjoy her bonus for a job well done on his album cover.Mia and Logan  two like minds who are vying for the same position. But, with a little help from her grandmother and a little magic, they find themselves in positions that Mia never thought were possible. Finding love at first sight was just a little something extra to the off the chart sex that they fell into within the first five minutes of meeting each other.Now, none of these woman had a submissive bone in their bodies. Each of them stood on their own two feet, were strong and strong-willed. But, the dominance that each of these men showed when they took control of their bodies was hotter than hot. Yes, each of the characters fell into sex rather quickly but these are three short stories so it was kind of expected. And, kudos to Ms. Daniels for giving us off the chart sexual encounters with three happily-ever-afters that really made me smile.Hot men, the women that bring them to their knees, love and lust all combined in the three stories to bring us an exciting read that will definitely leave you breathless.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWO3CBTX8ZPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NQEHGI#wasThisHelpful","R3VWO3CBTX8ZPV","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love it!  I have the Kindle Keyboard, the Paperwhite, a Galaxy tablet, an iPad and now this one.  This on is by far my favorite size, it's easy to hold and perfect size to carry in a purse.

"I'm kinda in love with MK Meredith after reading Seducing Seven because she wrote a book about a romance writer who loves her job, knows what she needs to do to be successful, is grateful for her fans and will defend romance books until her last breath.  I know you'll are wondering why this is such a big deal, well I'll tell you; lately I've read a few books that featured romance writers as a main character and they either thought they were wasting their time, didn't respect their readers or decided that it was in their best interest to stop writing romance and write a ""real"" book and for a lover of this genre that doesn't set well with me!In Las Vegas for a big book convention romance author Seven Michaels is trying to escape and overzealous male fan who thinks he's going to get lucky with her over the weekend when she enlists the help of Blake Turner, a random man in the elevator.  From that moment, it was game on for these two and when Blake finds out what Seven does for a living she makes him a bet she can make him have feelings for her by the end of the convention.Seven was a spitfire heroine and I loved that Blake made her act out of character a bit; made her go for it and put herself out there.  She never backed down on her profession, she was proud of what she does and her accomplishments as she should be and while a couple of times Blake made her feel bad and had her feeling off balance and a little insecure she held her ground.  I liked Blake for the most part and honestly I believe he was a good guy but things moved really fast for him and left him feeling out of control which made him act out and say some really hateful things.  I'll admit there were a couple of times I wanted to bop him upside the head, but thankfully he figured things out and made amends.So many of their interactions were playful, fun and very, very sexy and it was easy to feel their connection from their first kiss to their last. While they were both hoping to win the bet it became obvious pretty quickly they both were feeling way more than either of them wanted to admit.Sensual, smart and supremely satisfying don't miss MK Meredith's Seducing Seven.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24THLJ7C34MMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLZ6X2#wasThisHelpful","R24THLJ7C34MMW","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsI wasn't sure what to expect from A Lover's Lament, I have never read KL Grayson before and while I've followed BT Urruela's fitness and modeling career I wasn't aware he was an author, but after reading this book I look forward to reading more from both authors. This was not a pretty romance; this book deals with heart break, death, anger, war, forgiveness, anger, sadness and a forever kind of love we all hope to find. I loved this story and it was brilliantly written; told in first person from two points of view we were given a window into the lives, thoughts and emotional trauma each of these characters experienced throughout this book.A short prologue sets up this book and then it really begins 10 years after with Katie waking up after a car accident. She is not in a good place and for several chapters we see her struggling with life and her ""new"" normal. When her therapist suggests she should engage with a military pen pal she finds a familiar name on the list and decides to lay it all out on the line and unleash all of her pain. She never expects to feel so much as she writes the first letter or how much Devin's response affects her.I loved reading their letters to each other which progressed into emails and eventually into phone calls. Ten years after Devin left; it is easy to tell from the correspondence that they both were unable to erase the other one completely from their memory and the feelings pour through their words to one another.Watching Katie go from a very angry and closed off woman to one who wants more out of life, one that is actually living again and one that will even admit she is happy was pretty amazing to watch. I'll admit reading Devin's war accounts and the toll it was taking on him and his fellow soldiers was hard, but I felt very realistic. As they both being to realize that the feelings they once had were still there; they fell hard and fast and came to rely on the communication they both so desperately needed to stay connected so far away from one another.They faced some very hard times both apart and together and through it all their love remained strong, they both believed they had some divine intervention and they never lost hope that they would finally get their chance to have the life they both wanted together.A Lover's Lament will touch your soul and you will feel every emotion as you read this couple's intense and beautiful journey and it is absolutely a book you do not want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311N71B2VJF3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FVO6LS#wasThisHelpful","R311N71B2VJF3P","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an interesting little novella, with a quirky plot, some sizzling sex scenes and likable characters.Hannah Roberts runs the Tavern she inherited from her grandfather in Loving, Kansas. She has a crush on two of the men who play poker each week in her establishment, but knows the two gay men aren't for her. Brody Markham andDrew Pate are in a BDSM relationship, but they aren't gay, they are bisexual. Both are drawn to Hannah, but neither has acted on the attraction until circumstances throw them all together. Can Hannah become the submissive the two men are seeking? Can she handle that her lovers have each other as well as her? And can they all stay safe when her abusive ex-husband arrives to try and claim half the Tavern-even though he and Hannah were divorced when she inherited it.Hannah is portrayed as a strong woman who is willing to turn some of her decision making over to the two men who love her. What's not to love about Brody-strong, protective and dominant. Mainly because Drew is a sub to Brody, is it harder to see him as a dominant for Hannah-although he does prove to be equal to the task.Overall, a sexy little read.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHCFCWWWPZKBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PT3DFQ#wasThisHelpful","RHCFCWWWPZKBF","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsStunned...that's what I am as Crosswinds ended. I shouldn't be, because well teenage girls can be mean and ruthless, but I am. In Elisabeth Naughton's episode of this epic small town tale, we are drawn more into the lives of the younger members of Storm, Texas. We see one girl desperately trying to hang on to the boy that has come to mean so much to her, we see that girl's best friend break her trust, we see a confused young man, and that young man's best friend wondering not only what in the hell is wrong with him but trying to console the girl he obviously has feelings for who was wronged. So much happens in this story and while the high school set is front and center there are several other developments that just add to the drama, the intrigue and the overall intensity of this series.I am so drawn to these characters and their crazy, screwed up lives and with this younger crowd how they don't think about how their actions will affect so many people in so many different ways. In addition we see Ginny Moreno whose pregnancy has rocked this small town drawn to a man she once had a crush on as he returns from his time in the service. Given the secrets she carries with her I'm very curious as to where this will lead.With each installment the story becomes more complex, more intertwined and definitely more twisted and there is no doubt a storm is brewing and the aftermath will most likely blow everyone away. While Ms. Naughton's episode dealt with different characters in this saga, the story flowed seamlessly from the last one and I am in awe of the way these authors are blending their voices and their styles to create this amazing and startling tale.Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13G5K7RF6DXI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJ05GW#wasThisHelpful","R13G5K7RF6DXI1","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christmas in Mustang County looked cute and sweet when I read the blurb and it definitely lived up to my expectations even though I am nowhere near ready for the Christmas season to begin.The story is centered around Charlotte and Jax  his quest to win her back and her quest to try to convince herself that Mustang Creek is not the place for her. Theres nothing exciting, nothing high-powered and certainly not a place for her to apply her advertising degree. But it does have certain charms to it. The friends she grew up with, cozy little stories and, now, Jaxon.Jaxon tolerated the big city but, when he got the call to go back to Idaho, he was concerned for his father but excited to return to the wide open spaces, blue skies and the animals that he loved. His biggest regret was leaving Charlie. He tried to convince her that she should give it a chance, give him a chance but she wouldnt. Stalking her FB page, he finds out that shes going back to Mustang Creek. He doesnt know if she is there to stay but it is worth moving there and taking the job offer from his friend to help out at his Veterinary Clinic.A little bit of magic, a lot of meddling from the adorable Mrs. Klozz, the love of animals, a secluded cabin and a sleigh ride were all working against Charlotte and definitely in favor of Jax. Then throw in good meaning friends and planting a little idea into the right minds and Charlotte falls harder than the snow during a blizzard.So, yes, the story was adorable but  it really moved a little too quickly for me. Charlotte was in love with Jax when they were in New York and their chemistry was off the charts. I love how fate kept throwing them together from the moment they both set foot in Mustang Creek. But, she just kept giving me whiplash. No, she wasnt falling into his arms or bed; yes, she was; well, maybe she will; aw, what the hell, she cant fight it. I was happy that she was giving into the magic that was being woven around them but I was also stunned. But, Jax didnt surprise me at all  he was determined to make her see her place in Mustang Creek, in his bed and in his life, forever.Linda Lael Miller actually brought the sweetness factor up a notch with this story filling it with every known decadent desert you could possibly imagine. Mrs. Klozz and Aunt Geneva, Mutley, Can-Can and Felix lit up this story and brought the fun factor into the book. She made sure that we understood what Charlie and Jax were thinking and how they got where they were by weaving their pasts into the present  made sure that we are still wondering just who Mrs. Klozz really was  she made sure that we smiled throughout the whole story. These are all characteristics that I truly love in an author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNV9NR72FSM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWTYXC2#wasThisHelpful","R2FNV9NR72FSM1","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsA vacation from home turns into a TRUE Fairytale. This story has insta-love,hot times, fun friends and an ""international incident"". I really enjoyed this book. I truly am such a sucker for fairytales and being swept away in them. To imagine yourself to be seen by a prince who is can we say HAWT! Kristos is hot and a rebellious Prince with flaws. Oh you read that right Flaws. And Emmaline is a broken girl who had to give up her dreams. I know you see where this is going. But trust me when I saw Jennfier Chance takes you there in the most enjoyable way. As with most fairytales I've read the plot seems predictable I loved the current times spin on this tale. I found myself enjoying the characters of the book and did find that Emmaline and Kristos were definitely the stars of the book, all the supporting characters faded to the background until the end.I'm excited and can't wait for the next in the series just to come back to my fairytale land of Garronia.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D8LGTUFM8LN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A6OY78#wasThisHelpful","R3D8LGTUFM8LN2","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erin Nicholas is known for writing fun, flirty and sexy stories of life and love; in her latest release, Illegal Motion, she offers up an intense, deep and extremely emotional story and proves she can not only stretch her writing muscle but excel at it as well. Two people with a connection are reunited 6 months after the death of his best friend and her fianc, and must not only deal with the fallout from a memorable night they all three shared, but revelations from that night and regrets of time wasted. This was not a pretty or fun romance; it was a little dark, poignant and their journey took time, patience and the wisdom of friends to help them find the happiness they both so richly deserve.There was no doubt Carter Shaw was in a deep, dark place and being at the wedding of friends isnt helping. Carter doesnt believe in romance, in love or marriage and babies; hes seen what loves does to people up close as his Dad changes wives like he changes his underwear. Plus the one woman hes had feelings for is someone he would never want to hurt and he knows hell end up hurting with his inherited possessiveness.Lacey Andrews wanted to surprise Carter but getting the wrong house and then having to deal with not only an angry couple but Carter in full out police mode wasnt quite the surprise she had in mind. I admired Lacey for taking a chance and going after what she wants, but most of all for sticking to her guns and not letting Carter hide from her or his feelings.While this was a journey of two people trying to find a way to be together as a couple, there was a third person with them if only in their memories. I hurt for them both as they struggled to not only preserve their memories of Garrett, but as they realized how much they both needed one another. While Lacey was engaged to Garrett they had talked about Carter a lot and she had really taken time since his death to not only come to terms with it but to also realize that the other half of her heart belonged to Carter. Carter had not taken time to grieve or even really come to terms with the type of relationship Garrett and Lacey had wanted with him or for the time they lost because of him. To be honest Carter was kind of a mess and in many pieces but Lacey was the glue that was able to put him together. I appreciated the fact that Carter thought he needed help to make Lacey happy and was willing to do anything to keep her, but seriously he really went off the deep end a couple of times trying to find someone to step in an help him. I have to give Nolan a lot of credit for not only being a good friend to both Carter and Lacey but for trying to show Carter how way off base he was with his thinking. I also have to say that the scene in the bar with Oakley (from Mari Carrs Red Zone) was flat out hilarious and gave them both some much needed perspective.Hot, intense and emotional Illegal Motion shows a different side of author Erin Nicholas writing and an amazing addition to the Boys of Fall series.Review copy provided for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNVNG2DBR0LQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0118FIX3Q#wasThisHelpful","RNVNG2DBR0LQZ","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsI do so love when author Mari Carr serves up a sexy as hell mnage and Red Zone, her latest offering in the Boys of Fall series, is pretty much perfection. Two men; best friends for a long time and ranch hands at the same ranch decide they are tired of chasing after the woman of their dreams and offer her a night shell never forget. A secret relationship, an unconventional love, family drama, guilt, passion, and a love they cant deny all made Red Zone a page turner from start to finish and a book I know Ill want to read again and again.I loved the offbeat, snarky, and strong Sadie Milligan. Working in her fathers bad and being raised only by her Dad for most of her life Sadie isnt the typical girl next door in small Quinn, Texas. Shes outspoken, shes tattooed, she cusses, and she loves colorful hair. Sadie really is a breath of fresh air, but Sadie doesnt date much, but she finds it impossible to resist Joel and his best friend, Oakley.Three people; two very open in their sexuality and another one struggling due to his very religious upbringing made this a very intricate relationship. It was pretty fascinating watching these three people work through so many different and conflicting issues as they pursue being together in all ways.Sadie being abandoned by her mother at a young age worries shell never be able to have a committed relationship and that shell be a bad mother and while shes all good with some great sex she struggles with feelings and everything that comes with a relationship. Joel has the reputation of being cool, calm, collected, steady and a stand-up guy; hes got a good reputation and has lived his life in Quinn being raised by his dedicated but strict Catholic mother. As their relationship progresses and Joel must face the fact that he has feelings for not only Sadie but Oakley as well. And Oakleyman, I love this guy! Theres no doubt Oakley lucked out by NOT having family in town, but then he also claims his parents are pretty open about things. I loved that he pushed Joel but backed off when it became evident Joel was conflicted and that he was upfront with Sadie about what he wanted for the three of them even when he knew it might scare her. Together these three were so amazingly sexy but there was also an unbelievable closeness that went beyond sexual; it was quite beautiful watching these three not only learn so much about themselves but each other as well.Im just going to say it, I loved these three and their journey so much and I would very much love a follow up story to see not only how their relationship has progressed, but how the tiny Texas town of Quinn reacts to their unconventional lifestyle. Explosive, entertaining and amazingly sexy you dont want to miss Mari Carrs Red Zone!Review copy provided for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQCVXTE182Z3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010YH423Y#wasThisHelpful","RLQCVXTE182Z3","A3LXRIY0HE71K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LXRIY0HE71K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm an avid griller and so I was excited to try the Maverick remote monitoring temperature probe. I have a high-end FireMagic grill that has a built-in temperature probe, and while it's accurate and easy to use, you need to stay within a few feet of the grill to really use it, and this just isn't convenient when smoking or roasting larger meats that take a long time. Plus, a few times I've run out of fuel while grilling...I usually don't notice until I go check the grill, and by then it's gone cold. Having temperature monitoring capabilities that could work from a distance sounded like a great idea.The probes are easy to use - pretty much what you'd expect: insert, turn it on and your done. Of course, the trick is knowing where to place the probe, and the optimum location differs for every type of meat. Still, with a little experience, you can get perfect and repeatable results every time. With some practice, you'll be pulling stuff off the grill confident that you're really getting the rare/medium/well temperatures your friends and family ask for.As promised, the monitor works from at least a few hundred feet. With my grill outside, I found I got perfect connection up to about 200 feet, and some signal out to about 300 feet, and that's with the thick stainless steel cover on my grill closed. I could also go just about anywhere in my home, and even with up to four exterior and interior walls between me and my grill, I had no trouble staying connected. I've also used these in my indoor oven with the same great results.About the only concern I have is the upper temperature limit on the probes. The manufacturer says they are safe up to 572 degrees, but I know from experience that my 140,000 BTU grill can reach almost 1000 degrees. I seldom use it at those kinds of temperatures, but I do wonder what happens when that 572 degree value is exceeded.Otherwise, these are well made products at a fair price. If you're the type who holds your breath when you make that first cut into your meat, fearing that it might be underdone or overdone, this is for you - definitely worth a look if you grill a lot and struggle to hit the right doneness every time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GQI9CLOI0T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BOX5VE#wasThisHelpful","R6GQI9CLOI0T9","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit fanatic about my toast, and the Dash does a good job at a fair price.The unique see-through sides help you get exactly the result you want without lifting your toast out to check on it. In a conventional toaster, it seems like every time you raise your toast, it cools off a bit and tends to make the final product a bit on the soggy side. With the Dash, you don't have this problem...your toast keeps right on cooking until you're sure it's the doneness you want - never seen this sort of feature before, but it's great.Otherwise, it's reasonably well made and performs as well as most of the other toasters I've tried. The overall look is sort of retro, the red color is bold and it certainly makes a statement. The red parts and knobs are mostly a plastic material...it's not as rugged as some of the high end toasters you might see, but it's definitely more than adequate to meet the demands of most kitchens. On mine, the fit and finish is okay but not perfect...there are a few scratches and rough spots here and there, and the controls feel a bit loose. An added plus is that it's pretty simple to clean.The heating elements appear to be some type of ceramic. They seem to heat quickly and evenly, and the outside of the toaster doesn't get particularly hot unless you toast item after item in quick succession. It's not as fast as some others I've tried, but it certainly puts out enough heat to toast whatever you put into it. I did notice that there was a tendency to concentrate heat towards the center of the toaster, but with a few uses, you sort of figure this part out.If you're after a cool looking toaster and like the bold red, then this is definitely worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XRLKPDPORY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGCKZNE#wasThisHelpful","R27XRLKPDPORY9","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned many Epson printers over the years, and most have been reliable, competent performers. The PictureMate is what I use for quick prints from my phone or point-and-shoot camera when I just want a small print to share with a minimum of fuss.For me, setup was really easy and I was printing from my iPhone 6P in under five minutes from taking the printer out of the box. This printer is made for wireless, no matter what type of device or computer you have. Apple AirPrint support is very good, and it also works with Windows and Android. If you have WiFi, you can probably print to this device. You can also plug your memory card directly into the printer, review images on the built-in screen and print whatever photos you like. This is handy for cameras and devices lacking WiFi - no cables to attach. And yes, if you really want, you can even USB connect this printer to a computer.Overall, the print quality is quite good for this type of device. I'm a photographer and I have one of Epson's high-end Stylus Pro 4900 series printers that is simply the best image quality I've ever seen. For my review, I printed the same image on the PictureMate and on the 4900...I won't say that I couldn't tell the difference - but I was pleasantly surprised by just how good the PictureMate looked in a side-by-side comparison. Although I haven't done a scientific comparison by any means, I prefer the Epson look to that I've seen from similar Canon or HP products. A lot of printers can be tweaked to perform a certain way, but I like that with minimal adjustment, the Epson puts out prints that look good and last a long time.The Achilles heel to the PictureMate is probably the cost per page, which can be up to about 40 cents per 4x6 print. Still, the image quality, fast speed and overall performance probably warrant the premium price.If you're looking for a convenient, high-quality 4x6/5x7 photo printer, the Epson PictureMate might just be what you've been searching for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TNTX8FNCATU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KU0RIA#wasThisHelpful","R19TNTX8FNCATU","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been impressed by a few Lee products recently, and this shirt is no exception. It's inexpensive, but well-made - and best of all, it's comfortable and good-looking on me. The fabric is somewhat on the thin side (compared to say, a Ralph Lauren polo), but thanks to a bit of stretchiness, it always looks smooth without that crumpled some low-cost shirts have.The 5-button style is nice, the collar is well proportioned, and the sleeves are just the right length for me. I'm on the tall side, so I might like another inch of length or so, but it's by no means too short.Although I've only washed it a few times, it seems to hold up well without fading or shrinking.Overall, this is a great shirt at a fair price - congrats to Lee for another great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEW55J1P61RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012P2FLYK#wasThisHelpful","R1WEW55J1P61RL","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are some great inexpensive jeans that fit and look terrific.The fabric is indeed ""ultra soft"" and a medium weight, and it has a bit of stretch to it. I found the fit ""skinniest"" at the cuffs, less so through the waist and hips...depending on your shape, you might find them a bit loose up top.They also seem well made for jeans in this price range. The front pockets are a bit shallow. The color is a little on the indigo - almost purple - side, but it fades nicely after a few washings. As the sticker on the jeans says, they are subject to a lot of dye transfer, so definitely be careful where you sit until they've been washed several times - and of course, be careful what you wash them with.It's nice to see a great pair of jeans that you don't have to spend a fortune on...great job Lee!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJL7UNGG51T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RLMEI2#wasThisHelpful","R1LJL7UNGG51T3","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased four of these for my business to wall mount in our conference rooms, and so far we are very happy with them.There are lots of input options that make this a great monitor for business use. We generally connect using a mix of the built-in wireless client and Apple TV, although sometimes visitors will opt for a direct HDMI connection. All of them look wonderful, even the Apple TV (which is limited to 1080p). A recent model computer putting out a 4K signal over HDMI looks amazing on this monitor - best we've seen, certainly at this price point.For business use, the need is a little different than home theater, and the Samsung does a great job with text and graphics. Colors are bright and saturated, contrast is good enough to make reading text easy from across the room, and even in a brightly lit room, the monitor is easy to see. I would be more critical if this were going in my home theater: blacks and grays aren't terrific, and there's definitely a bit of visible light blooming across the bottom of the screen. These aren't issues for business presentations, but I'd definitely find them distracting in a home theater setup.The built-in sound quality is fine for our business needs. Again, if I were thinking of this for my home theater, I'd probably have some sort of multi-channel sound system, so audio quality might not be too important. But if you're thinking of just using the built-in sound, you'll be disappointed - you'll at least want to opt for a sound bar and maybe a subwoofer.The remote control is okay for what it is...all the functions are there, and Samsung thoughtfully publishes the IR command codes on their web site so you can control the monitor from most automation systems. Like most smaller remotes, it's no joy entering lots of text, like you might find yourself doing when setting up your WiFi or when entering information into some of the built-in apps. The built-in WiFi is a nice feature and it seems more than fast enough to keep up with the content...as a test, we played some native 4K content from both Amazon and Netflix and the network seemed to have no trouble keeping up.I'm not a huge fan of most of the apps that come on this (or any other) TV...many are poor quality, and most seem rendered in fuzzy, low-resolution ways. Again, this isn't an issue for us in our business setting, but for home theater use, I'm hoping the latest Apple TV catches on and that we eventually end up with millions of high quality apps that can take advantage of our 4K monitors. Still seems like a distant goal though.Being fairly light for this screen size (65"" weighs about 52 pounds), they're relatively painless to wall mount. We chose an articulating mount that can come 18"" off the wall and pivot about 60 degrees right or left. Our office walls are backed by thin steel studs that aren't hugely strong, but we felt confident to use snap toggles to handle the weight. Last monitor we had was nearly 150 pounds, and our walls needed all sorts of reinforcement to carry the load. One issue we had was that the VESA mounting holes are set unusually deep into the TV. The 1.5"" bolts that came with our mount weren't long enough to reach the deeply set nuts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBJ70YC9B1Q4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T48CVWE#wasThisHelpful","R1VBJ70YC9B1Q4","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last ViewSonic product I purchased was a large 17"" CRT monitor many years ago...it was great for it's day (still have it, actually!), so we felt comfortable turning to them again. We needed a bunch of monitors for our offices so that visiting workers could have a place to dock, and the ViewSonic VA2465 was the model we selected.For the price, they are actually very nice monitors - way better than similar units we tried from Acer and a few other brands. Our workers have a mix of different computers, Macs to Windows, and portables through small form factor Intel NUC computers running Linux. There are both VGA and HDMI inputs, and the good news is that whatever we connect to the ViewSonic monitors just works first time with no hassles at all - and they all produce a clean, crisp display.The monitor itself is small, lightweight and unobtrusive in our environment. The image is bright and high contrast, and it renders text quite well. The viewing angle is good, and you don't need to sit directly in front of the monitor to get a reasonable image. The built-in speakers are fine for office use. We don't use them for gaming, but they seem ""fast"" compared to others we've used. Power use is low, as an added benefit.We have a total of six of these, and exactly zero have bad or bright pixels. They are all calibrated equally out of the box, and this also speaks well to the quality ViewSonic is delivering.Can't really say enough good things about these monitors - for the price, they're a steal in this size and resolution. Definitely recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQF0BBAT5C7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPJOQQ8#wasThisHelpful","R1DQF0BBAT5C7V","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are terrific and very small memory sticks that I use in all sorts of places.On the USB 3 port on my network router, I get a quick way to share 64GB of data with the devices in my network. On my multi-function printer, I get a quick way to scan documents to a memory stick without needing to install software or drivers on my computers. Even in my car, I can keep my digital music collection on one of these without tethering my phone. And of course, I always carry a few in the backpack should I need to share files with anyone.The construction quality is good, but these are really tiny devices - about the size of a penny. Although the small size makes it convenient to carry a bunch of these in your pocket, I'm finding that the small size is sometimes a curse - they can be difficult to insert or to grasp when removing them from certain PCs. Otherwise, performance is quite good - especially on USB 3 devices...certainly faster than moving big files over a network.At the price, they're a bargain, and if you like the really small form factor, they are definitely worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36C3KW5W3ZPNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNI4YWA#wasThisHelpful","R36C3KW5W3ZPNG","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was having a problem at my vacation home where my cable modem would hang about once a week, causing me to lose contact with my monitoring and automation systems. More than once I needed to make the 700 mile trip, just to reset the cable modem.I figured a relatively low-tech timer like the Intermatic DT620 could be used to power off/on the cable modem once a day, and this is exactly what it does. I programmed it to be on for about 23 hours and 50 minutes a day - it switches off at 1:01AM for ten minutes, then back on...this seems to work great and it's saved me from several outages.The device itself is well made and seems to have way more than enough capacity for my use (the equipment I have plugged into it consume less than 100 watts). It's physically larger than I wished is was - you definitely can't use two of them in a single outlet.Programming is a bit complex, but once you get the hang of it, it's not terrible - and of course, it's not like you're doing the programming every day. Still, I'd say if you want complex programming, you're probably better off with the z-Wave version of this unit and relying on a home automation controller to send the ON/OFF commands.Overall, the DT620 is a solid product and seems to be doing just what I want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GOQ9TSJGKGBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TGO6RY#wasThisHelpful","R3GOQ9TSJGKGBD","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I studied every available machine for a long time before buying the Profitec. If you're a coffee fanatic, this is a great choice for making excellent espresso - now, and for a very long time.The unit itself is impeccably made and quite study. Unlike some of the super-automatics that seem to be more plastic than metal, this puppy is stainless steel all around, from the drip tray to the brew group to the cup warmer. Out of the box, it's over 70 pounds of metal. Under the pretty exterior is a serious set of coffee-making bona fides: dual stainless steel boilers, quiet rotary vane pump, sophisticated PID system with precise temperature control, shot timer, plumbed or tank operation - pretty much everything you could want in a high-end espresso machine.It's also designed for longevity and easy service. I'm always impressed when a product looks like it's built with care on the inside, where most people might not ever look - and the Profitec has this in spades. Everything comes apart easily, and it's no big deal to isolate a part for replacement without packing the whole thing up to send back to the manufacturer. There's a great video (search YouTube) revealing the internal construction...by all means have a look if you're so inclined.I also like that the brewer accommodates rather large mugs...if you don't mind buying an extra bottomless portafilter, you can generally fit a four to five inch mug under the brewer - many machines are limited to shot-glass sized cups. I also like that even though it's a dual boiler design, it runs fine on a standard 15 AMP residential circuit. A few other machines I auditioned required more...and while I could have a 20A circuit installed, this would have been an added cost and inconvenience.One additional feature I'd like to see is a built in timer. Machines like this tend to take a while to heat up - like twenty minutes - and so it would be nice to have it pop on at a preset time each day. Of course, you can use an external appliance timer for this...just feels like it would be a good built-in feature. Still, I do like that this is pretty much a ""minimalist"" machine with no frills beyond what it takes to make excellent espresso.But of course the proof is in the taste of what pours into your cup, and here is where the Profitec excels. With high quality beans (I like Kona and JBM), this machine produces some of the finest espresso I've ever tasted, and unlike other machines I've used, once I have it all dialed in, I'm able to reproduce the same exact taste shot after shot. I use a Baratza Forte grinder and a calibrated tamper to give me the same tamping pressure on every shot. Couple this with bottled water in the Profitec and a careful eye on the shot timer, and I get very repeatable results, shot after shot.The steam boiler is also impressive on the Profitec. With my old single-boiler system, I used to make milk drinks by heating the milk in my microwave while the coffee was brewing - there just wasn't a big difference between doing it this way and using the steamer on the espresso machine. Nothing could be further from the truth with the Profitec...the steamed milk and gentle foam it makes is a delight in any cappuccino - I'm even pouring artful looking drinks because the consistency is so perfect...something I never even tried before on lesser machines.One final complaint is that I don't like the placement of the internal tank at the back of the machine. To fill it, you really need to get to the right rear of the unit. If you have it even partially tucked under cabinetry, this means you'll be lifting a 75 pound machine every time it needs filling. To me, a better design would be a fill port at the front of the machine. Of course, you can plumb the Profitec and never have to worry about filling it - perhaps this is what they really intend, except I like the consistency I get from using the same brand of bottled water over and over, rather than putting my city water supply through it.Of course, the Profitec is expensive. so it's probably not for everyone. You really need a good quality grinder to get the best from it, and by the time you've got tampers, a few extra portafilters and all the other accessories, you're spending something around four thousand dollars to get a nice cup of expresso. With practice, you can make amazing espresso on the stovetop in a $25 espresso pot, and the Profitec costs as much as about 150 of these. Still, if you and your significant other are paying Starbucks $10/day for a few latte's, the Profitec will pay for itself in a year or two.Anyway, on the journey to the perfect cup of coffee, the Profitec 700 is definitely a worthwhile companion. Definitely recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UV7OOTB8CCPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY6372K#wasThisHelpful","R1UV7OOTB8CCPQ","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had last year's LG 34 UM95 monitor which was generally very good, but unfortunately, not very good with text...I always found fine detail on small point sizes looked too fuzzy and were often surrounded by fringes of red or purple, making the monitor difficult to read. I had a chance to swap the UM95 for this new UM97, and the differences are fairly substantial - in a positive direction.The monitor itself isn't exactly built like a tank - it's compact, lightweight and easy to move around. To me, these are all positives. Some of the controls are a bit frustrating...it falls into power save mode way too fast for me, and it takes a deft hand to swap between sources quickly. Still, no compatibility issues with the variety of devices I've connected, including Windows, Mac and Linux PCs, Apple TV, tablets through HDMI and so forth.Otherwise, the image quality is where this guy really shines. Bright and punchy, vivid colors, sharp - very much the perfect display for medium to dim rooms...in bright light, it's okay - but I might look closer at one of the Samsung products instead.

I've read all Mark's books, and I find this to be his most compelling work to date.You have to feel that if enough people would only read and understand this book, the USA would be a very different country, indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBSIWM1LODM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451606303#wasThisHelpful","R3PBSIWM1LODM9","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a serious immersion blender from one of the big name brands (Viking), and I was curious how this Oster would stack up. Honestly, at literally one-tenth the price, I didn't have high expectations for the Oster - but in nearly every case, I've been surprised at just how good the Oster is.Okay, in terms of construction quality and the feel in operation, the Viking is clearly the champ. It should be, given the price difference. But otherwise, the differences are fairly subtle. The motors are both more than powerful enough for any task I tried, and both are about the same in terms of cleanup, storage and so forth.I notice the size of the actual blades on the Oster is a bit small, and it is substantially louder and more vibration-prone in your hand. As other reviewers point out, it could also benefit from a slower speed. The Oster doesn't seem quite as durable as my Viking (which is five years old and still like new), but I doubt it's ten times less...you could almost treat the Oster as a disposable, given the cost difference. Otherwise, I'm hard pressed to find any significant differences. For the price, this little Oster blender is definitely a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYR74JI9KX1B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMH7URG#wasThisHelpful","RYR74JI9KX1B7","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm lucky enough to have one of the world's best grills (FireMaster), but sometimes I just want a quick and easy alternative that can be cooked right in the kitchen without heading outdoors, and this is where the George Foreman comes in handy.Putting it together was a snap - maybe five minutes, at most. From there, it's simple to use - heats quickly and evenly, cooks well without a lot of smoke, and when you're all done, cleans up without a fuss.Make no mistake: it doesn't get as hot as a proper charcoal or gas grill, so there's not quite as much grill flavor as you'd get on a higher power grill, but for a quick burger or such, it does the job. It's also hard to char food beyond recognition...in a sense, the less powerful George Foreman grill is more forgiving that way. Keep in mind the lower power and smaller surface area makes it best suited for small groups - it would take a long time to do, say, a dozen burgers on this guy.Does it make food rivaling my $8,000 Firemaster? No, not really - but it's definitely better than stovetop grilling, and for the price, it's definitely worth a try, especially if you don't have the space, budget or inclination for a larger conventional grill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBYZMSXRD33C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUXO#wasThisHelpful","R3MBYZMSXRD33C","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted an attractive and smart thermostat for my vacation home that could integrate with my HomeSeer home automation system. After trying a few z-wave products that I wasn't happy with, I eventually settled on this Honeywell WiFi thermostat.My home automation system knows all the details about what goes on in my home...whether I'm there, outside weather conditions, etc etc etc. I didn't see much value in trying to also have these smarts in a thermostat...if I want sophisticated energy management, I'll do it from my home automation system - I don't need something like a Nest or Ecobee trying to replicate these functions. Thus, I only needed a pretty basic thermostat that provides for manual operation while tying into my home automation system for the rest. If the Honeywell didn't work out, my other plan was to just implement a relay to switch the HVAC components on and off directly from my HomeSeer unit, and hang a small tabled on the wall where the thermostats would normally be.The Honeywell unit is attractive and easily customized with a variety of themes and colors. It might be possible, but I haven't found a way to change themes programmatically - I'd like to do things like load different colors depending on weather conditions or whether we're running heat or cooling. Over time, this might be easier to do with a small tablet computer running custom home automation software. Still, there are plenty of attractive themes built in, and I'm sure most people will find something they are happy with.Being WiFi, it's mostly independent from my HomeSeer, but at the same time, I've been able to integrate to it through plug-ins on the HS3 software. I can use the Honeywell mobile app or web site to remotely control the thermostat, and I can also send commands to it from my HomeSeer. This dual approach gives me an extra layer of redundancy, should some sort of error occur with the HomeSeer while I'm a thousand miles away.I use the HomeSeer part for more complex automation...changing temperature in response to weather conditions, home occupancy and other events that the thermostat generally wouldn't know about. Honestly, it was more difficult to get this part working than it should have been, but now that I have it setup, it seems to work flawlessly.The unit itself was relatively straightforward to install on my three zone heat pump systems. It replaced a 2006-era Honeywell thermostat, so most of the wiring was pretty straightforward, and with one small exception, it worked fine on the first try. In my case, I have a lot of wires to connect and the most challenging part of the install was finding a way to hide the wires in the wall behind the thermostat. Otherwise, install was a snap - even the mounting holes lined up exactly as on the old unit, so I was able to do the installation in just a few minutes.Temperature control using just the thermostat works quite well, and the home never varies more than a small amount from the set point. I have several temperature and humidity sensors throughout the home, and I find that the humidity sensor in the thermostat isn't particularly accurate - most of the other sensors in my home vary from one another by just a few percent...the one in the thermostat seems to be off by 10-15 percent.The remote access works well also. To boost reliability, I setup a network router (Asus - check here on Amazon) that has the ability to fail over to a 4G cellular modem should my main broadband connection fail. So long as I have a network connection between the Honeywell and the HomeSeer console, or between the Honeywell and the outside world, I can see what's going on and control the settings.So while the Honeywell isn't perfect, it is a good looking and reliable thermostat that can be coerced into working with home automation systems, and the price isn't terrible for what you get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVZ9D61IL85B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLZEQH2#wasThisHelpful","RAVZ9D61IL85B","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like a lot of people, I think that wearable technology holds huge promise, and some of these gadgets will prove to be amazingly beneficial. Just not sure that the Lumo Lift hits this threshold.Right off the bat, I was not at all impressed with the product packaging. It was way too difficult to get out of the package, even armed with my trusty pocket knife. I don't necessarily deduct points for a frustrating out of box experiences, but hopefully this is an area that will be improved as the product matures.I found the Lumo somewhat awkward and uncomfortable to wear. It needs to be snug against your skin, and perhaps because I tend to wear loose tops, I struggle to find an ideal way to wear it. It's held in place using a magnet, meaning you will generally see the magnet outside your clothes unless you clip it to an undergarment. Under tighter clothes it does work better, but it also gives an unsightly bulge that can be hard to conceal (I actually had a coworker think I had a pacemaker!).The mobile app is okay - I have the iOS version - but there isn't all that much data beyond what a simple pedometer would give you. The posture tracking is a relative thing...you calibrate it when you first put it on, and it vibrates (and counts) when you deviate from the calibrated position. I found that I never really hit the right mix of calibration - it would either never go off, or it seemed to go off constantly.The Lumo also tracks your activity (steps), much as FitBit and others. I happen to have a few of these devices - as well as a few iPhoone apps that monitor steps taken. The Lumo claims to be more accurate, but I'm not sure that's the case...wearing a few different pedometers at the same time, all of them came to different counts, but the results were generally within 1-2%, and it wasn't clear that any one was more accurate than the others. I'd rather just drop something like the FitBit in a pocket and not think about it than use the Lumo's clamp-on device.I'm generally enthusiastic on wearables, but I think the Lumo Lift needs a few more releases before it would be worth a look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQK059LVGYTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9P8GMW#wasThisHelpful","R1OQK059LVGYTL","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who wouldn't love the idea of spending a few minutes pulsing a little light on your face, and getting better skin as a result? That's what this product promises, and although I haven't used it long enough yet to know for sure, there do seem to be signs that it's working (barely).The device itself is well made and seems like it will hold up to frequent use. This is a good thing as my chief complaint is how long it takes to use. If you value your time, you might find it more cost efficient to head for the doctors office and be done with it. On the other hand, if you don't mind committing an hour or two per week, the Silk'n might be for you.It needs to be plugged in to work properly. Not a huge inconvenience as the cord is long enough to reach without problem.As for the results, I'd say after a month, there are some very, very subtle changes. I took a few close-up photos before starting...fine wrinkles seem a little more fine, and pores seem maybe a little tighter overall. Very subtle overall, but I'm only a month into it. I intend to give it several more months, and that will help me decide whether it's truly worthwhile or just a scam.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCXE83RRRB0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077R67CE#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCXE83RRRB0A","A38KK0SZYEH5UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK0SZYEH5UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have this connected to a small Intel NUC device that's been hardened for use in a demanding automotive environment. It gives us a display over an HDMI connection without requiring (say) a tablet that would need Internet access.So far, we're generally happy with it - was fairly straightforward to install, doesn't consume a lot of power and displays images that are clear and crisp enough to be useful, even though the display itself is fairly compact. We seldom use the touch screen feature, but it's a reasonable alternative to a conventional keyboard if your data entry needs are modest.Two missing features we wish we could find:1. A more secure hold-down for the HDMI cable. We're concerned that in a moving vehicle, the cable will eventually work its way loose.2. A built-in way to blank the display when the vehicle is in motion.

"My daughters both have boots similar to these and I always thought that they looked so cute in them so I thought I'de see if I could find some for myself. When I stumbled on them and saw that they were pink I just fell in love with them and ordered them right away. I normally wear a size 7.5 but after reading other peoples reviews I went up to a size 8 and I'm glad that I did since they fit me perfectly. I've had them on for 8 hours straight and they are so comfortable and keep my feet nice and warm.I do like that you can change the look of them too by unsnapping the fold over part and you can wear them as more of an ankle boot and there's enough of the laces to lace them up higher. The slot of the inside is kind of fun to keep things in but I doubt that I will personally use it as I'm not really the type to go anywhere without my purse or a backpack.The sole of these are nice and thick and have a great tread on them so when I'm in the snow and ice I shouldn't slip around as much as I would in tennis shoes. I still need to spray them with a waterproof sealant to protect them but these are beyond cute and I'm just in love with them. Just get a half size bigger than you normally wear and you'll be fine.I hope you find this review helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0QLOH21VE68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012UOVDLI#wasThisHelpful","R3N0QLOH21VE68","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to have the most amount of lights on our house at Christmas time but I always push our electrical outlets to the limit and I'm not too happy with the bills we get in January either so I'm trying to go solar as much as I can this year. These lights will be perfect for the shrubs in our yard and since they are solar, I don't need to worry about plugging them in or turning them off at night either.They came with a partial charge to them so in my photos, they're running off the power that they came with. The one thing I really like and is unlike any other solar lights that I have in our backyard is that they even supply a house mount if you don't want to put the stake in the ground. That means you can put these up higher and even put them on your house if you'd like.The solar panel has not only the on/off switch but also the mode switch so you can choose to a flashing light or constant on. I also like the fact that I won't have that mess of electrical cords in the middle of my yard and worrying about them getting wet and blowing all the lights out. I've been trying to get as much as our outdoor lighting to be all solar and except for Christmas lights, I'm pretty much done in our backyard. These light last about 8 hours after a full charge so the only thing I suggest is look throughout the day what areas get enough sun for the solar panel so you know the best place to put it. You don't want to spend a lot of time placing all 39' of lights only to discover that the solar panel is only getting an hour of sun a day. I'm only mentioning this because I made that mistake once.I'm looking forward to putting these up in a couple of weeks and I highly recommend them.

"I have quite a few diffusers in my home and now that my mother has moved in with us, I wanted one for her room since she suffers from allergies and get's stuffed up pretty easily.I'm going to start with the one negative on this and that's the fact that the instruction guide doesn't say a single thing on how to use it and I didn't even realize that the top piece as shown in their photo was the top piece since it didn't show how to put it together and I thought it was a funnel! lol I had to play with this a bit to figure it all out but the user guide is pretty useless.This has become my favorite of the ones that we have for a couple of reasons. The first is the amount of water it holds since you can  put 1.3 liters of water in it. When you fill it up it can run for over 6 hours on max or 7-8 hours on low until the water runs out. You actually fill up the top part, not the bottom like you do with other diffusers. I did notice that the top got quite a bit of moisture on it but that's because I didn't have the top piece on so now that I ran it again with the top on it didn't happen.For the LED light you just press it and it will go to the color changing mode. If you press it again then it will stay on that color and you can continue to press it to select the color you want to have and then stop there or keep pressing until it goes off. When it changes color it's very slow and suttle but the colors are very pretty and not bright so if you have it in a bedroom then the light is soft enough not to interrupt your sleep. This would even be great in a kids room as a night light too or you can just keep the light off.The dial allows you to select the flow of the vapor so you can go from fine to pretty heavy duty. This has a built in filter of some sort but again, it doesn't say what it is in the instruction guide. I like to put lavender in ours since I love the scent while we sleep. I have allergies as well and dry skin so sleeping with the humidifier on is great for not only my skin but it also helps me breath better at night. This is also so quite that you don't hear a thing and if you turn the light off, you'd never know it was on except for the mist coming out the top.Again, this is my new favorite diffuser so my mom now has the one we had in our room and we have this one. I highly recommend it and it would make a great gift as well.

"I have 3 dogs who all shed to some degree but it's an on going battle with our biggest dog, Buddy,  who will have clumps of fur coming off of him during the shedding seasons. Our furniture is covered with his fur and we have to vacuum every other day because it's everywhere. In the past I've always used our FURminator and taken him to the side of our house as I remove what seems to be the amount of fur that looks like a small dog.So I was really hoping that this would not only make brushing him out easier but I throught the other side would help get the pet hair off of our furniture too instead of using the hand held vac all the time. But I'm afraid it just didn't work. The idea behind this is great to have a dual mitt where you can brush them on one side and then clean up with the other. The mitt has velcro to make it secure around your wrist and inside there are 2 white straps to hold on to.But the problem I had is that neither the red side worked very well on our furniture or on the dogs. I first tried it with our smallest dog, Izzy to see how it would preform on long hair and as you'll see in her photo, there wasn't much hair and I brushed her 10 times. Then I moved on to buddy and I brushed him 3 times with this mitt and then 3 times with the FURminator and you'll see in my photos how much more hair the FURminator got because it can get down to the undercoat. The rubber nubs on this just don't get down to his undercoat where all the fur is so it's just not getting it and is only catching the loose fur that already on top of his fur. The FURminator is also only about a 1/3 of the width of the mitt so in reality, not got much more hair while covering less of his body.Like I said, I really wanted this to work but unfortunately, it's not better than what I'm currently using.

"I've reviewed a few different dash cam's and this has been my favorite so far. To be honest, when I saw the price I wasn't expecting it to be that good so I was pleased to find out that it was so good and came with a 32G memory card as well.This camera is nice and small so if you mount if between your windshield and rear view mirror it won't be as noticable. They also supply you with clips to run the cable to you can run it across your windshield and down along the dash board so the cable is out of view as well. You really don't want people seeing it so they won't break into your car to steal it so they've designed it to be less noticeable.There's a 2.4"" window to view the road but you really can't and won't be watching it while you drive. It's more to be able to see during the set up and make sure that you have it aimed properly as the display is both too small and at the wrong angle to see it properly while you drive. They also put the important buttons like the power and menu buttons on the drivers side of the camera so they are easy to reach. What I do like is that the camera will power off when you turn your car off and then power itself on when you turn your car on. That way it won't drain your car battery and the camera on it's own will only hold about 15 mnutes of battery time before it needs to be charge so you will need to use the provided cable and plug it into your cigarette lighter but they do supply a dual charger for you so you can still charge another device while this is working. There is an option to change the on/off feature so that you can choose to have the camera stay on for either 1, 3, 5 or 10 minutes after you turn your car off. There's also an option to turn the auto on/off off but again, not a good idea if you don't want it to drain your car battery. I would only use this feature if you know that you'll be starting your car every day. Another option is instead of plugging this into your cigarette lighter is to use an external power bank. That way the power bank will get used up instead of your car battery.This camera is equipped with a G sensor so if it detects any impact, such as someone hitting your parked car, it will turn itself on and start recording. Keep in mind that it takes a bit to turn itself on so it won't capture the impact itself and if the impact is outside of the view of screen it won't show anything at all. But, if someone pulls into a spot and hits you're front bumper then it will show them afterwards. This can be set for sensitivity levels of low, medium and high. The G sensor also locks any video it's recorded during an impact so you don't have to worry about it being recorded over.The audio can be turned on or off so if you don't mind that the world will hear you singing along to the radio then it's a good idea to keep that on as well to pick up any sounds.The G sensor is different from the Parking Monitor Mode as that detects vibration instead of an impact. There's also motion detection so the camera only records if there's movement. This means the camera will not record if you're sitting in traffic and not moving for 10 minutes but once you start moving, then it starts again or if there's any motion happening in front of the camera. There is an emergency button on the camera that looks like a Yield sign and if you press that, it will lock the video so again, it can't be recorded over. You can also take a still photo at any time by pressing the Mode button.You can playback the video on the camera itself and you can also us the USB cable to move and store the video and photos over to your computer if you don't have a card reader. That way you have the files saved if you need them or want to watch them on a larger screen.When you turn your car on and it starts recording, it only records small clips at a time and you choose if it's 1, 3, 5 or 10 minutes. That way your not trying to go look through 2 hours of video to find what your looking for but the video can all be viewed together for a seemless look.There isn't a ""nighttime"" recording mode and if it had it, it wouldn't even work as IR lights don't work that good for distance and your headlights will shine enough light to view the road as is. Any IR lights would just reflect off the windshield and you wouldn't see the road if they had them so don't worry about not seeing that as a feature.What I really appreciate is that they include the memory card and you can go up to a 32G card if you'd like as long as it's a class 6 or higher card. The mounting backet is very sturdy and the suction cup stays in place without falling off or moving.I'm very impressed with this camera and all that they packed into it so I highly recommend it.

"I have reviewed a lot of different speakers and sound quality is always the most important factor to me and I have to say, this one sounds really good. This came with a bit of a charge to it so I was able to pair it and listen for a few minutes before I had to give it a full charge.This does have a few nice additional features such as the color changing lights that you change by tapping the top of the mushroom. The lights shine down from underneath the mushroom and you can choose to stay on one color or cycle through it and have it change colors and you can have it set to the beat of the music.There is not an instruction guide to this so it did take a lot of playing around with it to figure it all out. Along the bottom of the speaker there is a sliding button that you use to both change the volume or play the previous or next song. You either quickly slide the button to play the previous/next song and hold it for the volume. The next port is the AUX/headset port, then there's the on/off switch and the charging port. They do supply the micro USB charger for you. Next is an USB port so you can charge other devices from this, the mircophone and then there's a slot for a memory card so you can insert that and play music off the card.The lights cycle between 7 colors which again, you change by tapping the top. If you keep your hand on the top, you can adjust how bright it is. It will also speak to you so you know when its in bluetooth mode or connected. There are only 2 negatives that I can say about it and that is the lack of the user manual and that for some reason it freaks my dog out and she's scared of it to the point that she runs and hides when I get it out. That's not such a big deal as I'm sure she'll get over it and I just thought it was weird and I wonder if it makes one of those sounds that only dogs can hear.

"I have been converting over to all LED bulbs in our home as well as all rechargable batteries so this flashlight also allows me to do both of those. This is a heavy duty son of a gun that can take a lot of abuse and compared to my old plastic flashlights, you know that this one will last forever and can pretty much take on any enviornments.The LED bulb has a life span of 100,000 hours so even if you ran it for 24 hours a day, this means it would last for over 4 years before the bulb would go out. I'm guessing this flashlight will outlast me so perhaps I should put it in my will. lolIt comes with 1 batteries, the charger for it, a spare insert to use 3 AAA batteries if needed and a plastic diffuser for the end. This allows you to not only dim the light but also provide an overall ""glow"" type of light so instead of needing to have the flashlight shine at something, it makes if more like a lamp where the light is within the plastic cap instead. The power button on the end also can be lightly pressed to change how bright the light is so press it once and it's at it's brightest but if you keep tapping it, it gets dimmer and dimmer plus there's a strobe and then will also do an S.O.S. signal so there's a total of 5 levels. There's also a removable strap at the end so you can wear it on your wrist or hang it up.The end of the flashlight expands so you can zoom the light to a closer or further distance and either condense the light or widen it. You'll see how it looks in my photos and I was aiming it about 20"" from the wall in all my shots. With the plastic cap on I show it with the light at different levels of brightness.The charger will only charge one battery at a time but they send the battery to you already charged which is great. This uses 18650 batteries so they are much bigger than the standare AA battery and do require this type of charging base so I appreciate that they include that. Actually for the price of this whole set it's hard to even find a battery and the charger for that price so this is a great deal. It does take a little over 5 hours to charge the battery and the charger will turn from red to green to let you know that it's fully charged.I highly recommend this flashlight set to anyone and it would also make a great gift.

"I'm a purse-a-holic so I love to have them in different shapes, colors, sizes and style depending on what I'm doing and wearing. There are many times I just want the basics with me so this is perfect since I can have my phone, credit/debit cards and cash with me.I'm just in love with the hot pink color and this wristlet is so well made and stylish. They really paid attention to the details and every bit of this shows the quality of work that was put into it. The leather isn't too stiff but not so soft that it loses it's shape. It's just is worn in enough so it's comfortable if you know what I mean.On the outside theres a nice roomy zippered pocket that's great for change and I keep my lipstick in there too. The handle is attached to the zipper and is the pull for it. On the inside there's a center divider so you really have 2 sides to keep things. There's a zippered pocket onside, then there's a wall of compartments for your ID and cards so you can carry up to 6 of them in there. Then there are 2 slots to keep things in so they stay secure and don't move around. The interior fabric has a flower design as you'll see in my photos.I highly recommend this to anyone and it would make a great gift too.

"This is my 2nd bottle of Mask Spray which is great since we have 2 bathrooms. I was very sceptical when I got the first bottle but it definately made me a believer after I used it the first time so having this new scent is awesome.This is so easy to use, you simply spray it about 5-6 pumps so that you have enough to make a film on top of the water in the toilet bowl. Then you simply do your business and the smell is then trapped under the layer of the Mask. The only scent you smell is the Mask scent (which is amazing!!) and when you flush, you'd never ever know that anyone had even pooped. Both my husband and I got a stomach flu a couple of weeks ago and this was a life saver for us to keep all the horrible smells away.This is one of those products that you just have to try for yourself to see what I mean. Since we got this there hasn't even been a hint of a poop smell and the bathroom is safe for the next person to go right in. I have a note in our guest bathroom next to the bottle that says ""When you gotta go, you gotta go but spray this first, and no one will ever know"". At first it was a joke for our friends and family members but now we've had several of them end up getting it as well after trying it. If you entertain a lot like we do, this is a must in your home.The scent is hard to describe but it's really a fresh smell. I highly recommend this to anyone and it would make a great stocking stuffer too.

"This is my 2nd SportShot  camera and once again, they have impressed me with the quality of camera and all the features they include. I also have a GoPro Hero and I honestly prefer the SportShot cameras over my GoPro.The main reason why I prefer them is simply the cost. If I damage or lose my GoPro there's hundreds of dollars down the drain for basically the same camera. Therefore, I'm way more nervous to use my GoPro and so there it sits, in it's case. I have no worries about the using my SportShot and for me and the conditions that I use it in, this is perfect. I love to snorkel when we go on trips so that will be my main reason for using it but I've taken this on bike rides (it's amazing what you see when you watch the video later) and my husband has worn it when he plays racquetball to try and improve his performance. I also have a harness for our dog which I like to use with her when we go on walks just for fun. When you get down on their level you see why your dog wants to stop and check things out more often as well.When I reviewed my other SportShot I compared the features between it and my GoPro and I feel that it's worth sharing again with you so here that is:1080p camera -............................. SportShot - Yes......GoPro - Yes12MP camera -.............................. SportShot - Yes......GoPro - NO, it's only 8MPWifi - ...............................................SportShot - Yes ....GoPro - YesWaterproof Housing - .....................SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - Yes170 viewing angle...........................SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - YesComes with 20 accessories - .........SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - NORecharable/replaceable battery - ...SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - YesCan connect to app - ......................SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - YesBurst Shots - ...................................SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - YesLoop recording - ..............................SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - YesTouch screen - ................................SportShot - No.......GoPro - YesUnder $75 - .....................................SportShot - Yes.....GoPro - No, It's currently $280Obviously the quality of the photos and videos is the biggest thing you'd want out of this and the SportShot wins that handsdown with their 12MP 1080p camera. The GoPro is only 8MP so you don't get the same level of detail with it. Yes, the color of the photos is the same but the SportShot is a much clearer and cleaner looking image. As you'll see in my photos the picture quaility is just amazing.The ease of use with the SportShot is another big plus with me. You only need to deal with 3 buttons and one of those is the wifi connection so you don't even use that one that much. The front and top buttons are a combination of the power, feature, scrolling and photo/video start and stop so it's so easy to learn.They also start you out with a nice selection of accessories where as my GoPro didn't. Yes, the accessories aren't all that much but at least the SportShot gives you enough to actually use it right out of the box while a GoPro will require that you go shopping first. Now neither one comes with a memory card so you will want to have that ready when you purchase this as well. The other item I purchased were additional batteries since they are so easy to change out with the SportShot. The camera come out of the housing very easily and on the bottom is the battery compartment. You want to keep the plastic tab on the battery since that's what allows you to pull it out but if you keep a couple of extra batteries charged then you don't have to wait to charge your SportShot and can just put a new battery in. I also keep a spare power bank in my case just incase I need to also charge the SportShot I can do it on the run.I highly recommend this camera to anyone and with the holidays arriving, this would make a great gift too. Why buy 1 GoPro for one person when you can buy 4 of these and give them to 4 people?

"Unlike most people who are purchasing this for a baby monitor, I have this because my mother now lives with us. She has Alzheimer's and has fallen twice this year breaking each hip so I really need to be able to keep an eye on her when I can't be in the room with her. For the most part she's in the family room so that's where I set up the camera.I like that this was truely a plug and play system. The camera is already paired to the receiver when you take it out of the box so the only time you would need to deal with the pairing is if you choose to add a 2nd camera or if you have to reset it for any reason. From the receiver you can both speak as well as listen to the camera and adjust the volume plus you can adjust the screen brighteness which is nice because depending on the amount of light coming in the room it may need to be adjusted.Then you can also move the camera to look all around the room both side to side as well as up and down. I can't say that the picture quality is as clear as an IP camera but for a remote device you can definately see what's going on. The receiver does need to be charged every few days depending on how much you have it on but they supply a charger for that. There's also a hook on the top so if you want to clip the receiver to anything you can do that. There's a kickstand on it too so you can either lay it down flat or have it upright.The range of motion on the camera is great because you really can scan the whole room remotely. And since there's no need to pair the camera and receiver it's very easy to unplug the camera and move it to another room anytime you need to as it all goes back online as soon as you plug it in.This really gives me peace of mind when I have to go and shower to anything else that takes me out of the room that my mom is in. She is supposed to use her walker but when I'm out of the room she seems to think she can get away with not using it so when I catch her without it I can go get her and the walker back together. She has never figured out what the camera is andhas no idea that I keep an eye on her. She just seems to think I'm really smart and know when she's doing something she isn't supposed to be doing. I remember her telling me as a child that she had eyes in the back of her head but little does she know, I have eyes in the room with her with this Foscam camera.I highly recommend this to anyone that needs to watch a child, pet, parent or anything else when you're at home but not in the room. Just know that this is not a wifi system so you can't take the receiver with you.

"I write a lot of reviews on Amazon and I always post photos for them. I'm in no way shape a professional photographer or even close to it but I wanted to be able to take better looking photos instead of doing them on my dining room table. I had another smaller box and that just wasn't big enough for some of the things I need to take pictures of so when I saw this one I thought it would work.Now there are a lot more things that I like about this compared to what I don't like so I'll start with the pro's:- 24 x 24 gives me more room- the optional cover over the front has a slit in it if I want to remove the natural light of the room. This is great when I want to have lower light and just rely on my 2 lamps.- It's very sturdy and easy to fold up when not in useCon's:- the curved bottom doesn't allow me to place light weight items towards the back or sides of the box. They just won't sit flat because of that.- the colored backgrounds don't attach very well and stay in place. It seems like I'm always trying to adjust and fix them compared to my old one.- the backgrounds are also easy to spot in my photos as they don't quite fit to the top and sides so I'm have to crop a lot more of my photos to try and get them out of the shot.- one of the velcro strips wan't sewn down properly so I can't use that spot until I sew it down.I'm not sure if this will be the right desktop kit for me and I just may need to have a square one instead of a rounded one since I need to take advantege of every square inch inside of it. That and the poor quality of construction that I shouldn't have to mess with. I can't say that I can recommend it for those reasons.I hope you find this review helpful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOOY5BJ4N43Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKGGICC#wasThisHelpful","R2JOOY5BJ4N43Z","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to wear over sized shirts during the fall and winter and pair a long shirt like this with leggings and boots and then add a scarf around my neck. It's a quick and easy outfit that's perfect for all kinds of occasions and this top is so well made and I love the length of it. I got a 2XL because of their sizing chart when I normally would get an XL and it fits perfectly.I would also normally put it on and take photos but I broke a rib and have some unattactive wraps around my ribs right now so this wouldn't look right in the photos and I didn't think that would be fair for me to do to the seller. That's why my photos just show it laying on the counter but I should be out of the wraps in a few days and this will be the first thing I wear when they're off.This top is made very well with no loose seams and is a thicker material that has a small pleat around the collar both on the front as well as the back. Since I'm a bit on the bigger side in the bust area that's perfect to help give me a little more room there without having to have a lower neckline like I normally would have to do. I may just need to get this in more colors so I can give the same look with other scarfs and boots that  have. Hmmm, or I could just put them on my Christmas list too.I highly recommend this top to anyone and again, I can't wait to wear it.

"Both my husband and I like to collect watches and I've had to rely on my father in law to help me with sizing my watch bands so I wanted to get a good set to be able to do it myself.While this kit has a lot of tools in it, there's no instructions telling you what any of them do so  spent some time looking them up so I'd know not only what each one does but thought I'd share that information just incase you don't know too. I labeled them on the photos so I hope that's helpful for you.The case is great to keep it all in and just be careful when you open it as a few of them had become loose from the elastic during transit and had fallen out when I unzipped it and fell all over the floor. Luckily nothing was damaged but thought you might like to be aware of that too.The screw drivers are actually 2 sided so you'll see a small screw on each side so if you loosen it with another screw driver, you can turn the end around and have another size. This really has way more items than I think I'll ever use but for the price, I thought it was a great deal and I now have the carrying case as well. Every tool is great quaity and very durable and this kit should last me for many years.I hope you find this review helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UA0WBIICLO02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DDGA38#wasThisHelpful","R2UA0WBIICLO02","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We entertain at our house a lot and I always decorate our table when we have people over, even if it's just to watch football. When the holidays roll around it's our house that has the family Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners so we end up with over 20 people at times for a sit down dinner.We have found a way to make our garage look like a big old living room and we have a bunch of tables that we set up and I try my best to have the portable tables look like our nice tables so using table clothes is a must. This table clothe is so well made and I selected the beige so it will go with a majority of table settings. The pattern is so pretty so I did take a close up of that for you so you can see how it looks and the hems are sewn perfecty.I got the largest size since we always have the leaves in our table and what I like about this one is how versatile it is.

"I don't know why I didn't buy these for my mom's walker instead of buying tennis ball after tennis ball and having them wear out in a month on the bottom. These walker glides allow for the walker to move much easier so it's not only easier for her to maneuver it and there's no risk to my hardwood floors getting scratched now. They pop in easily to the bottom of each leg so you'll have them in place in under a minute. The glides also angle up in the front so there's no tripping risk since they won't catch on thresholds or area rugs.In my opinion these are a must for anyone who uses a walker and they sure look much nicer than the tennis balls do. I'll just leave the tennis balls to the tennis players and let my mom glide along now.I hope you find this review helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5CL8KN0KZHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VWJYOS#wasThisHelpful","RE5CL8KN0KZHU","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This walllet has had a lot of thought go into the details. This may be a bit hard to describe how this wallet works but I'll do my best. At first glance it looks like any other wallet and even when you open it the first time it still looks like a normal wallet with one plastic window slot for your ID and then 3 slots on the other side for credit/debit cards. In the center you'll see a zipper that actually goes on both sides so you can tuck all kinds of change in there. Your bills go in the top but they've added a divider in there so you can seperate them out and have bills or reciepts in there. Then there's a snap on the left side you'll see a flap with a snap on the top that if you open that, there is another flap that has 2 more plastic ID slots and on the other side are 6 more slots for credit/debit cards. That's a total of 9 regular slots and 3 clear plastic slots so you can see through them.This wallet looks so unassuming at first but then you see how much you can really fit in it and what's hidden away and out of view then this is a great wallet. No one would guess that you have all those other cards tucked away so if a theif was checking out your wallet, from first glance they'd never know what all you have in it unless you open it all the way and they see that.I highly recommend this wallet and it would make a wonderful gift.

"I find using backpacks great when I'm either out shopping and want to have my hands free and not worry about a purse or for when we travel. I like that this one is not a stiff backpack so it fits into my suitcase very easily and doesn't take up as much space.The canvas is very durable and the bag is very well made. The leather is very soft and the snap that keeps the flap in place is very unique and unlike any snaps I've seen before. The bag closes on top with a drawstring and there is one main zippered pocket on the front of the bag as well as 2 on the sides. Inside is another zippered pocket as well as a pouch and there's also a handle on top to carry it by. What I really like is that on the shoulder straps they added a cross piece of the canvas which really helps keep the shoulder straps in place and much more comfortable. This too is something I've yet to see on a backpack and I think it's just a smart addition. The straps are also adjustable and all the hardware that they use on this bag is top quality.I highly recommend this bag and love how much I can fit in it.

" 5:54 Mins Wow, has technology ever come a long way! When the seller asked me to review this and share my honest and unbiased review I was prepared to say that there's no way that it would work. But much to my surprise, they prove me wrong.This is a handheld thermometer that allows you to get a temperature by not even touching the person. You simply hold it 1.2 - 2.0 inches from the surface of the sking and press the button and in one second, you have the reading not only on the large, backlit display but if you have the voice turned on, it will also say it.You can read not only the body temperature but also a surface and air temperature as well. I wish I had this 20 years ago when my kids were little and you'd go in at midnight to take their temerature. I'd have to turn the light on, shake the thermometer (they didn't have digital ones yet) and then place it under their tongue or arm pit. Of course that would wake them up and I'd have to get them back to sleep when their feeling yucky. Now, all you'd need to do is sneak in with a flashlight of the hall light on, make sure the voice it turned off (you don't want to wake them), be within range and press the button. You'll see in the display right away what the temperature is and let them get their rest.It also has a memory so it will display on the screen the last 32 temperatures that have been taken so if you can't remember what it was at 3am when the doctor asks you, you can now give it to them. This runs off of 2 AA batteries which they provide and there's not even an on/off switch since it powers on when you press a button and turns itself off. You can choose between celsius and fahrenheit for the reading and with the voice on, it will read it aloud to you.The device also has a very comfortable grip on it as they've molded the finger grips into the handle and all the buttons can be accessed with your thumb. There is an instruction booklet but this is so easy to use that you don't even need it. I also really like the storage case as it's not only easy to open and close but it's made of a thick plastic for durability and and the inside is molded to the shape of the thermometer.This is not only a must have for all households but would make a wonderful baby shower gift or just a great Christmas gift too with the holidays approaching. I highly recommend this to anyone and again, where was this 20 years ago??I will apologize that I typed the name wrong in my video so please make sure that you get the AccuMed, not AcuMed thermometer!I hope you find this review helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9M03NZ1WINB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OTB050#wasThisHelpful","R9M03NZ1WINB0","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:54 Mins I have reviewed a lot of bluetooth of all sizes and ones that light up and some that are even built into lightbulbs. But this is the first one that I've seen thats at an angle and I have to say, it makes so much sense! It seems that when I listen to a speaker and the sound isn't always the best, if I pick it up and angle it the speaker will always sound better and they took that idea and ran with it.I love that this one has the buttons on the top of the speaker so they are very easy to access and they're also BIG so again, easy to press and know what's what. Even the charging port and auxiliary port is located up high on the back so you're not fumbling around the base of the speaker trying to plug it in.The best part of this speaker by far is the sound though. It's a very rich sound and there's not the ""tinny"" sound at all. You'll hear for yourself in my video just how this sounds so I'll let you hear for yourself. I highly recommend this and for the price you really can't pass this up.

"I love using solar lights in our yard since we have a lack of electrical outlets and a lot of yard to light up. Last summer I started a memorial garden for my grandson so when the seller asked me to try this out in exchange of my honest review, I knew that I had the perfect spot for them.The first thing that struck me when I took them out of the box was that they were already partially charged so in my photos, I was able to show off the light without having to even put them in the sun. Now they say that there are 7 different colors but there really are more since there are many shades of each color as they go from soft to bright and then start to transition into the next color. 'The plasic used on these is very durable and no worries about them breaking. If you are installing them in hard dirt you may want to loosen up that dirt a bit first since the plasic part that goes into the ground is pretty wide. The top does come off when you need to change the rechargable batteries but that's the only maintainance that you'll have to do on them. Since the lights are LED they say that they'll last for 100,000 so if we average 10 hours  a night that means the bulbs will last for over 27 years! That means I can pass these lights onto my great grandkids..*sigh*And speaking of grandkids, kids will love these as well. The bright, vivid colors are just fun to watch and anyone who has a fairy garden will find these perfect as well to have.I hope you find this review helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1T57Y9EAAPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J2C6FO#wasThisHelpful","R1A1T57Y9EAAPG","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world looks wonderful when I'm with you. What a great way to symbolize your love for someone then when both of you wear these words around your neck along with ""eternal love"". I love that that they match but also have a different look by simply having the outer rings be either black or gold which to me looks more like rose gold. I also love the stone on the outer ring and the way that the light will catch it and give a bit of sparkle.The chain for the mens necklace is a bit thicker but they both have the same patttern. They can easily be changed to a longer or dfferent chain if you'd like too. I also like how the two rings are entwined as well as that is another symbol of love.I highly recommend this set to anyone and it would also make a wonderful gift, especially with the holidays approaching fast.

"I'm so proud of  my husband and the success he has had with his weight loss but that has left his wedding ring way too big for him and now he can't wear it. Since it was made of a hammered gold we couldn't even get it resized so finding a ring he would like and feel comfortable in was a bit of a challange and he's pretty picky. He didn't want anything expensive but he wanted something.So when the seller asked me to try this out in exchange of my honest review, I asked if he felt this was a ring that he would like and he really liked it in the photos but wanted to see it in person to decide for sure.Since we're going to renew our vows in March for our anniversary, we also got the women's rings so I could have one that would match when we do that.I have to say, the photos just don't do these rings justice. They are elegant and simple and since they both have the words ""real"" and ""love along with the swirl of either black (the mens ring) or gold (womens) on them, they match without being an exact match.The one thing we both like is how the rings don't cut into our skin since the band is rounded a bit and they are very comfortable. My husband is really enjoying his ring and I look forward to wearing mind in March when we say our ""I do's"" again. You would never know by the look of these rings that they didn't cost a whole lot more than they do.I hope you find this review helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN9LYNC2WK53M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XMBHM4#wasThisHelpful","RN9LYNC2WK53M","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using another lip exfoliator for almost a year now which is actually the one by E.L.F. and I have been very happy with that. So when the seller asked me to try this out in exchange of my honest review, I was anixous to try it out.I knew from using E.L.F. that you have to use it a few times to get that top layer of balm off and then get to the ""scrubbing"" part so I used it a few time throughout the day and it did leave my lips soft but I still didn't feel any thing that was exfoliating yet. The next day I used it twice and still the same so I decided to scrub it against the back of my hand for a bit to see if I could help it along and finally I was able to start to feel a slight roughness to it.Now the E.L.F. one is very corse and has large chunks that take the layer of dead skin off fairly quickly without hurting and it also left a sugary taste behind. Prior to using E.L.F. I made my own by taking sugar and mixing it with coconut oil which also worked really well but I just hate sticking my finger into pots to apply products which is why I made the change.I can't tell if it's because my lips were so use to a rougher product or if I just got a bad tube or if that's just the way it is but as much as I used it over a 5 day period of time, I never felt like my lips were doing anything other than apply the balm part of it. Sure, my lips were soft but the dry part that always happens was building up and I just had to go back to my E.L.F. and once I did that, the dead dry skin came right off.There is quite a bit of product in the tube and it is much thinner than what I'm used to. You will find that little pieces will come off but the E.L.F. does that too.To me, the Alexis Vogel seemed waxy and didn't leave any flavor behind. I just can't tell if it's because my lips were so used to another brand that I just had a hard time geting much out of it but I have a strong feeling that was the problem. If you've never used a lip exfoliator before or have had a different experience then I would totally understand why you ma have had more sucess than I did as I'm very aware that with cosmetics and any skin/lip care what works for one person may not work for another and vice versa.I hope you find this review helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234FCVKWB6U30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D2MMU0#wasThisHelpful","R234FCVKWB6U30","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been looking for the perfect cross since I lost my favorite one a few years ago but none of the ones I've looked  at seemed very unique to me until now. My  husband had also lost his cross many years ago and had a hard time finding one that he really liked too but how funny is it that we both looked at them and knew that these were the pefect necklaces for us? We don't normally do the ""matching"" things and I think the closest thing that we have is the fact that we both have Steeler's t-shirts.I know what drew me to this necklace as not only the simple form of the cross but the thin wire that wraps around it and also the circle that wraps around part of it too. To me it's a symbol of Jesus on the cross and I won't go into personal reasons for the deep meaning of that for me and I know that my husband has his own reasons for liking this as well.The chain on the mans necklace is a bit thicker than the womans but other than that, they match as well. These are well made and they come in one case so they would also make a wonderful gift for a couple. I highly recommend them and am very glad that the seller offered these to me at no charge in exchange of my honest review.

"I originally got these thinking that  they would be perfect for all of my sunglasses but then when my husband saw them he reminded me that between our kids and spouses, there are 7 of them so they would make great stocking stuffers and that we could also put goodies inside of them too. Well that's fine but now I need to order another set for my sunglasses! Since the seller offered these to me at no charge to try out in exchange for my honest review, I'll tell you my thoughts on them.For starters, you get 7 cases at just over $2 a case which that alone if amazing but what's even better, these are really awesome cases. I have 5 other cases that I use (not including the ones that came with my Oakley's and Michael Kor's glasses) and I had thought that they were all great cases but these are really so much better.For starters, the hard case is covered with what feels like neoprene and they're molded to hold the bridge of the glasses in place. Each case has a bright colored zipper, except for the black which is, well, just black. The zippers are all great quality and they each have the hook on them so you can clip them on to something if you'd like. I tend to use those a lot because when we travel I use a smaller purse and like to clip my sunglass case onto my purse. The inside of them is the same as the outside so they are well protected from any scratching or getting broken if dropped.So when I get MY set of them I like that I can use one color for each pair so that way I'll know what glasses are inside and just be able to grab them without opening the case to find the pair I want. I highly recommend these cases and perhaps you too will want to order 2 sets so you can give them as Christmas gifts too.I hope you find this review helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90XKF1UQUSZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDFC46E#wasThisHelpful","R90XKF1UQUSZM","AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFTVGYZ7CJ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of GoPro accessorie kits out there so how do you decide which one to get? Well, what stood out the most to me with this kit was the size of the case. I have a few cases already but they're all to small to hold anything more than the camera and perhaps a few of the  accessories. This one hold A LOT of accessories and speaking of accessories, this one actually has something other than half of them be clips or mounts or 2 sided sticky pads. Most of the other kits I've reviewed have more than I'll ever need so to me it's a waste. Instead they added cool things like the tripod or the floating wrist strap or even the cleaning kit. I've never had any of those accessories before and they actually come in quite handy.These are all well made and on the chest harness, the buckle is very durable and easy to click in and out. Even the helmet mount has rubberized texture on the under side to keep it from sliding so it's the little things like that that show the attention to details. I was on the fence about the foam insert since you could customize it and for me, it just depends on what I want to have in there at any given time so I ended up leaving a space for my GoPro and then took all but the frame surrounding it out so I could put anything in there. Sure, they don't have a ""place"" to go but since the case is nice and ridged and the foam keeps anything from getting beat up that's ok with me and I keep alot of the things in their plastic bags anyways.This kit has by far won me over and is now my favorite. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you're just starting out with accessories.

"Format: PaperbackWritten in 1913-1914 E. M. Forster's MAURICE, at his direction, was not published until after his death in 1970 although in the ""terminal note"" at the end of the novel he says that he changed little of the story over the years. Unless you were a gay man living in 1971 and had been bombarded all your life with how awful homosexuality was, a crime, a sin and a mental illness, you cannot imagine the joy that reading this novel brought since the only person who dies in this novel is Maurice's grandfather. Of course Maurice is beset with self-loathing, fears, depression and loneliness as Edwardian society expected young men who went to Cambridge to marry and repopulate the earth. For instance, when Maurice attempts to discuss his inspeakable problem ""of the Oscar Wilde sort,"" with a family friend Dr. Barry, the physician responded: ""'Rubbish, rubbish!'"" He further said that the worst thing he could do for Maurice was ""discuss it."" Maurice is able to rise above or work his way around this non-diagnosis, as well as a trip to a hypnotist to be cured, and have a life with another man.Some critics say that MAURICE is significant only in a historical context. Let them tell that to the gay teenager who finds this novel in his high school library and reads the beautiful ending, much more possible now than when Forster wrote it particularly if that teenager lives in Ireland or the U. S., after the events that have taken places in these two countries in the past few days.  This novel has universal appeal in that Clive, Maurice's first love, takes the easy way out by marrying and having a respectable career (we all know a couple of Clive's), and Maurice, for all his snobbery, grows to understand that love between men can cross class lines. (Forster's biographers note that he had a lover in 1919 who was an Egyptian tram conducter and fell in love with a London policeman in 1930.)In his fine memoir MISSISSIPPI SISSY Kevin Sessums recalls a conversation with the writer Eudora Welty who made him promise to read Forster's PASSAGE TO INDIA: ""'MAURICE is not first-rate Forster, even though I understand the reasons why it would be the only work of his you've read.'"" Being in the same boat with Sessums, I cannot disagree or agree with Ms. Welty. I can only say that this is a fine novel indeed. Forster, himself, said in ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL: ""The final test for a novel will be our affection for it, as it is the test of friends and of anything else which we cannot define.""By Forster's own definition, he has written a great novel. Even in the wake of the U. S. Supreme Court's recent ruling on same-sex marriage, this novel remains a treasure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30AOSEQLIZ47U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SESHIS#wasThisHelpful","R30AOSEQLIZ47U","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Format: PaperbackI found Holding the Man in a little bookshop in Melbourne several years ago. I had read many ""AIDS"" memoirs-- including Paul Monette's Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir and the very fine Heaven's Coast"" A Memoir by Mark Doty and thought there was nothing else to be said on the subject. I was wrong. I cannot say enough good things about this book. It is so well written. In addition to being a poignant account of a beautiful love affair and sad, sad, death in the time of AIDS, it is a quite wonderful account of what it is like to be a gay teen as well. When I finished the book-- and yes, it will make you cry-- I felt an overwhelming sadness that this young man will never write again and that both these young men's lives were snuffed out at such an early age. And I wanted to see John's beautiful eyelashes.This is one of those books that, upon finishing, you call up everyone you love and ask him/her to read it although you are afraid to lend your copy in case you don't get it back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEJV90GGYP1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF6EA8K#wasThisHelpful","RAEJV90GGYP1G","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those novels that gets off to a great start but then gets a little wobbly at times, at least for me. It all has to do with the land of make believe that the soon-to-be-eight heroine Elsa wanders in and out of. Im willing to admit that the fault lies within me and not the author, however, since fantasy stories are not my favorite form of reading. That being said, the book does have its charm. The most cynical of us cannot argue with the Land-of-Almost-Awake where magical things happen, where, for instance, if you ever get separated from your grandmother or she gets lost, she will send a lion to tell you where she is.More about the relationship between Elsa and her whacky grandmother.  They are best, best friends. (Grandmothers to a person are always special in and out of literature and Grannie is no exception.)  This one, while in the hospital for cancer takes off all her clothes when she sits on the toilet and leaves the bathroom door open, throws turds at a policeman, rolls her own cigarettes and is described by one of her physicians as someone who could start a fight in an empty room. We do learn, as we get into the story, that she has her own set of minuses and that is where the title comes from: MY GRANDMOTHER ASKED ME TO TELL YOU SHES SORRY. Elsa in her own way is just as interesting as Grannie: precocious for seven, she uses Wikipedia, loves everything associated with Harry Potter, and writes political letters to Santa.I particularly like the aphorisms that Grannie strews along the path of her beloved granddaughter.  When Elsa says she is different, Grannies reply: Only different people change the world.  And being special is the best way of being different. Dont kick the st, itll go all over the place (one of my favorites). Grannie reminds Elsa that every child of a divorce can be eccentric.  And finally when Elsa asks hard questions about why people die and after Grannie is unsuccessful in trying to distract her with ice cream and changing the subject, she tells her that something always had to give up its own space so that something else could take its place. When I asked my own precious mother a similar question when I was four or five, she in a manner that still amazes me so many years later explained that we all get frail and sick and broken and we would all be miserable if we could not die.In one of the most touching scenes (for me) Elsa asks her father if he plans to have more children with his second wife Lisette. (Elsas mom is very pregnant throughout most of this novel with a second child by her second husband.) He responds that he has all the children he and Lisette need. Elsa asks the obvious question: is it because of her and because she is different. He whispers: Because you turned out to be perfect.A word about the assorted motley characters who live in Elsas apartment: the author finally pulls them all together in his little story that ultimately makes profound statements and childhood, parents, grandparents, love, death, mothers and daughters, children of divorce, and being different.  Quite an accomplishment to finally make sense of it all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWG00P3YJW6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501115065#wasThisHelpful","R3PWG00P3YJW6Q","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I owe Grady Harp big time for recommending BLIND TRIANGLE to me.  I would have missed the three hours or so I spent with these three characters who make up the doomed love triangle: Ray Styles, a genius with red hair that he wears in an Elvis pompadour to distinguish himself from the hippy culture of 1967; Tom Laurel, a beautiful young artist two years younger than Ray; and Soledad Paz, a black-haired prostitute but oh so much more than that (she only sleeps with wealthy women).  Mr. Deveny has created three completely empathetic characters who consumed me totally in the time it took me to finish this short novel of a little over 200 pages.As always, one fine novel reminds you of another.  I immediately thought of what Toni Morrison says in her latest novel GOD HELP THE CHILD about the harm that parents inflict on their children as these star-crossed characters are saddled with the sins of their parents, each in his or her own way. The novels of Tom Spanbauer also came to mind, particularly his latest I LOVED YOU MORE, another fantastic book about another triangle.As you read this novel, you know that these characters will not live happily ever after. The sense of danger and tragedy is everywhere although you hope again hope that all will be well with these three characters who find themselves in an impossible situation. Since anyone who reads the book blurb knows, at the center of this novel is Tommy's love for Ray. (Perhaps he would have fared better if the novel had been set in the present; but that would have been another story.) He is in a word obsessed with Ray.Mr. Deveny in beautifully-written prose shows tremendous insight into human beings with all their frailties as he speaks so eloquently about love, loss, longing, and sadness. Here is Tommy after he experiences Ray having a petit mal seizure: ""We both smiled, but from that moment on he was made of glass. That's the problem with loving people. Once they become precious to you, they're no longer just flesh and blood.""  And Tom on what he has gained from Ray: ""My father had started out life with no family and remained lost, trying hopelessly to free himself in the only ways known to the abandoned. My mother, for all her precious affection for me, could only present to him a love more dangerous than his own desperation. The two of them were crushed in an embrace from which nothing could survive. All of this understanding had come from Ray. Without his love I would have never seen my mother and father like this."" And one more out of so many. Here is Soledad in a conversation with Tom about Ray: ""'He made me laugh so that I forgot I was ever sad,' she said. `That as good. But also he knows sadness. I feel it in his body. That is better. Even though he is rich he knows sadness. That makes him wonderful.'""BLIND TRIANGLE is Mr. Deveny's debut novel. We can only hope that there are many more to follow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDJG96MDAHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YRCFSC2#wasThisHelpful","R2GDJG96MDAHP","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In HOW I SHED MY SKIN Jim Grimsley gives a brutally honest and sensitive account of growing up dirt poor in Eastern North Carolina, being eleven and  in the sixth grade when his elementary school became integrated in that state in 1966  and confronting his own bigotry.

For the white Southerner, the past was a better time than the present, even though it was tragic and painful."" And while no one ever said to him exactly as Mr. Grimsley states, he was raised to believe in the United States as a white nation, the South ""as a white paradise, and in the superiority of my European-descended race over all the other races of the earth.""Combining this honesty with fine writing makes for a fantastic memoir, as good as any I can remember reading.  His story resonates with me so much because I grew up in similar circumstances, that is, gay and very poor-- although my father was neither an alcoholic or wife abuser--  in a small town in East Tennessee a few years ahead of Mr.  Grimsley in North Carolina.

Something that helped him overcome his racism was figuring out early on that he too like the Afro-American students was different but in another way besides skin color since he was attracted to other boys. Would that that were the case with a lot of other Caucasians in the gay community. Members of the African American gay community in Atlanta, for instance, even in 2015 have their own gay pride events, a sad commentary on the racism that still exists among many white gay men. And since Mr.  Grimsley was in an integrated school, other students were confronting and dealing with the two races sharing the same school and paying less attention to the fact that he was gay.Mr. Grimsley closes this simply wonderful book with a chapter entitled ""Reunion"" and tells of going to his high school forty-year class reunion in 2013. Among the usual events, he attends a memorial service at a church for classmates who have died. He and a woman friend are the only white people in attendance.

"One reviewer described Tom Spanbauer's latest novel I LOVED YOU MORE as having ""messy beauty."" I'm not sure I can say it better. I have read and liked immensely three of his previous four novels. I never got into IN THE CITY OF SHY HUNTERS and suspect it probably was me and not the book. John Irving has a wonderful quotation in one of his novels about how the state of mind we are in plays a tremendous part in how we react to fiction at any given time so I'm willing to give that novel another try since everyone else I know who read it was much taken with it.I LOVED YOU MORE surely is Mr. Spanbauer's most ambitious novel to date. It is long and sprawling at 464 pages and covers many years in the lives of the three main characters: the narrator Ben Grunewald, his friends Hank Christian and Ruth Dearden. (I am well aware that good fiction does not have to be autobiographical although I believe Salman Rushdie has said that all fiction is but that it doesn't matter.) I so wanted this one to be a page from the author's life. Surely there are elements of Mr. Spanbauer's own experience in the narrator since just as the author is, Ben is gay, grows up in Pocatello, Idaho, studies writing in New York, works as both a waiter and super in apartment buildings while a student there, is diagnosed with AIDS and moves to Portland, Oregon and teaches writing. Of course Hank and Ruth could be figments of Mr. Spanbauer's fertile imagination, but I really wanted them to be people in his own life, particularly Hank. At one point in this sometimes painful novel, Ruth says in the presence of both Ben and Hank that she and Ben are both in love with Hank. But aren't we all in love with Hank, straight Hank, the man whose eyes the narrator describes over and over that should have been blue but are dark, almost black, who many years into their friendship tells Ben, ""'You're the one who's in my heart'""?Mr. Spanbauer is a master is creating characters who literally walk out of the novel into your living room and, if you are not careful, into your heart. You know dozens of things about them that he tells you over and over: how they look (I can see Ruth`s mane of red hair), how they smell (Ben`s wet feet), how they walk. And he is just as good at fleshing out characters whom we see for only a few pages. I'm thinking now of Andy Gronik, another wounded soul, just one example among many. The plot of the novel is certainly not linear. Mr. Spanbauer tells us early on how this story is going to end and then reminds us again and again. (The only other writer I can think of who does this so well is Toni Morrison.) And he throws everything into this novel-- love, AIDS, homophobia, guilt, sex, friendship, relationships, loneliness (those awful passages about the loneliness of the narrator's mother and sister), anger, racism, grief, illness, death, regrets (Ben never told Hank he loved him)-- and somehow makes it all fit together, no easy task.Of course there are passages that are good because of their beauty or because they hit you in your gut or because they ring true or maybe all three: ""If I don't eat by ten the world gets f----d up Francis Bacon on me."" ""No wonder everybody hates Christmas. F-----g memories, man."" ""Hank Christian. . . Nobody makes me laugh like him."" Then there is this evocative highly sexually-charged passage--that no writer other than possibly Reynolds Price does so well-- when the narrator describes Hank dancing: ""Slow, more like a man swimming than a man dancing, how a body moves, against the water. That way straight guys won't move their hips, Hank is moving. My a-- is beautiful, the way his hips are moving. The candlelight on the muscles of his back, his chest, his arms, that full, bright face framed in cornflower. His closed eyes, his nipples, his hairy underarms, the hair in the middle of his chest, light, dark, light dark, light and dark."" Finally there is the line from W. H. Auden that Mr. Spanbauer weaves into the narrative and title: ""If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving one be me.""Although I LOVED YOU MORE may wring you out, it is not a novel you want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ST23TTUITZFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN8O1E6#wasThisHelpful","R1ST23TTUITZFN","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When my reading friends saw that I was reading this book, to a person they lit up with comments like, Shes a great writer or I read The Lottery in high school and loved it. Unfortunately I have never read Ms. Jackson; had I done so, I suspect I could have seen the seeds that flourished into her well-known works in this new book of uncollected short fiction, essays, lectures and drawings by her in much the same way that we can see Herman Melvilles masterpiece MOBY DICK in his dreary earlier novels. (At least knowing his novel OMOO is good for crossword puzzles.)  There are certainly some interesting things happening in some of the short stories and essays, but I would be less than honest if I didnt say that I found much of this book too much of a task and not enough pleasure to read. And I wondered if Ms. Jackson would have wanted some of the material published. Some of the short fiction, for instance, seems unfinished. (The editors say so about the title story Let Me Tell You.)The first short story Paranoia was quite good. The suspense that Ms. Jackson builds up is palpable as in The Man in the Woods. In these two storiesand othersMs. Jackson made a believer out of me. She can write a horror story.  I particularly liked some of her essays. The one entitled A Garland of Garlands about book reviewersshe was married to one it seems-- using the tired language over and over was amusing: I realize now thinking back over the events of the last few years, that people marry book reviewers with the expectation that it is a temporary thing, that sooner or later the poor dear is going to find himself a better niche in life, such as selling vacuum cleaners. Book reviewing is just nothing for a healthy young woman to be married to. Her essay on fan mail (On Fans and Fan Mail) was a hoot.  I also enjoyed her review of  the novelist Samuel  Richardson. And she certainly knows all the perils and frustrations involved with raising four children. Many critics I suspect would agree with her that metaphors should be like garlic, used sparingly.This book then will probably be best appreciated by Ms. Jacksons already fans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q60KWSCSH0EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997662#wasThisHelpful","R3Q60KWSCSH0EP","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One reviewer described Tom Spanbauer's latest novel I LOVED YOU MORE as having ""messy beauty."" I'm not sure I can say it better. I have read and liked immensely three of his previous four novels. I never got into IN THE CITY OF SHY HUNTERS and suspect it probably was me and not the book. John Irving has a wonderful quotation in one of his novels about how the state of mind we are in plays a tremendous part in how we react to fiction at any given time so I'm willing to give that novel another try since everyone else I know who read it was much taken with it.I LOVED YOU MORE surely is Mr. Spanbauer's most ambitious novel to date. It is long and sprawling at 464 pages and covers many years in the lives of the three main characters: the narrator Ben Grunewald, his friends Hank Christian and Ruth Dearden. (I am well aware that good fiction does not have to be autobiographical although I believe Salman Rushdie has said that all fiction is but that it doesn't matter.) I so wanted this one to be a page from the author's life. Surely there are elements of Mr. Spanbauer's own experience in the narrator since just as the author is, Ben is gay, grows up in Pocatello, Idaho, studies writing in New York, works as both a waiter and super in apartment buildings while a student there, is diagnosed with AIDS and moves to Portland, Oregon and teaches writing. Of course Hank and Ruth could be figments of Mr. Spanbauer's fertile imagination, but I really wanted them to be people in his own life, particularly Hank. At one point in this sometimes painful novel, Ruth says in the presence of both Ben and Hank that she and Ben are both in love with Hank. But aren't we all in love with Hank, straight Hank, the man whose eyes the narrator describes over and over that should have been blue but are dark, almost black, who many years into their friendship tells Ben, ""'You're the one who's in my heart'""?Mr. Spanbauer is a master is creating characters who literally walk out of the novel into your living room and, if you are not careful, into your heart. You know dozens of things about them that he tells you over and over: how they look (I can see Ruth`s mane of red hair), how they smell (Ben`s wet feet), how they walk. And he is just as good at fleshing out characters whom we see for only a few pages. I'm thinking now of Andy Gronik, another wounded soul, just one example among many. The plot of the novel is certainly not linear. Mr. Spanbauer tells us early on how this story is going to end and then reminds us again and again. (The only other writer I can think of who does this so well is Toni Morrison.) And he throws everything into this novel-- love, AIDS, homophobia, guilt, sex, friendship, relationships, loneliness (those awful passages about the loneliness of the narrator's mother and sister), anger, racism, grief, illness, death, regrets (Ben never told Hank he loved him)-- and somehow makes it all fit together, no easy task.Of course there are passages that are good because of their beauty or because they hit you in your gut or because they ring true or maybe all three: ""If I don't eat by ten the world gets f----d up Francis Bacon on me."" ""No wonder everybody hates Christmas. F-----g memories, man."" ""Hank Christian. . . Nobody makes me laugh like him."" Then there is this evocative highly sexually-charged passage--that no writer other than possibly Reynolds Price does so well-- when the narrator describes Hank dancing: ""Slow, more like a man swimming than a man dancing, how a body moves, against the water. That way straight guys won't move their hips, Hank is moving. My a-- is beautiful, the way his hips are moving. The candlelight on the muscles of his back, his chest, his arms, that full, bright face framed in cornflower. His closed eyes, his nipples, his hairy underarms, the hair in the middle of his chest, light, dark, light dark, light and dark."" Finally there is the line from W. H. Auden that Mr. Spanbauer weaves into the narrative and title: ""If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving one be me.""Although I LOVED YOU MORE may wring you out, it is not a novel you want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY7WWZ8VGP1WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4HDR38#wasThisHelpful","RY7WWZ8VGP1WG","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toni Morrison always grabs you by the collar immediately with her novels (in this instance a 178 page novella) and never turns you loose.  That is certainly the case with GOD HELP THE CHILD that I read straight through.  It begins this way: Its not my fault. So you cant blame me. I didnt do it and have no idea how it happened. It didnt take more than an hour after they pulled her out from between my legs to realize something was wrong. Really wrong. She was so black she scared me. Midnight black, Sudanese black. Ms. Morrison certainly has lost none of her passion as she writes about racism, racism, racism and here color, color, color. The main character Bride, who is born Lula Ann Bridewell,  is despised by her very light-skinned mother (for an instant her mother contemplates smothering her) because she came into this world tar black. As an adult, she flees to California, changes her name to Bride, accentuates her blackness by wearing only white, a panther in snow, becomes an exotic beauty, finds a lucrative career (she now drives a Jaguar), and willing men to fall for her. But she is haunted by demons and certainly one very large one.Ms. Morrison tells her story that takes place in contemporary America in part with a third-person narrator and also with some of the characters, all of whom happen to be female, speaking directly to the reader.  In addition to Bride, her mother Sweetness speaks, as do Brooklyn, her best friend who is white, her mother Sweetness, Sofia, and Rain.This novella with not a wasted word will ultimately break your heart. It is dark, as dark as I remember BELOVED, although I read that one long ago when it was first published. I would be tempted to say the book is too dark except for two reasons: I have never walked in this brilliant writers shoes. (I remember her telling Charlie Rose in an interview years ago of helping an Italian kid in her class in elementary school in Ohio who was new in school and deficient in English. When the boys mother learned that he was being tutored by a young black girl, she complained to the instructor.)  And I can watch the news daily where young black men are being shot by white police officers far and wide.Ms. Morrison has created unforgettable characters here: Bride of course but Booker, Sweetness and Sofia; and who can forget Rain, the little girl with alabaster skin and the greenest eyes Bride had ever seen, and the lovable red-headed Queen who has made many mistakes in her knock-about life but has attained the wisdom we all seek in old age?This book makes  a profound statement about what parents do to children. (Ms. Morrisons quotation from Luke, Suffer  little children to come unto me, and forbid them not at the beginning of the novella is a harbinger of what is to come. And Sweetness, in a moment of self-awareness says: What you do to children matters. And finally GOD HELP THE CHILD is about love, our ultimate quest for it in all its varieties and how bereft we are in we do not find it. It surely is no coincidence that Ms. Morrison entitled another recent book simply LOVE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VBF80TMLKQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594173#wasThisHelpful","R33VBF80TMLKQE","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In these more than forty  fascinating little essays about Tokyo, Michael Pronko, the transplanted American from Kansas City, offers  kaleidoscopic views into his adopted city that he obviously finds simultaneously intriguing, beautiful and sometimes frustrating. He says that perhaps he settled in Tokyo to write them when he muses on why he came to Tokyo rather than Paris or Beijing.  His only qualifications for writing these essays, he says, are passion and curiosity.  (I would add at least two more:  an impeccable talent for writing  and a near-clinical attention to the most miniscule of details.) He neither attempts to bash the city nor put it on a pedestal, but rather to look right at it and write directly.Mr. Pronko gives us vignettes of areas and customs of Tokyo that I suspect a Tokyoite probably doesnt notice or takes for granted: the abundance of escalators, stairs, signs, banners, hanging menus, city maps that include cherry trees, the art of chopsticks (eating with chopsticks is eating with the eyes first, and then with the mouth), the dominance of the color pink among Tokyos women, etc., etc.  I particularly liked his essays on omnipresent T-shirts with English slogans the Tokyoites wear (MICROSHIT, PEARLY GATES, BOUNTY, NOT SPONSORED, SHOOT THE SUITS, JUST DID IT,),  the dividing gaps between buildings, the ritual of making small change, Don Quixotethe store with more than all the junk youll never need. (It sounds like a similar store in Japan Town in San Francisco where everything cheap and useless seems to be available.) But then there is Mr. Pronkos little praise song to eating a bowl of ramen (Ramen has touched the heartand stomachof this one non-Japanese deeply). And every essay in the section entitled A Maze of the Mind intrigued me. One essay in this section, A-maze-ing Tokyo, is Mr. Pronkos play on wordsTokyo is a city of mazeswith few if any straight lines getting you from A to B but in the end an amazing city. I would say the same about these essays. They too are amazing.Finally the greatest compliment I can give Mr. Pronko: should I ever be so fortunate as to visit Tokyo, I would certainly take his book with me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPXPR2UNG7JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194241000X#wasThisHelpful","RDPXPR2UNG7JX","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have known Bob Van Keuren since 1983, have spent many hours with him in the past thirty or so years and thought I knew him. When I finished this so-very-well written memoir, I was taken aback at all the things I never knew about him. Unlike me and many of my friends, Bob has that rarest of qualities: he is modest about his considerable accomplishments. A real class act. I never knew that he was permitted to stand, compliments of the Doorkeeper of the House of Representatives, at the front of the House Chambers where the president of the U. S. stands when he addresses a joint session of Congress in the State of the Union address; or that when he served in the U. S. Navy, that he visited all those exotic foreign countries (although I knew he had served in the Navy); or that he had a masters degree in journalism from the University of South Carolina; or that he had worked in all those political campaigns of progressive Democrats; or that he met Hubert Humphrey, or that he had dressed up as George Washington complete with a wig (Bob in drag?) for a festive event in Boston when he was president of a professional organization to which he belonged.  The list is long.While Bob is so totally honest about practically every aspect of his life, he also exhibits another quality long out of style-- when the most uninteresting sad-sacks on earth tell the most tawdry details of their sordid lives before the likes of Dr. Phil and Jerry Springer and the assembled TV multitudesrestraint. And one more rare quality of all too few writers: Bob does not trash individuals with whom he disagrees vehemently. For example, when he discusses the late Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina who spewed out [my words; not Bobs] his poisonous venom in favor of segregation, Bob does not remind the reader (I would have) that the Senator was big on affirmative action in his bedroom and surely guilty of statutory rape as well. There were times that Bobs narrative made my eyes burn: for instance, when he surprised his father one Christmas with the book WALL he had edited that his father had written (I felt cheated that I never met his parents) and Bobs chapter on the assassination of President Kennedy. His chapter entitled I Had a Sweetheart about his nine-year relationship with Montie that ended only in his death is beautiful and moving too.Bob begins each chapter with a quotation, sometimes by someone famous but just as often from an anonymous source. My three favorites, beginning with the second runner-up first is that glorious line from the Paul Simon song: And every strangers face I see reminds me that I long to be homeward bound. The next quotation is from President Kennedy: Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our childrens future. And we are all mortal. And finally from Shirley Temple: I stopped believing in Santa Claus when I was six. Mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph.Bob suggests that, although he is neither famous or celebrated, he is a man of his time and that perhaps that is reason enough for people to read his book.  I think he is right. He is the child of parents who started a home and family when his dad returned from World War II, he remembers the significance of radio, television and the advent of the world of computers, the civil rights era, andsadly-- the onslaught of AIDS:It would be a shame if only those of us who love himhis beloved sister Jeanie, his friends and his family at St. Bartholomews Episcopal Church in Atlanta (Bobs ashes he says will end up in the memorial garden there)--  are the only ones who read this gentle,  ever-engaging memoir.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRA9NGU0LV9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511541652#wasThisHelpful","R2YRA9NGU0LV9D","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When this sample arrived in the mail from Tokyo, the amount-- equal to about a tablespoon-- seemed just about the right amount. The resulting color and subtle flavor were perfect.

"Henning Mankell in THE CAT WHO LIKED RAIN has written a near-perfect childrens book. He is quoted as saying about this story:  This might even be my most important book. While I have not read everything this fine writer has written, this certainly is as good a childrens novel as I can remember having read and as good as the 8 or 10 books of his of all kinds that I  have read. Would this story appeal to a youngster? I do not know, but I would certainly like to put it in the hands of a child and find out. Until I can do that, Im pressing it into a middle-aged child friend of mine for his reaction right away.Lukas gets a completely black cat except for a white marking on his tail for his seventh birthday. It is love at first sight, at least for Lukas. He names his new friend Night. He wants to understand everything about Night: It seemed to Lukas that it wasnt easy to understand what went on in a cats head. Lukas knew how he behaved when he was angry or upset or happy. But he wasnt at all sure how Night reacted in such circumstances. Lukas knew that Nights tail would be upright when he was pleased and contented, and that he would rush up against Lukas legs, and that he would purr. But what would Night do when he was upset?  Lukas sets about to take care of and understand Night. Then problems begin when Night comes up missing. And that is all I can say about the plot without revealing too much.It is obvious that Mr. Mankell is no stranger to cats or to seven-year-old and fourteen-year-old boys (Lukas has an older brother Markus whose nickname is Whirlwind). The author gets all the shenanigans of Night just right. He hides in places in the home making it difficult for Lukas to find him,  he likes to jump up and lie on the highest shelf in the kitchen,  he awakens Lukas at four in the morning  when he is ready to play,  he is not interested in being put on a leash.  But Mr. Mankell  flips one characteristic of most cats: Night apparently likes to prowl in the rain.  And Lukas tiffs and run-ins with Whirlwind are so very typical of two brothers this far apart in age growing up together. The parents Axel and Beatrice who round out this family are good and loving parents. They are both attentive and sensitive to Lukas every need and feeling. That is not to say, however, that they are story-book parents. They behave the way most decent parents do. This of course does not happen by accident. As he always does--and one of the reasons he is one of my favorite authors-- Mr. Mankell shows tremendous empathy for these characters.THE CAT WHO LIKED RAIN is first about a young boys love for a pet: At that moment, Lukas knew he was in love with this cat. Hed often wondered what it would be like, being in love with something. Now he knew.  It is also a moving account of parents love  for their children and vice-versa, and probably most importantly as good a story as I can remember that gently teaches a youngster the lesson of loss. There is a magic about it as well that should appeal to everyone.  There are so many gentle touches in the story: on the first day of school Lukas knows he will tell his classmates about Night, he loves the smells he associated with his father whom he adores, Beatrice helps Lukas put up notices about his missing cat.  Additionally the illustrations are, as the Brits say so much better than AmericansI dont know about the Swedeslovely.This is a little book that, upon finishing, you want to give to cat-lovers as well as practically every other reader you know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAR2KOJ98MFRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SB2T5PU#wasThisHelpful","RAR2KOJ98MFRS","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When you get past the namethere must have been a better title for this series of booksSOCIAL SECURITY FOR DUMMIES, like every other book I have read with Dummies in the title, is a first rate book with important information about everything connected with Social Security. You name it: the author Jonathan Peterson, AARP Executive Communications Director, covers it and in language the average reader should understand. When is the best time to apply for Social Security, how to get a new Social Security card if you lose yours, how much a surviving spouse can draw, how to apply for Medicare, the pros and cons of buying long-term health insurance: these are just a few items that jumped out at me. There is fact after fact that I didnt know. How about this one? You can get three replacement Social Security cards in a year and a total of ten in a lifetime.  And your birthday determines which Wednesday in the month you get your Social Security check, which almost always no longer is a check but is deposited in your banking account; hence the saying, the checks in the mail is no longer accurate.The second edition of the book is completely up-to-date. Two items I noticed: The book incorporates the new health law with the information that seniors will only pay 25% for prescription drugs if they find themselves in the gap known as the doughnut hole by the year 2020. (This is information I have tried on more than one occasion to rely to seniors who remain steadfast in their belief that they are going to lose their SS benefits under the new health law.) The book also includes information on the new definition of spouses (p. 156). The SSA now offers benefits to spouses in same-sex marriages who live in states that recognize these unions.Since I am helping someone apply for the Social Security, I found that section of the book very helpful. Mr. Peterson gives good advice for the applicant. You should be honest in your answers. You should not exaggerate your disability; on the other hand, you should not shy away from telling what you are unable to do either.I particularly liked chapter 15: the ten myths about Social Security. Myth number fourId Be Better Off Investing in Stocks I found particularly informative.  One of the facts that Mr. Peterson puts forthamong several-- to counter this myth: Social Security benefits can be paid at an early age, should an individual experience a tragedy, and would certainly have not built up a nest egg on the stock market or other savings plan.Finally a word about the layout of this informative book: pages numbers both black and large as are the different sections of the book. The author also includes charts and what he labels Tips and Remember to better help you navigate this really easily laid-out book so you can just pick and choose the topics that apply to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNFST04HAV1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118967569#wasThisHelpful","R3KNFST04HAV1S","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seemed only appropriate to share the cake with the gift-giver.  She was quite taken with it and declared it a keeper. Mr. Yosses in his acknowledgments quotes from the chef Philippe Conticini who said that he wanted to create emotions in the mouththis bundt cake does just that comments that he loves that phrase and thinks that is the dessert makers highest calling. Amen and amen.There are at least a half dozen more recipes I plan to try. (It has usually been my experience that if one recipe in a cookbook of all of one kind of recipes, desserts, breads, soups, etc., that there isnt a bad recipe in the bunch.) The lemon pound cake supreme looks divine, Mamie Eisenhowers cheesecake is inviting, apple conversation beckons as does soft almond cake with fresh raspberries. But I think Ill try the yogurt cake next. And I went outside this cookbook to locate Mr. Yosses apple pie recipe that is a favorite of President Obama. I want to bake that one too.I would certainly purchase another cookbook by this chef.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IGUYAB7FY5E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393059537#wasThisHelpful","R2IGUYAB7FY5E9","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"June Carter Cashs last CD, with thirteen cuts, has a lot of stuff thrown in: some of it fantastic, some of it I would have omitted. The fantastic first is the A. P. Carter song Storms Are on the Ocean. Whoever decided to support Junes voice with just an acoustic guitar (Norman Blake), a cello and violin hit the ball out of the park, if we are using a sports metaphor. The use of a cello, an instrument we dont usually associate with mountain/country music was a stroke of genius on someones part. My second favorite song is one that June and her sister Helen wrote, The Road to Kaintuck. This is a kicky song, completely not politically correctcountry music never iswith great accompaniment and with Johnny and womens backup vocals chiming inaltogether an A production. Other A. P. Carter standards are included: Keep on the Sunny Side, Sinking in the Lonesome Sea, Cannonball Blues, Will You Miss Me When Im Gone, Anchored in Love and Wildwood Flower. Will You Miss Me with Johnny and the women supporting June is a great contribution as well.Keep on the Sunny Side and Wildwood Flower are usually two of my favorites by A. P. but not here.  In these arrangements the accompaniment is way too loud. Someone should have done a better job mixing. These plaintive mountain songs are best kept simple. Less is more in these instances. Anchored in Love with those glorious twangy voices of Joe and Janet Carter, A. P. Carters children is a perfect example of what I mean: as pure and non-complicated as a Virginia mountain stream.The one song I refuse to listen to and would have left off this CD is one written by Maybelle and her daughters: Kneeling Drunkards Plea. Enough said.  A word about Junes voice: I think most people would say that she did not have the best voice of the three Carter sisters. On the other hand, as she has aged, her voicealthough she does not always hit all the higher notes perfectlyhas taken on that beautiful alto quality of her mothers voice. In places on the CD she sounds just like Maybelle, a very good thing.The artwork on the CD is beautiful and appropriate. And Rosanne Cash writes a moving tribute and includes the eulogy she gave at her mothers funeral.  (It speaks volumes about June that she refused to let the words step-mother or step-children be heard in her home.) Should anyone be interested, Rosanne Cash has written a fine memoir about her life and June and Johnnys; a book entitled WILL YOU MISS ME WHEN IM GONE, about the original Carter family is a great study of both the family and the times and place that produced them as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFHFDEG6K0V9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001LNOZG#wasThisHelpful","RFHFDEG6K0V9P","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These two tunnels are quite attractive with colorful horizontal stripes on both of them. As you can see from the illustration, each tunnel has a hanging ornament and one of them has a hole in the middle to make the adventure in the tunnel that more of an adventure.Alas, alas. My large yellow long-haired cat sniffed both tunnels when I put them down on the hallway on the path to his litter box and ultimately to his food bowl in my kitchen. He since the initial sniffing refuses to come near these delightful toys. I even tried holding one up to see if I could get his attention. That ploy did not work either.Let me make myself clear. I in no way blame the maker of these tunnels. I have tried other bought toys over the years, some of them quite expensive,  for my cat that the vet thinks is now probably eleven or twelve years old;  and he only played with one of them that he destroyed fairly quickly. His favorite toys remain in no particular order: a roll of toilet paper, my naked ankles, any pen or pencil preferably near the edge of a table so he can roll it onto the floor, and my computer keyboard any time I am typing. (I kid you not. He has just approached my computer and has taken a liking to my ankles as well.)My only concern about these tunnels is that while they are light and collapsible, it takes some doing to get them fastened down after you collapse them.I received a sample for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31RNHKWH0QFKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2G83K0#wasThisHelpful","R31RNHKWH0QFKB","A9I40WFF40R4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9I40WFF40R4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot find much to like about this book. You are to mix and match as to what you want to do each day while in Tokyo, selecting from the three sections (about the size of a business card) on each page. The book comes equipped with a cord that you place over the three sections that you have selected for your itinerary for the day to hold them in place. An added disadvantage is that because of the size of the book and these tabs-- if that's the right word-- both the type and the photographs are very small. I suppose there might be some use for this book if you had another guide book on Tokyo.

"As a USB connected printer, this is a fine printer for the price. It works well when wired. It's much quieter than the prior Brother laser printer I've had (I've had 3 of them over the years) and it seems to print about the same quality if not better, albeit it uses a different toner cartridge and drum model.But this printer is a total pain to set up to print wirelessly on Mac OSX.  You're better off running a USB cable quite frankly. I did find it to work better if you set up the printer using the printer's IP address, after you connect it to your wifi network. You can find this after you connect the printer to your wifi router and then look in your router setup for the IP addresses of all connected devices.  Then, add that in the Printers & Scanners control panel using the IP address. Why? Because the built in Brother set up software is garbage and just didn't work reliably at all. After sleeping the computer, it would no longer recognize the printer as online, even though it was on. The IP address method seems to work a lot better than Brother's own set up method unfortunately.I also could not get the AirPrint feature (to print from an iPhone or iPad) to work. It just says 'no printer available' even when the computers can print to it via wifi. Really annoying! Brother- don't advertise a feature if you haven't fully tested it.I even tried the Brother iPrint & Scan app, which also did not work at first, until I used the IP address of the printer in the app, then it worked fine. At least I can use this app to print from my mobile devices but it would have been nice if it worked via AirPrint like they advertise.Brother really could have done a lot better!  That said, this may be par for the course for wifi printer as this point. I'm reading reviews of other manufacturers laser printers, which don't sound any better.To reiterate, this is a very nice printer when used via USB. It's just the wifi setup and reliability that could really be improved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO8FYLER673EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZS5EEI#wasThisHelpful","RO8FYLER673EK","A1F9Z42CFF9IAY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F9Z42CFF9IAY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:38 MinsI like the fact that you can connect this to your wifi network and use your iPhone as an extension. I have my iPhone nearby more than I would this handset and also can use a Bluetooth earpiece or wired headset on the iPhone to make landline calls using this.Unfortunately, this handset itself does not use Bluetooth and has no jack for  a headset. It is also not very ergonomic to hold up to your ear and talk on. Further, if a woman who wears makeup uses it, the makeup gets in the little speaker holes and also into the edge of the screen, which is sorta gross. A bad design really. The speakerphone works great though so plan on using that or your iPhone, more than holding this handset up to your ear to talk on.The setup was easy and the design of this fairly simple, which I appreciate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQE5W8BN86W7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4MG9JG#wasThisHelpful","RQE5W8BN86W7F","A1F9Z42CFF9IAY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F9Z42CFF9IAY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you don't have any issues with your current USB audio, or have another device already such as the Schiit Wyrd which is cleaning up your USB as I did, I would skip this.On the plus side, if you don't have anything cleaning your USB yet, the cost of entry of this is low so you can see if it makes any improvement for you without too much risk.Overall, it just made the sound a bit unnatural and not necessarily as musical with some types of music such as heavy metal/hard rock.

Useless.-The smartphone app is $6.00 additional (although there is a limited free version). This gives a feeling that Rde is trying to nickel and dime customers.- The Rode SC3 TRRS to TRS adapter, which is not included is another $15.- This mic sounds just okay, not great.I also found this mic sounds a lot better with the wind screen off so I recommend you only use that if you have to. The windscreen made my voice sound quite thin.For a mic going into your iPhone I guess it's fine, but for anything else, look elsewhere.UPDATE: I much prefer the Giant Squid Audio Lab Omnidirectional Microphone.

"AudioBook Review  Stars: Overall 3.5 Narration 3 Story 3.5  (rounded)I really liked Opening Up (book one) and found Duke to be a laid-back, nice to everyone sort of guy. It actually seemed like he was more concerned with not getting involved deeply to not hurt anyones feelings, rather than a hang up. But, the overall impression is a man youd like to know. With a long-standing flirtation with his neighbor Carmella, you could see the two had something there, it just wasnt bagged and tagged with a label, yet.An opening in the garage when his secretary is moving on is the perfect opportunity to spend more time with Camilla, and thats no hardship. But, like Asa, hes not so sure business and pleasure mix, but he is willing to give it a shot.  Carmella is a bit reserved but no pushover: shes capable of declaring her wants and needs, and wont depend on anyone, but she can also ask for help when it becomes apparent she needs it. I really liked her, although I wanted her to be more forthright and clear to Duke about his behavior when he danced over the line of respectful and callous.Now, these two were steamy, and their conversations were clever and interesting, but there was just some spark missing from this story. It didnt make it bad, or less intriguing to see where things were going and how the characters would learn to come together, but it just wasnt as rapid fire as the first book.Narration is again provided by Sasha Dunbrooke, and as with the first, her voice fits Carmella neatly, but the voice for Duke most often reminded me of an exuberant puppy.  None of the strong alpha came through in the voice performance, and while the words were right the lack of distinction in vocal tones failed to present the character in a way I expected.  Again her emphasis, pauses and tone fit nicely with emotional elements in the text and were appropriate, but this was a decent performance overall, with room for improvement.Its inevitable, in my experience, to find a series where a book is still good and enjoyable, but not quite as good as hoped for. That was this book, but I still enjoy the premise, the characters are built with some solid foundations and their connections are plausible.  Im looking forward to the next in the series focused on Mick, now back from the war and his lover(s).I received an AudioBook copy of the title from Hachette Audio for purpose of honest review.

"AudioBook Review  Stars: Overall 4  Narration 3 Story 4The first in a new contemporary series by Lauren Dane, Opening Up is the story of Asa and PJ, two people who are convinced the other is exactly what they DONT need.  A mix of blue-collar take charge men, women who hold their own in more ways than one and several moments of steam will keep readers (and listeners) panting for the next moment and installment.Asa and his partner Duke have a custom garage  specializing in motorcycles and vintage muscle cars.  Hes one of those gruff, bristly men who appears more than slightly menacing and completely in control.  All of that (we know) hides his soft and fluffy center, but not only is it a struggle to get to that center, once you have reached it his control issues take over. Asa is more than fond of knowing what is best for those around him, or so he thinks.PJ is the baby of her family, and works for the family tire business. Like many women in male-dominated industries, she has to be on her toes and better than the boys at all times: while others outside the family see her as capable and confident, her father has yet to fully trust her. While shes good at her job, she really wants to branch out and start her own custom paint line, where proving herself to the clients is the only constant pressure.  Instantly attracted to Asa, the two have a hot and steamy night, and then he reinstates his rule: no mixing business and pleasure.  Oh, and hes decided PJ is too young to know her own mind.There were times when a crescent wrench against the side of Asas head would not have gone amiss: hes so sure he knows what is right for everyone else that he completely misses the turns in front of him. Yes, PJ is younger but shes determined, smart, clever and funny, and she wants him despite his overwhelming tendency to treat her like a child.  Hes unwilling to admit that PJ makes him crazy in all the good ways, and that he just could see himself rearranging his life to have her. Big scary monster in the closet. Shes more than willing to call him out on his bad behavior, she has no problem challenging his habit of being in charge of everything, and while you can see the fireworks in their spats, there really isnt anything that the two dont, or cant share. The occasional dust up for PJ in the ongoing conflict with her father and his inability to take her seriously plays nicely with her determination, and has a simple, if rather quick resolution.Narration for this story is provided by Sasha Dunbrooke, who has an interesting rasp to her voice that plays nicely for PJ.  I dont think there was a great distinction between characters, a touch of tone or delivery emphasis was the most obvious with her male characters, although the differences were often uneven when dialogue was rapid fire. A solid performance that would have benefitted from more consideration paid to developing distinct voices that were consistently applied would have helped this performance.Fortunately, the story is such a fast-paced and enjoyable listen that the minor hiccups in the performance soon fade away as the characters of PJ and Asa take over, and their story takes flight.  A wonderful start to a new series, sure to please fans of romance with heat and humor.I received an AudioBook copy of the title via Hachette Audio for purpose of honest review.

"Not always a go-to genre for me, Cynthia Eden just may have me picking up more romantic suspense in the future.  The LOST Team (Last Option Search Team) is back on the case in New Orleans, and nothing is truly as you thought it was.Jax is a member of LOST, a total badass and while not always completely on the right side of the law, he is committed to his team, their missions and those he is tasked to find (or protect).  Hes not the typical bad boy though: there is heart and caring underneath the get it done exterior, and his desire and caring for Sarah is palpable.Sarah is a criminal psychologist, and there is something to be said for her looking to her past to inform her career.  With a father of dubious morals, shes encountered the dark side more personally than many, and her ability to not shrink away from difficult or emotionally taxing situations show an iron core that doesnt diminish from her ability to be vulnerable and admit when she is in over her head.An attack on Sarah throws she and Jax into a maelstrom, and with a girl turning up missing that coincides with Sarahs attack, everything starts to twist and turn into a giant, edge of your seat, read with the lights on story.  With plenty of heart and heat between Sarah and Jax, angst as Sarah faces demons and darkness from her past and the overriding mystery, this story was jam packed with thrills galore.I received an eArc copy from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"The second I have read from this series, Darcy Burke always seems to keep me wondering just how her characters will work out their issues.  A key plotting device for romance is conflict and uncertainty, and it doesnt always have to come from actions, but can, as in this story, come from personalities and approaches to life.  Evan Archer has always preferred quiet, from focusing on his own projects to living out of the chaos that was common in his family. Hes got a chance to return home to take over the creative team for Archer Enterprises, but just how well will he cope with the chaos, noise and people that are sure to come with the position.Alaina is a celeb, a movie star with a paparazzi problem and a tabloid scandal. She wants nothing more than to hide away, but escaping the limelight is proving to be near impossible. Her friend and business partner offers her an out, and soon she is staying in a quiet little apartment at the Archers.Its critical for readers to know that Evan has moved away from Ribbon Ridge to both pursue his own goals and to be defined by something other than his Aspergers, the first key to his preference for solitude.  When he first meets Alaina, hes intrigued (as is she) but hes never thought himself as capable of, nor wanting, a relationship and all of the associated stress, so the options of them as a couple are limitedBurke uses the characters own issues and self-esteem issues to become the focal points of this story, Evan is not his diagnosis, he has issues and fears just like everyone else. And Alaina, despite her fame and notoriety has her own set of baggage she brings. The two are beautifully built and detailed, showing how they push and pull against the feelings that are overtaking their attraction, and shouting for something more.  Right up until the end Burke kept a sense of will they or wont they and kept me on the edge of my seat. Sweetly heartwarming, this story presents a tale that is hard to forget but will leave you smiling.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"The first I have read by this author or of this series, I found this book read nicely without great holes. Well written and reasonably paced, the story moves between Daniel and Shannon, sharing their wounds, sharing with one another and learning to work together.A bit old school country music to the story  there were so many elements added to build empathy for and a connection to the characters that I found rather superfluous. Its fine to have some tragedy but when things just pile on one after the other, I tend to see that character as pitiful, not particularly engaging.  While dancing on this edge, March did pull back on the pity party when she showed Shannon and Daniel and their connection with the growth of esteem and love between them.There were several moments that danced over the edge of believability for me, but those quickly were offset with sweeter moments of sharing memories and characters that are (I expect) familiar to readers of the series.  Dialogue in this is wonderfully crafted and realistic, and that goes a long way to upping the enjoyment factor.  I was a smidge disappointed in that the Christmas-y moments and seasonal elements I expected were late comers to the party, it did lighten the story somewhat, after a rather angsty read.While the first I have read from this author, it wont be the last. I enjoyed her writing style and flow if not always where the story led, but Im going to take a chance and grab a couple of other titles to see what shakes out.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review: I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKZVSCOTUK23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHJM7RU#wasThisHelpful","RJKZVSCOTUK23","A14I311IIUMBWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14I311IIUMBWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toss together a prophecy, a matchmaker, a retreat to Ireland that soon tosses the heroine into the 15th century and a fianc in the present time who just isnt Mr. Right and you get The Winter Laird, the debut offering from Nancy Scanlon.As a matchmaker, Brianagh is incredibly successful, and believes that her clients all deserve, and thus get, a Happy Ever After.  She, however, isnt convinced that more than a comfortable is good enough for now is in the cards for herself. Her long term relationship, Matthew is less than perfect, but pragmatism wins and when he proposes, she says yes. But she hasnt really settled, or only settled about 75% because in her dreams she has found the perfect man, until she sees him killed and is convinced it is her fault.Thinking she needs a break before her own wedding (and more of Matthews juvenile behavior) she heads to Ireland to commune with her roots.  When the ORourke clans story of being passage keepers for time is revealed, she thinks it quaint  and then.Thrust back into time, she meets the man from her dreams: only to find out they were promised as children. Nicolas has spent the past 20 years searching for this woman he knows to be his  but time is passing and he worries his chances for any marriage are decreasing. And then, there she is, exactly as he pictured her.Far less focus on the romance, while the two do find a connection and work to overcome their own hesitations and curious circumstances to build to a possible happy ending.  With a mix of past, present and future the story moves forward with a fast pace, and occasionally the frequent switches in time are dizzying, as Brianagh does NOT adjust her behavior after the time slip. This made for a few confusing passages until the present scene sorted itself out, but I was so engaged and intrigued that those moments didnt matter overmuch.  Nicolas is a far better man and match for Bri, and his honor and faith in her and her strange story fit perfectly with his being an Irishman from his time: fae and the impossible were often far easier to believe.  Dialogue and situations blend nicely, feeling possible and plausible, and the few twists add intrigue and drama to the plot, as it all resolves neatly and satisfactorily, without feeling rushed or pushed.A great debut offering and a wonderful start to a series that mixes time travel, history and a touch of romance in an era and a place (Ireland) that is not overly common in todays fiction.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"Three stories all centered around the holiday are the backbone of this collection, two that are series-specific (one from Sisterhood and one from Godmothers) and one that mixes the two groups in an unexpected yet thoroughly heartwarming way.  While Ive not read more current titles by Fern Michaels, Im familiar with the women of the Sisterhood, and this was a nice introduction to the characters from the Godmothers series.  While working nicely without having current information on the women featured in this title (and Michaels does give a bit of background information) isnt necessary, it does whet my appetite to go back and read earlier titles in both series.In the first story, And The Angels Sing, the women of the sisterhood are banding together to help one of their own during the season. Maggie has carried around a burden of guilt from her childhood, and the former teacher that her very young self couldnt help disappeared without a word.  Deciding to pool their not inconsiderable resources into the search and redeem mission, the friendship and support that these women offer one another is heartwarming.Quickly this transitions into a story of the Godmothers, Naughty or Nice, and Toots is center stage. Oh I loved Toots interior monologue, her ability to thumb her nose at convention and the rather rigid social mores of Charleston.  When a design assistant for her daughters home becomes the center of the story as she and her three children are struggling to make ends meet with her husband deployed, and incommunicado for months.  Between the spats with Toots and others, the struggles of Charlotte and the wonderful descriptions, this story leads to a wonderful series of moments.Then two worlds collide (or collude- you pick) with A Golden Tree.  Holly is running her familys inn for the first Christmas after her mothers death, without her very pregnant and uber capable best friend and assistant.  With her Grandfathers recent move to a lauded (and exclusive) assisted living facility, shes in need of help. And she hires on Gannon to get through the holidays, not knowing that he and his Grandfather (her grandfathers new bestie) own a competing inn.  In pop Annie and Myra from the Sisterhood, as they have recruited Toots and Sophie to solve a tiny (but very dangerous) mystery at the Haven, the assisted living facility. Clever and fun, the hijinks soon ensue as the two newbies to the investigation break things wide open.A lovely Christmas feel that brings forward the theme of better to give than to receive runs through each story, and while the characters have plenty of life and personality, and all was neatly presented with their full force forward, there are quirks and kinks galore to be explored, and now I will do just that by grabbing all the titles I have missed from these two series.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"AudioBook Review  Stars:  Overall 5 Narration 5 Story 5One of six daughters, Dorchen was the wild one of the family and one who held both imagination and daring close.  Her family was well off for the time: a pharmacist, he expected his girls to have a certain level of suitor, one that the lowly and impoverished Grimm family could not hope to meet.It is during the time of Napoleon, and his encroachment through Europe strikes fear and unease in the people.  During this time, Dorchen and Wilhelm Grimm have formed a friendship, and the two are never far apart.  Kate Forsyth mixes historical fiction and imagined events to build the young characters as they share stories and tales: Dorchens imagination and flair for the dramatic make her a wonderful storyteller, and she shares tales with Wilhelm, tales that will soon fall into the realm of the forgotten as Napoleon is taking over and remaking Europe in a manner of his own choosing.  The old tales and stories are important to Wilhelm, as he sees them as a part of his own history.  Bit by bit, Dorchen is encouraged to remember and retell these stories, stories that will soon form the majority of tales we now know as Grimms Fairy Tales.As the 6th of 7 daughters, the recognition, attention and even possibilities for marriage or a life of her own choosing are slim, particularly as her father has his own plans, and isnt a particularly jocular or kindly sort.  When the time together blooms from distraction to friendship to love, she is denied permission to marry, and this sets up some of the hauntingly dark and often brutal moments of the story.  In fact, Dorchen and Wilhelm did eventually marry, and his collaboration of forbidden folk tales with his brother came into existence as simple fairy tales, with no acknowledgment of either their history or Dorchens part in the story.Narration is provided by Kate Reading and she has a tone and presentation style that perfectly highlights the story, adding emotion, emphasis, and silences where required, shifting subtly to announce or present each character and clearly imbue the story with the overriding emotion of the moment: childlike joy, fear, anger, stealth.While moments run from wonderfully engaging to dark and brutal, Forsyths writing style maintains a smooth and easy to follow flow, quietly inserting actual events around the moments of imagined conversation and emotion, bringing both to life.  A weighty story at almost 18 hours listening time, this story does break neatly into sections  you can listen and break, mull over what you have covered, and be ready to pick up the next bit.  As a fan of historic fiction and one who appreciates the old style of fairy tale, it was a wonderful addition full of moments that transport and entertain.I received an AudioBook copy of the title from the publisher via AudioBook Jukebox for purpose of honest review.

"AudioBook Review:  Stars:  Overall 3  Narration 4  Story 2So  this is wholly a YA, leaning to teen listen with characters that border on the stereotypical. Sadly, while there were some clever moments in the use of werewolves, the characters themselves were rather thin and underdeveloped, or presented with quirks that needed far more than a quick mention (or repeated and often overused phrases) to build them with some depth.In short, Samara is fifteen, a good girl who is obsessed with being just that, with a best friend who is the poster child for party-girl central.  Shes got a difficult life at home (we are told often) but her hesitancy in asking the right questions or actually looking at the situation before just forging ahead according to whim of the moment is frustrating.  When shes finally asked out by her crush of long standing, and she is then bitten by a wolf, her life starts to change.As a wolf, Samara is finding things changed  two alphas wanting her to join their packs, with no real explanation as to why she was turned. Oh yeah  she has to make a choice because of strife between the two packs, and her bloodline allows her to make that choice.  Confused yet?Let me elaborate  we have a convoluted storyline of the wolf, we have the teenaged girl hiding her wolf side in school and at home.  And we have secrets. Lots of secrets  all leading to an ending.  Wait. There is no real ending.  Not a one. Not even a solid conclusion to bring us to some sort of satisfaction.  A HUGE peeve of mine  Im cool with a cliffhanger for an ongoing major issue (the wolf pack wars could be that) but something solid and important should have been decided. And wasnt.Narration has been provided by Meghan Kelly, the second or third title I have reviewed that she has narrated.  Her performance was solid, capturing Samara and her friends voices with a tone that gave them a teen edge, and her male voices didnt overreach into cartoony-overact.  Her performance and the emotion that she brought to a book solidly lacking in substance kept me listening on, a clear bonus for a story so full of issues.In short  I wouldnt recommend this book  but I would most certainly take a chance with another title from this narrator.I received an AudioBook copy of the title for purpose of honest review.

"AudioBook Review:  Stars: Overall:  4 Narration: 3  Story: 4When I start a collection, I expect that there is some common thread tying the stories together, and while not instantly apparent in Bream Gives Me Hiccups, Eisenberg has managed to take moments of life that present an instant issue for the character, whether it be an explanation, a relationship or even a worry.Multiple moments experiment with different narrative styles: conversations, letters, emails, texts and even a story using reviews all present themselves with a distinct style, solidly appropriate to the style of narration.While I found the stories had flow, it was a collection that required attention: with narrator changes in the writing and presentation, each moment required an adjustment in the listen, and some stories required a second or third listen to absorb the impact.Narration was from a cast of characters: Jesse Eisenberg, Hallie Eisenberg, Annapurna Sriram, Erin Darke, and Colin Nissan, and while each narrator felt appropriate for their story, the frequent changes in presenter, for me, is a bit unsettled, I prefer not to readjust expectations or concentration with each new moment.Overall, I liked this curious little collection: the mix of narrative style and form was intriguing and unique, and while I do have favorites (My Roommate Stole my Ramen, Restaurant Reviews from a Privileged Nine Year Old, Marv Albert is my Therapist, My Mother Explains the Ballet to Me) each story brought some humor and humanity into rather awkward moments of life, those moments that bring forward emotions that are puzzling, funny or downright weird.I received an AudioBook copy of the title from Audible Customer Relations for purpose of honest review.

"As I found in A Hundred Summers this book was a little slow to start for me, and combined two stories from two differing timelines and places.  It is in the interweaving of these two stories, and the common elements in each story that have the two timeframes working to tell the tale.In 1966, we meet Pepper as she is introduced, in a roundabout way to the other focus of this story, Annabelle.  From there, the storylines intersect and divide, taking off into a tale of life in pre-war 1930s Europe as we move to the nearer dates of mid-60s America.These two stories were a tad uneven, Annabelles character and her life in Europe were richly detailed and emotionally available, through threats, romance, struggles and heartbreak before immigrating to the US, Annabelle had experiences that clearly related to her present behaviors and attitudes, so many years on.Pepper was, for me, the less intriguing or engaging of the two: abrasive, headstrong and more than a tad self-centered, she was difficult to empathize with and engendered little sympathy. Not quite detestable, but just filler for me, only relevant in the moments where she and Annabelle interacted or her character moved the story forward. Of course there is a mystery to solve, some drama to overcome and romance, some good some could have been left aside to concentrate on balancing the two stories.With some over used phrases, a bit more tell than show and some gaps in the choices made in pre-war Germany, all presented but few explained. For me, the story would have been richer for that information and perhaps a few fewer romantic themed moments, as many felt forced.  A story that is bordering on beach-side read, notable for the moments that sparkle, but not enough of those moments appear to truly rocket this read into a keeper shelf.I received an eBook copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"One of my favorite escape listens are the audio stories from Molly Harper, set in and around Half-Moon Hollow Kentucky.  The narration for these snarky, occasionally outrageous and always unique stories featuring a motley group of supernatural superfriends and the humans who love them are full of unexpected laughs, lots of heart, the occasional (or not so) misadventure and plenty of dysfunctional family dynamics to amuse everyone.In this story, we are treated to Andrea and her life, or her life that led up to her relationship with Dick Cheney. No, not that hunters beware Cheney, but the Civil-War era Cheney, now vampire, and his curiously malleable adherence to the law, attraction to cheesey t-shirts and unending charm.  Andrea is a new resident, taking up in Half-Moon Hollow as a surrogate, utilizing her connections with the council to earn a living after a rather tumultuous and short university experience that ended her family relationship as well.  Shes introduced to Jane early on, and this story brings us into the story after a death.I like Andrea, and Dick, despite his questionable morals, is truly a romantic and caring vampire: hoping to be able to protect (at surprising cost) those he cares for.  While Andrea is struggling with issues from a failed relationship and the struggles that she had to finally consider herself independent, shes finding that loneliness is a true burden, one not easily resolved. When a new client meeting goes horribly awry, it is when she sees the value and merit in knowing Dick, and having him consider her a friend, one that he could fall in love with.Full of the humor and often inappropriate utterances, clever references to other characters and the ability to revisit some of the more outrageous moments in the series through eyes that are slightly more removed from the middle of the action, this story is perfect to present Andreas history, and provide readers of the series some fun moments.

"The first Ive read from this author, I rather expected some drama, but OMG the drama! From characters that are working their own agendas to the often overstated independence and self-reliance, they had me thinking in many spots these are perfect examples of what not to be when you reach adulthood. And no, I dont say grow up since both Colt and Zanna were stalled in childhood and past issues, making them far more reactive than take charge.Character wise, there was a decided lack of depth of emotional veracity for both Colt and Zanna. The posturing from Colt often seemed more important to him than actually making a change: perfectly depicting deep insecurities, but he never really confronts those issues. Zanna had a bit more depth, although I would have preferred that she did more that was visible without being TOLD repeatedly that she was moving forward.Relationship wise, the story was a tale of hot, sexy moments that were ultimately flattened by the lack of honest connection between the characters. While dialogue flowed nicely, and interactions between Colt and Zanna, or Colt and his brothers was fast-paced and felt as if you could hear it, there was an emotional element missing.Now, part of the missing bits could be the need for some serious editing, while I realize this was an ARC and not in final sale mode, the story read far too roughly. Often I was correcting as I read, wondering why some issues were overplayed and others not explored to build tension from the characters, not from the multiple returns, repeats and reliving old issues. A story with promise could have shone with a more finished and polished ARC. As it stands, the story I read had promise but was let down by repeated grammatical errors, lack of character development and a reliance on outside influences to create drama and conflict that were already predominant in the characters, yet left untouched and unresolved.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"A debut offering from author Jessica Tom will have your mouth watering, even as you push on through the story.  Luscious food descriptions, tastes and textures are easy to envision as Tia regroups after not getting an internship, THE internship with a renowned food critic turned cookbook author.But, all is not lost as she is approached with an offer, the current star critic for the Times has lost his taste buds, and she enters into the food elite, undercover and in secret.  Shes unable to share this latest coup with anyone: not her roommates, her boyfriend or even her parents, even as the decisions shes made, and the secrecy she agreed to are taking a toll.Tias decisions arent always good ones, being so focused on one goal led her into trouble more than once, and it took some time for her to realize that her deal just may have been more than she bargained for. Truly, she is growing up, adjusting her life goals and finding herself, deciding what is important and necessary to her life throughout the story, and I can honestly say that her ability to recognize and adjust to make those changes showed her in a far more positive light.New York City becomes a character, as much as the food or the moments of romance for Tia are, wholly engaging, deliciously decadent and as filling as the most perfect chocolat chaud, youll be satisfied and sated, finding an appropriate ending that will have you surfing the web looking for new recipes to fit the inspired and imaginative pairings and tastes experienced in the book.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"The second book in Leighs Wicked Quills of London focuses on two secondary characters from Forever Your Earl, Cameron Chalton, Viscount Marwood and Maggie Delamere, a playwright and Eleanors best friend.  And these two were SO guarded and fearful, so jaded, that getting to know them and connect to them was supremely difficult.Cam has spent his entire life railing against convention: he has money and a title, and no interest in forgoing any pleasure available to him. His nights on the town have been increasingly frenetic and outrageous since Daniels involvement with Eleanor, highlighted with his frequent appearances in the Hawks Eye. What he is finding, however, is less patience and interest in the pursuits that intrigued him and those who participated. Hes bored, and searching for something to fill the holes in his life.Maggie Delamere is a playwright, wholly independent and driven, she is unfailingly determined to forge her own lifes path, alone. While she genuinely is happy for Eleanors marriage to Daniel, she firmly believes that aristos, on the whole, are untrustworthy, deceptive and a dead end for anyone not of their class. Shes parlayed this deep seated anger into an archetype character familiar in all of her works: evil, callous, snobbish and perfidious men, used to dismissing and using people for their own purposes.  Cams interest in her, and the lust he engenders are huge warnings to her, ones she runs from determined to ignore.Because both characters in this story are so very guarded, getting to know them takes a bit of time: they dont share easily with themselves or others. While it appeared, at first, that Cams interest was simply fueled by Maggies avoidance of him, he shares little pieces of his real admiration for her, and refuses to take no for an answer. While gifts and trinkets hold no interest for Maggie, he continues to find ways to show his esteem: his country house, his patronage of the theatre, his constant presence in the pit during rehearsals. Neither one sees that the attraction between them is more than simple lust: Maggie so consumed with the class differences and scandal, Cam so afraid that a marriage, a truly happy loving marriage like his parents, is unreachable. And how wrong they both are.A wonderful follow-up to Forever Your Earl, with two characters that really can be frustrating and bullheaded, giving readers a chance to truly understand their concerns and fears as the layers peel slowly away. Beautifully developed, these two blossom before our eyes: the relationship is a delicate dance moving forward and back, almost without warning. While neither character is easy to know, by the end of the book you understand them, their fears and see just how truly in need of love, they both are. A slower pacing allows each character time to share themselves, in as much as they understand their own motivations, and gives readers several moments of get it together already. Invested in a happy ending for these two, readers will find the hard-won battles over personal fears for both Cam and Maggie feel plausible and possible, and are all the more worthwhile in the winning.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"Oh what a fun series this is: time slips, bear shifters and the highlands  its hard not to find things to like.  In this story, Davis uses her humor and some rather unbelievable circumstances to throw our couple together, but as this is a shifter story, the suspension of disbelief works well, making this story carry the strongest feelings of fantasy.Roman (or Brother Bear) is a bit of a complex being: his bear side is a stress eater, rather child-like (think 2 year old in the MINE stage) and is truly the lighter half of Romans personality. As we have learned, the bear and human sides interact with one another, often these interactions are devilishly close to argument. Every time the bears voice is heard, there is an answering, and usually more adult, reaction from Roman, but both sides want Anise for their own.Anise is a French operative, she and Roman has met years ago in Paris, but now, she is running from danger and reprisal, and the last thing she needs or wants is an entanglement. Shes a bit of a hard nut to crack, and while her relationship with Roman does carry that insta-love burden, unlike earlier titles in this series, their relationship shows an attraction, if not always one that is felt to the core.Dialogue, both internal and external, brings a consistent sense of humor to the story, keeping the moments fresh and unique, even when stretching believability.  With moments to check back with couples from the earlier titles, and a cute short story bonus make up for the near total absence of Effie, always her meddling provides scenarios that move the story along, adding a sense of familiarity and family at the backbone of the series.  While not my favorite, this is still a wonderfully unique series and story, full of laughter and lightness, the perfect escape read.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"The first in a new highland romance historical series, The Wrong Bride is a wrong-place wrong-time situation gone horribly, or not so, awry.  Catriona (Riona) is visiting her paternal uncles home, staying in her cousins room. Her cousin, also Catriona, is sent off to the country by her father, in anticipation of some forceful means of collecting on a bridal contract. See, years ago, her uncle entered into a contract for his daughters hand in marriage to Hugh, the son of the McCallums, an abutting landowner. Now, as the time for the deal is coming Duff has arranged for his own daughters safety.  Rebuffed and angry, Hugh returns to capture his bride, taking Catriona from the room he knows is hers. Unfortunately, the girl in the chamber is not the promised one, and our story takes flight.Needing Hugh to understand and believe the truth, Riona is relentless in trying to get the bullheaded Hugh to listen to her: sure their names are the same, but she knows that the dowry he expects, so desperately needed for his ability to help the clan, wont come, and she wants little more than to return home. But, Hughs plans for the clan, and his determination to do right by them, combined with his protectiveness, and despite his inability to listen, show him in a new light: one that doesnt include crazed kidnapping highlander.With his realization of the truth however, a whole new set of questions are asked, and Hugh has decisions and doubts: will Riona, the one he has come to care for, take him, even if the contract was not for her. Well-developed characters who showed solid growth and growing connection, even as circumstances truly thrust the two together.  While the mystery of the wrong bride was instantly apparent to everyone BUT Hugh, the fun in this story is in his slow realization of the fact, and the authors choices for resolution.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"The first in a new military-themed romance brings us the story of Evelyn and Oliver, in a story that shows what you think you want isnt always what you need, or get.Evelyn is determined to have a relationship with a serious 9  5 man, one that isnt in the military, or a cop, or lawyer or or  or.  Shes the daughter of a General, and is determined that her life will be settled and diferent from everything she has known to this point.  Starting her own PR company, she is determined to make her first big event a success, not only to start her company out with a bang, but to prove to her father that she is on the right track.  The Alpha Dog Training Program event will be fabulous, even though she has to work with that clean-freak MP who sets her nerves alight.Oliver is an MP stationed on the base, reporting to Evelyns father, the General. After a good Samaritan act gone horribly wrong, he is relieved of duty, but assigned to work with Evelyn to make the event a success.  Oliver is a bit of a clean-freak, he likes things the way he wants them, and hes never met a more bossy, opinionated woman in his life. And hes met many.  Worse still, shes one of the sexiest women hes met in a long time, and she is completely hands off.The thing is, everything about Oliver ticks each box in Evelyns chequelist, but the fact hes in the military makes him not worthy of her consideration. Mostly.""There are no details to tell. I don't even know if I like him, it's more that I just-""""Want to strip him naked and eat chocolate off his abs?"" Megan offered.Eve thought about that, grinning. ""His butt too. He's got a great butt.""So we have the polar opposites and clashes, plenty of heat and a slowly developing understanding between the two as they realize that they can work together productively, and actually enjoy their time together.  And perhaps that spark, that flame is signifying more.These two are real and complete in this story: Evelyn is a bit of a loose cannon with her spark for life, her inability to take things slow and her lack of housekeeping skills, or the desire to change that. Olivers family and his own relationship with them is wonderful, his rather naughty sofa-snacking dog and his good-natured protectiveness for all he meets are obvious and apparent throughout.  Neatly adding in family, friends and animals to build the world around these two provides wonderful insight into the characters, and everyone feels so very real and plausible, you want to have them as friends and neighbors. Surprisingly, for a novella-length story, it never feels rushed or forced, this is simply a story that flows well to an inevitable happy ending full of heart, a touch of heat and plenty of moments to laugh.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"The second title Ive read by this author, Virtuous Scoundrel is a tale of a rake in reformation and the woman (and others) who provide distractions from his stated goal.  Part love story with the occasional slapstick moments thrown in, the premise is solidly presented and there are some moments and characters that shine.After a few years away from England, Sebastians return is heralded by false paternity claims, danger of a duel, and several rumors more on the lines of hell never change.  But, hes truly wishing to make a difference, and to find the woman hes always loved, his late Uncles wife, Katherine.Katherine has not had a great track record with men, and feels that her chances at love are limited.  She does care for Sebastian, but prefers to believe the rumors and history rather than listen to Sebastians own story. Two loves, torn asunder by miscommunication, assumptions and pure circumstance.And circumstance continues to get in the way with the determined squire looking to make a match with his daughter, dognappers, blackmail and a French toff. One or two of these distractions would have been more than enough. Romp truly isnt the word, and like the first book, I found the humor and hijinks trying after repeated instances. At some point, the characters own voices and emotions need to play for the story to work. And while the characters were decently built, too often the humor took place of actual interaction and emotion, and left me wanting.I received a copy of the title from The Jeep Diva for purpose of honest review.

"Reunited adversaries combine to volcanic effect in this story. Penelope (PIA) and Brock were at one anothers throats years ago.  Now with both older and more set in their ways, the stakes are higher and these two must overcome their animosity to work toward a solution.Fast paced with outlines of history that play into the current situation, the characters relationship develops adequately for a novella-length story, and while their interactions feel appropriate to their backstory, their connection felt tenuous at best. Greater exploration into their own feelings would have helped, but restrictions for word count because of the length is understandable.World building was wonderful, and intrigue and political maneuvering was well thought out and brought the tension and action in a plausible way.  Think operetta with drama and villains, a touch of guilt and some serious chemistry and that is what emerges. I would have liked the background and information in a longer form, allowing their relationship to feel more connected beyond the physical, but even without it, the steamy moments worked as well.I received an eBook copy of the title from the author for purpose of honest review for The Jeep Diva.

"Told from Jeremys point of view, the story brings us two broken people, working to find their own new normal.  Jeremy has just moved on after a divorce, now free to think of more, hes too emotionally worn down to think of a relationship, and his kids are angry at his coming out.. And, fortunately for him, the breakdown of his clients relationship with her girlfriend reinforces his no relationship clause when he starts to soften.Jeremys client Anna wants her relationship with Leigh to work, and they have made an appointment for counseling.  Imagine Jeremys surprise when he meets Scott, the counselor, and the chemistry is electric. With his own set of tragedies behind him, Scott isnt looking for Mr. Right, but isnt averse to Mr. Right Now, and Jeremy just may be wearing that t-shirt.Witt builds these two characters with solid stories, and gives life to Jeremys voice as it illustrates the emotional moments in the story. While Scott and Jeremy have a connection that will shatter their no relationship resolve, there are secondary plots that play on readers emotions and help to fill out the world.  With Anna and Leigh at a tipping point as their relationship crumbles, Jeremy and Scott tentatively walking toward their own solidly defined relationship and the overtures that Jeremy makes toward his children, looking to repair that rift, the story is full of relationships in every stage of the process.

"Dahlia is a train wreck, albeit the train with the cow-catcher snugged on with duct tape, a few cracks in the windscreen and a curious mix of shiny and scrap-heaped cars following the engine. But there is joy to be found in the repeated mishaps, and a level of admiration for the heroine, Dahlia, and her willingness to turn the next corner even as all her experience says things will not go well.A story full of nerdy RPG references, the unemployed and without prospects Dahlia is hired to find a stolen in-game item, which quickly morphs into a real-world murder mystery, where the victim is felled by the same item that Dahlia has been hired to find.  More on the lines of a loosely plotted I Love Lucy Episode, the story never truly grabs onto any sense that this is more than a fantasy, I kept expecting this story to be a Dali-esque dream retelling, with perhaps Spielberg and Heinlein providing some of the elements.While I do realize this was an ARC copy, the story was rough in construct: grammatical errors that should have been cleared before review copies were completed did make this read difficult. And there was a curious lack of development in Dahlia, her repeated fallback position was a cutesy comment or yet another outrageous plan destined to go awry: at some point I wanted her to LEARN something, but I will admit that the situations and extrications did have me laughing out loud. Often.As a first peek into a new title, this was a solid effort  I hope that editing will tighten up the character weaknesses and fix the grammar, letting this story show the unique and quirky plot as just that, and not one that is consciously (and occasionally painfully) attempting to be funny and quirky.

"The third installment in the series brings us two characters that first meet outside the Bent Zealots Chapel.  One is coming to join in after leaving the Bare Bones club in his rearview, the other is arriving for babysitting after an early release from a bid for Bank Robbery offers him a new opportunity. My favorite, so far, for the honest struggles of the characters that set up their own growth and development.Harte has always believed that Leo was his father, and now that many of the members hed known since childhood were under investigation as Leo was working to save his own skin, hes needing a change of scenery. Not to mention that hes discovering his own sexuality, and in the Bare Bones, as it has developed, being gay just isnt cool.Bond is Turks biological brother, even as they were separated after their parents were killed by a drunk driver.  We know that Turks life with the Illuminatis wasnt great, but Bonds life was full of fighting, foster homes and rejection: all the while he believed his brother got a Leave it to Beaver existence.  Fresh out of prison and with a chip on his shoulder the size of a potato field (with tractors), Bond is expecting to roll into the Bent Zealots clubhouse and take over  brother or no brother.Wolfe has taken two very disparate characters here and given them both time to grow and develop. Bond starts out completely terrified, always on the offensive, expecting people will see inside his head and realize hes worthless. Oh  and we wont even mention his extreme (can anyone say he doth protest too much) homophobia.  Imagine his surprise when he sees that the Zealots are predominantly gay, and have already given him two steps up the ladder, to prospect.  On the other hand, Harte is a known entity to the club, and while not settled in his identification of a gay man (hes still working on his genre) hes at least honest with himself and others, and eager to see what will come.  Hes the eager puppy in this book  honest, loving, kind-hearted and adorable, even when hes wrong.While the opportunity to take a small side-mission in retaliation for a horrific attack on Ormond appears, the whole gang of outsiders, with mindful tech geek Twinkletoes as watcher, set off on a mission that could bring the full force of retaliation down on the club.  Add in the two teenaged Navajo boys rescued from near slavery in the last book, and a new member of the shatter crew in the two-spirited Fredericka and the story is full of moments that shine.What emerges is a story that, above all, celebrates self-acceptance and awareness, showing the power of friendship and love in making things better than they were. Foul language, often rough and raw emotions and plenty of balance checks to be sure no-one is believing the less than truthful utterances, these characters are real, honest and completely lovable. Eventually.Humor adds to the story, with some appropros yet wholly original pithy moments.Youre gayer than a treeful of monkeys on nitrous oxide  and as confused as a chameleon in a bag of Skittles  that lighten the mood and keep me intrigued for the next in the series.I received an eBook copy of the title from the author for purpose of honest review.

"Evies mother has recently died, and her only relative, her Uncle Scott, has gained custody. Completely overwhelmed and not sure she can handle yet another change, Evie is not thrilled with the decision.  Its bad enough to lose your Mum, but all her friends, her life, everything she knows is in Dublin, and Scott, although willing, is unfamiliar. Scotts amiability and true understanding for Evie are highlighted when he gets her to do a trial run, and if, after the summer she hates New York, she can come back to Dublin to stay with her Godmother.Off to the Upper West side, Evie and Scott start to feel their way along in this new relationship. Theres just one problem, Scotts girlfriend Leela, who isnt thrilled with the interloper that will challenge her demands on the limited time that the busy veterinarian has free.  When you add in Evies grief, Scotts struggle to keep her engaged and involved, and not ignore his relationship while managing a practice, there are plenty of engaging elements to keep the story moving forward.On the whole, I found Evie engaging and solidly voiced, while she worked through her grief she did find many intriguing and new things, and animals galore  from exotic (Iguanas and snapping turtles) to ordinary dogs and cats.  Well developed, you can see the city through Evies fresh eyes, and understand her needing to keep busy as she deals with her grief.  Adults are also more than just window dressing, her relationship with Scott and the conflicts with Leela feel honest and are well-spaced: not too much acting out or angst.  The showdown at the end, combined with Evies own guilt over some situations with Scott bring her to the cliffhangerwill she stay in New York, or return to Dublin.Wonderfully paced, easy to read, and quite appropriate for 10 year olds and up, this story delicately balances the concept of grief and loss with the ordinary exuberance of a curious 12 year old in the midst of changes, and is a wonderfully clever read.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"I was intrigued by the premise, and interested in seeing where two strong-minded characters could go.  The combination of authors to pen this story promised an intriguing read, and something that just takes a rather mundane set of tropes and makes it work with a unique twist.I like my heroes to have some depth: tattooed and sexist, with a vocabulary limited to profanity doesnt lend to the depth I wanted. Yeah  bad boys can be hot, but puddles are boring after youve spent the energy finding all the reflections.  Hendrix had far more to overcome for me to believe or be intrigued in him than he presented at first, and even further on in the story, I didnt necessarily buy into his character.Matching out this bad boy with a character who comes with her own issues, Olivia is in need of some serious grow up time. Shes a bit of a pushover, with a determination to stand on her own, even if that is unrealistic in the extreme. See, Olivia, to me, was a follower  needing someone to tell her what her next move should be, how to fully grasp onto female empowerment (hint  its not a random sexual encounter in a closet with a nameless man) and how to listen to her own inner voices.These two damaged people are meant to come together, against all odds, and find solace, companionship and love in one another. Never have I felt the you complete me line was more relevant here, as both characters, to me, were half-formed, using clichs and atmospheric posturing and language to build a person, and one that wasnt that intriguing.  Dropping the F bomb, clueless sexual encounters, misogynistic speech and a history of childhood abuse that is really never dealt with beyond sharing stories just doesnt build a foundation for me, leaving me unconnected and uncaring about the characters, bored by the feelings of forced connection and emotion, and uncomfortable with the sex as it never felt more connected than the first random encounter.  Id be interested in seeing the authors work independent of this collaboration to see if their styles and ideas bear fruit more tasty in solo work.I received an eArc copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"I've not tried a commercially available dry shampoo, so this was an opportunity. Normally I wash my hair every other day, As I keep it up, it tends not to get too dirty or oily.  But, there are days (and times- especially living in the high humidity/heat areas) that a 'freshen"" would be nice without gong through the trouble of washing.A two pack - one to 'clean' and one to shine - this product was easy to use and would be perfect for those who do a 'mid-day' workout and return to the office, not wanting their hair to look like it's been through a workout, or not having the time to rewash/style.Simply shake the can well - spray about 6 - 8"" from your hair - work from mid-shaft to end  - then work the shampoo through with your fingers.  then brush it out - there is a slight 'white' tinge with the shampoo, but your hair will feel and smell fresher. Then - you can use conditioner - Shake well - and spray mid-shaft on hair from about 6- 8 "" away  - Use this sparingly - a quick once over with the spray then working through with brush. comb or fingers will leave a nice light fresh scent (it's not obtrusive) and give a bit of shine.Just beware - these are aerosol and flammable - so best to use away from open flame or small enclosed spaces.The results freshen and last to give an 'extra day"" between shampoos - or a quick refresh.

"Arriving in an easy-to open/store container, this masque is white in color, fairly thick in consistency (think hair gel thickness) with a pleasant and not overwhelming odor.My hair is long (past my waist) and very fine, and I am not someone who uses a dryer / curling iron / mousse or gel. Mostly, my hair air dries, and stays 'up' in braid or bun.  While not suffering from a great deal of split / broken ends, I do have a huge tangle issue - usually I use a silicon-based shine/detangler to comb/brush through after shampooing.I had no need for any additional detanglers / conditioners, and my hair was super slick / soft and shiny. Following the directions of 3 minutes in - I used about a Tbsp of conditioner, worked it through my hair, waited and rinsed.  If it were summer and I was swimming more in chlorinated pools, this would be something I'd use weekly.  I'd also like to give it a try as a heat-activated (leave on - use a dryer or plastic cap and towel and let set for 30 minutes or so) if I had the desire / need for more penetration.I think this is best for hair that is curly or coarser in texture than mine, although I will undoubtedly use this every other week or so just to keep my ends in top notch shape.I was provided a sample of the product from the manufacturer for purpose of honest review.

"I enjoy the damsel in distress trope on occasion, especially if the characters come to grow and let go of some of their past issues as they work toward a new normal. And I had high hopes for Karlie, in seeing that her childhood in foster care left her feeling less than lovable, which led to a longer than is logical relationship with a man who used her low self-esteem to further bully her into staying.  Getting up the courage to move on, especially when every fibre of your being is second-guessing your worth is a monumental task, and that alone is admirable.Lucas is a police officer, not content with upholding the law, hes also got a serious case of protect and rescue when it comes to the obviously distressed, and Karlie ticks off every box. I liked Lucas, even as he occasionally felt overbearing and overly interested in fixing Karlies life, as his own wasnt smooth, as he was in the midst of a custody battle.Exes galore kicking up a fuss, and some serious danger (not just distraction) from Karlies ex throws the two together. Sparks fly. Did I think that they were meant to be, Im not entirely sure. There was chemistry, but from Karlies POV I thought her emotions were more tied to his being nice and honest with her. For Lucas, the appearance of his exs photo, and the fact that it wasnt put away / thrown out (even with the child in the mix) kept me thinking (and occasionally humming) it was a Love the One Youre With moment.  Their interactions felt real, the steam was there, I just didnt find all the heart that was spoken of reaching out and grabbing me.Overall, with a twist at the end that was completely unexpected, the story was light and easy, lower in angst than many.

"Amber is almost twelve, and about to leave her primary school to begin at middle school. Of course, thats not her only worry, because at 11 going on 12 and into a new school with scary looking bigger kids is daunting.See, Amber and her sister Bella are different: half-Japanese, half Italian, their mother is a bit of an eclectic soul and their father, well, Amber doesnt quite know where he is, having left when she was 6 and Bella was just one.Ambers voice is solid and quite appropriate for her age. Shes got questions about her father and misses the idea of a father near constantly, but the wound is reopened when she and Bella, returning home, see a father and daughter playing in the park sandbox.  Now Amber has no desire to draw (her favorite pastime) and doesnt feel that she can tell her mother just why Bella is so sad.Clever, funny and occasionally clichd, the story rings true and honest because life is all of those things, including a bit dark, worry filled and self-centered.  Because Amber is all of those things, but her perspective isnt wearing despite the often negative focus. She does move on and forward, continuing to do what she loves (art) while still wondering if a new phone, different clothes, being more like everyone else will make things different and better. Weve all done that  chased an idea or thing to fit in, and Amber is no different.  And, she is desperately missing the feedback and guidance from her father, so much so that she creates a Dream Father to answer her questions, provide guidance and comfort.  What Amber never quite realizes consciously is that she is spending more effort providing solutions for herself in her dream fathers perspective: those answers are there all along.A book that is fun to read, with insets where Amber uses and explains British-isms, humor and situations familiar to most middle schoolers to move the story forward and present her life. While the mystery of her fathers disappearance is never explained, the emotions ring true for the situation, and the voice is wholly 12, full of important and not so worries and daily emotional roller coaster rides.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"Starting with a very dark and sad tone, the story revolves around sisters Hallie and Marthe, and their struggles to maintain the family lands and farm.  A war has raged on for years, and 16 year old Hallie is responsible for near everything, her sister is pregnant and her husband Thom is still away fighting. The war is a layered one: humans, the Twisted Things and the Wicked God are all struggling for supremacy, and it seems as if their farm is the central location for the battle.Most certainly different from anything I have read, Bobet shows imagination in the development of unusual characters and backstory to the war. Unfortunately there were so many elements that I was expected to accept with broad brushstroke explanations rather than more detail giving context and adding richness.  I want to have the history that puts events in context, and there were moments where I wished for more.Hallie was a strong character, and wholly sixteen in her moments of self-pity. While those moments played into her doubts, she is far stronger than she realizes, and every ounce of that strength will be needed for what comes next.  Most of her time between working the farm or joining with her friends to defeat the Twisted Things is spent keeping Marthe in the dark about just how dire the situation is. While I wish that she was more open with Marthe and would rely on their bond, the disconnect between the two didnt always work for me.A budding romance that didnt delve into a love triangle, thankfully, worked nicely to soften Hallie and give us reason to hope for more in the future for them.  Not great, but certainly solid, the read kept me interested even as a hoped for a bit more. But, readers who are of the age to connect better to Hallie, or those who prefer a dark and gloomy read will find this a good fit for their shelves.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"Ive been craving some easy low angst contemporary romance of late, and Samantha Chase delivers both in these novella length stories.  The Callahan family cottage in Asheville has been a magical place, and is the setting for both of the stories.  What better way to regroup and reconnect than a favored place, cozy and warm?In The Christmas Cottage, we are treated to Lacy and Eans story, although we do have secondary characters that play important roles. Ean believed that his family cottage had been burgled, and has arrived to sort things out. Imagine his surprise coming face to face with Lacey, who has held a torch for him for years.  This story uses the see the kid in a whole new light to perfection, the two are adorable together and their rush to marriage really didnt feel too presumptuous considering the length of the book and their long acquaintance.In Ever After, Ava is regrouping after a failed engagement, but shes not all that broken up if truth be told.  A bit of a control freak with a heavy dose of OCD and an obsession with the perfect setting, outcome, moment, Ava needs some maturation.  Brian is the best friend of Avas ex Mason, but hes always had a thing for her. But, being an honorable guy, he never made a move.  Heavily populated with moments from Ean and Lacey, poor Brian is the picture in the clich book for you cant help who you love.  A very down to earth guy, the high maintenance treadmill that Ava is on needs to stop, and slowly but surely she starts to show glimpses of understanding that.  With the award for most patient hero ever being awarded to Brian, the story does wrap nicely, and while the changes in Ava were microscopic, he is a good counterpoint for her.A light and fun set of stories, although I did enjoy the first more than the last. There is room to expand on both of these couples stories, whether they pop in and visit or are given time to explore their relationships in full length form.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"The first I have read by this author, I happen to enjoy a solidly honest MC romance: if the characters manage to make me believe in them, and want to know more.  And in this first loves reunite story, Zane carried that off nicely.  Friends and in love since childhood, Zane and Evie were one anothers first love, and their one night of passion was the last one in many years.Evie promised to wait, and shortly moved on, leaving Zane struggling and wondering just what happened. Believing her faithless and feckless, hes moved up the ranks to VP of the club, when she walks back into his life.Zane was attractive and believable, he has reasons for his behaviors, and while I never actually felt as if he wanted Evie for herself (more later) she was more of a challenge and his memories of who she is seemed to be halted in childhood. Because she  is far less compelling.Evie is, in a nutshell, TSTL (too stupid to live), let alone draw huge amounts of loyalty and regard. There was little in her choices, past or present, that showed any capability of thought beyond her own needs of the moment, and a particular exchange where she wished to use Zane to punish her for the death of another was disgusting, I wanted to punish her for sure, but not in the way she thought, almost putting the book in the DNF pile.  If it werent for some solid writing, secondary characters with heart and depth, and the ever-present question as I wondered if Zane would smarten up and walk away from this woman who is selfishly struggling only to have all of her own needs met, I would have.I didnt necessarily believe their relationship as a mature and present thing, it was more stuck in the loyalties to the bonds from the past, and if Evie had, for one moment, shown an iota of growth or selflessness, it would have helped me tremendously.  If you are a fan of the series, this is most probably a good fit. As an introduction to this authors writing it was a solid example, showing much promise and I am intrigued enough to read the earlier titles in the series, hoping that the female characters wont be so flat and unlikable.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGaley for purpose of honest review.

"Im obsessed currently with highlander stories: how can you miss as a lover of historic romance? And when you bring in characters like Serafina and Gerard, and a whole host of secondary characters that aid or thwart the path to love.Engaged to a rather despicable man, who then left her and stole a valuable shipment, Serafina is penniless, friendless and angry. She cant believe that she fell so completely for Edward, and lost everything in the process.  Together with her new friends Abby and Undine, and Abbys new love Duncan, she is determined to use any means to regain the cargo and reclaim her future.In this story, it is Gerard who is transported back, and his consternation, reluctance to participate in Serafinas plan and his attitude and approach are well-suited to Serafinas often stubborn and outspoken approach.  There is endless bickering, these two are very similar in personality and that makes for great fire, and neither is particularly interested in a relationship per se, so it works to fuel the moments as the story progresses.  A far deeper and more complex set of circumstances than we initially understand is behind the cargo, and as our couple, aided with the help of several friends, uncover the mystery the story moves forward nicely.Cready has built this world and the plot with care, what starts as a wild goose chase soon firms up and solidifies into a wonderful tale that feels both of the moment and in the past. Theres a particular modernity that having a time-traveling character adds to a plot, and this story manages to mix the two outlooks and approaches nicely.

"The first I have read by this author, the story takes a slower pace, and builds characters carefully. They truly are the driving forces behind the story, and the twists with a touch of murderous intent and danger work to build the tension through to the conclusion.  A simple driving club the Lords of Anarchy are titled men who enjoy a bit of carriage racing, and other manly pursuits. Until Hermione Upperton is admitted into their ranks.  A bold and fearless horsewoman of her own right, her vaunted pair is the perfect competition for the men. Until she loses her own property to pay off her rather feckless fathers gambling debt.  But, as she is determined to get her own property back, her father goes one step further, and wagers her hand in marriage! Now, understandably women had few rights, but this was over the top. Great premise though.And then, the man who won Hermiones horses turns up murdered, and she is the primary suspect.  Fortunately, her hand was won by Jasper, and while an inveterate gambler, he does have some sense of morality, and he knows that Hermione is better off away from her father, and with someone who can protect her from the dangers, and the charge of murder.Hermione was a wonderful character: not too over the top in terms of her determination to win womans rights, although she did rail at the unfairness of the situation, and shes not particularly thrilled with Jasper as a prospective husband. But, personas are often based in gossip and fueled by deliberate actions to cause more gossip and allow freedom of choice, and Jasper has used those tactics to great advantage personally, even as his reputation among the ton is dubious. Hes got a strong sense of loyalty, protectiveness and hes actually rather intrigued by her.  Like many of the forced proximity trope stories, these two do not have an instant bond, but the ulterior motives are not stopgaps to a true friendship, which soon deepens into honest regard, and then the attractions come to the forefront.With several twists and turns, a clever series of events lead them through the miasma of murder, villains, suspects and foes hidden and overt, and keeps readers following along. While not a race to the finish sort of story, the characters and events grow on you and become richer in each page.

"One of the most difficult reviews to write is one for a book that you loved, that moved you to tears (forget tears  full on sobs with hyperventilation and flails) for emotions stay hot, and it is hard to step back and be objective and informative without spoilers.  The combination of action, emotional climax points, heartbreaking decisions and some hard won redemption for a character many thought lost just culminated in a 3 am crying jag of epic proportions.  Im still recovering as I struggle to form coherent sentences.The premise in this story is the extraction of 6 hostages from an attack on a convoy leaving the embassy compound in Israel.  Nathan, a former colleague of Cassies and huge thorn in the paw of Trevor, is tasked to lead the teams with help from some deep undercover, super-charged military operatives. These guys make SEALs and Rangers look like kids playing at cowboys and Indians.  Even worse, theres a traitor on the American side, and only one of the hostages has an idea that the kidnapping was staged.  And, add insult to Nathans injured feelings  Trevor and his fellow geeky bloodhound George, have the ability to put eyes on the compound, trace digital imprints and hopefully find the mastermind before it is too late.We have the tension and action from the search and chase, the conflict between Trevor and Nathan, the guilt at Trevors leaving Cassie behind in Dublin, Nathans stubborn habit of refusing to think outside the box if it conflicts with policy and procedure, a Hawaiian-shirt wearing, tattooed smart aleck in Hanson, team leader of the military guys, Jessica about to pop with her and Stephens first child and guilt.  OMG the guilt.  Everyone is guilty about something here  all emotional, all based in their feelings of failure and letting someone down.  The only one NOT guilty is George, back in the States working away at the NSA, and tossing nuggets of information at Trevor, managing satellite tracking while fending off teasing and pushes from Cassie, who consistently re-nicknames him (G-String being my personal favorite).Most telling in this story is Nathan. Ive maintained that he needed a hug  or several  to make up for some horrible events in his past. Until this story, he had buried those issues, although he was acting out in often uncontrolled ways. Full of regret, guilt and what-ifs, Nathans opportunity for redemption is right at his fingertips, if he is ready to grab an opportunity at honesty and learn to forgive himself.  For the first time we get to see what makes him tick, and I wanted to cry for him and all he had lost.  But Almeida and Aubrey dont take without giving, and he was given opportunities and a future with the one he always wanted. And a chance for a real friendship with Trevor, unlike the adversarial relationship that had alternated between repelling and drawing the two together.But its not all about Nathan:  Stephan is about to have his carefully orchestrated world turned on end, yet again, by the arrival of his and Jessicas first child.  These two are adorable together, his own worries about their age difference is wiped out with Jessicas every utterance and adoration.  Shes no doormat, she challenges his moments of moodiness and withdrawal from her with her own unique approach, and these two are magically delicious.  Circling back to George, this guy needs a relationship and a woman, and perhaps there is something in the works on the swipe left tip, whether or not he knows it yet.  George is the worrywart of the bunch, able to break complex issues into their myriad parts with the speed of a multi-gig processor, his ability to speak reason to Trevor when his more adventurous and risk-taking side take precedence, hes a great friend and work partner for Trevor.Lastly we dive into Cassie and Trevor. These two are magical together: not only is there a palpable electric attraction between them, but their friendship has grown and developed into a character that grows and breathes.  You want to know these two, so solidly developed and presented that they fairly leap off the pages and sit at your desk, pushing you to read more, faster, again.  The central characters that are the touchstone in each title, their relationship, while not perfect, epitomizes the support, respect and enjoyment that every couple should strive for.Alternate Connection is more than just a suspense story, or a steamy romance, or even an action-packed ride worthy of a top ten list.  Characters arrive as complete people, functioning to the best of their ability on their own, with issues both hidden and more obvious. While it does carry threads from earlier titles forward, like all good series reads, the release of a new installment will fuel your desire to re-read the earlier titles.  Fortunately with the full length titles (now 3) and multiple smaller bits and bytes that focus on one couple or person for a short moment in time, there are hours of reading to escape with.I received an eArc copy from the publisher via Substance B for purpose of honest review.

"Nine times out of ten, an author can grab me with a synopsis that brings to mind earlier favorite reads, and I do tend to zone out after that, missing other bits of information. That certainly happened when I grabbed Chivalrous for review, the character of Gwendolyn instantly reminded me of an earlier favorite (Alanna from Tamora Pierce) and I wanted to see the evolution of a strong medieval era female character could be in the hands of a different author.  While I normally am not seeking out Christian titles, I also am familiar with the evolution of religion and personal devotion in daily life, and while there is significant page time focused on devotions, prayer and personal relationships with God, the moments did fit and flow nicely, and added to the relationship and story trajectory.Gwendolyn wants only to be a knight, but like all females of a certain class, she is expected to be little more than an advantageous offering in the game of wealth and alliances that were very common in medieval times. Completely disheartened by the prospects she sees before her, she makes a plan to have one moment of glory before a lifetime of perceived duty and drudgery.Allen has left what he knows, in search of more: better leadership, a closer relationship to what is right in this world, and perhaps love.  Arriving at the tournament, he comes face to face with what could be, if only he and Gwyn can find a way.Plenty of twists and action keep the plot moving forward, with a touch of magic and sorcery that is, as one would expect, treated as strange and wrong in terms of the characters beliefs.  Still, the disregard for the magic, while carrying a solid negative tone, was well-presented and gives readers another perspective on magic, a learning experience buried within the story.  Engaging and intriguing, with only a few backroad diversions into faith, the story moved smoothly and presented some truly good-hearted and honorable characters.

"Such a fun premise, a love potion gone horribly wrong sets the search for the cure, and our story is off and running.  We meet Samantha, descended from a line of alchemists whove had a string of bad luck thats not done wonders for their reputation.  Shes competent, intelligent and above all, she wants to make a difference.  But the traditionally crafted potions that her family is known for have fallen out of favor: cheaper, mass-produced synthetic concoctions are all the rage, and this sets up a confrontation between waiting for tried and true, or the quick satisfaction of the now.Samantha, despite all of her knowledge is still just a teen: she gets into scrapes and makes some decisions that arent always the best, but she is able to brush off, learn from it, and move on. And the variety of options available are wonderful: from familiar like planes and cars to teleporting through mirrors, the inclusions of familiar and mixing with the inventive creations are wonderful.And Samantha does not exist in a void: secondary characters bring interest and depth to the story, from best friends and family who both believe and support her quest to find the cure, to her relationship with her Grandfather: a man with many secrets but never failing to help her where he could.  Then there is Zane  there is an attraction there, but as he is working with a competitor, his flirtations are slightly suspect, even as there is something in their relationship that rings true.Plenty of action, some danger and the omnipresent status updates on social media bring the fantastical into a familiar light, and keep the story moving forward. Alward carefully built this world with familiar and not so familiar elements.  Gradually pieces and elements are presented in context, and these surprising inclusions leave the reader with clear visual imagery, picturing each element. With a gradual romance in tentative stages and characters that are intriguing and fun to know, this is a great start to a new series.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"Debut author Laurel Gale didnt miss a trick with this middle-school read.  Crow is undead  not quite zombie, but truly dead, just still animated.  Life is just weird for the poor little guy: his parents have split up, hes sure it is his fault, he cant go to school like other kids, his mother occasionally has to darn up a new hole or stitch a body part back on, and did we mention the smell? Thats not pleasant either, nor are the maggots that creep out of his nose like unmanageable bogies.  But Crow is thoughtful and considered, and he really just wants a friend.Then, Melody moves in next door.  Not allowed to go out during the heat of the day because that will speed up his physical demise, hes taken to sneaking out at night to meet this new girl who believes in aliens and Area 51, loves a good mystery and has few if any illusions about the facades that people present. She sees Crow as kind and generous, thoughtful and above all, great friend material.Gale has created a wonderful set of characters in this: Crow who is just adorable and Melody who wants to know just HOW he died, and his mother who  is more than a bit obsessed with keeping her child alive and safe. While Melody is most interested in sorting out the mystery around Crows death, the solidity of their friendship and the beauty in selfless behaviors.  While middle graders will find it easy to understand and relate to both Crow and Melody, adults who venture into this title will appreciate the nuance and fearless tackling of issues surrounding his parents, their divorce and Crows mother and her obsessions to the detriment of a life outside the home.  Full of magic, fun and imagery, this story is a winner for middle graders and the parents who love them.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"Make no mistake about it, this is Annes Story: her trials with being the rebellious outsider, spurned and scorned by many who are uncomfortable with her clear thinking, devil-may-care approach to boys, life and her own single-minded determination.  Shes bold, brassy, motorcycle riding, sharp tongued and intelligent.  With one HUGE flaw.  She is intrigued by Henry.Henry is exactly what one would expect from the golden boy  raised without consequence, every whim granted on a silver platter, no true ramifications for anything and the attention span of a gnat.  Completely unlikable, utterly without redeeming features, the lauded charms of the original Henry (he was purported to be funny, charming, athletic, and intelligent) missing, he was the character you had to dislike.  Especially as he discards the new and shiny in favor of something different, simply because he never had to work to get anything.Ius has a wonderful writing style, she keeps readers engaged even with the horrible hero, because you need to know what is next. If I had one complaint, the accuracy with which she correlates the real couple to this fictional one forced some moments that would have been better felt and integrated had they come to the couple naturally.  Using source material as inspiration is a wonderful tool, and Ius did that well, with only a few hiccups.

"William is a first-hand witness to the murder of his brother by British soldiers.  The War of Independence is heating up, and William, in tandem with Rebecca, a daughter of an imprisoned spy, undertake a mission to deliver a message as they pose as ordinary, if young, colonials.Familiar and lesser known moments and scenes from history are chronicled: the HMS Jersey, Yorktown, even the soldier Peter Francisco all add depth and intrigue to the rather dry accounts of textbooks, and encourage you to read on. William and Rebecca are wonderful young protagonists, at 12 and 16 respectively, their determination and cleverness maneuvering through the pitfalls of war, double agents, danger and primitive living conditions intrigue and engage imagination.No battle for hearts or minds is ever truly won on the field: belief and support from all levels of society need be involved and heard. While we rarely hear of the many unknown who supported the fight for independence, Pierpoint brings two young voices into the game, with motivations both possible and plausible, and show that historical fiction can be fun and educational.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"3.5 stars  roundedIve not been a huge reader of sport romance, but this one looked as if it would hit all the marks for me.  This is a story meant ONLY for readers who want to bask in steam, a sauna has nothing on this read!Bean and Cass are football players: boyz to the end and just a little scandalous. A night of passion was videotaped and released to the press: the threesome was memorable for all involved.  Marian is a new coach for the Rebels, and her night with Bean and Cass making tabloid fuel and fodder is a bit of a difficult situation.  But its not the embarrassing private moment made public, it is those niggling desires for both the men, and the decisions about what to do.It was easy to understand the confusion and conflicts that each character had in this situation: the attraction was still strong, and everyone seems to have caught feelings. But there was a touch of depth and exploration of those emotions missing for me.  While their interactions were wonderful, and felt plausible, I needed more: more feeling on the page that wasnt integrally tied to the very explicit, very steamy and evocative scenes.With some wonderful integration of secondary characters, interest on and off the field for this story was slowly building around the moments between Cass, Marian and Bean.  There is potential here for some terrific growth and exploring the complexities of a non-traditional relationship, but it didnt go far enough to satisfy on every level.  Im hoping for more depth and exploration as the series continues: Kane can certainly bring her characters in and give them voices and presence that intrigues, now I want them to grow.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"My first choice for a read is not often romantic suspense, but when I am pulled into the story and cant put it down, I start to question that decision.  Dixie Lee Browns Rescued by the Ranger danced into the room with an adorable alpha male, a furry sidekick and a huge helping of action.Garret was wounded in Iraq, and has returned to the states, only to discover that his estranged mother had died.  He ventures to his mothers ranch, hoping to discover the answers as to why he and his brother were abandoned.  At the Cougar Ridge Ranch, Rachel has been quietly working and isnt at all interested in making nice with Amandas sons.  Of course, there are two sides to the story, and both Garret and Rachel have some seriously tangled situations in their family history.From beginning to end, Brown develops the characters with care: releasing bits of information and displaying their own personal integrity as they come to know one another and find some common issues. When Rachel is threatened, the simple fact that Garret exists makes her feel more secure, and his willingness to put aside any of his own questions to help her resolve her past and learn to live safely in the now, you just cant help but find him a near perfect man. Detailed, emotional and so perfectly plotted that every element falls in to the right place in exactly the right time, with insets from Cowboy and his fierce protective and loyal nature adds the perfect humanizing touch with a cold nose always in the midst of things.A wonderfully fun read that brings chemistry, emotion and action into a hard to put down story!I received an ARC copy of the title from the publisher via the Avon Addicts program.

"Newly released in paper, The Courtship and The Duke and His Duchess are wonderfully fun prequel stories that detail the relationship between the Duke and Duchess of Windham, before they became the managing partners of their grown children and their relationships.While The Duke and His Duchess is technically the second novella, I read these in order as presented, and this is a wonderful introduction to Percy and the young Esther, a thoroughly impertinent woman, and he cant resist the challenge.  Clever, determined and ever so self-assured, Percy is so busy proclaiming he will make Esther his, that he misses her rather subtle moves that show her iron will. Sweetly romantic and full of moments that just strike that youthful ideal of romance as Percy counts their kisses, this introduction gives a glimpse into the couple they could become.In The Courtship, a few years have passed from the early days, and Esther is managing four very young boys while Percy, as was the habit, was involved in his own affairs, not quite ignoring, but not sharing his life with her, or helping her with the boys.  Of course, he has secrets, but rather than spend an eternity discussing the secrets and why hes keeping them, Esther wont allow too much division between them.  Soon they do talk, as adults, with few to no recriminations and a re-alignment of their relationship.Both stories bring the presence of both Percy and Esther into the forefront, while developing them as individuals and as a very formidable (in all the best ways) couple. Not all smooth sailing and happy ever afters, these two have overcome difficulties, learned that two heads are better and never forgot the initial reasons, attitudes and beliefs that brought them together.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"Anna and Sophie are cousins, with the ties of family and history showing strongly in the story. Both graduates of the Womens Medical College, these two are working against the odds: society doesnt believe women are as viable as men in medicine.  Beyond that frustration (which they both expected) there are the dangers, the hardships and the abject poverty that they will encounter through their work.Told with details that bring the city to light, good and bad, the voices of both Anna and Sophie are clear and present, engaging the reader, bringing empathy and a view that feels as if you could be there, watching over their shoulders.  Their actions are completely in keeping with their own personalities and beliefs, fully integrated characters that are accessible and present for readers and a true treat to read.With a fairly formidable cast of characters, most secondary and met in passing, it would feel rushed and overwhelming if details and time were not taken. But Donati paints pictures with broad strokes, filling in details with smaller shadows and highlights, then penciling in the finest bits: in pieces, it looks disjointed and crowded, but all together it is masterful and flows perfectly from one moment to the next.  Not quite a read in one sitting title at over 750 pages, this was one that I finished in 2 long blocks of reading, always tossing moments back and forth when the book was idle.

"As children, Farah and Dougan were soon inseparable, Farahs open and loving heart that brought Dougan into her life set them on a path to love, albeit childish. They had even declared themselves married, and life for them always included one another.  But when Farah is nearly abused, and Dougan steps in to defend her, he is sent to prison and she is left to manoeuver life alone.Fast forward several years, and Farah is posing as a widow, using Dougans surname, and working for Scotland Yard. Shes never forgotten Dougan, and while she wants a family of her own, her options are limited, and loveless.  Soon, however, she is taken by Dorian, a man at the center of a manhunt, believed to run all things nefarious in London, best exemplified by his cold and calculating presence.  But, all is not as it seems, and Dorian, enchanted by his former prison-mate Dougans tale of the wondrous Fairy had sought her out. Shes apparently the target of danger, and Dorian wouldnt want anything happen to the woman hed come to know through tales in prison.The dark and brooding hero is back! Dorian is nothing but solicitous and kind to Farah, even as his remove is buried beneath layers of abuse and issues, from childhood and even in prison. Again, Farahs heart and strength of character shine through. Still holding on to her memories of Dougan, she cant help but see the same characteristics in Dorian: the protectiveness, the wary watchfulness, the care with which he approaches new situations, and the underlying doubts he has.Wonderfully gripping, wholly emotional and beautifully described, these characters come alive on the page, set in a rather unforgiving landscape.

"The first in a new trilogy focused on the 18th Century French Court of Louis XV, the Nesle sisters, four of whom occupied the position of mistress, is detailed with lush imagery, treachery fitting the most twisted thriller, the opulence and over the top splendor of Versailles all in a story that explores the effects of power, betrayal, competition and family in a story that brings history to life.I love the court drama, sometimes even more animated and always more treacherous than one would expect.  This story reads much like favorites (Pillars of the Earth) as the sisters are all developed and detailed: personalities, physical types, even moralities are different.  With Hortense being the only sister NOT a mistress to Louis, we run through the sisters, and see their machinations within the family bonds, not to mention the behind the back maneuvering within the court.  All struggling for power, presence and admiration  from one and all. Starting with Louise and moving on shortly to Pauline: the truly bitter and life altering interactions are gobsmacking. Frenemies have nothing on these women: and sadly, each was a brilliant strategist: were they born in another time, or had more options available to them  they could have ruled the world.  But, boredom, greed, limited options and the family connections turned their attentions inward, as each slowly worked to destroy their rivals/sisters in benefit of their own rise on the ladder.This is gripping, telenovela-style drama that is all the more intriguing (and heart wrenching) for the fact that these were real women involved in real situations.  The historical research in this novel is impeccable, descriptions are lush and evocative and the people well, suffice it to say that the revolution against the rulers in France is understood better after seeing the attitudes, the wastefulness and the unrestrained behavior of the court.

"A mix of French nobility and Scottish knight provide the base for this story.  When Gavin saves a mans life, he is introduced to Colette, not as a bride, but as a treasured possession that he is to escort to Scotland to deliver her to her fianc.  While Gavin is instantly attracted to the beauty before him, his honor and his duty require him to complete the mission to the best of his ability.Colette has been raised to obey and make a marriage that benefits her family. Unhappy with leaving her home and family for the unknown, shes reserved and a bit removed. These two will have a long journey together, with several unexpected obstacles.I wanted to see more conviction from Colette, her sharp tongue was dismissive and made her difficult to understand or like: pretty is not an excuse for bad behavior.  Her opening up to Gavin rather felt like walking through a puddle, she didnt have many moments that built her as a character that felt equal to Gavin.  As for Gavin, hes gobsmacked from the first by her, and I didnt feel his fighting the attraction as much as come up with yet another reason for them not to be together.  Common in romance, but when the sole character conflict is solely based on the two characters overcoming a single obstacle (a fianc)  and the many reasons they can push off the moment when they both decide their connection is more important.Having really enjoyed other titles from this author, I was disappointed in the plotting flow: characters seemed to appear and disappear, with and without convictions and intentions, solely to serve the plot move forward.  It didnt hold together as well as I wanted, and while there was plenty of other moments of created conflict (thieves, orphans, subterfuge, danger) it didnt always feel necessary or connected in a broader sense.  An easy, non-challenging read that hit the okay button: not great, not bad, but never quite hitting the good moments that make a story memorable.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"3.5 stars  roundedThe second title in this four-book series brings us to Cashs story.  Returning to New Orleans to say goodbye to the recently dead club president, he discovers an inheritance.  He has been deeded some old Deacons property that just happens to be in use by Billie Taylor: it houses her gallery and the small apartment above the storefront.  Far different than the first in the series, this story takes a circuitous route to a happy solution for Billie and Cash.Cash was difficult to like, and even more difficult to tolerate in his blatant disregard for Billie: he had his reasons for wanting nothing to do with the Deacons, and Priests decisions  preferring to sell and go. But Billie is almost a casualty in his early behavior  his bullheaded approach didnt show me a redeemable person beneath even though (this IS romance) there was a physical attraction. Characters in this are a bit more developed: Billie is recovering from her own hang-ups and issues  and Cash just jumps in with that air of control. Slowly though, the two do develop a rapport, as Cash opens up to BIlie and the two find that together they can be WHO they want to be, not who they are.There is an underlying layer of mystery surrounding Priests death, and several unanswered questions about the disbanding of the club, his  final bequests to former members that moved out and on from New Orleans, and some other little who is pulling the strings moments. Most are still unanswered and dance on the line where some answers need to come or the storyline will feel like filler to prolong, rather than a driving force.  Less rough-hewn than the first, this is a good starter kit for those interested in trying motorcycle club romance but are unsure about the graphic nature of the genre.  Rachael Johns has created a  character in Billie that was truly a fun one to know, and gave some development to Cash that brought me around to accepting, if not wholly believing or liking him much.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"In Sweet Bea, Heggers trajectory for the hero was most striking, taking him from disreputable and unlikeable to better understood. No such issue in My Lady Faye, as both characters arrive with instant empathy points: Faye has suffered in an abusive marriage and Gregory is a man who fought for years as a knight, foregoing his own desires to become a monk, and ignoring his affections for Faye.I really did enjoy the development of this story: Fayes ability to survive years of abuse, and her familys willingness to go against tradition of the time and offer her and her two sons refuge gave instant heart to the story.  And then there is Gregory: honorable and upstanding, hes put off his own desires to fulfill the needs of others, and the time has come for him to follow his own dreams.But upon Fayes return, he realizes that his attraction for Faye never declined, and even has grown over the years, recognizing her strength and determination.  Shes sworn off men, but Gregory is different. When her son is taken, the two head off to recover him, and their relationship is rekindled.  Slowly the two open up and redefine their own potential as a couple, and the story is a wonderful journey.Easily read by itself, readers will find a benefit in understanding and adapting to language flow, recurring characters and the feel of the time reading this series in order. Although it isnt necessary, Sweet Bea feeds nicely into this story, and you will see Heggers ability to develop characters that keep you glued to the pages.

"Oh how I love a highlander, and when you combine it with a heroine who has her own backbone and fire, add in a touch of danger and plenty of steam and its a total winner.  Such is Hannah and the Highlander, the first in a new series from Sabrina York.  Ive read this title three times (already) and different elements stand forward with each pageResearch is impeccable, using actual events and traditions that inform the setting.  There is a plausible threat and reason for the relationship, and clues to the truth of Alexander in the near-fawning affections for him exemplified in his staff and clansmen. Not to mention an adorable imp, taken in during the clearings who has him wrapped around her little finger.  These all come together and give a framework on which the story is wovenHannah is an unmarried woman, considering herself off the market, preferring to manage her fathers estate, dodge arrows from her nieces bow, and keep her younger innocent sister from harm, particularly with her discussions of spirits and ghosts.  Despite her very logical core, Hannah is a dyed in the wool romantic, and not only yearns for love but an equal partnership, and she wont be happy settling for less.Alexander is weighed down by his responsibilities, and mired in memories of his past.  A totally honorable and giving man, his childhood traumas have left him with a stammer, and the belief that he can never be enough for the position as Laird.An instant connection keeps Hannah in Alexanders mind, the first hes ever found intriguing.

"Im loving this mix up of the American Civil War brought to English shores: in this installment, Dalton has returned from his participation in the war, wounded and changed, only to discover he has inherited the title after his elder brothers demise.  Before the war, Dalton was a rake, at loose ends and bored. The war seemed a wonderful adventure and his boredom was quickly erased at Manassas.  Now he wants little more than to adjust to a new quiet life, even as his new responsibilities pull at him.Minervas brother Neville was one who followed Dalton to America, and now she wants to know where her brother is.  Dalton could care less about Neville, although he does find the rather strident young woman intriguing.  He believes that his injuries (a missing eye and hearing loss) were at the business end of Nevilles gun, and hes got no interest in his well-being.A bit of a slow start, this story gives us both Minerva and Dalton in retrospective: we learn about each person, discover their characters, secrets and motivations early on, giving a solidity to their characters and the slowly developing romance between them.  Minerva was very much a forward thinking, take charge woman who often substituted logic for pure emotion, so it was wonderful to see her softer side emerge. Dalton was a fairly typical second son of the aristocracy, and he availed himself of all the possible distractions, looking for purpose.  From rather offhandedly dismissive of the assistance granted one in his position to actually needing help from others to exist and survive, his growth is bone deep and visceral, and the break in the stiff upper lip approach to life just add to his humanity.Slow growing, this romance started with banter and butting heads as the two learn one another, react to differences, argue, snipe and eventually learn to compromise and agree. Yes, there is a subplot with murder and mystery, but the characters and the development of their relationship from two fiercely independent, I will live my life alone people to two who have learned to open doors and let another person in. And their relationship is stronger and more palpable for the growth and development both characters displayed.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review.

"Susanna Derring is living a life of propriety: a domineering mother who is a stickler for propriety are stifling Susannas every moment. Bored to tears and longing for something diferent even her simplest requests are denied her.  See, Susanna believes that her life would be better if she could only get to Vauxhall Gardens, yet she is denied the opportunity at every turn.Gideon is a thief, and a member of the loose collective, The Covent Garden Cubs.  Hes tired of the life, knows that there is more to be and do outside of London, but he has just one more heist to give up the life forever. Its hard not to like him: he wants more and different, and is completely unafraid of facing his own faults or deeds.  Hes also got a strong sense of honor, as strange as that sounds that informs his life and actions.A mistimed encounter brings Susanna and Gideon face to face- and Susanna uses the moment to convince Gideon to take her to the Gardens. From here  the story runs full out.  And in a short 36 hours  the two share moments of discovery (on both sides), danger (Gideon is being chased), honest interactions and several moments that bring both growth and emotion.  While I would have preferred a longer trajectory, the fast and furious action kept both characters on their toes, and had the connection between Gideon and Suzanna moving forward at rapid fire. Fun, light and funny, this story had all the hallmarks of a fun escape read:  romance, action, danger and two characters that are hard not to like.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"For years Ive been fascinated with mythology and history: not simply the better known Greek and Roman, or even the lore from the Brothers Grimm, but the lesser known folk tales, beliefs and history of other cultures.  Often the discovering of this information is quite a dry read: more scholarly in nature, with frequent references that assume (or require) a broad base of historic knowledge to place an object in time.  While this often carries the onus of coursework you have to complete, rather than wish to investigate, the time spent is always beneficial.  But, to find complex history where the author has placed items into context of time, culture and lore opens a well of richness that spurns imagination and helps to vividly imprint that information.In Ivory Vikings, Nancy Marie Brown delves into the rich history of the years where the Vikings ruled the North Atlantic, courageously (and without advantage of modern technology) establishing presence on areas as diverse as Greenland and Scotland, England and Norway, Ireland and Iceland and even into modern-day Scandinavia.  While myth and discoveries intertwine, there is also the story of the artist, the creator of the very wondrous pieces, a woman (yes  I too was surprised) Margaret the Adroit.Woven through all of the information and history, including the construct of the pieces, the background and history to each piece on the board and information on the discovery of the pieces, who holds the best argument for provenance, and even using archaeological evidence (or lack thereof) to illustrate the story.  The history and legend of Iceland, life and beliefs are also highlights, with information coming fast and furiously, well-documented and placed to present a solid history for the pieces.I couldnt put this down, and I have a list as long as I am tall to look for later: most importantly, I wanted to touch the pieces, stroke them. There is a certain life to ivory (for those who havent felt an old carving or piano key) that has a warmthsomewhere along the way I had read that ancient people preferred items carved from bone or ivory, believing the spirit of the animal helped to infuse a life and warmth, if not special powers.  While the use of the visages from the set may forever be encapsulated by the Wizards chess games in the Harry Potter books, the set, on display at the British Museum, can spur imagination and questions evermore.  Brown has answered some of those questions, and given readers more to investigate along the way.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"A follow-up character exploration story, MacAlisters Hope is the story of Fia MacLachlan, first met in The Devil of Kilmartin. Ive yet to read that particular title, and have purchased it to read at the first free opportunity.Fia was an orphan child, yet skilled with healing and herbs. Taken in and raised with love and kindness, Fia has made a life for herself, and has grown and thrived in her role as healer.  But, the early years took a toll: never fully confident in her skills, or believing her own worth, she is content to serve as second to Elena, the woman who with her husband, raised her.When the MacAlisters come searching for a healer, namely Elena, her advanced pregnancy preclude her traveling, and Fia is sent in her place.  The man sent to fetch the healer is Kieron, who has never forgotten the sage advice given years ago by an orphan waif.  Not only did Fias advice to Kieron help him through a difficult time pushing him to use not just his fists but his wits.  Now grown, a trusted warrior for the clan and advisor to the chieftan, Kieron has never forgotten Fia, and his interest is renewed.A sweet story based in learning, healing and help: beautifully emotional and detailed with descriptions that bring the characters to life, setting their conflicts, concerns and connection out for all to see.  Kierons admiration for Fia is heartfelt, yet her loyalty to her own home and all she feels she needs to know keep her hesitant. The feelings and desire are there, but the conflict between leaving those she feels she owes and toward her own happiness clearly present and leave the reader cheering for this coupleA wonderful short, perfect for a quick read, I cant wait to grab the first in the story to meet Fia and Kieron as children.I received an eBook copy of the title from the author for purpose of honest review.

"The Redcakes Tea Shop, indeed the cake factory are experiencing troubles, and Matilda is feeling the pressure to keep everything running. The renegade of the family, she has a young son that she is raising herself, and combined with the factory and business, life is hectic. She doesnt have time for the trouble OR to hunt down a new secretary, let alone have a relationship.Evan was the secretary for the Redcakes Tea Shop until fortuitous news arrives: believing himself an impoverished orphan, he discovers he is in fact the heir to the Earl of Fitzwater. Hes grabbing for the brass ring, and turning in his resignation. Hes always had a crush on Matilda, but now hes beginning to wonder if there is potential for a relationship.There are several elements coming into play in this story, almost too many. Characters have always been (for me) the high point of this series, and both Matilda and Evan have quietly existed in the background of these stories, only coming forward in moments.  While I enjoyed the two of them together I did find that some of the elements are too far beyond belief, and too many elements collided: the sabotage at the factory, Evans ties to the flour manufacturer, Matildas son being kidnapped for me to find a solid link to follow the story from point a  b  c.Because of the multiple moments competing for supremacy and attention, the story felt disjointed, making the read feel far longer than a book of 250-ish pages should.  Sadly, the enjoyment that I found in the first book I had read of this series was missing, and I was struggling to find that sense of familiarity and enjoyment that was present in earlier reads.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"Ive been following this series from the beginning, and Renita Pizzitola has managed to create engaging and honest characters that readers will recognize and want to know. In the third book, Just a Little Kiss, we have Masons story. We first met Mason back in Just a Little Crush, he had his own crush on the heroine Brinley, but realized soon on that it was one-sided, and the two became fast friends.  Fortunately, his sense was rewarded, and we get to see his story here.Mason is a stand-up guy: in touch with his feelings and aware that he can find a love of his own. A summer job offer with a fishing boat service brings him into a new environment, and hes finding himself ready for a summer fling.Felicity is a local girl, a waitress at the diner, and one with a passion for her summer boys.  Shes not interested in long term, and the influx of summer only workers fits her plan perfectly: no muss, no fuss.  But then she meets Mason  and hes more than just a summer boy..These two have the chemistry, and despite the rather mature attitude they both project about relationships, they are young and make some mistakes that perfectly fit their actual ages: neither one is perfect or without issues, but they do manage to finally get it together and actually discuss their issues, rather than flounce off in a snit.  Both characters grew and learned from their drama, and while it may seem that I am downplaying angst and drama, these two really dont have an overabundance of either.  Pizzitola wrote these characters with care and deliberation, and both they and their relationship grew in ways that felt plausible and natural. A wonderful installment, and leaves the door open for more, should other characters get a chance to have their moments.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"Sarah Hegger has veered from the more traditional contemporary romance pathways and added some difficult real-life situations that usually dont take a front row. In Nobodys Angel, the topic was alcoholism, and the story worked on several levels.  This book tackles the difficulties of mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder, and how the disease effects the family, not just the individual.Holly has headed to Chicago to find her sister, fearing she isnt following through with her medication regime.  The eldest of four, Holly has always (and we never really get a solid why) been the protector, and it falls to her to find and return Portia to the fold.  I found her difficult: yes, she had far more on her plate than most, and she is either oversharing or not letting people in.Josh is intrigued by Holly, and surprised as he usually doesnt get too emotionally involved with the women he meets.  I felt more of a desire for a connection from his side, although their chemistry was uneven, especially after the sisters descended and the alone time for the couple was nearly non-existent.Hegger writes a beautiful story, and bravely tackles issues that are relevant and prevalent today, but this was more family saga than romance, with the connection between Josh and Holly often took a backseat to drama with Holly, Portia, Grace and Emma. While I was frequently told that they were connected, rather than given that visceral emotional punch I hoped for.  Not a bad story by any means, this is almost a tale of how a mental illness effects more than the person with the diagnosis.I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

"This first chapter of Cold Weather, a short story authored by songwriter-musician Lori Carson (via the new indie writer website 3am Analog), introduces us primarily to Owen Ash, the lead character, and establishes the foundation of a story that's already drawing me in, even in just the 13 or so pages available here. The author's revealing and tempting introduction of Ash, for me, provides the beginnings of a compelling protagonist. In addition, the conflict aspect is also parsed out sufficiently to not only maintain my interest in the story as it's told here, but also gives me something to look forward to as future chapters become available. In short, Cold Weather offers a very promising start to a well-told tale of a character's journey I'm eager to continue experiencing.I'm not sure how germane this is, but I thought I'd mention my experience with the story's author was not through literature. Rather, I was first ""introduced"" to Lori Carson through her musical work with The Golden Palominos and, later, her extensive solo career (in fact, via her song ""You Won't Fall"" from the Liv Tyler movie ""Stealing Beauty."" I'd always found her lyrics captivating, primarily due to their painfully insightful but often - often, not always ;) - hopeful take on relationships, love, and life in general. These themes carry over, in some ways, into her fiction writing, though in a much different style. In a way, it's a bit apples and oranges, but the songwriter and the author can't be wholly separated, no matter who the artist, in my very humble opinion.Knowing good songwriting doesn't always or automatically translate to good fiction writing (as I think we've all seen at one time or another), I normally wouldn't have expected too much. But, I'd read Ms Carson's first (and only) novel, which I enjoyed immensly, so it was with no small amount of excitement I'd read she'd authored this short story and that it'd be released in a serialized format (for lack of a better term?) via Amazon and available on my iPad via the Kindle app. Pretty cool. :)On a personal note, I've always been drawn more to exploring the sadder, more melancholy facets that exist in all of us as we muddle through life as best we can, and for better or worse. I think, through exploring those moments of our lives we can often find the most interesting and truthful aspects of ourselves. I guess Im a bit more Eeyore than Tigger, in that regard, as I told someone once. hahaAnyway, Im looking forward to the next installment and the day I'll be able to read this story as a complete work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UY47A5LQMGDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HDQDLS#wasThisHelpful","R2UY47A5LQMGDW","A1M0YAZ6JV488Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M0YAZ6JV488Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tolerable microbudget indie sci-fi found footage video... The acting ranges from actually pretty good to cringeworthy. But, overall, it's free on Amazon Prime, Im a huge fan of this subgenre, and I'm always on the lookout for diamonds in the rough. This is not one of those, but I did find I could sit through it, if taking a few breaks during the really tedious parts. I honestly can't say this is a terrible video, however. It is what it is - small crew, no budget, group of friends getting together to make a sci-fi found footage thriller.There aren't any real thrills or chills, but it's not one you'll turn off (in my opinion) because it's one of those in the glut of unwatchable hack jobs. It's slickly edited and shot, and, again, the acting is really what saves it (with a couple notable exceptions - sorry ""Andrea"", you'd make a great Maxim model, but I think she was really added to the production - as they ironically state in the video - for eye candy purposes. And she definitely fits the bill on that one. Hell, I'd watch this again just to catch her scenes. But, seriously, there are some really decent actors in this film, and they save it from being a totally boring train ride to nowhere. Even ""Foster"", the over-the-top stylish-hipster-photographer was incongruous in the overall ghost hunting team.If I had to sum it up, I'd say it's like the cast and crew of an adult video production got lost on their way to the San Fernando Valley and ended up making a mainstream indie film instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KAZ129YI84UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DMXYNI#wasThisHelpful","R2KAZ129YI84UA","A1M0YAZ6JV488Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M0YAZ6JV488Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Goodness knows, there are plenty of people at airports who are there solely to pickpocket and commit other crimes.

I'm a big water drinker, so I've found these infusers a very nice change from plain ole water. I particularly like this one, as it doesn't require me to constantly refill from the larger version if I want to have some flavor in my water. Specifically, I use sliced lemon from my backyard tree. But, I've also used various other citrus and fruit varieties. I like using lemon, lime, and cucumber, as they hold up the longest.

They have vibrant colors and great detail on each of the drivers in the cars. Each car is the perfect size for small hands, but not too small to be concerned with choking.Each car has a piece that is interactive, a dump truck, a trailer that has a tailgate that opens and hooks to another tractor, cement truck that can ""empty"" the cement, and a traditional tractor used for loading up dirt or digging holes.These are so fun to play with and teach your kids about different kinds of cars and what they can do for different jobs. I really love the friction ""push and go"" feature and makes for great playtime! You can make the cars go forward, backward and really fast or slow.I highly recommend these cars, they make great gifts, simple designs, but allow for creative play and learning!

You simply push in the final ""tension"" rod and it's spring-loaded feature makes it easy to put in place and keeps it perfectly secure and stable. It is also very well designed in that the plastic trays are easy to put on the rods and they actually stay in place.

I love the clamp on feature which not only works very well, but makes these things compact and easy to store when not in use!I was worried about how strong they would be and if the clamps would hold very well but they definitely hold incredibly strong. Our babies are totally secure in these and they have the included buckles within the seats which are a great safety feature as well. They don't damage our table whatsoever which is a nice bonus too.The seats are quite comfortable and our babies really love sitting in them! (We ordered two for our twins).

" 1:26 Mins This is such an awesome drone. I own a couple of this thing's smaller predecessors (the X5C-1) but decided to upgrade to this larger drone primarily for the ability to lift a heavier payload (specifically either my gopro or mobius cameras). This thing shoots decent 720P footage (with a bit of the ""jello"" effect though), but can easily lift a gopro or other action sports camera of similar size and weight.Pros:1. Size and power: it is basically the same size of the dji phantom but obviously doesn't have the gps system. However, it is still easy to fly and has sufficient power to lift a heavier camera than the stock one (lifts my gopro hero 3+ without a problem).2. Easy to fly: any drone flying obviously takes some practice, but this thing is very user friendly, simple, and straightforward to fly. It's overall size and weight make it quite stable and solid in medium winds (up to about 15 mph before it becomes to hard to keep stable). Additionally, this drone has the option to fly in ""headless"" mode (push and hold the top left button for about two seconds and wait for 3 beeps to activate). Headless mode simply makes it so no matter what direction the drone is facing, the forward/backward and left/right controls are always consistent. Make sure you active headless mode with the drone facing straight away from you, then even if you turn it sideways or even back toward you, pushing the control forward still moves the drone forward and away from you and likewise for the other controls...no need to flip the controls mentally when it is pointing to or from you.3. Quick and easy setup: You simply attach the landing gear, propellers, and the batteries and your flying in no time. There are youtube videos that show how to install the propellers but basically you put on the prop first, then the little white piece (you'll know what I mean when you see it) then you slide the little metal bar on top of the white piece and through the propeller pole. Then finish it off by pushing on the chrome propeller caps.4. Affordable parts and accessories: parts are easy to find and relatively cheap for this drone. There's obviously a bit more pricey than the parts for the smaller X5C sized drones because everything is bigger, but still much cheaper than parts for like a dji phantom or other more expensive drone. Batteries are here on amazon for about 15 to 17 bucks each. Extra propellers are a few bucks too.5. Super durable: I accidentally flew this thing pretty hard into the ground at one point, causing it to bounce and flip and roll along the field...but absolutely no damage aside from some negligible scuffs. It's built like a tank though, very solid.6. Battery life: I consistently get 10 or 11 minutes even with my gopro attached. Even after several recharges on the same battery I'm still getting north of 10 minutes every time. And I usually don't even wait for the battery to totally die, I just either see the lights start to flash or notice a bit of power loss and bring it in for a fresh battery, and this is consistently above the 10 minute mark still.Cons:1. Jello effect on camera: This can be mitigated by adding some electrical or duct tape to the camera to keep it extra steadyIt's not horrendous though and again, just making the camera even tighter with some tape really reduces the issue. Honestly though, one of the key benefits of this drone is the ability you have to upgrade its camera to a gopro or mobius etc.Other notes:1. This drone is can easily and cheaply be customized with other cool parts. For example, I bought and attached some aftermarket dji phantom wide and tall landing gear, which fits this drone as well. Now I don't have any landing gear in my video when I use wide angle on my gopro.I hope you enjoy the flight footage I've uploaded. I've been super happy with this drone and for the price, it's really tough to beat. The next step up in drones costs hundreds more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LFV5MRUEHO5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011WUWC7K#wasThisHelpful","R1LFV5MRUEHO5L","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolutely fantastic kit of accessories for my gopro hero3+. I really love the long arm mount piece because I was able to use it to set up a stoller-cam for our jogging stroller, super fun! The quality of these products is definitely equal to gopro brand accessories but just way more affordable. The sticky tape that it comes with for the mounts is also the same quality 3M brand tape that really holds strong. I love having a chest harness for rollerblading, and the headstrap for filming my drone flights. The suction cup mount is also great for the windshield.

" 1:26 Mins Very nice camera! This thing shoots a very clear and crisp full HD video and takes great photos as well. The compression for uploading my video to amazon doesn't do the quality justice. I've had lesser cameras similar to this one before that didn't do very good in either low or very bright environments. This one performs very respectable in both. It is also very lightweight. It is much lighter than my GoPro Hero3+ with the lcd backpack mounted, and I love that this one has a built in lcd screen.The number of settings and customization that you can do with this camera is fantastic. The case is perfectly waterproof and we use it to shoot family videos at the pool and lake. Because it is so lightweight, I can also attach it to my smaller drone and it lifts it just fine. I've attached a video of the aerial video. I also like that it comes with two batteries so I can record for longer periods of time when I'm out. Plenty of great accessories too.I've been very happy with this camera and would certainly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7MWYM3OFRKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140K37NC#wasThisHelpful","R3R7MWYM3OFRKK","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very well made and designed, and super convenient item. I wanted to be able to split the signal from my bluray player to two separate tv's and this little gem does the trick extremely well.

"Very well designed and constructed genuine leather wallet. I was tired of not having enough slots and pockets in my old wallet so I upgraded to this one and I'm glad I did. Whilst still remaining reasonably sleek and compact, this thing can store all of my cards, cash, and other wallet items with ease. I've had cheap ""leather"" wallets in the past that fell apart rather quickly, primarily because of poor stitching. The stitching on this wallet seems really solid and has held up very well for me so far. The leather is quite strong too. I keep a magnetic key-card in my wallet for accessing a couple places and I usually just hold my wallet up to the scanner and then use my wallet on the handle to open the door. The leather holds up very well even to this atypical rugged use. Overall I've been very happy with the style, quality, and most importantly, the craftsmanship of this wallet and would certainly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R106OL8V3MB7Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013IFATOK#wasThisHelpful","R106OL8V3MB7Y2","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love love love these bibs! I love the silicone material on these bibs, makes them flexible, comfortable and the easiest thing to clean after feeding time with my babies. I have used them now a dozen times with my twins and it has made feeding time a simple no hassle experience!The neck is adjustable and fits around most any neck size perfectly. It lays on the shoulders and drapes down the chest so it easily captures any droppings from feeding time! With this type of customizable adjustment these bibs will grow as your baby grows.Easy clean up! I have used a simple baby wipe or disinfectant wipe to clean it up and the material has maintained its integrity! I have also tried washing mine in the dishwasher on the top rack. It comes out perfectly clean each time and shows no sign of deterioration. I now do not need to undress my twins down to diapers for every feeding.Excellent buy! I plan on getting more to have hand and to take with me when we go out! Highly recommend this purchase, every parent with now be stress free during feeding time. Feeding time will still be messy, but I love that I no longer have to worry about the mess winding up on their clothes and staining!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODEFB82XE0XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TJVHR0#wasThisHelpful","RODEFB82XE0XK","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love this product! As a mom I needed something that is easy to use and clean, safe and simple. This product meets each of those requirements and then some! The orange portion of the bath rack is a grip material that will keep a wet baby in place, but is also comfortable and will not leave baby's skin irritated. The ""arm rests"" on the side keep baby securely in place while allowing arm room for them to play with a few toys during bath time. At the bottom there is lip that goes between the legs keeping them from sliding down and out of the rack. I really loved this feature because my little ones are squirmy and this keeps them in place for bath time!It is lightweight and easy to clean given it is a plastic surface. It has suction cups on each of the legs that will lock it securely in place wherever you are doing bath time for your little one(s). I have tried it in our bathroom sink and also in our portable bathtub. It works excellent in both places and suctions to both surfaces perfectly.I highly recommend this rack if you are looking for something that is simple, yet still maintains a high level of safety for your little one. Doesn't take up much space, easy to clean, and allows your little one to have fun and still be safe during bath time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GS4XEX7S79SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TJUGB8#wasThisHelpful","R2GS4XEX7S79SZ","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:26 Mins This is such an awesome drone. I own a couple of this thing's smaller predecessors (the X5C-1) but decided to upgrade to this larger drone primarily for the ability to lift a heavier payload (specifically either my gopro or mobius cameras). This thing shoots decent 720P footage (with a bit of the ""jello"" effect though), but can easily lift a gopro or other action sports camera of similar size and weight.Pros:1. Size and power: it is basically the same size of the dji phantom but obviously doesn't have the gps system. However, it is still easy to fly and has sufficient power to lift a heavier camera than the stock one (lifts my gopro hero 3+ without a problem).2. Easy to fly: any drone flying obviously takes some practice, but this thing is very user friendly, simple, and straightforward to fly. It's overall size and weight make it quite stable and solid in medium winds (up to about 15 mph before it becomes to hard to keep stable). Additionally, this drone has the option to fly in ""headless"" mode (push and hold the top left button for about two seconds and wait for 3 beeps to activate). Headless mode simply makes it so no matter what direction the drone is facing, the forward/backward and left/right controls are always consistent. Make sure you active headless mode with the drone facing straight away from you, then even if you turn it sideways or even back toward you, pushing the control forward still moves the drone forward and away from you and likewise for the other controls...no need to flip the controls mentally when it is pointing to or from you.3. Quick and easy setup: You simply attach the landing gear, propellers, and the batteries and your flying in no time. There are youtube videos that show how to install the propellers but basically you put on the prop first, then the little white piece (you'll know what I mean when you see it) then you slide the little metal bar on top of the white piece and through the propeller pole. Then finish it off by pushing on the chrome propeller caps.4. Affordable parts and accessories: parts are easy to find and relatively cheap for this drone. There's obviously a bit more pricey than the parts for the smaller X5C sized drones because everything is bigger, but still much cheaper than parts for like a dji phantom or other more expensive drone. Batteries are here on amazon for about 15 to 17 bucks each. Extra propellers are a few bucks too.5. Super durable: I accidentally flew this thing pretty hard into the ground at one point, causing it to bounce and flip and roll along the field...but absolutely no damage aside from some negligible scuffs. It's built like a tank though, very solid.6. Battery life: I consistently get 10 or 11 minutes even with my gopro attached. Even after several recharges on the same battery I'm still getting north of 10 minutes every time. And I usually don't even wait for the battery to totally die, I just either see the lights start to flash or notice a bit of power loss and bring it in for a fresh battery, and this is consistently above the 10 minute mark still.Cons:1. Jello effect on camera: This can be mitigated by adding some electrical or duct tape to the camera to keep it extra steadyIt's not horrendous though and again, just making the camera even tighter with some tape really reduces the issue. Honestly though, one of the key benefits of this drone is the ability you have to upgrade its camera to a gopro or mobius etc.Other notes:1. This drone is can easily and cheaply be customized with other cool parts. For example, I bought and attached some aftermarket dji phantom wide and tall landing gear, which fits this drone as well. Now I don't have any landing gear in my video when I use wide angle on my gopro.I hope you enjoy the flight footage I've uploaded. I've been super happy with this drone and for the price, it's really tough to beat. The next step up in drones costs hundreds more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3UPLYO72NVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010L6JG66#wasThisHelpful","R3E3UPLYO72NVJ","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These motors are awesome! I have a couple of Syma X8C drones and they both made a slight scratchy sound from the motors on occasion (though it didn't seem to impact performance). These motors have eliminated that problem for me and are actually noticeably better than the stock ones.Thanks to the plug-in system on these they are a piece of cake to install. After installation, I immediately noticed better response and power from the motors. Sometimes when the X8C is on a downward drift it can take a bit of time and full throttle to get it to stop moving down and to begin gaining elevation again. That problem has also been eliminated for me with these new motors, with them providing a noticeable increase in power.I'll definitely be looking to get another set for my other X8C! If you enjoy your X8C and want to optimize its performance, these are a worthwhile investment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4JRLHNW8MSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WBWYUM#wasThisHelpful","R2T4JRLHNW8MSF","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is such a fantastic inflatable chair. It is made of a solid and durable rubber like material. It has three different compartments for air so that you can adjust the pressure and softness in various spots which is great. Also, I love the feature of being able to quickly fold out the cushions into an air mattress for sleeping.

" 4:35 Mins This is such an awesome drone. I own a couple of this thing's smaller predecessors (the X5C-1) but decided to upgrade to this larger drone primarily for the ability to lift a heavier payload (specifically either my gopro or mobius cameras). This thing shoots decent 720P footage (with a bit of the ""jello"" effect though), but can easily lift a gopro or other action sports camera of similar size and weight.Pros:1. Size and power: it is basically the same size of the dji phantom but obviously doesn't have the gps system. However, it is still easy to fly and has sufficient power to lift a heavier camera than the stock one (lifts my gopro hero 3+ without a problem).2. Easy to fly: any drone flying obviously takes some practice, but this thing is very user friendly, simple, and straightforward to fly. It's overall size and weight make it quite stable and solid in medium winds (up to about 15 mph before it becomes to hard to keep stable). Additionally, this drone has the option to fly in ""headless"" mode (push and hold the top left button for about two seconds and wait for 3 beeps to activate). Headless mode simply makes it so no matter what direction the drone is facing, the forward/backward and left/right controls are always consistent. Make sure you active headless mode with the drone facing straight away from you, then even if you turn it sideways or even back toward you, pushing the control forward still moves the drone forward and away from you and likewise for the other controls...no need to flip the controls mentally when it is pointing to or from you.3. Quick and easy setup: You simply attach the landing gear, propellers, and the batteries and your flying in no time. There are youtube videos that show how to install the propellers but basically you put on the prop first, then the little white piece (you'll know what I mean when you see it) then you slide the little metal bar on top of the white piece and through the propeller pole. Then finish it off by pushing on the chrome propeller caps.4. Affordable parts and accessories: parts are easy to find and relatively cheap for this drone. There's obviously a bit more pricey than the parts for the smaller X5C sized drones because everything is bigger, but still much cheaper than parts for like a dji phantom or other more expensive drone. Batteries are here on amazon for about 15 to 17 bucks each. Extra propellers are a few bucks too.5. Super durable: I accidentally flew this thing pretty hard into the ground at one point, causing it to bounce and flip and roll along the field...but absolutely no damage aside from some negligible scuffs. It's built like a tank though, very solid.6. Battery life: not sure why another reviewer only got 7 minutes as I consistently get 10 or 11 minutes even with my gopro attached. Even after several recharges on the same battery I'm still getting north of 10 minutes every time. And I usually don't even wait for the battery to totally die, I just either see the lights start to flash or notice a bit of power loss and bring it in for a fresh battery, and this is consistently above the 10 minute mark still.Cons:1. Jello effect on camera: This can be mitigated by adding some electrical or duct tape to the camera to keep it extra steady, but for my review I didn't want to tamper with it's stock condition so my attached video shows a bit of jello. It's not horrendous though and again, just making the camera even tighter with some tape really reduces the issue. Honestly though, one of the key benefits of this drone is the ability you have to upgrade its camera to a gopro or mobius etc, so once I finished the video I shot for this review I just stuck my gopro back on it.Other notes:1. This drone is can easily and cheaply be customized with other cool parts. For example, I bought and attached some aftermarket dji phantom wide and tall landing gear, which fits this drone as well. Now I don't have any landing gear in my video when I use wide angle on my gopro.I hope you enjoy the flight footage I've uploaded. When the video rendered the timing between the drone camera and my gopro got a bit off but I think you'll still get the gist of it. I've been super happy with this drone and for the price, it's really tough to beat. The next step up in drones costs hundreds more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BVOLAGFAUXIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W552JIY#wasThisHelpful","R2BVOLAGFAUXIE","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent product and a great buy!It is an excellent way to open up counter space in even the smallest of bathrooms. It is super easy to install on any wall surface with it's damage free adhesive backing on both the toothbrush holder and the toothpaste dispenser. It is made of a really nice white plastic which makes for easy cleaning, and looks great on any wall.The toothbrush holder has slots for 5 total toothbrushes, we only have need for two toothbrush slots, but are able to utilize it for our other teeth cleaning items as shown in the pictures. I love that the holder has a cover shielding the heads of your toothbrushes from dust and other germs prone to be found in the bathroom. The way your toothbrushes are stored allows you to grab your toothbrush at the base rather than from the head portion which goes in your mouth, another hygienic factor I love about this product!  What is also great about this holder is the cover opens easily and will stay open on its own, which allows for easy access to pull out, use your toothbrush and quickly return it and then close the cover only the one time. I really love this type of holder over your standard counter holder. For this holder alone I would buy this product again.The toothpaste dispenser absolutely great! It is easy to install any type of toothpaste that has a twist off cap so you can just install the tube itself. Which I've also shown in the included pictures. You simply push the plastic lever back like you would at a soft drink machine and the dispenser will dispense the perfect amount of toothpaste onto your toothbrush! Hands free and no more needing to break your hands trying to squeeze every last ounce of toothpaste out because this does it for you!Overall, a fantastic product, high quality and creates the most convenience for a daily routine process. It's easy to install, holds a large quantity of toothbrushes and is still easy to clean. Highly recommend this product and would totally buy it again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPVIWJ5HFNX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHI1R9Q#wasThisHelpful","R1MPVIWJ5HFNX1","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great set of luggage, that is lightweight yet durable. The sizing is perfect for your carryon and personal item for air travel. They are still spacious and do come with an expansion option (didn't use the expansion, using that might take it out of meeting the size requirement for carryon items). Plenty of smaller sippers and pockets in the roller bag to fit what you need for several days. The small shoulder bag is a great size.

"This was my first purchase of any kind of Pack 'n Play and I was totally happy with the purchase, especially for the price! You can go to stores and pay double the price and get less quality than this! I love the bassinet feature, which is how I am currently using mine. The pad isn't the most soft, but after wrapping a small blanket tightly around it, my baby sleeps really well in it. Since I purchased this I have actually purchased another one. These are one of the more compact PNP's that I've seen when it is completely folded up.Only Con - The arch that holds the dangling stars. The stars are only attached by Velcro and my babies are strong enough to pull them off. They stars are fairly big so I'm not sure they would be a complete risk of choking hazard, but it isn't safe in my opinion, plus it is an added loose piece to pack with you which is a negative to me. I just don't put mine on and that solves the problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GX0UTA37BPXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHVR4LA#wasThisHelpful","R2GX0UTA37BPXG","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second Graco Pack 'n Play and I love it! I love the bassinet option on this and that once your baby gets a bit bigger you can remove that and place a mattress at the bottom and make it more of a crib. The pad for the bassinet is not very soft even when a sheet is added. I personally purchased a soft small blanket and wrapped it very tightly around the pad and then placed it in the PNP. The setup and take down is really easy, done in just a few steps. I have twins and have these setup in our bedroom side-by-side and they both take up less space than one of my full size cribs, so this is great for on the go.Con - The one thing I don't like about this product (not enough to deduct a star) is the arch over the bassinet with hanging stars. The stars only attach to a dangling string by Velcro...my babies are strong enough to grab those and pull them off...The star's sizes are not a concern for choking unless they really tried to stuff them in their mouths...either way, these should be either permanently attached in some other way or not included in this at all.

"I am a bit torn on if I love or just sort of like this product. The clear ""extraction"" portions at both ends say they are made of a soft rubber. The actual blue portion of this is a soft rubber, while the clear portion is actually a more firm hard plastic. It does limit how deep you can enter your child's nose, which is good, but a lot of times their boogers are farther back, so I end up using a bulb to get it closer to the front and then use these to do the rest of extracting. I have tested this on my twins ears and they work excellent for cleaning out ears safely! Would recommend this for a great ear cleaner, but not the greatest solution for cleaning out noses. Plus I could never get away with using this while my babies slept. It would wake them right up. Overall, any okay product that I'll keep using sense I have two, but still will utilize my other gadgets along with it.

"I bought this teething blanket along with another style and like them equally. This is a great size, a bit bigger than I originally expected, but that was a plus in my mind. Each corner of the star provides some sort of touch stimulation for your baby, along with the center having some sort of crackling paper inside the fabric. The reason again for 4 stars is that the bottom right (blue) corner is the only surface for teething, which is why I bought this. I think it serves more as a sensory toy than a teething blanket. I still love it for my twins, they love playing with it and do use the actual teething portion to chew on, it would just be nice if a greater portion of it was made of a chewable rubber.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33D9Z6KJJFFZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019QCGVK#wasThisHelpful","R33D9Z6KJJFFZP","A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QSQ4VAKV2U0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is not.You don't need to dig out a pair of pliers to get the rack out when there's a a hot heavy piece of meat on it and you need to get to the pan drippings.It's solid.  It won't warp or bend or any of those annoying things flimsy pans do.The handles are nice and sturdy when you're dealing with heavy meats.You can put it in the dishwasher!It looks cool sitting on the counter.It fits in my not0huge vintage Wedgewood oven.Thanksgiving turkey?

"The story is told from the POV of two women who, when they were twelve, were kidnapped and held for a summer before they were returned to their families.  Back then Carly May was a beauty pageant contestant whose horrifying stepmother hauled her to multiple pageants cashing in on her golden locks.  Lois was smart as a whip, quite disenchanted with her family, and a spelling bee champ.  Their abductor, who they called Zed, never laid a hand on them.Despite this, their abduction obviously affected them.  Now Carly May, still beautiful but perhaps a bit worn around the edges with a drinking problem, is an actress who goes by the name Chloe.  Lois is a college professor who wrote a novel about their abduction and seems relationship-challenged.  The novel is being made into a screenplay and guess who is cast in it?Yep.  Chloe.To up the stakes a bit, Lois is writing another novel about Zeds unknown son.  Both Lois and Chloe are heading to the cabin in the woods where the film is to be shot.  Chloe is not sure how she feels about her life being turned into a screenplay without her knowledge.  And, oh yeah.  Lois has a stalker.Let the games begin.While the story kept moving, and many creepy secrets were revealed, it left a lot unexplained.  Yes, I was entertained by the book.  I was turning the pages and reading late into the night.  But I had questions.  A LOT of questions.Like:1.  If Zed didn't abduct them for money or creepy abductor reasons, why did he take them?2.  What was the story with Zed's family?3.  Why was it so easy to take the girls?  And why did they not try to escape when they were still traveling to the remote cabin?4.  How does a college professor with a full caseload have time to crank out two novels?5.  How did Zed choose the girls?  Was he looking for a spelling champ and someone wasting her intellect in beauty pageants?  It's not like they lived remotely near each other.And for the plot holes through which you can drive a truck:Time-wise it made no sense.  It takes a long time to get a novel optioned into a screenplay.  It takes a long time to get a script approved of said novel.  Then there's all the wheeling and dealing that occurs before pre-production even starts, and then there's a lot of preproduction time.It felt like when Maggie Mitchell couldn't explain something, she just moved on to the next chapter.As Ricky said to Lucy, and I say to Mitchell, You got some 'splainin' to do!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BS6SKHHDTC40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791485#wasThisHelpful","R2BS6SKHHDTC40","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever worry that your family might be a wee bit dysfunctional?  Worry no longer. Your flaws are nothing next to these folks.Meet the Mercer family: Alex, Millicent, and their son Max.The story begins when young Max boldly enters the neighbor's house in search of his cat.  Alex, ever the protective father, follows.  Neither seems too disturbed about the fact that they're wandering in someone else's home.  Then they discover te neighbor dead in the bathtub, apparently electrocuted when an electric iron fell in the tub.  For some reason, Alex thinks it must be a suicide... though I have a lot of troble figuring out how (or why) one would kill oneself by tossing an electric iron into one's bubble bath. Failing that, Alex thinks the eath must be accidental.  Again, I have trouble understanding how someone could be accidentally electrocuted in his own bathtub with an iron.  A radio, Maybe.  A hairdryer?  Perhaps.  But a iron?!The police, a bit less clueless than Alex in matters of bathtubs and irons and death are justifiably suspicious, first of Alex, and then of Millicent.Alex and Millcent, meanwhile are having their share of troubles, and the neighbor has heard them arguing, calling each other a variety of names one should never use with a loved one (though Alex claims they were using the words ""ironically."")  Accusing first one, then the other, of murder does not help their relationship a whit.  And then all sorts of unpleasant secrets about their lives start to emerge, giving them all sort of nifty motives.Meanwhile, son Max is acting increasingly bizarre.  Understandable after what he witnessed whilst traipsing though the neighbor's house.  Alex and Millcent hurry him to a shrink who, at times, seems as clueless as Alex and Millicent as to what's going on.  And Max starts revealing some secrets about Alex and Millcent that do nothing to help the unraveling we are witnessing.Does Ben McPherson write well?  Yes.  His dialog is crisp, his descriptions evocative, his characterizations of Alex, Millicent and Max creepily real, his ponderings on the importance of family worth reading.  He even does a reasonably coherent explanation of circuitry (though, to tell the truth, it didn't make sense to me.)  And he has come up with his own category of creepy.But the iron in the bathtub, to me, feels like a plot hole one could drive a truck through, and a clear indication of who the murderer is.I'm a 3.5 stars on this one.

"Show of hands from the writers out there.  Would you make a pact with the devil, or someone creepily like-but-not-exactly-the-devil to write a best seller?  Or even just to sell your book?  I suspect a number are timidly raising hands.That's what Philip Murdstone does.  Kind of.You see, he was once a successful YA author of thoughtful sensitive books about boys who are, to quote Minerva Cinch, his agent, ""inadequate.""  Philip made enough money writing what Minerva calls the ""Sensitive Dippy Boy genre"" that he was able to buy a rustic cottage in rustic Devon and pretty much hide from civilization.  Only now the books aren't selling, and Minerva can't get even a nibble on his latest work.  Philip needs a hit.  Soon.  And Minerva has a plan.  Philips needs to write a fantasy.  High fantasy.  Spelled with a p-h.  With magial swords and maps and wizards and deep meaning that no one understands.Philip panicks, as would any writer whose genre is definitely not fantasy (or phantasy). Minerva has a formula which she maps out for him, and sends Philip back to write some high phantasy.After getting drunk, Philip embarks on research.  Lots and lots of research.  It helps him not a whit. Until one night, after over-indulging on a new artisinal beer called Dark Entropy, he goes stumbling out into the bogs and meets the aforementioned kind-of-like-a-devil character, Pocket Wellfair, with whom Philip makes a Faustian pact.When Philip returns home and sits down to write, it's like the book is writing itself.  But keep in mind, he's just made a pact a somewhat unsavory character from another realm, and things are not going to go well.  And so it begins.Want a top ten list of things that are geat about THE MURDSTONE TRILOGY?  Easy.10.  Minerva's blueprint for writing high fantasy is hilarious, and probably spot-on.  If you read nothing else in the book, read that.9.  Mal Peet actually did write sensitive YA fiction.  This is his first book aimed at adults and, sadly, his last.  He died of cancer in 2015.  But there is a legacy of sensitive books once you finish this one.  It was Peet who said, ""Writing is a form of licensed madness.""8.  The book is funny.  And bizzare.  And bizzarely funny.  If you are not a LOL person, this just might make you LOL.7.  Peet takes square aim at the publsihing industry today: its greed, its insensitivity to the art of writing, its commercialsm and all that is wrong with it.6.  Character, character, character.  Philip is both schlemazel and schlemiel.  He is brilliant and an idiot. You probably wouldn't want to hang out with him in real life but that's okay; he wouldn't want to hang out with you either.5.  If you love puns, you'll enjoy the multitude of them.  If you don't, well... there's always the fine art of skimming a passage.4.  Faust was never this much fun.  This is a funny, if painful, romp through publishing, the world of phantasy, and misty legend places.3.  Like black comedy?  This is very black comedy.2.  Peet captures the character of the oh-so-elegant and oh-so-greedy literary agent with flair and humor.1.  The ending.  Enjoy the ride and wait for it... wait for it.It's phantastic.  ;-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0GLSP5XA48O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763681849#wasThisHelpful","R3B0GLSP5XA48O","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After gasping at the price of high-end cocktail cherries like LUXARDO and BADDA BINGS, I decided I would make my own.  And so I purchased the PREPWORKS CHERRY PITTER.  I lined up cherries and pitted them cleanly.  First I did them with no stems.  But then I thought about the prefect maraschino cherry and its stem (no, I have never tied a knot in one with random body parts), and left the stems on.

"Everyone has a target zone: a part of one's anatomy that reacts to stress, environmental factors, life.  Mine is skin.  I itch.  A lot.  Use the wrong detergent and itch.  Handle the wrong metals and itch.  Use a band-aid and itch.  Walk within a mile of a bug, be bitten, and itch.It was once explained to me by a medical professional that itching is borderline pain, and from someone who suffered from a 2-year run of hives, I can attest to the truth of that.  Itching is also time-consuming.

"Ryder Creed is an ex-combat  veteran with a past and a passion for search and rescue dogs.  He once (apparently) had a wild fling with FBI Agent Maggie O'Dell.  When Creed and his dog are called to the scene of horrific mudslides, one would think it was to do search and rescue work, finding survivors.  Unfortunately, it's because he owes a favor to the extremely unlikeable former commander Logan.  And Logan isn't at all interested in Creed doing anything humanitarian at the site.This, of course, doesn't stop Creed and his dog from doing some good work (and getting swept up in a mudslide, emerging with a concussion, a few broken ribs, and a pile of mud-caked lacerations) before Logan shows up and reveals his true purpose: he needs Creed to stop slacking and find what happened to a secret military lab that was chock full of all sorts of extremely creepy chemicals.To add to the mix, who should show up buy Maggie O'Dell, who has been sent by her current boyfriend.Meanwhile, back in Washington, hearings are going on re: testings done on children and civilians back in  the good old days of the cold war.Things only get more complicated from there.This was my first Alex Kava book and, while I wasn't totally mesmerized by the characters, with the exception of Creed and his dogs, I *was* totally mesmerized by the search and rescue elements of the book, its pacing, and it's slow reveal of the past.That being said, here are the Top Ten Things That Are Great About SILENT CREED.10.  Everything to do with the dogs is fascinating - how they are trained for search and rescue, their specialties. what they respond to, how they signal...  All of that makes for a great read.9.

I plan to stay very far away from cascading mud.8.  Creed's tough-love relationship with other veterans, struggling to live normal lives after dealing with PTSD.7.  While I didn't think Kava did much of a job on female characters, she can conjure up nasty scheming jerks beautifully.  There are characters you'll love to hate.6.  Kava captured the feel of rescue operations magnificently: the urgency, the danger, the despair, battling the elements...  You'll want to curl up somewhere warm and dry.5.  She also captured the ambience of those gyms and auditoriums where the locals get together to feed and warm and take care of those who have come to the rescue.4.  Creepy creepy creepy old military testing.3.  An homage to those who have been damaged by chemicals or war or being exposed to something no one should be exposed to, and their struggle for justice and medical care.2.  Some great heroic moments of triumph.1.  Did I mention the dogs?  The dogs are amazing.Go hug a dog and check out this book.

"Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box is a lovely little box of pampering.  You can shower with it and step out feeling like a goddess or god. Then you go clean the cat box, unclog the disposal, sort the recycling, and hunt down the funky smell in the refrigerator, still bathed in its aura.  It lathers beautifully, smells like a spring bouquet, and soaps you up nice and clean.But wait!  There's more!  Here are 101 Things You can do with your Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box.1.  Give the cool excelsior in your box to the birds for nesting material.  (It's the real deal and not the paper substitute where the colors run and suddenly the birds are bathing in purple water.)2.  Give the box to the magician in your family.  I guarantee said magician will come up with some nifty effect that absolutely needs that box.  Failing that, it's a cool sturdy little box for your collection of push pins, safety pins, buttons, paperclips, coupons... You get the idea.3.  Store the soap in a drawer with your undergarments.  According to my mother (whose word was not to be doubted under any circumstances), this gives the soap a chance to dry out, giving it a longer life, and scents the drawer nicely.  It also kicks the soap's scent down a notch since the smell is a bit strong straight out of the box.4.  It's the perfect gift for the soap-o-philes on your list.  You know who they are. The ones who can't pass a Lush store without going in ""just to see what's new.""5.  Drive nails with less risk of splitting the wood by first rubbing some of the soap on the nail shank.  Then your nail will smell nice, too!6.  Stretch those arthritic fingers.  The bar of soap is huge and grasping it gives the fingers a nice stretch.7.  Let your skin suck up that shea butter.  Shea butter is an excellent moisturizer and it has healing properties for your skin.8. Take a shower with the soap.  Or a bath.  Or wash your hands.

"What's scarier than a hit man? A hit man who hits hit men.  Though that's probably not what one lists under PROFESSION on a tax return.Michael Hendricks is former special ops, who lost his entire unit (except for his best friend Lester) in a mission gone bad.  He's officially declared dead.  His best (or sole surviving) friend, who can crack code and figure out anything, is confined to a wheelchair for life.  For these secret mission guys, there are no honorable discharges because what they did never happened.  Best friend buys a bar and tries to drink himself to death until Hendricks shows up.  Together the two come up with an original, if ironic, kind of business model where they figure out who's about to be hit... and, for a price, hit the hit man.  That is, unless the target is some unredeemable creep.  Then they take a pass.  As a result of his high rate of success, the mob wants Hendricks eliminated.Adding to his vulnerability (if it can be called that), Hendricks was in love with Evie, who thinks he's dead and is now married and pregnant.  But Hendricks still loves her and watches out for her and sends her money under some phony trust fund set-up.The mob calls in perhaps the creepiest of creepy hitmen -- a sadist named Engelmann, who is more than happy to take down Hendricks, and anyone else who happens to be in the way.  The fact that he's being paid one million Euros to do the deed is just icing on the cake.  He'd probably do it happily for the opportunity to torture a few people along the way.  (Did I mention he was creepy?)And then there are the Feds, who are also after Hendricks.Let me point out that I am not the target audience for this book.  It's far too violent for me (despite the fact that I apparently read all kinds of horrifyingly violent books).  But Holm has done a masterful job with his story so, with eyes occasionally shut, looking the other way, humming a happy hum to myself, I finished the book and present to you the Top Ten Things That Are Great About THE KILLING KIND10.  Do you love guns?  (I don't, but apparently Chris Holm does)  You'll meet all kinds of guns here and find out all sorts of things about them.9.  Do you love irony?  A hit man trying to hit a hit man? Figuring out if a hit man can be a good guy?  Irony and questions of morality abound.8.  Did you think code was just something that makes a web page look like it does?  Or makes Facebook work?  Or tells you how to get from A to B and avoid traffic?  It can also be used to designate hits.  Feel better now?7.  The loyalty of two men who served together is always touching... even if they spend their days picking out new targets to kill.6.  A nice glimpse of the town of Portland, Maine.  Don't worry; it's safe to go there now.5.  Scenes where hit men disguise themselves as tourists or cowboys or bumbling idiots are fun, and a nice respite from blood and gore.4.  If you're an FBI dude who is dismissive to female agents, watch out for karma.  Well, not karma exactly.  Maybe more like over-the-top just desserts.3.  You'll learn so many ways to hide, steal clothing, get wheels...  There's a whole primer of felonious behavior.2.  Pacing.  The story moves.  It races.  It careens toward the finish line.1.  A great MacGyver moment.If it's your scene, it's a roller coaster ride.  Great pacing.  Tons of suspense.If you're squeamish, there are other great books out there.I'm going to hum my happy hum some more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXWY7QF9PCGOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316259535#wasThisHelpful","RXWY7QF9PCGOG","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's the summer of 1972 in rural Peckinpaw, Kentucky, where couples sit on Liar's Bench as the world goes by.  In many ways, the town never emerged from 1860, when Fannie Crow, a slave who was a victim of rape and assorted cruelties, is found guilty of poisoning the mistress of the house and is summarily hanged.  Her son built a Liar's Bench from the remnant of the gallows where it sits, its dubious history perhaps contaminating everyone who sits upon it.Like Mudas Summers.  She has just turned 17.  Her mother, now is a relationship with a man who probably beats her and is the father of Muddy's baby sister, is found hanging in her house, and it's being ruled a suicide, which seems unlikely to Muddy.  Muddy lives with her father, the town attorney, who is a philanderer and definitely hiding something.  And before her mother's death, Muddy overheard some angry exchanges between her mother and one of her bosses.  Also, Muddy is in an interracial relationship.  In Kentucky.  In 1972.Against the backdrop of the terrifyingly present Klan, the last brutal years of the Vietnam War, and the town's racism, trusting basically no one, Muddy sets out to solve the mystery and uncover the secrets herself.Writer Kim Michele Richardson perhaps tries to cover too much.  LIAR'S BENCH is simultaneously a mystery, a coming-of-age story, a history lesson, a love story in a difficult and dangerous situation, a story of grief, a deeply troubling portrait of a rural southern town that almost feels like a foreign country, and a story of unraveling lies to find the truth.  And while it accomplishes all of these to a certain extent, the book loses its way deciding what it wants to be.Richardson writes stunning descriptions and portrays the angst and anguish of youth terrifyingly well.  But I had to wonder which book she was trying to write.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0L331UAWU4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161773733X#wasThisHelpful","R3K0L331UAWU4K","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the third of Julia Heaberlins books, BLACK-EYED SUSANS, Heaberlin continues to write a tale of a twisted past, not fully remembered, but always fully affecting the heroine.  Tessa Cartwright was a teenager when she was snatched by a psycho and left for dead in a pit with another dead girl (or two) and some bones, covered with black-eyed susans (which is a flower for the botanically non-inclined).  She was dubbed one of the Black-Eyed Susans.Tessa was returned to her home, traumatized, broken, scarred emotionally and physically, but to a loving (if eccentric) family.  Throughout her best (and also eccentric) friend Lydia stood by her.  Tessa went to therapy with a questionable doctor and was prepared to testify at the trial of the suspect.  He was found guilty and sentenced to death.It is Texas, after all.But Tessa is not convinced he is the killer, feels guilty that her testimony helped convict him, has spent the intervening years with little reminders, creepy gifts, and all kinds of nasty innuendo, and is struggling to do what is right while simultaneously being terrified.I couldnt put it down.This being said here are the top ten things that are great about BLACK-EYED SUSANS: A NOVEL OF SUSPENSE.10.  Heaberlin captures slices of Texas in each of her books -- the terrain, the people, the food, the families, the houses, the feel that you're someplace else.9.  Though Heaberlin writes female characters that have been traumatized, victimized, and terrorized, she captures their strength, which gives strength to others.  There's always the unspoken message that, despite everything, we have strength within us.8.  She has a sense of humor.  Sure, horrible things have happened.  But life, in so many ways, is funny.  There are amusing things to observe.  Without laughter, we have darkness.7.  Character, character, character. Heaberlin write great characters.  There's the eccentric grandfather, building a house filled with surprises to delight and entertain and pose mystery.  There's the aging neighbor lady, slowly losing it, good of heart, in pursuit of her lost diggers.  There's Tessa's teenaged daughter, simultaneously belligerent and loving, filled with bravery and frightened like a small child.  And of course, there's Tessa, facing her demons.6.  Tessa's best friend Lydia, who vanished once the trial was over, never to surface again, is a fabulous portrait of the teen obsessed with the dark and morbid, collecting bits of horrifying daa, cataloguing Jack the Ripper's conquests, a font of information about skeletal remains and a collector of everything creepy.  She's a mystery within the mystery.  Our own little Wednesday Addams.5.  Building an emotional arc.  The characters grow, engage, have epiphanies, and evolve from there.4.  A realistic mother-daughter relationship.  If you've been there, you know.  It's not all love and harmony.  It's not all ""I hate you"" and slammed doors.  There's a lot in between and Heaberlin has captured that masterfully.3.  Suspense.  Holy cow.  Fasten your seatbelts.  Heaberlin builds and builds suspense, gives you a small break to get your heart rate back to normal, and goes right back to building suspense.2.  I love a story with a totally twisted back-story.  This one has it.1.  Heaberlin can write.  She turns a beautiful phrase, writes dialogue that rings true, mixes just the right amount of description in with the action, and takes you on a roller coaster read.I can't wait for her next book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PG8EFUCYX3F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804177996#wasThisHelpful","R1PG8EFUCYX3F6","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"KILL AGAIN is the second of the Dr. Claire Waters books, written by the Neal Baer and Jonathan Greene, former executive producers of NBCs Law & Order.  It suffers from screenplay-itis.Claire has just returned to work after her traumas in the first book  (KILL SWITCH).  She has a new apartment, is back at work, is helping teach while she pursues her forensic psychiatric fellowship , and seeing patients, who include Rosa Sanchez, a young mother who has had a spectacular string of bad luck which is about to get worse.  After their session Claire sees Rosa walking down the street, where she is arrested by a uniformed member of the NYPD.  Claire makes frantic calls to all her contacts in the police department and the probation department (all of whom take her call with nary a quibble), but no one knows what happened to Rosa.  So she enlists the aid of deskbound homicide detective Nick Lawler, who is suffering from increasing blindness due to retinitis pigmentosa and is no longer allowed to carry a gun or drive or participate in active investigations.The two of them, of course, jump right in, investigating, playing with guns, driving, and doing just about everything they were forbidden to do.  And, with zero attention to protocol or safety, they manage to make some grisly discoveries.  Meanwhile, the entire police department is falling all over itself with adoration for Clairea.  Sound unrealistic?Fasten your seatbelts.  Because from there, with every chapter, it grows exponentially unrealistic, complete with faux psychology, bizarre ritualistic killings, car chases, kidnapping, and a spectacularly unrealistic love story.  In addition, there are numerous references to all the traumas of the past, over and over and over... as if this were a TV show and the viewers, who had perhaps missed the first 20 episodes, needed to be told again.  Unfortunately, a reader is far better tuned in to this and being told the same bits and pieces repeatedly grows old.The only area where the book does not suffer is in terms of pacing, which is clearly a skill the writers learned in their years of television.You won't need to read the first book because most of it is revealed here.  And if you're like me, you won't want to read the next book because that will contain numerous explanations of everything that happened in this one.The best parts were little cool nuggets of science.  The worst?  See above.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22DII35NBBQAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758266871#wasThisHelpful","R22DII35NBBQAB","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave these to my husband to try out, and here's what he had to say:I'm a weekend bass player who plays a long scale Fender Jazz Bass.  I've been playing flat wound strings for a number of years to reduce string noise.  The Elixir Nano Web strings are round wound, but the coating keeps string squeak to a minimum.  As one would expect, these round wounds have a brighter tone than the flats I've been playing.  The Elixirs also have great sustain and stay in tune well.

"Because of cats and squirrels, I hang my bird feeders two stories up, away from branches suitable for mammalian leaping.  And for that reason, and my abundant supply of bird seed, I have a robust population of birds visiting (and emptying) my hanging squirrel-proof bird feeder on a daily basis and my nyger-filled feeder during goldfinch season.I fill the first feeder with no-mess wild bird seed, which they adore, and which contains a minimal amount of sunflower seeds.  So I was happy to add this to the birdie buffet.  Filling it is simple.  The top unscrews easily, and re-seats easily.  I poured sunflower seeds up to the top, closed it, and hung it by the other feeders.  Then I watched and waited.  And watched and waited.  And watched and waited.During this waiting period, I did note that the lack of little perches makes it a bit challenging for feeding purposes, and the mushroom top roof makes access a little tougher.  Then I watched and waited some more.  The birds were decidedly uninterested.On the other hand, they weren't exactly desperate.  The other feeders hung nearby, enticingly easy to access, making them a house finch buffet.  And maybe they were suspicious of this new thing which (I'm guessing) does not look like an enticing mushroom to them.  Or maybe they were waiting for a garden gnome to show up.Finally, when the main feeder was down to a few morsels, they started analyzing the Mushroom feeder.  You know the look.  Head cocked, one-eyeing it, making birdie calculations.  And eventually, when they saw I was not running out to work the pulley and refill their beloved feeder, they gave it a try.  And they liked it.  Plus the roof was a nice place to sit.  And poop.  But hey, that's what birds do.  (No pun intended.)I would recommend this as a good supplemental feeder.  Because of the size of the mesh, about the only thing you can put in it is sunflower seeds are shelled peanuts.  But it works well for those.I'll let you know if it starts attracting garden gnomes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MMKQS58H0BEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JG02V84#wasThisHelpful","R3MMKQS58H0BEG","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My prior experience with Hill's dog food was with various forms of Hill's Prescription Diet, which is dog food that looks pretty much the same going in as coming out.  And Prescription Diet was the kind of food the dog needed to be coaxed to eat.  (Option 1: Grate fresh Parmesan on top and say ""Oh, look!  Tonight we're having Italian!""; Option #2: put it in cat food cans and say ""Oh, look!  Tonight we're having a small plate dinner!).So I was thrilled when I opened the can and discovered food that looked like food.  I was further thrilled that, instead of having to coax the food out of the can with forks, knives, spoons, a rubber spatula, and blasting caps, it virtually glided out of the can and into the dish.  And I was especially thrilled when Esmeralda, all 70 pounds of her, did her excited up-on-her-hind-legs doggie dance as soon as she got a whiff of it.  She adored all the flavors: braised salmon, shredded beef, and simmered chicken.I was less thrilled when I started investigating the ingredients, which I should have done before I fed it to the dog.For example, the first ingredient is chicken broth, which isn't particularly nutritious though it is probably the ingredient that makes the food slide out of the can.  Second ingredient is chicken.  Points for that.  Third ingredient is pork liver - an organ meat that should be rich in protein.  (Good thing Esmeralda doesn't keep kosher.)These are followed by carrots (good nutrients), potatoes (Carb-y and not high in nutrients), green peas (good source of fiber/bad source of protein), rice starch (thickening, no real nutritional value), rice (what kind?  brown? white?  need more info), spinach (good nutrients), powdered cellulose...Wait.  Powdered cellulose?  According to Dog Food Adviser, powdered cellulose is ""a non-digestible plant fiber usually made from the by-products of vegetable processing. Except for the usual benefits of fiber, powdered cellulose provides no nutritional value to a dog.""  And if it's non-digestible, what is it doing in dog food?Further calculations, according to Dog Food Adviser, indicate an average protein content of 23% and a mean fat level of 18%, giving it a carbohydrate content of 51% and a fat-to-protein ratio of about 81%.Which adds up to below-average protein, below-average fat, and above-average carbs despite broadcasting that it is gluten-free.So, although Esmeralda adored this food, I  will continue my quest for the perfect canned food (and my weekly ritual of making her special gluten-free high-in-protein dog soup).","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YS8WQ53NMP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH3MNEW#wasThisHelpful","R29YS8WQ53NMP8","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan is at it again.  Kathy Reich's latest book starts off in its usual intriguing opening - a recording of a girl imprisoned, frightened, in danger.  It's brought to her by ""Lucky"" Strike, a self-appointed cyber-sleuth on the trail of a girl who no one ever declared as missing.  Lucky wants Tempe's help to find the remains of young Cora Teague, daughter of religious fanatics, who has not been seen or heard from for 3-1/2 years.  How can Tempe resist?  She wades right in.Meanwhile, her on-again-off-again relationship with Montreal Police Detective Andrew Ryan is on again... or is it.  In earlier books in the now-18 book series, Ryan went hermit after the death of his daughter, re-emerged to help Tempe solve a case, and finally proposed... only now Tempe is having second (and third) thoughts about the wisdom of such as move.Meanwhile daughter Katy is still off in Afghanistan, Mama is still in her high-end asylum refusing chemo, and cat Birdie is still sharing Tempe's meals.If you've never read the series, you could start here and, if you like it, go back to the beginning because there are major character arcs for everyone.  But for the main part, I suspect this is a book for the fans and followers of Dr. Temperance Brennan.Why have I read all 18?  Top ten reasons:10.  Tempe has a sense of humor.  No matter how dark the subject matter, she brings wit, whimsy and insight to any situation.  I used to read all the Patricia Cornwall books, too, but at a certain point I had to stop because medical examiner Kay Scarpetta was always angry, humorless, and no fun to read.  Tempe, even at her worst, is a burst of sunshine in the midst of forensics.9.  The Ryan-Tempe relationship.  On again, off again, hot pants, cold feet... Come on, you two!  Let's get this party started!8.  Lots of cool cool science.  Kathy Reichs infuses each book with lots and lots of intriguing forensics.  And, while I doubt I'll ever use it, I like knowing stuff, and there's lots here to know.7.  An always astounding collection of nuts jobs, psychotics, religious fanatics...  Your crazy neighbor won't look so crazy any more.6.  Cliffhanger, cliffhanger, cliffhanger... Pretty much each chapter ends with a cliffhanger and, while it's really just Reich's writing device and doesn't always pay off, it makes for a fast-paced read.5.  Tempe always has a snappy retort for anything.  Usually she keeps thm to herself and we simply enjoy her inner dialog.  Other times she'll hit someone with a well-deserved zinger.4.  Location, location, location.  This one takes place in North Carolina.  Some take place in Montreal and across Canada.  You'll always get lots of local description and a feel for the locale.3.  A new handsome character.  To solve this puzzle, Tempe works with handsome down-to-earth Deputy Zeb Ramsey.  Where might this be going?2.  Impeccable medical research.  You can learn about all sorts of disorders you'll never want to have.1.  A smart female character who can take care of herself (despite her occasional tendency toward hot-dogging).So what happened to Cora Teague?  What's up with these web-sleuthers?  Who can be trusted?

"I don't usually read short stories.  I get involved with the characters and then it's over.  But when I saw that BLACK GLASS was a work from Karen Joy Fowler, I put my short story prejudices on the shelf and dived in.  Why?  Because Fowler is an amazing, witty, insightful, cynical, diverse writer.  I have never read subject matter she has written that didn't suck me in.  Her stories here span centuries, continents, diverse people, and more.What makes this book a must-read?  Here are the Top Ten Things That Are Great About BLACK GLASS.10.  Fowler is crazy smart.  She attacks a multitude of subject matters: the Lone Ranger from Tonto's point of view, a DEA Agent who may have licked one toad too many, Einstein's letters from Mileva, Berkeley days in the early 70s... And to each situation she brings insights and understanding.9.  Impeccable research.  If Fowler writes about unicorn horn, you know she's read everything she can find on the subject.  Carry Nation?  Researched every moment of the woman's life.  Hara Castle?  Prepare to be enlightened.8.  Descriptions.  Fowler can create a picture in your mind with a minimum of words. ""'Have some of mine,' Ruiz said.  He was drinking a margarita. He handed the glass to Harris.  Harris tuned the glass to a virginal part of the salt rim and sipped.  He rotated the glass and sipped again.""7.  Diversity of subject matter.  In her novels, Fowler has written about Jane Austen, growing up as the human sister of a chimp, a Chinese railway worker, women's baseball...  Now we see through Fowler's window to Einstein's early love, an abducted cartographer in the Amazon, Vietnam war protests... It's a time travel, world travel adventure.6.  She writes with humor, with tragedy, with longing...  There is much emotion to be experienced reading the pages.5.  She has captured Berkeley at the time of the Cambodian invasion perfectly.  How?  She was there.  How do I know?  I was there, too. I read ""Letters from Home"" and was struck with the same sense of tragedy I felt then.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I could smell the tear gas.4.  Kids breaking into a mysterious neighbor's basement to find his secret stash?  Tonto at 40?  A note in a bottle, read 20 years later?  What's not to like?!3.  You'll have to think.  Not every story will make sense right away.  Ponder and find Fowler's meaning... or your meaning.2.  Fowler is clearly a student/devotee of myth and mythology.  She weaves it beautifully through her stories.1.  Sentences like this: ""She regretted every tree she had never climbed.""Go climb a tree and read the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O6N7GJ7LME9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399175792#wasThisHelpful","R1O6N7GJ7LME9A","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should preface this review by pointing out that Esmeralda is the world's shyest least aggressive dog.  She is 55 pounds of quivering insecurities.  But she loves her toys.  She loves her toys so much, in fact, that she still has every single stuffed squeakie toy she has ever owned.  She never rips the stuffing out.  She never tears them apart in quest of the squeakie.  She carries them around and offers them to visitors... as long as they don't try to rip them apart.So I figured the CHUCKIT CHUCKIT!

She retreated to her safe corner for a nap.I figured she would get used to it.  It's a toy!  It squeaks!  It bounces!  It's a great ball!  What's not to like?!The ball sat where I had placed it.

(And as long as we're on the subject of cheaply manufactured Cuisinart parts, I had previously replaced the pusher mechanism),  It did not fit, and I returned it, thinking must have foolishly ordered the wrong part and maybe I should just pick up the phone and ask next time.I then contacted Cuisinart to find out what the correct part would be.  I gave them the serial number, model number, number etched in the bowl, and any other number I could find.  I spent a LONG time on the phone with them.They sent me the ""correct"" cover for my model.  Yep.  The same as this one.  And, big surprise, it did not fit.So I hunkered in for another half hour call and called them again, giving them the serial number, model number, number etched in the bowl, and any other number I could find.Turns out they sent the correct part.  But since my machine was ""old"" (as in more than a year old), the bowl had changed, and I would now need to order a new bowl.  For $75.  They did waive the shipping fee since the first agent had not actually mentioned this to me.It finally arrived, and my Cuisinart is functional once again.  Cost of replacement parts?  $124.25.Cost of Cuisinart new?  $139.00.Time spent on the phone?

"Eileen exists in a dark dark ugly world.  She lives with her father, an ex-cop, who not only has alcoholic dementia and the accompanying paranoia, but a mean streak the size of Massachusetts.  He hates her.  She hates him, and fantasizes about killing him, or having an icicle split him in two, or, at the very least, coming home and finding him dead.  Her mother, who was possibly equally despicable, died and Eileen takes care of her father... if taking care of him means driving to the store in her exhaust-fume-filled-car to buy him liquor, or eating peanuts or a dried up sandwich in the kitchen with him or locking his shoes in the trunk of her car so he can't go out in the snow and shoot at people.She is in her early twenties and works at the local boy's prison/juvenile detention facility, as an admin who hates both women she works with.  In fact, Eileen hates just about everybody, including herself.  It appears she has never had a friend.She is obsessed with bodily functions, noxious smells, and stalking one of the prison guards.  She also likes to steal.Then one day a new employee comes to the prison, a beautiful well-dressed woman, a Harvard grad named Rebecca.  Eileen is ready to hate Rebecca, too but Rebecca befriends Eileen, makes her a confidante, a drinking buddy, a girlfriend, a BFF.  And Eileen falls for it.  Which leads, ultimately, to the day that changes everything... which is why the story can be told from the perspective of older wiser happier loved Eileen.  Which is fortunate, because is she was going to live her whole life the ways she lives it for the first 222 pages, Otessa Moshfegh would be responsible for hundreds of readers opening a vein.While it is a compelling story, with a twist I never saw coming, it is probably not good reading material for someone in danger of slipping into a depression.Moshfegh is an excellent writer, and so here are the Top Ten Things That Are Great About EILEEN.10.  It's very difficult to write descriptions of smells.  Moshfegh does it brilliantly.  You'll be opening your windows and gasping for fresh air.9.  Ever fear alcoholic dementia?  Watch Eileen's father and be afraid.  Be very afraid.8.  Sometimes a writer captures cold weather so well, you need to bundle up.7.  Moshfegh describes dirt and grunge so well you'll want to scrub your kitchen and feel good about it.6.  Look in Wikipedia under dysfunctional and you might find a picture of Eileen and her family.  Moshfegh has created a family so dysfunctional it might make your own encounters looks pleasant.5.  It is reassuring to believe that someone with such horrible beginnings can end up happy.  Yes, I know it's fiction.  But I'd like to believe that.4.  A good lesson: Beware of beautiful strangers who suddenly want to become your best friend for no apparent reason.3.  One of the best/worst testimonies/explanations of a mother who stood by while her child was abused.2.  You can walk away and say THIS IS NOT MY LIFE.1.  The twist.

"This nifty tool - the ARKON MAGNETIC PHONE MOUNT - came at a perfect time in my life.  You see, I have no sense of direction and my car's GPS, a mere 10 years old - suffers from GPS Alzheimer's.  In the old days she would merely give slightly cockeyed directions, like turning onto a street that was a flight of stairs.  But now she is confused all the time.  ""Turn right.  Please make a legal U turn.  Please make a legal U turn. Turn right.  Please make a legal U turn. Please make a legal U turn.""  When there are tall buildings, she is completely disoriented.Then I tried out the Google Maps App.  It was wonderful, and I retired my GPS to hospice care.  But it burned through a battery faster than my old GPS could say ""Please make a legal U turn.""  Plus it was sitting in the cup holder of my car, which kind of muffled Ms. Google Map's voice.Enter the ARKON MAGNETIC PHONE MOUNT.  At first I worried that it would stick on my pebbly dash, but it sent on perfectly, proudly displaying my iPhone 4S, with the car charger dangling from her dainty posterior into the cigarette lighter.  Then I lost my iPhone 4S (the GPS isn't the only forgetful thing in my car) and I became the proud owner of the iPhone 6 Plus... which is a big honkin' phone.  Could the phone mount hold it?  Indeed it could.  I stuck the smaller round magnetic disk on the back of the case (yeah, I know, but I couldn't get the Otter Box off), and stuck it right on the phone mount.And away we drove, monitoring traffic, finding new exciting ways that actually worked.Google Maps with the Arkon Magnetic Phone Mount are my new best friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GW4XJ25EEYDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZHIERG#wasThisHelpful","R1GW4XJ25EEYDX","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been a fan of Nutro cat food and, while I don't feed it to all my cats every day (because I have too many cats and it's too expensive), I have used it to help heal a cat who was wasting away, and to tempt non-eaters.  Nutro seems to have its finger (or paw) on the pulse of feline taste, because I have never found a Nutro cat food that the cats didn't like, and I have pretty much tried them all (to keep myself amused).I think Breakfast Scrambles are a fun idea, despite the fact that my cats eat one meal in the morning.  You can call it breakfast if you like.  It's their protein-packed repast for the day.  And Breakfast Scrambles are protein-packed, with real egg and chicken and salmon.  The cats gave it a look -- it was something different -- but they all ate their portions with kitty delight.There's just one problem.  It's sticky.  Really, really sticky.If you do the canned cat food ritual, you know how you pull the lid off and then try to scrap the lid against the edge of the can to get all the food off the lid.  This one doesn't scrape off well at all.Next, with your utensil of choice, you scoop as much cat food as you possibly can out of the can and into the dish.  There is no utensil that works with this  A lot remains stuck to the inside of the can.  You can scrape and fork and spoon and pick at it but it's pretty much stuck.Usually the dog is my back-up with the cans.  When I've scaped them out into the cat dishes, the dog help lick out the cans so they can go into the recycling without a layer of kitty pt.  Only the dog couldn't get it all out either.  She licked and turned and chased those cans all over the deck and still couldn't get all the food out.Five stars?  The cats loved it.

"Layla Beck is the spoiled daughter of a senator, living in luxury as the Great Depression drags on.  When she refuses to marry a wealthy suitor, her father cuts her off and gets her a job with the WPA, which Layla sees as the ultimate humiliation.  Worse, she must go to very rural Macedonia, West Virginia, where she is to write the town's history.  She has no desire to be in West Virginia, much less to be living among people she feels are beneath her, and writing their history.  But she must.She ends up as a boarder at the home of the Romeyns, who were once a great family in Macedonia.  Jottie and Felix's father ran the mill and was regarded with great respect.  Now Jottie runs the house and raises Felix's two daughters, Willa and Bird.  Assorted aunts live there on and off, and sometimes Felix lives there as well.  And so do secrets.  A whole lot of secrets.Twelve-year old Willa is determined to snoop and learn the long-hidden truth.  Layla is determined to prove herself and live happily ever after with Felix.  And Jottie keeps on keepin' on, happiness having eluded her years ago when the secrets were carefully hidden.What a tangled web of secrets it is.  Annie Barrows, who first captured my interest with THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY has written another book full of history and character and tragedy and love and loss.  Once I started reading, I desperately needed to know all the hidden secrets, too.That being said, here are the Top Ten Things That Are Great About THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO US.10.  Annie Barrows can really write.  GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY was done in the form of letters -- the epistolary style that created some of the first novels.  In THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO US, she uses letters, as well, though they are inter-woven with Willa's narrative and other points of view.  The voices work well with each other, creating a complex layering that is beautifully done.9.  History.  As Layla write her history of the 150-year old town, she discovers that history has many faces.  And woven in with that is history in the mid 30s, the Depression trudging on, the labor unions working for fair wages, Prohibition, and many of its facets.8.  The book transports you to another time and place.  You feel the pace of Southern life, the conversations on the porch drinking sweating glasses of sweet tea, trying to get through the heat of summer.  You experience the things kids were able to do then, running loose, throwing fruit at each other.  It's literary time travel.7.  The library.  When I was a kid, the library was the best place ever.  You could hide out among the shelves and lose yourself in other worlds, and then haul a stack of books home, reading all the way, and escape whatever you needed to escape.  That's what the library is in the book.6.  Character, character, character.  There's daring dashing sneaky Felix, wise-for-her-years Willa, ever-patient, ever-longing Jottie, ever-evolving Layla.  Barrows writes great characters.5.  Not only does Barrows write great characters; when they speak it sounds natural, and it sounds like they would sound.4.  The characters grow and learn and evolve and become better or reap just desserts for their deeds.  There are epiphanies.  No one remains stagnant.3.  The book is full of little side stories, like life.  As Layla interviews various townspeople or Jottie tells her stories, we hear all sorts of intriguing little tales that don't move the story forward, but give us context and enrichment and a great deal of vicarious amusement.2.  It's a Coming of Age story that's actually interesting.1.  What really happened in the mill that night?  I absolutely had to know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W1994AX4U9H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385342942#wasThisHelpful","R3W1994AX4U9H9","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One fine evening, on the UC Santa Cruz campus, back in 1993, roommates Anna Fury and Kate Smirnoff are stumbling home from a party when they find a woman passed out by a willow tree: George Leoni.  Kate thinks she recognizes her from her Biology class, so they try to shake her awake.  George turns out to be a lot heavier than she looks.  They load her in a shopping cart and take her home.Thus begins a lifelong friendship... with requisite hiccups, bumps, disasters, tragedies, camping trips, children, and all that a lifelong friendship of women entails.The story is told from various perspectives.There's Kate Smirnoff (""like the vodka""), raised by her grandfather, ready to take over his diner when the time comes, never plans to leave Santa Cruz... or her apartment.Anna Fury is the rich kid with the wildly dysfunctional mother.  She's brilliant, she's angry, and she has an addictive personality that triggers events for the three women.And tree-hugger George, always up for a camping trip under the stars, who can start a fire faster than anyone, gives it all up for a succession of dreadful husbands.The story hops around, from character to character, from year to year, from place to place.  Santa Cruz 1993.  Lincoln Nebraska 2005.  Boston 2002. St. Louis 1999. It's a bit like assembling a puzzle, piecing it all together to find the inciting incidents that hold the women together and drive them apart and back together.Lisa Lutz writes with a natural ear for dialog, a finely tuned sense of the absurd, and an acute understanding of the unique personalities she portrays in the three friends.  And while, during the book, you may find yourself confusing which is Kate and which is Anna and which is George, eventually you'll see an artistic uniqueness to each.A fascinating involving book filled with humor and compassion and quirky moments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKPQZHRTATNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544411633#wasThisHelpful","R2QKPQZHRTATNN","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those who follow my reviews know that I like a little (okay, a lot) of rit in my reading material.  Add to that the fact that this books was tucked into the category of Christian Books and Bibles.  I never would have found it except that I saw that Sharyn McCrumb is the author.  I have enjoyed many McCrumb mysteries, with her finely woven its of history and folklore of Tennessee.  And so I chose the book, and I am so happy I did.NORA BONESTEEL'S CHRISTMAS PAST brings back a beloved character, Nora Bonesteel, who has the sight.  It also brings back good-guy Sheriff Spencer Atwood and his cynical deputy Joe LeDonne, who have been in excellent McCrumb stories of their own.Miss Bonesteel's story brings her back to the old Honeycutt house, filled with memories of her childhood, and now inhabited by a retiring Florida couple who realize, when their fake Christmas tree is smashed to pieces, that their house is haunted.The Sheriff and his deputy, meanwhile, are driving down the backroads to arrest someone who dented a Senator's Mercedes.  The snow is coming in, darkness is about to fall, and it's Christmas Eve.Both stories have sweetness and humor, history and tradition, woven through them.The book is a feel-good Christmas tale right up there with Truman Capote's A CHRISTMAS MEMORY or O'Henry's GIFT OF THE MAGI - stories about humans and their foibles at a certain time of year.To list it under Christian Books and Bibles does the book a disservice. It's a gentle book for everyone and anyone who needs a sentimental smile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25ZPRMM9VTB8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426754213#wasThisHelpful","R25ZPRMM9VTB8G","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meet the Burroughs clan.  They are meaner than snakes.  They have run Bull Mountain for generations, destroying anything that blocked their path.  First they ran moonshine, then marijuana, and ultimately crystal meth.  If they don't like you, if they think you've taken advantage of them, if you cross them, they will beat you or burn you up or kill you in equally unappetizing ways.The clan has come down to three brothers, then two.  One is the King of the Mountain, so to speak.  The other is a lawman, a Burroughs gone straight.  The question is: which one will survive?Brian Panowich's BULL MOUNTAIN is a dark action-packed deeply twisted tale, fast paced, unrelenting in emotion, violence, meanness, and one of the most dysfunctional family dynamics imaginable.Panowich tells the story in scenes from time, from the point of view of different characters.  And while this definitely builds tension and understanding of all that went before without reading through a long Bull Mountain history, it can be confusing.Chapter 1: Rye Burroughs, father of the brothers, with brother Cooper in 1949Chapter 2 & 3: Clayton Burroughs, the lawman brother, in 2015Chapter 4: Katie Burroughs, Clayton's wife, 2015Chapter 5: Halford (dead brother) and Clayton Burroughs in 1985Chapter 6: Simon Holly, Federal Agent with a twisted plan in 2015Chapter 7: Cooper Burroughs (Rye's brother) in 1950Chapter 8: Gareth Burroughs (Cooper's son) in 1958Chapter 9: Annette Henson Burroughs, who marries Rye, in 1961Chapter 10: Gareth again, in 1973You get my drift.  It's all over the place and you might want to make an Excel spreadsheet to keep it all straight before it gets REALLY complicated.Because it does.Panowich, amazingly, miraculously, pulls it all together, weaves all the threads, adds knots and tangles and twists and turns and, like a magician, makes it all make sense at the end... in a twisted kind of way.Not for the faint of heart, but a relentlessly action-packed page-turner.And in case you were wondering what a sage grouse is, I've attached a photo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PT5A3IYVUWWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039917396X#wasThisHelpful","R3PT5A3IYVUWWK","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes in life, when everything is going fine, suddenly an anvil falls from the sky and changes everything.  That's what happened to the Dupont Family.  Enroute to parent teacher conferences, the kids safely belted into the car, the signal green, Robert and Sylvie drive their car across the covered bridge and have a head-on collision.  The car goes into the water.  Seven year old Jess dies.  Robert is physically crippled, confined to a wheelchair.  Sylvie is emotionally crippled, unable to leave the house or function.  And 9-year old Ruby gets to be the adult, the one who copes and tries to keep everyone else on track.The story flashes forward 2 years.  Robert has moved in with his brother, and Ruby stays with them because Sylvie is no longer capable of caring for herself, much less her daughter.  A storm is coming in, Robert and his brother need to leave the state to assist another brother, and Ruby must stay with her mother.Add to the mix a penniless mute pregnant teenager with mysterious roots to the town, stumbling back ""home,"" ready to deliver her baby, and Ruby's best friend who suddenly abandons her just before they are to complete a vastly important bridge project that they are to research and design.Let's just say Ruby, who already thought she'd had the worst day of her life, is having days that rival it.All that being said, here are the top ten things that are great about T. Greenwood's THE FOREVER BRIDGE.10.  It is beautifully written.  Greenwood delivers sumptuous descriptions, hair-raising tension, and complex characters.  She ties all the book's threads together seamlessly... and there are many to tie together.9.  Character, character, character.  Each character is unique, shaped by the tragic events in different ways, coping in different ways.  The snotty friend is drawn to a T, the pregnant teenager struggling to survive reveals convincing panic, the mother's fears are almost visible.8.  Bridges.  Did you ever want to learn about bridges?  No?  Well, you'll learn a lot about them hear and share some of Ruby's wonder and obsession with them.7.  Tender memories of the brother who died.  Because little brother can be a pain, and Ruby's was, but she is able to summon little moments that hold his image together in her mind.6.  There's a family of baby raccoons living on the porch.  This is clearly not a family of animal-lovers, but the raccoons capture the fragility of life and Ruby, while struggling to cope with everything else, manages to take time to deal with that.5.  The kindness of strangers.  Here's a family who once was a vital part of the community, and now is a shattered version of themselves.  Yet there are old friends and passing acquaintances who still take the time to try to help.4.  The power of the river.  It swept away Jess years before.  The storm comes and we are reminded of what a formidable foe a river can be.3.  Have you ever read a book and found is so layered with perceptions and emotions and thought that you wonder how the writer could possibly have any thoughts left for another book?  This one is like that, and T. Greenwood has 8 previous novels.2.  Where does one go from the moment the anvil drops?  Here is one scenario and it reminds of of the fragility of life and survival.1.  Mysterious threads that will keep you wondering until the end.I loved the book and book and am thrilled to have found an author who has 8 previous novels, and clearly has more in her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNLYK33FVC7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758290535#wasThisHelpful","RYNLYK33FVC7X","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The 12 Pack CERTIFIED ORGANIC HERB SEEDS offer a wonderful selection of possibilities.  These created a beautifully trailing thyme and a robust basil.  The real Jack-and-the-Beanstalk-Winner is the dill, which (in Southern California) doesn't do well at all.  But with these seeds and the Aero Garden, we've made abundant supplies of it.

I really wanted to love it.I love that is is sourced in the US.I love that The Honest Kitchen actually sought (and obtained) FDA approval as human-grade foods for dogs.I love the fact that the beef is hormone-free meat.I love the fact that it contains ""no red flag pet food ingredients like corn, soy, rice, beet pulp or wheat.""I love the fact that it is easy to increase or decrease the amount fed, with no stinking half-can sitting in the refrigerator.So why did VERVE lose a star?Sigh...I have always raised large-breed dogs, and have never had a problem with them being finicky eaters.

I finally got her to eat it by scooping it into cat food cans.I hoped Day 3 was a fluke.It wasn't.Day 4 rolled around.  No doggie dance.  And she wouldn't touch it until I again slopped it into cat food cans.And there's my sad tale of the perfect food.  It's perfect except Esmeralda won't eat it.

"I find it interesting that all the negative reviews about PURINA PRO PLAN DRY CAT FOOD have logged unhelpfuls.  And looking at them, all the reviews state useful information.  So who is finding them unhelpful?  Purina elves?  I'm just saying...I like the fact that PURINA PRO PLAN DRY CAT FOOD's formula is 45% protein.  I have yet to see a cat stalking broccoli in the wild.  Cats are carnivores.  So I like that the fact that the first ingredient listed is turkey.  I like the fact PRO PLAN is formulated without corn or wheat.What I don't like is that the third and fifth ingredients are soy protein isolate and soy protein concentrate.  According to Dr. Karen Becker, a proactive and integrative wellness veterinarian:""Soy is a plant protein used by pet food companies to boost protein content and add bulk. Because plant proteins are less expensive than meat proteins, pet food manufacturers use them to increase profit margins...The majority of experts on pet nutrition agree soy isn't good nutrition for cats or dogs. It is considered a low-quality, incomplete protein well known to create food allergies in pets......The carbohydrate action of soy can cause a rise in blood sugar in many cats. Soy is also linked to thyroid damage, and since hyperthyroidism is common in kitties, this is yet another reason it should not be part of a feline's diet.The ingestion of soybean products is also linked to seizures in both dogs and cats.""Not good.And the last thing I'm not liking is that Purina is not assuring me that all the ingredients are sourced in the US.  It says it is manufactured at Purina-Owned US Facilities.  But given all of the pet food disasters with China-sourced ingredients, I need an assurance of sourcing before I can trust them.Still searching for a cat food I trust.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QSUBTEJN5NQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVMMK7Q#wasThisHelpful","R2QSUBTEJN5NQQ","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Giovanni Bernini has a unique talent... or character flaw.  He watches a person and then perfectly mimics them.  This gets him into no end of trouble, in school, in life, in love, in entertainment, in politics...  Jacob Rubin has created a character the likes of which I have not encountered in literature before.It's been described by a number of readers as hilarious.  It's more funny than hilarious, and not funny in the ha-ha way.The pacing is a bit slow but the insights offer perfect payoffs when they occur... which is often.It's well-written, it's thoughtful,it's unique, it has spectacular descriptions of various people Giovanni meets... but it has a tendency to drag, and for that I deduct one star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P95PIZLTBY81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016764#wasThisHelpful","R3P95PIZLTBY81","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the first sentence of Chapter 1, one of the characters describes the heroine, Maxine, of being a ""tenacious b*&^#.""Author Allison Brennan spends the next 372 pages proving it.Maxine Revere is a noted writer and high-powered investigative reporter who specializes in missing persons cases, using any and all techniques possible.  That means that, with her assistant and bodyguard an producer and ex-lovers and current lovers and people to whom she has ""brought closure"" in the past, she will determinedly undermine the district attorney's case against a murderer, steal information from a medical facility, lie and cheat to find out what she wants to find out.  She gets away with it because she is the sexiest, hottest, smartest, saintliest, most instinctive, mind-reading brilliant student of the human mind who ever walked the earth.In COMPULSION, Adam Bachman is on trial for murder.  He was caught with a drugged and bound woman in the trunk of his car, the modus operandi matching that of a number of unsolved murders.  Right before his trial, Max is allowed to interview him.  Max is convinced that Adam did not act alone, that he had a partner, and that they were responsible for the murder/disappearance of an older couple whose case remains unsolved.  All Adam says is ""You'll never find them.""So off Max goes, to prove her theory and find the missing couple.Anything she does, she justifies with her maxim that those left behind need truth and closure.This goes on for 171 pages, during which enough of Max's back-story and former liaisons are revealed that you'll never have to read any of the Max Revere books that preceded this one.Finally, on page 171, something happens so you don't have to watch the b*&^#-on-wheels act for a while.I, for one, was relieved.A thoroughly unlikeable character in an implausible story-line that throws in a new character whenever the plot stalls.If you're behind on your reading, you might want to give this one a pass.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1060TKDVHLYCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250035023#wasThisHelpful","R1060TKDVHLYCB","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The MIRACLE-GRO CHERRY TOMATO SEES POD makes a perfect teaching moment.  Often, when you plant with children (or planting-phobes), gently guiding them as they plant a seed, gently water, and watch a sprout emerge... that pesky sprout doesn't emerge.  Or it does, only to be lovingly fondled and accidentally crushed.  Or it grows and is then devoured by a giant tomato worm that looks like something out of an alien film.I can't guarantee what happens after the seed pod tomato sprouts, but the sprouting odds are greatly enhanced with the fertilizer and little peat pot.If you're planting your all-organic compost enhanced vegetable plot, this isn't your scene.  But if you want to plant your little plant and watch a seedling emerge, this makes a very teachable moment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IJUS4W76F5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZNJ1C0#wasThisHelpful","R11IJUS4W76F5Z","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The dress is diaphanous and fairy-like and wispy and wonderful in terms of color.  It floats and enchants.The problem is the bust.  It is so low cut that there is no place to hide a bra.

"Using Joseph Kennedy and his legacy as an example, Lady, Vee, and Delph Alter's mother tells them, in one of her famous pronouncements, that the sins of the father are visited down on four generations.  Lady, Vee, and Delph are the fourth generation of one massive sinner: Lens Alter.Lens Alter was a Jew converted to Lutheran, a scientist (fictional) modeled after a real scientist (Fritz Haber) who not only weaponized chlorine gas and promoted it to the Germans for use as a weapon in Word War I, but went on to develop Zyklon B, which the Nazis used to exterminate Jews during World War II.  (In addition to that, he was a thoroughly unlikeable character).Ever since, descendants of Lens Alter have met their ends by suicide in many forms - hanging, throwing oneself out a window, drowning... You name it; the Alters have thought of it.Beyond that, it is a tale of four generations of dysfunctional family members doing dysfunctional things, in darkly amusing ways.  And while all this sounds terribly grim, it's a extremely funny, insightful, quirky, touching story.Here, then, is my list of The Top Ten Things That Are Great About A REUNION OF GHOSTS10.  Judith Claire Mitchell can turn a phrase with the best of them.  Her sentences are beautiful constructions.9.  The weaving of the storylines.  Mitchell bounces between generations, telling little vignette gems from each, until all the vignettes form a complete story.  It makes it difficult to follow, at times, but eventually it all makes sense and the complexities form a whole picture.8.  It's funny.  I know.  From the description it sounds dark beyond belief, but these are real people she's created, and real people do funny things and think irreverent funny thoughts.  In addition, the sisters are irrepressible punsters.  They can't stop themselves.  And so they rarely do.7.  History.  I was a bad student of history, as served up in school.  In works of fiction, where it is woven in to make us understand times and places we have never been, I am a voracious student of history.  And there is much in the pages of this book.6.  Cameo appearances.  Meet Albert Einstein and his first wife Mileva, the Curies, Frank Zappa, Janis Joplin.  Or have a chat with Dr. Freud.5.  Location, location, location.  There is much for those who love New York, walking the streets and byways with the sisters.4.  Character, character, character.  Each of the sisters in uniquely intriguingly bizarre and endearing in strange ways.  They feel so real, so scarred, so frightened, so brave, and, as mentioned before, very funny.3.  Observations and insights.  Have you read books where the author reveals so many juicy thoughts that the pages swim with them, and you wonder how said author could ever write another book because so much of the author's soul and brain are in the one you are reading?  This is one of those books.2.  Making such a dark tale such a pleasure to read.  Sure, I recoiled.  I was horrified.  I also laughed.1.  Judith Claire Mitchell can REALLY write.

This is certainly not the end of the world; it's easy to turn it back on.  But it does interfere with the timing.But I love it, and can learn to live with the button.  Why?

"This is my first BRUNO, CHIEF OF POLICE novel, but I immediately felt welcome in his circle -- enough so that I will be dipping back to Martin Walker's earlier works to spend more time with Bruno in St. Denis.The stories revolve around the small French town of St. Denis, where Bruno Courreges is the Chief of Police.  The town is tiny enough that everyone knows everyone's business, for better or for worse.In the book, two ""children"" return.  One is Sami, an autistic boy who was taken in by his uncle and aunt when he was very young.  After a number of years, they took him to a special school at the local mosquq.  But somewhere along the way, Sami's unique skills made him attractive to the jihadists, who put him to work. He has somehow escaped and wants to return to France.The other ""child"" is an old Jewish woman who, as a child, along with her brother, were sheltered from the Nazis.  Her brother, who was quite wealthy, recently died, and wanted to make a large bequest to the town as a token of their gratitude.But there are terrorists on the loose in the peaceful village.  As the story opens, Bruno is dealing with the corpse of a tortured undercover police officer who was investigating activities at the local mosque.  Following the assassins' trail, Bruno discovers them at the school, armed and dangerous, no doubt looking for Sami's uncle.Life in peaceful St. Denis is about to get a lot less peaceful, perhaps forever.That being said, here is my Top Ten List of Things That Are Great About THE CHILDREN RETURN.10.  Bruno's character.  He's everything  charming Frenchman should be.  A great cook, a lover of good food, a lover of wine and women.9.  Really scary stuff mixed in with beautiful touching stuff.  The contrast shows off both extremes to the maximum. The ending sequence will have you chewing your nails and flying through the pages (or chewing the pages and flying through your nails).8.  Lovely recipes and cool info about growing wine grapes and making wine.  While Martin Walker's wife is apparently putting together a cookbook of bruno's recipes, the beauty of them here, I think, is the ""cooking without recipe"" approach: adding fresh vegetables from the garden, some dry white wine, a drizzle of olive oil...7.  Glimpses and lessons in history, woven into the story.  We read about the French Resistance, the Partisans, the Algerian War, the Nazis' effects on secluded Southern France, and more.  Walker describes the July 1942 roundup at the Velodrome Hiver, the heroic efforts of the Jewish Scouts to save the children, the Protestant communities of Southern France who played a heroic role is the rescue of so many Jewish children, the Battles of Mouleydier in June of '44, and much more.6.  Research, research, research.  Martin has done a diligent job researching not only the history but autism, life in Afghanistan, Islam in Europe, the Taliban, and more. The subject matter around the mosques, the jihadists, and the peaceable Muslims is extremely timely.5.  Martin Walker can turn a phrase beautifully.  The words flow.  The characters' dialog is natural and believable.4.  Walker develops excellent characters.  They are portrayed with sensitivity, each unique and separate from the other characters.3. An interesting glimpse into the ways French politics (and international politics) work, with relationships, past history, protocol, and more.2.  How can you not love a book where it's time for the wine harvest festival?1. There are six more Bruno books, just waiting to be read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XIIF9QWPXBTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354150#wasThisHelpful","R2XIIF9QWPXBTX","A2IQV2ITUT56A5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IQV2ITUT56A5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My sister just had her baby this month and I was super excited to get this in for my baby niece to try.The colors are super vibrant with its little fishes and ocean colors.Very beautiful and can be used for both girls or boys.These are organic and come prewashed.We ended up washing these twice (you don't need to wash them twice we had an accident happen right after washing it the first time) and these came out super soft. My sister loves them they are very generous in size at  47"" x 47"".My niece loves to be swaddled which if you are a Mother you know it helps them transition from the womb to the outside world.I was so happy my niece loves it.She even sleeps swaddled.These are so versatile you can use this as a carseat/stroller sun shade protector, an emergency blanket(if you forgot to bring one), burp cloth, etc. I love when you can use an item for multiple things.My sister uses the other one as a blanket to lay on the floor for tummy time.They come in a 2 pack which is great.These are great because they are breathable and do not get in the way when nursing.These are breathable and do not trap babys body heat when swaddled.She can even use these long after the newborn swaddle stages as a blanket when my niece gets in the crawling and toddler stages. Overall my sister and I was very pleased with the quality of these swaddle blankets and the many ways you can use it.I have used another product from this brand and love the quality of their products.Glad that this one was no different in quality.Sample was provided by Itsy Bitsy Baby Boo in exchange for my honest unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHYNH0DM2FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102XMDAY#wasThisHelpful","R1LHYNH0DM2FZ","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:46 Mins This piece of jewelry is beautiful.I love the pendant it is very attractive and adds a nice touch to my outfit.It has a nice durable thick chain, this is not your usual silver chain links where it can break easily.This one is thicker with the way it was made and even looks nice.You can adjust the lobster clasp to different lengths if you want to.The Pendant itself is very beautiful with its detailing and little crystals.You also have a turquoise stone like piece in the middle of the pendant which makes it look so elegant. I really like this pendant it has so much detail.The little part that holds the pendant from the chain keeps the pendant from turning around on you while you are wearing it which is nice.The back is plain so this feature is great to keep the front facing forward and you do not have to worry about it flipping around on you while you wear it.

"I am very pleased with this Portable Solar Charger from SunLabz.I have tried a few of their products and was excited to give this a try since I have never used this type of portable charger powered by the sun.This panel is very sleek and thin.Perfect to take on traveling trips I gave this to my Mother to borrow on her trip to Samoa and she had so many compliments about how neat this is.It is very sunny and hot out there so this worked absolutely well for her.She was able to charge it up quickly and efficiently and charge her IPad2 as well as her 6Plus.I tried this here as well before giving her this to try out there on our trip to Arizona and here in California and it worked great!I was a bit skeptic if it would actualy work and it did.This comes with the panel itself which is wrapped with a nylon like material around the whole frame and in the back as well.It has 4 holes total around the corners to hold the suction cups that you receive in your purchase as well as the hooks.The hooks are perfect to use while camping, hiking, etc. You can hook on the back of your backpack, bag, or tent to get a 45 degree angle to charge up the panel.That is the angle that is suggested when charging this device.What is neat about this panel is that in the back there is a net pouch to store your phone cord tablet cord or the hooks/suction cups that come with it.In the back they have a black little port for the usb to go into to charge your device.You cannot charge this with your power cord it is only charged through the sun.Overall since having this over a month we really like  it.My Family members borrow this when they are going to be outside doing recreational activities or traveling where it is hot like back in the islands.Sample was provided to me from SunLabz in exchange for my honest unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12AIHO21BXS9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU8T7MM#wasThisHelpful","R12AIHO21BXS9F","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my Mother to use since she had symptoms of candida and wanted to try it myself before giving it to her to see what it tastes like.It really is POTENT!IYou have to shake this bottle very well before using.You can smell the strong oil as soon as you open it.It tastes really bad!I could not stomach it.My Mother could not either so I got capsules to put them in for her to take.So far it seems to be helping her, she does not seem to be feeling terrible like she use to.So I am sure this is helping.I would definitely use capsules if you cannot stomach the taste or smell.It comes with a glass dropper.The directions are simple and to take daily under the tongue.Working your way up to a full syringe which is a lot!I would definitely take it slow if you plan on using this and keep in mind that it is very strong and potent and not for everyone.Sample was provided to me complimentary in exchange for my honest unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KVGBXVOSVD2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTWLHX8#wasThisHelpful","R3KVGBXVOSVD2V","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was excited to try this product out and wanted to give it a try.My Sister was expecting a baby when I ordered it and wanted to make one for her.I love that they include everything you need except the scissors and sharpie is what you will need from home.The kit comes with the string for the ornaments to hang from, 1 template for the markings of where the string goes,2 different size wooden beads, pink pre cut felt, off white thick durable cardstock, & 3 various sized metal rings, as well as one glue.I was a little skeptic if we got enough string or glue but after cutting all the strings to the required length I had some left over.The glue was just enough and I ended up squeezing out the last drops toward the end of getting my cardstock glued together.I was very pleased with the quality of the products they are definitely 5 star.I had to dock off one star because this did not come with any printed instructions.The only thing you get regarding instructions is a sheet of paper with a colored picture of the project printed on it and a link to a video to show you how to do it. I ended up going to this link and found the video and followed the instructions.I really wished the video would show how to actually hang the ornaments on.I think with the price of 44$ it is selling at they should have printed instructions and a better video tutorial in my opinion.I had trouble getting the string tied correctly because of the view and ended up messing up my cardstock and damaging it because I did not put the glue on the correct side & ended up placing the glue on the wrong side.The seller was kind enough to offer to send me replacements which I thought was a very nice thing to do.So just keep in mind they don't really show you step by step breakdown in the video of putting it all together, it is more like briefly going over what goes where in my opinion.I was expecting a step by step guide.I am a very detailed person so hopefully you will have a better experience than I did.Here is the link for the youtube tutorial: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m1cUugVH2v4 Overall besides the cons for me it is a great quality product.Hopefully in the future they can include better instructions.You also can have an opportunity to make money from this.They include information on how to make these kits your own and selling them etc. which I thought was pretty neat.Sample was provided to me by Apostrophe S in exchange for my honest unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R5NAE8MIOPCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUGUH54#wasThisHelpful","R2R5NAE8MIOPCN","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:46 Mins This piece of jewelry is beautiful.I love the pendant it is very attractive and adds a nice touch to my outfit.It has a nice durable thick chain, this is not your usual silver chain links where it can break easily.This one is thicker with the way it was made and even looks nice.You can adjust the lobster clasp to different lengths if you want to.The Pendant itself is very beautiful with its detailing and little crystals.You also have a turquoise stone like piece in the middle of the pendant which makes it look so elegant. I really like this pendant it has so much detail.The little part that holds the pendant from the chain keeps the pendant from turning around on you while you are wearing it which is nice.The back is plain so this feature is great to keep the front facing forward and you do not have to worry about it flipping around on you while you wear it.

"This iPhone 6 4.7"" case works well with my Moms new iPhone 6.Right out of the box it feels very sturdy and durable.It has cutouts for the volume up and down, muting ringer button, camera, power button, headphones & charging port.So far they worked great for her and I was able to test this out for her since she is new to the iPhone.I was able to use all functions just fine, It definitely comes in handy when you are out and about and forget you are running low on battery power.She is getting ready to leave back home to the islands and this will definitely help keep her prepared while at the airports since she has a stop or 2 before arriving to her destination. To operate and turn on you have to charge it up takes about 5 hours to charge there are 4 blue indicator lights that let you know how much 'juice' you got left on the battery case which is nice.You simply press the power button on the bottome left corner to turn the case on to charge your phone when low.To install your phone you would have to remove the top part of the case that slides out and then when sliding your phone in, you can simply close it back up. Another good thing about this case is that it has a kickstand located on the back.This will come in handy and when not in use simply fold it back into its storage slot.I have 1 con about this case it does not include an adapter for the headphone port, usually the battery cases include this for the 6 or 6plus.That is why I give it a 4 star, it would be nice if they included that.Overall it is definitely very useful and the quality seems good, and would definitely add some protection to your phone.It is going to add some weight to your phone so keep that in mind.It also does not include any charging cable, you would have to use your cord that came with your  phone. I would not suggest using any other cord anyway personally unless you want one as a backup.I always use the manufacturer cord unless it has to be replaced.My Mother definitely appreciates a case like this and really likes it.*Complimentary Sample was provided in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQA0QSWZ6MBF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y23ABR8#wasThisHelpful","RQA0QSWZ6MBF4","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love chickpeas but never had it in a flour form, so I was eager to try this out.My toddler loves chickpeas as well so I wanted to make something out of this for us to try.I ended up making zuchinni flour bread off a recipe I found on the internet and it was super easy.I am definitely a beginner when cooking with these kind of flours and this recipe I found on youtube was so simple and easy, they come out looking like a pancake and taste yummy!!Definitely a great healthier alternative to eat bread since this is gluten free. The bag has its organic seal which is always great, I love when companies that claim to be organic actually have that on the product itself.So if you are wondering if it has that seal it definitely does and is also a product of India in case you are wondering. I know I like to know things like this when looking for organic. This definitely has some great flavor and my family loves it!I can't wait to explore more recipes cooking with the rest of this flour.If you have never tried chickpea flour I would definitely recommend giving it a try.*Complimentary sample was provided in exchange for my honest unbaised evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZXL5UK6TI2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJEXF4E#wasThisHelpful","RSZXL5UK6TI2S","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:26 Mins I really like this gypsy boho maxi full length skirt.The white is perfect for the summer if I want to wear something like a skirt, it went great with my black tank top.The material is all cotton as well as the lining inside, I did notice that you can still see a little bit through but not the type of see through that a leggings has if that makes sense.That cotton lining inside provides you some coverage.I am 5'4 and had to pull this skirt up past my waistline because it would have dragged up some dirt since it rested right on the tops of my feet.I wore sandals with it, so I would definitely recommend getting a size up to make sure you have room to pull up on the waistline if you are short like me. The waistline is not stretchable and can get uncomfortable if you do not get the right sizing.I got a size 10 and it fit great, so I would definitely recommend checking your size accurately and picking maybe a size up depending on your body type.The tiered layers that run all the way down the skirt is nice and gives the skirt some texture and design instead of a simple plain white maxi skirt.The zipper on this skirt is nicely hidden, so when you wear a top that is waistline length you do not have to worry about it showing.I would definitely hang dry this skirt as well because of the material and possible shrinking.Overall I am very happy with quality and fit.*Complimentary Sample was provided to me during a promotional offer in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UG0ZEMSMY4JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAE4OFY#wasThisHelpful","R1UG0ZEMSMY4JV","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:50 Mins What a cute little plastic ladybug toothbrush holder.I thought this was really cute and fun for my daughter to use for her toothbrush.It definitely makes that part of the day more fun for her and special since she has her own special holder.It comes with 3 suctions cups to put on in the back which holds well to glass.I would recommend being careful when repositioning since the suction cups may come off.You have to kind of screw them in but they don't come off easily which is a good thing, but also it may come out when removing.The suction cups are removable so if it were to come off during removal you can easily put them back into place.This is also versatile you can keep your kids little chalk markers or crayons in if you wanted to.Or maybe keep your pens in there and use it as a holder in the kitchen for quick access.The plastic is strong enough to hold her toothbrush and toothpaste.The opening to slide things in is not that big or small it is the perfect size for a toddlers toothbrush.Check out my video for more information.*Sample was provided at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R346CBUZSNWQYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAEJ3N2#wasThisHelpful","R346CBUZSNWQYO","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:17 Mins I have tried URPOWER's single pocket running belt and liked that one so far.This one is even better in my opinon because of the dual pockets this one has.It allows me extra space for anything I would like to take with me while out and about or enjoying some recreation activities.The thickness of the elastic band is very durable and no different in quality than their single pocket one I have tried.The material for the pockets is made of neoprene which is very durable, waterproof, and tear resistant.It is nice to know that I can depend on using this for a long time, especialy with a toddler you do not know what kind of shenanigans my daughter and I will get into lol. If you are a mother of a toddler you know accidents happen, water is spilled, juice tumbles over, food thrown, etc. so this handy little travel waist pouch will definitely be handy to keep my phone and other things protected when out and about.I was very impressed at how this 1 1/2"" width can extend bigger than I had anticipated it would.The 2 pockets are both different sizes the big one is about 11"" at the opening, the smaller one is 6"".That is a pretty decent size for essential things I would definitely use and need, like my ID,Credit Card, Keys, money, & iphone 6Plus.The bigger pocket fits my 6Plus nicely with some extra room for keys.The other running belt they have which is single can only hold my cell phone.So I am really liking this one much better due to the fact they have one big pocket and a smaller pocket for other various things.This is comfortable to wear and the waist belt can be adjusted to fit me or my Husband perfectly.It can fit wasit lines of 31.5 to 55.This will definitely will come in handy this summer.So far I really like this one better than the single pocket one.*Complimentary Sample was provided to me in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BA2NWP9O2RO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAO46JC#wasThisHelpful","R3BA2NWP9O2RO7","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:17 Mins This running belt from URPOWER  is pretty neat.I have to be honest, I have seen these floating around on my Facebook Page but never really paid any attention.I thought this belt was way too thin for my liking, and how in the world is this going to fit my valuables in while I am out and about? This running belt is very compact, thin, and very lightweight.It measures about 1 1/2"" wide and can extend to fit various waist sizes from 23.5 to 47.What is really neat about this belt that I underestimated how big the single pocket is.The pocket in the front is covered by reflective strips so when you are out at night you can be visible to those driving, walking, etc. It is very well made and very durable, the material it is made of is neoprene.Making this wawterproof and tear resistant, so I can definitely be confident that this will last me a long time.It will also keep your things dry from rain, water rides, etc. I think this wait pack not only works as a running belt for outdoor recreations but also as a travel belt for theme parks and such.This will definitely keep your things in one safe accessible spot, but also keep it dry from the water rides, or any other moisture.I live in Cali. and they have theme parks with water etc. so this definitely will be handy during those type of trips.The pocket in the front measures out to be 9"" long and fits my iphone 6Plus perfectly snug as well as some money,ID,Credit Card,if I needed to carry such things with me. The elastic band is very nice and thick and has to extension clips on both sides to adjust to various waist sizes.The plastic belt clip makes it easy for you to take it off and put it on quickly.I like the whole design because it is not bulky or something overpowering when you travel,excercise, etc. It is nice and sleek.I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good waterproof running belt or waist pack.They also have one with 2 pockets for those of us who like to carry a lot more things with us.Overall I am very pleased with this belt so far great quality.*Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QHTQ6M1NZJ9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG1H3R2#wasThisHelpful","R3QHTQ6M1NZJ9A","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:45 Mins How adorable are these ribbons? I have a daughter who was blessed to have a lot of hair, and I mean A LOT.She will be 2 next month and I was in need of some hair accessories since she has grown out of the headbands I had for her.I actually prefer these better because I have more control where to put them.The ribbons come in a 15pack and all are not just one color they are all different.You have some that are different variations of the color but not all the same.I really love the variety because you can dress up any outfit since there are so many and best of all this will last me a couple years for hair dos with her.She will not outgrow these like a headband.This would definitely make a great gift idea as well if you wanted to, or decorate a diaper cake with these sprinkled around.One particular feature on this which I show in my video, is that the clip is metal that they use and it holds to the hair perfectly and securely.They also have the metal part hidden where it would have been exposed so you do not see the metal part at all like some bows do.I really am enjoying dressing my daughters hair up with these adorable boutique bows.(3"" in size) From a mother who has a daughter who is active I would definitely recommend them.They stand up well to her daily activities and the ribbon itself is pretty durable.Don't forget to check out my video as I show you up close the quality of these premium ribbons.*Complimentary Sample was provided to me during a promotional offer in exchange for my honest evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LTTQGKYAQT5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YU6WZ3U#wasThisHelpful","R3LTTQGKYAQT5W","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:29 Mins I absolutely love this car mount it is nice and compact perfect for my iPhone6Plus & Hubbys phone.One of the great things I liked about this car mount is that it can be mounted to your dashboard or windshiled which is nice.Most car mounts I have used can only be mounted on a certain area because the way it is designed.This one does not obstruct my views when driving at all which is a big plus for me.This one is nice and short at the base allowing the support to hold my phone but at the same time out of my view of driving.I can see the cars clearly and I do not have any blindspots with this one.The car mount is a clip which makes it easy to install and remove your phone quickly and easily.It has rubber like grips that hold my phone securely in place.I also like that it can accomadate any phone size since it does not have side brackets limiting the size phone you can put in it.There is a lever on the bottom to create a nice suction when installing the base to the surface of your choosing and locks it into place.You also can move the phone around 360degrees to suit your needs.I would definitely recommend this car mount if you are in search of a good plastic one.No magnets or anything of that nature needed.Just simply open the clip and place your phone in and your ready to go.*Complimentary Sample was provided to me during a promotional offer in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG2QBXO6YCBT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WP5VMGO#wasThisHelpful","RG2QBXO6YCBT2","A2E5XMD6VDNK6L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5XMD6VDNK6L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:43 Mins This is a wonderful RC offroad vehicle.  It is what I would consider to be a midrange toy.  You can get cheap toys for $20, or pay $2,000 for a high end racing RC vehicle, and this one fits somewhere in the middle.First of all, the packaging says for ages 14 and up.  While I personally think any 10 year old would be fine with it, that is an indicator of the type of toy we are talking about; it is FAST and powerful, and if not used properly could cause harm (I can see my 10 year old self building ramps and jumping it over my friends ... would not have been a smart idea).And this thing is big.  It is 1/12 scale, and as you can see from the photo, it dwarfs a foot long ruler.The construction is good and solid.  The tires are real soft rubber.  The suspension works well, and it can take a beating.  However, note that my pug (which goes crazy over RC vehicles) managed to immediately break the rear ""spoiler"", which is just a cosmetic weak point.  My pug also pulled one of the tires off, but I popped it right back on and everything was fine (after a pounding, the suspension and parts that matter hold up admirably).The remote is just ""ok"".  The steering wheel has a foam rubber surface for good grip, and it has a pull trigger gas pedal (and reverse).  The controller has lots of other fake buttons, which adds zero value and is just distracting.The driving experience is awesome and fun!  Yes, it is very very fast in my opinion; much faster than any other RC vehicle I have ever operated (which to be fair are cheap ones).  The box says it goes 18 KM/hr, which is 11 miles per hour.  That is a very fast run (sprint speed for a kid or someone who isn't in great shape).  It accelerates VERY quickly to the top speed, so driving can be a challenge.The only downside with driving is that the steering is very wide; in other words, you will not be making sharp turns with this.  The turning radius is roughly ten feet.  This makes it easier to drive, but tough to navigate small areas.  The steering does not slowly adjust; it is full on left or right when you turn the wheel.  That is fine for a fun toy, but ""pro"" RC racing vehicles allow for turning sharp or gradual, not just all or nothing.  But for my purposes this is fine.The set includes a charger and TWO battery packs (as well as a 9v for the remote).  This is wonderful in that you don't need to buy anything else to be up and running immediately.In conclusion, this is a really fun toy; it isn't perfect, but is miles ahead of lower priced RC units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLG575KN87IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6GRF9A#wasThisHelpful","RJLG575KN87IN","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the opportunity to review the product at no charge.My first impression out of the box is ""wow, this is a nice and well made piece of hardware.""  This is the type of item (as you would hope) that you'll probably have in your toolbox forever, and if you have children they will inherit it.The size is similar to a hammer; a bit longer, but it is not a giant tool (mine is the 16"" long model).The head is adjustable and has a perfectly curved surface that make prying or lifting a breeze where other tools fail.I used this recently just to lift an edge of a very heavy piece of metal furniture where I needed to get my fingers underneath to lift.

"I had the opportunity to review the book at no charge.I am a property manager, and have mostly ""winged it"" without getting outside help.  Most property management is common sense, but there are some ""gotchas"", and those can cost you dearly if not handled properly.I recently had my first major run-in with a former tenant regarding their condition upon move-out, and the amount withheld from their deposit to get the property back into condition.  I was lucky that no lawsuit was filed, because if so I likely would have lost out on labor charges (which seemed completely appropriate to me, but this book would have steered me in a slightly different direction which could have avoided some of this conflict in the first place).  The book focuses on practical scenarios, and has what I would consider to be excellent advise throughout.In summary, if you are new to property management, this is a must read.

"This is a fantastic little solar light.  It measure about 5 inches long by 4 inches high by 3 inches deep (the solar part is angled on top, with the lighting angled towards the ground).Installation is as easy as can be.  The only thing to remember is you MUST use the included little metal ""key"" (basically like a paperclip) to click on the light for the first time.  There are included screws, but really you just need one screw and can quickly slap it on the side of a house, a tree, etc.The motion detection is not adjustable but works perfectly; just right for my application of having this on the side of my house.The brightness is quite nice; the 8 LEDs are very bright and put off maybe half the brightness of a small flood light.

"I cannot tell you the reader how much I love this CD / DVD burner. But I will try.Yes, it is a fairly generic CD/DVD reader and writer. It comes with the USB cable you need, and you can just plug it into most machines and it will work great. I tried it with a Windows 7 machine, and with a MacBook running OSX 10.8, and both worked flawlessly with no hiccups or hassles. Note that this drive is USB 3.0 compatible; unfortunately I don't have any machines that are new enough to try out the faster speeds. But USB 2.0 works great.The reason I am blown away with love for this unit is that it works with my Korg Kronos keyboard (basically a $3,000 professional music workstation / keyboard / synth). One of the features of my keyboard is you can write music, plug in a CD burner, and burn CDs. After two years of trying out different drives (all ""major brands"") with no luck, I plugged in this VicTsing drive in, just for grins. And sure enough it worked right off the bat without a single issue. I have spent literally dozens of hours trying to get other burners to work without ever successfully burning a single disk (and those drives worked fine everywhere else), but this new one finally solved my problem. I will be reporting my results to Korg and posting this for other frustrated users out there (there are plenty). Finally a solution that works!Bottom line, this is a fantastic little burner that will do everything you need, and even outperforms all other brands in my specific scenario of trying to burn a CD from my Korg Kronos keyboard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195NN78M43Q8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016JS3J90#wasThisHelpful","R195NN78M43Q8N","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The ""reeling"" action is smooth and flawless.  The retraction tension is perfect and withdraws nicely.

"I have been using Energizers for years.  While I am more of a rechargeable guy, alkaline batteries absolutely have a place at the table for powering items like remotes, AC wall thermostats, and outdoor thermometers (applications without large drains where you do not want to mess with recharging batteries every few months).This is an 8 pack of alkaline AAA batteries.  So far they seem just as good as any others I have tried.  The packaging for these has ""ECO"" stamped on them, as if these are environmentally friendly.  Well, they are made of 4% ""recycled"" content, which means they are 96% as ""bad"" as any other battery.  I suppose that is better than nothing, but it isn't like every one of these batteries sold will result in a tree getting to live.  But the real benefit is that they (according to Energizer) DO indeed last a bit longer (12 year shelf life versus 10 year for their normal alkalines).Bottom line, you are getting a top quality alkaline battery; no, they still aren't ""good"" for the environment, but for the right applications they should last for many years (which IS good for the environment and your pocketbook!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15SS66SUIMV7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0JV826#wasThisHelpful","R15SS66SUIMV7I","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:49 Mins This is an awesome little RC car!  Yes, it is not equivalent to the ones that are several hundred dollars at the hobby shops.  But it is fun, fast, includes everything you, need, and so far is VERY durable.The packaging looks nice; definitely would make a fantastic gift for any kid (or, err, some adults might actually have fun with these).  It comes with a 9V battery for the remote, a rechargeable battery pack, a plug-in wall charger, and of course the wireless remote and the car.The car is about a foot long and has ""off road"" style tires and suspension.  It works best indoors, but it also does fine in the dirt (not enough ground clearance for grass though).  The steering is incredibly precise; it even has fine adjustments with a ""clicker"" on the bottom of the car.  The suspension offers more than looks; when my one-eyed pug saw this thing racing around the house, he had to pounce (see video review).  Botton line, the car has held up admirably to an assault by a giant pug, so it should be fairly kid-proof (it has limits, but I'm sure if it gets dropped and played with it will keep going).In summary, this is a great little RC car; highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WBSA6L64VP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154M0TZE#wasThisHelpful","R22WBSA6L64VP3","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And let me tell you, if you are new to boating and tow a boat in wet weather, expect the boat (interior and all) to be a huge mess when you get to the lake; a cover is really a necessity if you will be travelling with the boat (and also provides at least some level of security, especially for quick stops at convenience stores or places to eat.I will provide further updates if I experience any issues, but so far this seems to be an EXCELLENT cover; highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6MR9QVKJEEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KWJHVY#wasThisHelpful","RD6MR9QVKJEEA","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was truly a breeze. Download the app, create an account (as simple as providing an email address and password), plug in the camera, enter your router's password into the app, and presto, the magic happens!- Good app. The app not only allows you to set everything up initially, but it great and fully functioned, AND they do not nickel and dime you by trying to sell you a full-featured app. Out of the box the app can send you notifications if motion is detected, you can pan and tilt with the live view, and you can record automatically if motion is detected.

"I had the incredible opportunity to try out this product at no charge.In short, I love it!  The whole package is incredibly slick and obviously had plenty of input not only from engineers but from users.  This is basically the ""Mac"" of microphones; looks great (""cute""), and most importantly it accomplishes the primary mission of being a great microphone.PROS:- Packaging is possibly the best I have ever seen for a consumer product.  Seriously.  SPOILER: the mic comes in a little beehive.  The userguide is printed using hexagonal paper.  It is just plain fun unboxing this thing.- Construction is first rate.  The microphone feels like something made in the 1950s: sturdy metal is used here.  The mic looks like a piece of art.  The black finish feels more like a quality powder coating than paint.- The knobs are useful.  Microphone sound, microphone volume, and headphone volume are included.  You have a USB jack to connect to a PC or Mac, and a 1/8"" headphone output.- Truly requires no drivers; plugged it into my Mac and Logic Pro immediately recognized it.  Nice.- The microphone quality sounds professional.  The ""music"" setting captures every crisp nuance, and the ""voice"" setting turns you into a podcaster in a snap!  The ""normal"" setting just captures sounds exactly as they are made with no ""enhancements"".  If you are an aspiring musician or an aspiring podcaster, this mic will fit your needs until you make it to the big leagues and record in a professional studio.

"I am incredibly fortunately in being able to review this product.I recently shorted out my old late 90's Cobra radar detector (while trying to hard-wire it into my Subaru WRX's rear-view mirror power supply).  I decided to buy a cheapie $35 replacement Cobra detector.  Funny enough it is basically identical to the one I bought 17 years ago.  But it works fine.Well, I had the opportunity to try out this new ""fancy"" model, loaded with bells and whistles.  I'm not at an age where bells and whistles do not easily impress me, so I was skeptical on what this unit could really deliver (and let's face it, at a cost of around 10 times their low-end detectors).In short, I am completely WOWED by what Cobra has produced.  Here is what I like:- By far fewer false alarms.  When this baby goes off, there is a pretty good chance there is a cop nearby.  It isn't perfect, but I would say it produces fewer than half of the false alarms as my other detector.  Bells and whistles aside, this is my favorite thing about this unit.- Truly leverages your smartphone and confirmed radar gun sightings from other users.  There is a little button that you can click if you spot a ""for real"" radar gun, that gets uploaded to Cobra's servers, and then gets distributed to everyone who is running these units.  The radar detector then warns you when you get close, regardless if any signals are being detected (which helps prevent the instant-on situations).- Nice display screen.  My other detector just has the LED lights that can be confusing.  This one has a nice screen similar to what you would see on a cell phone (it isn't a touch screen, but is a nice lit LCD screen that tells you what is going on).- Nice sounds.  My old detector had too many literal bells and whistles; you all know the beeps, they get old and you start tuning them out.  This detector has nice voices that announce when you change from city to highway mode, etc.  Much more pleasing to passengers and easier to interpret for drivers.- Compact size.  My other detector is small, but this one is even smaller (I would say about a third smaller than most detectors out there).- Power cable included.  Everything you need is in the package, including a car plug cable that has a convenient additional USB slot (nice!).- App is easy to download and get started using.  It was free and easy to download the app; in about one minute I was registered and connected.  The app also shows useful information on a map such as speed traps, traffic lights that ticket you for running red lights, etc.This detector is not just a fun gadget; it really works.  If I had to estimate how much my older detector helps prevents tickets, I would say it decreases my odds by roughly half.  It isn't perfect, but provides a decent warning about half the time.  Well, this new detector probably cuts that in half again.  I would say about 3/4 of the time this thing could save you from getting a ticket.  Of course if you speed all over the place or drive a ""cop magnet"" like I do (WRX), then nothing can prevent you from getting tickets sooner or later; nothing will ever be perfect.  But this unit is a revolution in radar detection that is more significant than anything since detectors first hit the market.  The only downsides are expense, and that for you to get information ""real time"" about radar guns other users are seeing, those users must also be connected and willing to click the ""report"" button to show that a radar gun is really in the area.  I have always been a guy who flashes lights to warn oncoming traffic of a cop, so I hope this will catch on and more drivers will help each other out.  Last comment, please drive responsibly; use this as a tool to protect yourself, but don't use it to drive like a demon and endanger the lives of others (I used to drive like a moron and I'm ashamed of it).In summary, if you can afford it, highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNJL5TUQXW6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010B6EJQS#wasThisHelpful","RWNJL5TUQXW6M","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The software (which is equally as important as the hardware) is excellent.  Setup is a breeze, and the app works great right off the bat.  I would give a very slight nod to Fitbit as far as the functionality and ease of use of their ""ecosystem"" goes (apps, web tools, etc).- Battery life is long.  Fitbit required me to charge it twice a week, and this lasts a full week.- A healthy ecosystem of accessories is available, including a scale (I have a Fitbit scale which I love that is not compatible with this, but you can buy Jawbone compatible scales that should work nicely).CONS:- Not a watch (same complaint as my original Fitbit, and what lead me to go with the Pebble).- For the money, no other complaints!Note that my Pebble watch offers fitness tracking that works with the Jawbone system, plus of course it has a screen and many other functions.  However, the Pebble just makes for an ""ok"" fitness tracker; results are inconsistent, connecting can be a nightmare, and it locks you in to not wearing other watches (where a dedicated fitness band is expected to be combined with wearing a watch, and I like to wear different watches).In summary, I highly recommend the UP2 fitness tracker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y1ULVOQKZCMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIFZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2Y1ULVOQKZCMI","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a videogame nut, but lean much more towards the retro side, and I love the history of videogaming in particular.  This is an excellent addition to my gaming book library; while there are plenty of titles (almost all which I have) dedicated to 80s and 90s gaming, this one primarily addresses games from the early 2000's and on, and it mostly explores the artistic aspects.  There are 40 videogames profiled, and most of those tend to be Japanese based (but all released in the US; you just will not find many ""western"" developed games here).The printing is on nice heavy glossy paper, and the colors of the artwork pop on every page.  The book is hardcover, and is truly a coffee-table quality that any gamer would be proud to show off.While I am drawn to older more ""traditional"" games, I found myself quickly engrossed and amazed at the artistic range demonstrated in this book.  There are true artists that show their work through videogames, and even non-gamers can appreciate the incredible talents that those who worked on these games have.  Bottom line, this is a gorgeous book to flip through, with every page flip revealing dynamic magical worlds.In summary, this is a highly recommended book if you are interested in the artistic side of gaming from around 2000 and beyond.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5PHCZI8ULM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593276656#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5PHCZI8ULM5","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an incredibly nice watch; I LOVE it and have received numerous compliments on it, even after wearing it for just a few days!The construction is heavy and solid.  Time will tell the tale, but this feels like a watch that will last a lifetime or more if cared for properly.  The band is metal, and does require the little pins to be removed to adjust (one-time ""setup"").The face of the watch has the main dial, and then three (not two) smaller dials.  The third dial (hard to see because it does not have the same black background) is the second hand for the chronograph.  But in person you can see it just fine; I really like the design.  Also note that the watch face size is perfect for me; not too big, not too small.Bottom line, this is an excellent looking watch; very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI6FP54BKPM1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XWXC#wasThisHelpful","RI6FP54BKPM1L","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great camera; I have tried numerous ones over the years, and this one definitely takes the cake as being the most solid, having the best image, and easiest to setup.The construction feels heavy and solid; this is not a toy.  It has a flat black finish, and looks great.Setup was a breeze; I did not need to hack my network or anything, just followed the instructions, installed an app, and was up and running in 5 minutes.The free app works well with my LG G2.  The camera pans and tilts nicely.  The image is super clear, and it works well on my cell phone (4G signal).My only minor gripe is that the camera is not listed on the ""IP Cam Viewer"" app that I use for all of my other cameras; I imagine it will be added at some point, but for now I'm stuck using two different apps for all of my cameras.

"DISCLAIMER: I had the opportunity to review this product at no cost in exchange for an honest review.UPDATE: these photos were taken 8 days apart.... sorry for sideways orientation but Amazon upload forces that.  But as you can say, in 8 days I already have a fairly dense and green lawn!First of all, let me state my location: the hot and dry climate of Austin, Texas.  While the local ""big box"" stores sell the product, it is not officially recommended for my climate.  I actually have quite a history with the product and have used it for a couple of years, with different applications in mind (and different results).  I quite successfully grew seeds in a purely dirt area, I have successfully filled in ""gaps"" in my grass, and I have unsuccessfully tried to fill in large thin areas of grass.KEY POINTS:- Scotts has a quality product, and quality seeds in my opinion.  There really isn't anything else they can do to make the product ""better"" (without doing some silly packaging gimmicks, which thank goodness they have not).- These seeds will absolutely grow IN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS.  The right conditions are not just ""sprinkle the seed, grab a chair, and watch the grass grow""- You MUST adequately prepare the area.  You need loose dirt to begin with, you need to put the seed down, and then you have to rake in the seeds and really get them in the ground.  You will NOT be successful just sprinkling the seeds on top of bare ground.- You MUST adequately water these seeds.  A bunch.  Every day.  If they get a good soaking, in a couple of weeks you'll start seeing blades, and in a month or two you'll really see nice results.  Even after the seeds become grass, if you stop watering the grass, the blades will die.- You MUST plant in an area that is appropriate; full sun will cook this grass (at least in Texas) and it will die.  On the flip side, you cannot plant the grass in an area with zero sun; nothing will grow in a cave (well, cave crickets, but you know what I'm saying).- Expect to have to fill in spotty areas; even with my successes, the initial version of the grass has been spotty (think mangy dog).  You will have to go back and fill in areas (and again, be prepared to use a rake to get the seeds in the ground, water the heck out of the seeds daily, etc.).- Be gentle with the grass; the first time I mowed my ""new"" grass, the mower wheels ripped up some areas.  These grass is just a bit more delicate than other grasses, so go easy on it.In summary, if you treat these seeds right, you will be rewarded with some nice grass, but don't expect magic; growing anything takes work.

"DISCLAIMER: I had the opportunity to try this product at no charge.I will get right to the point: these razors work great.  At a price point of about $1 each, that falls somewhere between the low and high end of the shaving world.  The cheapie razors are utter garbage; I have tried them all, and wound up gravitating back to Bic's higher end offerings.  These razors so far have held up admirably to multiple uses, and feel 90% as good as the most expensive razors out there (and 100% better than the cheap ones!).

"I was quite fortunate to be able to review this product at no cost in exchange for an honest review.To get to the point, I would call this an attempt to make more money using the Monopoly name, but poorly executed.  We love travel and my son loves Monopoly, so we thought Monopoly World Edition would be a fun twist on regular Monopoly.  This could be a good game, if they hadnt tried to sell it as a Monopoly version.  The main premise is that you travel around the board collecting passport stamps and when your passport book is full, you win.  However, other players can steal your stamps.  In real life, you get a stamp by going someplace and it is stamped in your passport, others cant steal it from you, this is a strange quirk and a not very thought out aspect of the game.  A better choice would have been to have souvenirs from the place you visit and you win by collecting a certain number of souvenirs.  It would make so much more sense to trade or steal souvenirs than passport stamps.  We also thought that the kids would learn something from this game, but the cards are so generic, you dont learn anything about the world or the places you visit on the board.If you want a really quick game (our games were under 30 minutes each) and to teach your kid how to move a piece around the board, you might enjoy it.  If you are looking for a real Monopoly experience but want to try a different version, I recommend Monopoly City.  For my family, this just is not a great game and will likely collect dust until our year 2023 garage sale.  Others obviously enjoy the game, so best of luck, and thanks for reading!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GM61YGHLRJTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THAGEL8#wasThisHelpful","R3GM61YGHLRJTJ","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These feel like very high quality (think Ray Bans or better) sunglasses at a price that doesn't break the bank.  They are very slightly heavy compared to cheapie ones you might find on a convenience store rack.  But they look great.  The tinting looks great from both sides of the lens.  So far after a week's use (including a drop or two, some cleanings, and general use) it looks perfectly brand new, so it does not appear that the tint will wear on the lenses that you normally see with budget priced sunglasses.

"I was lucky enough to get to review this product at no charge.The image is bright when viewed in a very dark location using a screen area of about 60"" or less; however, note that this is rated at 120 lumens of brightness.  That is only about 5% of what most projectors are rated, so you cannot expect it to really compare well head-to-head.  The unit is small and looks nice.  The sales price is VERY inexpensive for what you get (this would have been a $1000 projector a few years back).  The lamp life is rated at 20,000 hours, which is probably TEN times better than a conventional bulb projector.  Unfortunately there are no buttons to change inputs on the unit; you have to use the remote.  Well, I fired up the projector, hooked up my DVD player to it via HDMI, put in new batteries in the remote, and ... couldn't change inputs.  I tried three different sets of batteries before giving up; mine shipped with a completely dead remote, and unfortunately I have not been able to obtain a working one so I can thoroughly review the unit.  The other reviews are overwhelmingly positive, and I'm guessing I was the ""lucky"" one to get a dud.  But unfortunately a dead remote knocks off a couple of stars.UPDATE - I decided to give the remote another fresh try, and the original one DOES indeed work.  Perhaps I didn't try it correctly to begin with; the sensor is on the back of the unit; I tried it from all angles, but must not have tried hard enough.  Plus the remote responsiveness seems slow (but is acceptable, because changing inputs is mostly a one-time thing, plus there IS a dedicated on and off button on the unit).So I did get to give the projector a legitimate try since I could change inputs, and I walked away a little disappointed.  I'm showing an image in my review that was taken during the day on my kitchen wall.  The image is dim, and at night would definitely be better, but nowhere close to a ""real' projector (even another 10 year old Dell projector I have beats the pants off this one, and you can buy that used projector for about the same price).  But the worst part is the entire screen would not focus at once; if you make the image crisp in the middle, the edges go blurry (and vice versa).  You can see this to some degree in the photo I attached with the review (my apologies on the sideways orientation of the photo; cannot rotate it correctly in Amazon).  Bottom line, and to be fair I am something of an audio video snob, this unit will not really cut the mustard for me to watch movies.  For some it may be fine (for example, kids watching a late night movie outdoors).FINAL UPDATE - the customer service has been very responsive, which bumps this up another star.  I truly believe I got a bit of a ""dud"" and that the majority of users will be happy with the product given the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQIEG9RYOPXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154PMK08#wasThisHelpful","R2AQIEG9RYOPXX","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was incredibly fortunate enough to be able to try out a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.  My review does not take into account the price point of this product (which I am certain is the opposite of ""cheap"").My first impression of this rolling travel bag is that it is unbelievably light.  I have been travelling for years and used a variety of bags, but for the size this one takes the cake for being light.  Which should not be confused with not being well-made; the seams, construction, zippers, handle, and wheels (4 wheels so the bag can roll without having to tilt) all seem first-rate; all mechanical functions are ""buttery"" smooth.  There are a number of compartments that should satisfy even the most demanding of travel pros; this is truly and excellent carry-on size bag that is great if you want to avoid checking luggage, and it is sized to accommodate international baggage size limit standards.Lastly (but not least in my wife's opinion), the bag looks wonderful.  It screams ""I'm a travel pro"" and is something that anyone could be proud of when rolling up to the airport, or to stow away in a day meeting where you have to catch a late flight.

"I was fortunate enough to receive the watch in exchange for an honest review.In short, I love it!  Note that the face IS indeed huge.  The band is also fairly large and wide; quite frankly, this watch will work best for larger males (I am very tall and could stand to lose a few pounds, and even I feel like the watch makes my wrists look small!).The color is a light slate grey; just gorgeous.  So far the face seems to be a good quality crystal that is scratch resistant; will update the review if I get any fine scratches, but none so far.The controls are on the left side.  This is my first watch with this configuration; I wear the watch on my left wrist and find the controls much easier to operate using my thumb.In summary, this is a large, fairly heavy watch that looks and feels expensive.

"For this amateur musician, these microphones offer truly excellent pro quality.  They are a significant step up from the ""prosumer"" level mics that you will find at your local electronics store, yet are offered at a price point where you can set up your entire band or have extras for the home studio artist.  I have a $200 condenser microphone (which requires the additional power source, etc), and I can hardly tell any difference between the sound quality (and these D38 mics actually sound a little bit warmer; which I prefer).  Also, I have tested recording an acoustic guitar, and again the mic performed admirably and revealed an incredibly accurate recording of my strumming (warts and all).  They are a bit heavy, and have a very high-quality feel; these will not be confused with toys or cheapie mics.

"These are some great batteries for the money.  Note that they are only rated for 1000mAh hours, which is fairly low compared to other AAs.

"The NB Vazee running shoes are awesome!  I am a heavier runner (close to 200 pounds), and have found these to be great for speedwork training on a track, or for running short races (5Ks to 10Ks).  I have had problems over the years with sinus tarsi syndrome and plantar fasciitis, and have had zero issues with these shoes.  The size is spot on; when wearing Asics I usually go an extra width, but these in D width seem to fit just fine with zero rubbing.The shoes are the lightest I have ever worn (outside of track spike shoes).  It almost feels like you are wearing nothing, except there is sufficient cushioning (much more than you will find in a minimalist type shoe).  For long-distance training or races I am still using heavier shoes with more cushioning.Bottom line, these are some great shoes - highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYIPPM5MVXIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R78V9U8#wasThisHelpful","R3MYIPPM5MVXIV","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I keep these stowed in the ski locker, and when docking I put two on the side facing the dock.

"This is an excellent set of five stainless steel measuring cups, ranging from a small 1/8 cup to a full cup.  They have a nonslip grip that also insulates you from heat; this is a simple but very nice design.  Appearance and build is similar to what I would expect from any high-end manufacturer (Kitchen Aid or better).With the stainless construction, I would expect to be using these for the rest of my life (they do come with a lifetime guarantee).  If you are looking for a nice set of measuring cups for you or as a gift (showers, etc), this is a premium set at a reasonable price.  Highly recommended!UPDATE:  After a couple of weeks of use and washing, still love 'em!

"This book reminds me of why I read books.  This is a well-written and completely engrossing story about friendship and adversity.  The book is a reminder of the struggles and sacrifices that previous generations endured for the benefit of those who enjoy our freedoms today.  I wouldn't be surprised if this deservingly becomes a hit movie; regardless, if you enjoy amazing history, then give this amazing book a try.  This outstanding work comes highly recommended!UPDATE: This is the first time I have ever come back to update a review on book.  Why on earth would I do that?  Well, the book has stuck with me.  I think of it daily; that seems crazy, but that is the case.  I think of the sacrifices that these guys in the book made (especially what the Marines went through in those beyond horrible conditions in Korea), and I think of the men and women throughout our military that continue to make sacrifices in many ways that allows the US to still be the best country in the world.  There are sections in the book that literally drove me to tears, which is fairly unusual for my personality.  A great book really imparts a sense of learning and understanding, and this book accomplished that many times over.  I also happen to be a writer (with zero association of the writer of this book or the publisher), but I can honestly state that if you only buy and read ONE book this year, make it this one.

I use the on without light setting, and it works great.  I have been using it for several weeks now, constantly in the on position, and it has had no issues with needing batteries (I do use AAA rechargeables).The ergonomics are fairly standard but work great; I have larger hands and have no issues with the mouse.

"I received the product at no charge in exchange for an honest review.This is an EXCELLENT little container. It is the approximately size of a standard water bottle, except that it rolls up. The material is rubbery, so it is not very firm (but it stands up on it's own just fine). Storage capacity is 18.9 ounces (so somewhere between your standard 16 ounce and 20 ounce plastic bottles you commonly see). This is a great bottle for backpacking or hiking (where you have your own water filter but don't need to pack in all of your own water).

"I received these batteries to test for free in exchange for an honest review.  One to the review ...UPDATE:  OK, I procured a flashlight that these are designed to work in (SecurityIng 700 Lumens Cree XM-L2 LED Flashlight), which accepts either two CR123 batteries or one of these baby's (the 18650).Well, the 18650 performs admirably and provides several hours of intensely blinding brightness; they last MUCH longer than a flashlight I have that is about half the brightness and uses AA batteries.  If you want what I consider to be an industrial strength rechargeable battery, just be sure this will work in your application (again, some flashlights but NOT all that take CR123 batteries can use this), and these babies won't let you down!............. original review:PLEASE READ - Don't be an idiot like me - these batteries are not AA batteries.  I feel completely stupid for thinking so, but based on the picture I made the wrong conclusion.  These look exactly like AA batteries but are double the physical size.One of these batteries I believe are intended to fit in place of two CR123 flashlight batteries (commonly used on higher quality LED flashlights).  The size is very close to one that I have, but this battery did not quite fit (I might have been able to force it in the tube, but did not want it to get permanently stuck).  I have a couple of flashlights on order, so I will be using and testing these batteries with that application.Note that a special charger is also necessary (will NOT work with most normal chargers that are geared for C, D, AA, and AAA batteries).Seems like a solid product, but take my review with a grain of salt at this point since I was unable to test in a flashlight application.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EBXA52CZP6PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8U187W#wasThisHelpful","R1EBXA52CZP6PP","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, let me state that I am reviewing a free copy of the book, but I have zero ties to the author, and am providing a completely unbiased review.This was an entirely enjoyable and surprisingly outstanding book that encompasses multiple facets, most which completely hit ""home"" with me.First of all, the author is a brilliant writer.  I flew through reading this book, and that is rare for me.  As a child of the 80s and as an adult who is searching for more (and trying to fill some gaps in my youth where I was extremely athletically challenged), I couldn't have enjoyed the book more.Reading the book has inspired me to commit to my own quest to win the master's division in a 10K foot race (""old folks"" 40 years of age or older) that is sponsored by the author's own newspaper, the Austin American Statesman.  My odds are slim, but I believe it is technically possible, and I intend to enjoy the journey in reaching the starting line next April 10th.

"I am truly an independent (when it comes to voting or all other matters).  I am fiscally conservative and socially progressive (which seems to account for most of America, but few politicians truly embrace these two basic concepts).This book does shed lots of interesting light on the business of outrage.  The writing is extremely current and relevant to topics in the news today (and broaches topics as recent as the end of 2014).  The observations are interesting, but quite frankly most of the points mentioned in the book I was already aware of, at least to some degree.  But for those who lean extremely left or right and blindly defend a certain network (be it CNN, Fox, etc), then I would highly recommend this book.In summary, this is a thought-provoking and surprisingly balanced perspective of the climate we live in today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LWYXRMIDKRH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553447750#wasThisHelpful","R3LWYXRMIDKRH0","A3DX5F0CW34Y9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DX5F0CW34Y9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I received the product at no charge in exchange for an honest review.Now to the good stuff - these are a great set of headphones!  I am fairly well qualified to judge; as a hobby I create and product music (including remixes), and I have used a wide range of headphone products (cheap to very pricey).SOUND - A.  Most important to me is the sound quality.  These are the best sounding non-wired headphones I have experienced.  Light years ahead of some wireless Sennheisers I used to use that were a couple of hundred bucks.  While I do not plan on using these to talk on the phone, a brief test showed that they picked up my voice with about the same sound quality as my cell phone.ERGONOMICS - A+.  These fit great, and have plenty of adjustability.  The top extends like most headphones, but the ears swivel (which is very unusual and welcomed).  Also, the ears are at an angle that fit my head perfectly.  These are incredibly comfortable, and would be suitable for a long-haul flight, for example.  The control buttons are located on the headphones for skipping around tracks and volume, and are easily accessible.SETUP / ELECTRONICS - A.  Thorough instructions are included.  Setup was easy on my Windows 8 tablet; the device shows up as ""A1"" and the password is ""0000"".  Range is about 30 feet from your Bluetooth transmitting device.  At first I was confused in not seeing blinking LED indicators, and then I realized that they are ""inside"" one of the earphones (and quite visible once you look).OVERALL - A+.

"For the money I didn't expect much, and my expectations were not met.  I knew that the wig was not included; only sideburns, mustache, and chest hair are included.  Well, the mustache and sideburns are GIGANTIC sized and would never fit on a normal human, plus the material is basically a super cheap felt.  There are tape strips that my wife and I spent about 30 minutes trying to peel; we never succeeded, and in desperation finally fell back to using spirit gum as an adhesive.  We also had to use scissors to cut the pieces down, which looked terrible.The reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the ""chest hair"".  That was awesome.

"I just purchased these for my 2013 Gibson Les Paul Standard with chrome hardware.  These match the hardware fantastically!  And did not require any alterations to my guitar (I can easily go back to stock if I ever wanted).  They are Schaller, so you know the reputation they carry with professional musicians.  Let me tell you, these are solid.  The button rests in the cradle side of the lock, with a spring loaded pin that inserts into the button and keeps it in the cradle.  Installation is very easy, as all you need is a screw driver to set the buttons on the guitar.  It comes with a couple of different length screws.  Just pick the length closest to whatever you just removed!  You'll need a couple of wrenches to install the lock on the strap.  Make sure the hole in your strap is large enough to let the lock stay flat (usually just needs some very minor trimming).  Be careful grabbing the cradle when torquing the nut onto the lock, if you use a wrench, make sure its flat against the base or you could potentially bend the metal of the cradle.My favorite part is the compatibility with all my guitars.  I now have these on my 2001 Gibson ES-335, 1995 Fender American Standard (it is compatible with the Fender branded locks) and my Epiphone Jazz bass from 1986.  And one strap to rule them all!

"I am not a luthier, so I've spent quite a bit of money on having simple setups done.  Now that I own 3 guitars (Stratocaster, Les Paul and ES-335), I figured it's time I learned how to do some of the basic stuff.  The word truss rod used to scare me, but after finishing a satisfying basic setup on my stratocaster with a tricky tremolo, not anymore!To do this properly, you will need some good basic tools and this guage takes care of most of the precision measurement you'll need.  Here is a list of other tools you'll need:-Truss rod tool (look in your case candy if you have a Gibson, and American Fenders use a 1/8"" hex key, MIM use 3/16"" hex)-0.050"" or 1.3mm hex key for setting saddle height/action on a Fender stratocaster American standard-Philips head screwdriver to set the bridge intonation (both fender and Gibson)-a capo for holding down the first fretI found the specs for my guitars online (I would start with the manufacturer website), even some helpful youtube videos to help me thru my first attempt.  I setup each of my guitars and I was really happy with the results.  You can immediately tell this is a high quality guage.  It is made of fairly high guage steel.  The markings are engraved rather than painted on.  In addition to the fine measurement edges, the instrument has a clever fret height guage, fret rocker for locating high frets and a handy units conversion table on the back. Excellent!  I did notice that the fret rocker (3 sides of varying length) is a bit long for higher frets.5 stars!

"This is a fantastic mattress!  I got the queen size to use for guests and wow, I was impressed.  It's very firm and supportive.  Soft enough but not springy.  Lightweight but keeps its shape incredibly well.  Some have posted that it doesn't even need a box spring on bed with slats such as metal bunk beds.  I haven't tried that myself but it is plenty thick.  The package is pretty amazing it come vacuum stuffed into a bag.  I was able to work it out of the draw string bag without ripping the bag (I was hoping to reuse it). But after I let the air in, it expanded to impressive proportions, so there is no humanly possible way to get it back in. (I guess I just need another purpose for the bag.).

"I own a 1995 Fender American Standard Stratocaster that I bought new.  Until recently I never wore a strap because I only played sitting down.  However I've since started standing to play and decided I needed some secure straps.  I bought this set based on the great reviews.  I was preparing to replace the original strap buttons on my stratocaster when I noticed a curious thing.  The strap locks were IDENTICAL to my original buttons!  I had never heard that strats come built in with strap locks and being the original owner, and never having taking the guitar in for servicing, I was 100% sure they weren't replaced.  So I tested it with the Schaller strap locks I have on my Gibson ES-355, and found it's a Schaller style for sure.  Wonderfully secure feeling!

"I own 2 Gibsons guitars: a 2013 Les Paul Standard and a 2001 ES-335.  Both of these guitars are coated in nitrocellulose, a beautiful but somewhat temperamental finish (reacts with many chemicals). Nitrocellulose is only found on vintage and the most expensive guitars, and requires special treatment.  Many have said that Pledge furniture polish works wonders but this is a silicone containing product which is an absolute no-no for these guitars.  Many in the guitar community and professional luthiers swear by a product called virtuoso.  I agree it's a good product but ridiculously expensive.  Gibson sells a ""Pump Polish"" but really it's not a polish at all, but more of a cleaner only.I noticed that Zymol recently released a special guitar polish formula, and I went back to the boards to read about it and I discovered that many people have been using the car polish version with excellent results.  It is an all natural formula WITHOUT silicone. I tried it on a small area of my ES-335 and I was really impressed.  I ended up striping all the hardware and giving it a full polish up.  The guitar looks brand new!  It took some elbow grease but that's exactly what you want, something gentle to prevent you from overdoing it.  I believe this fits the bill perfectly. The best part is its relatively cheap compared with Virtuoso and Zymols dedicated guitar polish, which is most likely just a similar formula to his one.5 stars!

"I have a Gibson Les Paul Standard from 2013 with burstbucker pros.  Supposedly the burstbucker pro is wound to sound like the original PAF (how they actually sounded), while the Classic 57 is wound to the original design specification of PAFs (how they were supposed to be made). I just picked up a gorgeous Gibson ES-335 from 2001 with the Classic 57, and man, I like this way better than the burstbucker pro!  Both are great pickups, but these have such great bite in the lead and smooth in neck I can stop listening to it.  Every note rings so nicely.  Between the 2 pickups I can find great jazzy/bluesy tones and some to just rock out!

"I have been a long time Slingbox user, thru multiple generations of products.  My wife and I use this on a daily basis to watch live and recorded TV from Japan at our home in California.  The technology is wonderful, but has unfortunately been plagued by the recent addition of forced advertisements.  Slingbox is still the leader in Place-shifting but has made some regrettable choices in an effort to improve their revenue stream at the expense of customer user experience.What is ""Place-shifting""?I have long been a fan and strong advocate for the technology of ""place-shifting"" which allows the ability to watch and control your personal media (cable boxes, Tivo, other DVR systems) remotely from outside your home.  Slingbox practically invented this market segment and although there have been several competitors over the years (Sony, Hava, Belkin to name a few), Slingbox still remains the leader in this segment.Ad-supported SlingPlayer (Read on for hints how to block)Since winning a technology lawsuit that forced several competitors to drop out of the market, combined with the increasing pressure from expanding On-demand services (Netflix, Amazon, HBO Go, etc) Slingbox has found themselves in a position to attempt to grow their revenue from ad-supported players, introduced March 2015.  Since that time, Slingbox has undergone a revolt from customers who found ads intrusive and severely impacting a previously pleasant viewing experience (screen viewing area decreased as a result of creating ad space).  It should be pointed out that the SlingPlayers for Mobile Devices, (a $14.99 app) was and still is devoid of ads.  The desktop/web-based SlingPlayer requires watching a pre-roll video ad that lasts about 15secs.  In addition there are banner ads below the viewing screen and above the guide.  In full screen mode, the ads fortunately disappear.  There are some clever ways of blanking the ad banner boxes by changing your hosts file and redirecting known ad-servers to bogus IP addresses (usually the loopback address 127.0.01).  There are special hosts files you can download on the web.  However even these maneuvers which help reduce the ""screen clutter"" of ads, do not fix the fact that part of the viewing screen size was sacrificed to make room for the banner boxes.So, what's new with the M2?Sorry to disappoint here, but the short answer is NOTHING really.  It's just a bundling change.  That was confirmed in an inquiry I made to the SlingMedia Marketing Department.  Indeed, in my tests, there has been no change in operation or performance from that of the M1. The M2 bundle is basically the M1 hardware plus the unlimited mobile ad-supported SlingPlayers for your tablet or smartphone.  That's it!  See below under price for a discussion about which may make more sense you.  (That's all that matters in a bundling change.)Watching on real TV?Since the SlingCatcher was discontinued several years ago, there hasn't been a good solution for watching Slingbox on an actual TV.  Several 3rd party boxes have come and gone but none provided a stable and clean connection (Boxee, Netgear, Sony).  Recently ChromeCast and Roku added a channel for SlingBox but it requires a SlingPlayer on your mobile to work which doesn't make sense that you need 2 devices to make this work (room for more problems).  SlingPlayer on an ipad can be transmitted to an AppleTV device thru airplay but again, you need 2 devices (and only the person with an ipad in hand can use it).  To date the best way I have found to accomplish this is making an HTPC and installing the desktop application or using the web-based player.  In full screen, there are no ads, and the experience is actually quite good.  However, creating an HTPC requires alot of technical know-how that most consumers don't really have.  Thus overall, this is a disappointing area for SlingBox.Watching on the go!  (Your Smartphone!)Attention!  There are now FREE apps for both iPad and iPhone!  These were released July 16, 2015.  The catch?  Everytime you connect, you have to watch a 30sec commercial to get things started.  Sometimes when you switch apps (say to respond to a text message) and go back, you may have to reconnect an watch the 30sec commercial again.  It gets a little old, and when I don't pause my show beforehand and I finally connect again, I find I've missed several minutes of the show and need to go back.  But hey, its free right?  For $14.99 a pop, you can get an ad-free version.  Although I'm not thrilled about shelling out more money, at least there is a choice!  The app itself (outside of ads) is actually very well designed.  You get access to your actual full-featured remote, in a perfect graphical replica to control your TV that appears and disappears at the touch of a screen.  The settings are easy to understand and change.  There is an excellent guide to shows (based on your location and provider that you select during inital setup).  I'm personally not a huge mobile TV viewer but overall, I'd have to say they've done a good job with the apps here.  What's more, the free apps also work with legacy Slingboxs!  I can watch both my M1 and my Slingbox Pro-HDs with the new free app.Setup?Easy.  No playing around with port setups on your firewall.  Just plug in everything (LAN cable too) and go to the setup website (you must be on the same local network for setup).  After answering a few questions about what cablebox (or other device) you are controlling and running a few operational tests, you are done!  Much easier than the past versions.  The only issue is the port number can no longer be customized, only a problem for network geeks (but even I can live with it).How is the picture quality?Overall, its great.  But keep in mind, this all depends on THREE factors:1. Upload speed at the source (where your Slingbox is located)2. Download speed at the viewing location (where your computer, tablet or phone is)3. The internet backbone latency.  These are all the interconnects between your source ISP and your destination ISP.  This is especially important for overseas connections that may rely on limited network connectionsI stream from Japan(Fiberoptic connection about 50Mbps up) to California(TWC about 30Mbps down), crossing the Pacific Ocean (where ever that line runs).  I can usually get HD quality with 2-4K link.  It is actually quite impressive!  When I watch on my home 37"" screen, it's almost like I'm watching local TV!  There are some issues with fast moving things (sports especially) that take extra processing and get locally pixelated but its really not that terrible.  (I watched the 2015 Women's World Cup from my M1, and it was decent quality).  A word about network: I would strongly recommend using an Ethernet connection if possible.  There are really no problems with a WiFi connection, but a hardwire connection in general will provide more reliability (after all, you won't be around to troubleshoot any issue as that is kinda the point of the slingbox).Price (and your options)I'm not entirely sure I understand the price structure at this point in time.  The current Slingbox product lineup includes the M1, M2, 350 and 500.  The M1 currently sells for $120 which other than the name itself, is the same hardware as the M2 (this was confirmed by Slingbox PR office in an inquiry by me).  Indeed, I notice absolutely no performance difference between the M1 & M2.  The M2 sells for $199.  The $70 premium bundles the unlimited free SlingPlayer app (with ads) that are not included with other packages.  If you consider that $70 would purchase 4 SlingPlayer apps (without ads), this likely isn't the choice for you at this pricepoint.  You would probably be much better off purchasing an M1 plus 1 or 2 ad-free SlingPlayers separately ($150 total).  The Slingbox 350 is $95, has excellent quality (HD quality like M1/M2), but lacks WiFi (I suspect the 350 will be discontinued very shortly, but an OK choice if you don't need the WiFi and want to save a few bucks).  The supposed ""flagship"" Slingbox 500 currently costs $235, has no improvement in quality and features an HDMI input that has serious technical concerns given that Slingbox does not allow HDCP protected content.  I cannot recommend the 500.  Thus, the M1 seems to provide the highest value of the entire lineup.Overall, I still have to give the product 2 stars.  I continue use the Slingbox on a daily basis but I really feel this product could be so much better if the ads could just disappear all together (especially on the PC desktop/webplayer versions of the player).  It is a hard pill to swallow especially for those of us who have been long time users.  I also feel that the value of the M2 (at $199 with ad-supported unlimited mobile player downloads) is not as good as the M1 (at $120 with exact same hardware and option to buy ad-free mobile players at $15 a piece)2 stars.  I wish I could give more...Slingbox it's in your hands!","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWN0IDXX16NMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QHAOWO#wasThisHelpful","RWN0IDXX16NMM","A1VPJT3BHZ9UAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VPJT3BHZ9UAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!The TechnologyRather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.The ResultsAs other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.Before you use:You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343JSO3O9K2IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFBGATM#wasThisHelpful","R343JSO3O9K2IC","A1VPJT3BHZ9UAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VPJT3BHZ9UAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Admittedly I agree with many of the comments of the other reviews here.  Oil pans of today are no longer just buckets anymore.  They have splash guards and easy pour spouts for recycling.  On first inspection, it is obvious that this oil pan has none of those features.  It is a simple plastic bucket.  Therefore it is no surprise that people have the complaints they do.

"I bought this for a small electric 4-cycle Honda generator for emergency electrical backup.  Because the generator is something that I use VERY infrequently it is essential that I remove the fluids (oil/gas) with each use.  I needed something small(for convenience of space) and reliable, as I don't want flammable liquids falling in the wrong place on an electric generator.  (Bad combination).  I also use this for my 4-cycle 150cc scooter for regular oil changes.After its field test, I was very happy with the performance of this funnel.  The long neck is especially useful for keeping some separation from the fill hole and pouring location.  That is essential for ensuring a safe fill.  I used it for both gas and oil, wiping it down between one and the other.  I will say that it is a bit tough to wipe inside the long neck, but nothing a twisted paper towel couldn't handle.  I store it with a paper towel crunched in both ends to keep dirt out.  When ready for use I pull them out, wipe the outside and I'm ready to go!5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPVMNVCZ9CGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AXRH5#wasThisHelpful","RSPVMNVCZ9CGU","A1VPJT3BHZ9UAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VPJT3BHZ9UAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of prime lens and 50mm is one of those sweet spot focal lengths that should be in every camera bag, if not on the camera itself!  Canon produced a massive hit with the affordable f1.8 50mm, dubbed the nifty-fifty.  It was succeeded by the II, which sadly saw some corners cut in build quality with the transition to a plastic base.  (While I have commented in prior reviews that I challenge the ""need"" for metal mounts in smaller, lighter lenses, I can't help but admit that I prefer a metal mount.). This latest iteration of the venerable ""nifty-fifty"" sees the return of the metal mount and upgrades the focus mechanism to the silently speedy STM stepping motor!OpticsWhat's not to love about a f1.8 lens?  The optics are excellent as you would expect from the reputation of its prior versions.  Talk about a fast lens, you can take some pretty incredible shots in poor light conditions with this.  Beautiful bokeh!  It provides excellent separation of your subject from the background, as if they jump out of the picture.  I was very pleased with my results on a recent flower viewing trip.  Terrific color representation, minimal chromatic aberration and distortion.  It will not disappoint!Focus mechanismIf you haven't tried STM yet, prepare to be amazed.  Fast and quiet!  Great for video work too.  I'm very happy with the Canon STM lineup.Build QualityAs mentioned previously, the metal mount has returned. (I can hear the cheering!). The barrel feels a little less sturdy than the 24mm and 40mm pancakes, but all in all, it's an improvement over the prior version.  Considering its price, it is quite an impressive piece of work.PriceCheap, it would be hard to imagine anyone not happy with the priceMy recommendation is to run outside right now and buy this lens.  You won't be disappointed.5 stars.

"I owned a Fender Deville 212 prior to getting the 410 version III.  The basic amp design and sound is nearly identical and has gone thru very little change in the near 20 years since Fender released this best seller.  This amp is quite a familiar sight in many studios and on stages of both professional and superstar musicians.  It embodies a classic sound that fender is well known for.Improvements over prior versionWhy should you consider an upgrade?  By far an away the most important change is the volume pot redesign.  As anyone who has ever played on the older version can tell you, there was hardly any control for the volume of this beast.  The slightest movement in the knob would cause all hell to break loose.  Now the new knob has a more linear and therefore more manageable control.  Thank god!  Actually there are some good 3rd party mod kits to change the old ones, but who wants to go thru that trouble or risk damaging their amp.  The version III finally gets the knob correct!The silver panel for knobs has become more user friendly by becoming black.  I used to have to put masking tape labels on to see in dark rooms. Not with this one.  Very easy to read, even in low light.The power tubes now have a protective cage.  I never had much of a problem with prior versions but I definitely feel a lot safer storing and pulling things out from the back cabinet (I keep some heavy duty speaker cables back there).ProsMagnificent cleans!  Although it takes pedals extremely well, lately I find myself just plugging straight in!Linear volume knob (See above)Loud enough for larger venues.  Need more?  Mic it!8 ohms (versus 212 that is 4 ohms) plugs into many more speaker cabinetsGreat cover!Incredibly popular with 20 years of production means easy to find servicing and partsConsHeavy!

"Fantastic for a medium sized venue!The first time I heard it I was impressed, when I found out the price, I was in disbelief!  Beautiful amplification, and flat frequency response (just makes your sound louder, no tint to sound).  Can take keyboards, synthesizer directly or any line in from other instruments (I have DI inputs from Guitar and bass too).  Totally scalable with ""PowerLink"" (via XLR cables) as you can daisy-chain as many of these as you want to fit your venue or number of inputs.  Each additional unit adds 2 more inputs to your mix.  I personally use this directly from my Nord Piano 2 in combination with a Powerwerks Subwoofer PW 112S which together make an awesome tower pair (the subwoofer takes a speaker pole and acts as a mount for the tower).

"Vaseline products set the standard for over-all body lotions.  This particular variety provides instant relief for dry skin and lasting moisture to repair problem dryness.  I love that they left out the overwhelming perfume-y smell that so many lotions have.  For me, it absorbed well, moisturized well and felt great on my skin.  On top of that, you get a giant bottle for less than a tiny tube of something that wouldn't work any better.  Highly recommended.  One note: It did leave my hands feeling greasy.

"These were cute boots and the quality seemed in line with the price point.  Unfortunately, they did not fit my feet.  I thought I'd be OK having chosen a rounded toe boot and ordered a half size up from what I normally wear.  Not only were they too short in the length but my toes felt cramped on the sides too.  Since these are ""pleather"" there was little hope of them stretching out to fit.If you can find a pair that fit, they wouldn't be a bad boot, provided you remember they are a ""fashion"" boot, not something designed for hiking or harsh weather.  Note: the top of the boot flares out which is great if you want to tuck some skinny jeans in but not so great if you want to wear a straight leg pant over the boot.

"What's not to like here?  These have a cute design that didn't fade when heated, are thick enough to do the job, peel off the muffin easily and are affordably priced.  The little plastic packaging keeps their form pristine through shipping and storage in my pantry.  As others have mentioned, these are sized for old-school standard size muffin pans not the giant tins popular today.  If you have a thick muffin batter, you can often fill a standard size muffin more than recommended and bake an oversized muffin in a cup this size.  Don't try that with a runny batter though- it will just be a hot mess.Pan spray works fine for muffins and cupcakes too but sometimes it is just nice to have them baked in a paper to make them more festive and portable.

"As you might guess from the small jar size, this product is intended for spot hydration, more than as an all-over body lotion.  When applied to large areas, it takes quite a while to rub in.  If I wanted to moisturize my legs, for example, I'd pick something else.  This cream is best dabbed on sparingly  for targeted moisturizing of specific areas, neck, elbows, knees.  The scent is light and though it takes a while to absorb, it must really get deep into the skin because the moisturizing effect is still noticeable the next morning.

"Once I finally got this installed, it works wonderfully. Installation was a day long event, though that was entirely because of Comcast- not of any fault in the TP-Link device.  It took me 3 phone calls to finally get it activated and provisioned with Comcast.  If you are going to try self-activation, let me caution you to use your Comcast account number and phone number to log in.  DO NOT use your e-mail and saved password to log into that activation page.  For whatever reason, that was a stumbling block for me.  Even after we cleared that, Their agent still had to preform a ""hard reset"" on the TP LInk to get it working.  The old jam the paperclip into the hole in the back trick...  I also think you are better off if you can activate it using a hardwired connection first and then set up the wireless connections, if you have a PC with an Ethernet port.Anyway, once it was activated, I had no trouble getting my wireless devices to recognize it.  Kudos to TP Link for giving a simple 8 digit numerical PIN rather than some 16 character alpha-numeric code that is a nightmare to key in on a printer, phone or TV.  You can also use the push button WPS to link up your devices if they have that option.  Router works fine with Yoga laptop, Samsung phone, LG Smart TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick.My wireless range throughout the house is definitely better than before.  I get good signal strength in  the far corners of the upstairs where it used to drop out with my Motorola modem/router.  I'm not sure my connectivity and speed problems are fixed though.  I still get buffering issues with my Amazon Fire Stick.  Again, this is likely not the fault of the TP Link.  It can only work as well as your cable signal input.  If you have poor speeds from your ISP or your house has crappy wiring, this is not going to be a magic bullet for those issues.  {You can make Comcast come out to check your signal strength and tune things up.  Just make sure they add on the line protection coverage to your account first so you don't have to pay for the service call.  They added a small device to one of my cable outlets to boost the cable signal strength and it made a huge difference.}Back to the TP Link----  The most intriguing feature of this device for me is the 2 USB ports.  I have an external  Hard drive plugged into one.  Now I can back up both my PC and my laptop to the same hard drive- wirelessly- without having to be some sort of networking wizard.  The laptop can get at the PC's backed up files even if the PC isn't turned on, since it all runs through the router.  {Suggestion, do your initial backup hardwired and then do subsequent incremental backups wireless.  The wireless back up of my music and photo files took more than a full day.}  I plugged a printer into the other USB.  The printer was already wireless but would sometimes loose connectivity for no reason.  This gives me a back up option for when that happens, but I assume it would also enable you to share a non-wireless printer across your home network, again without requiring network administrator skills.For me, the only thing that would make this device even better is if it included telephony services so I could ditch all of Comcast's modem/gateway equipment.  As it is, I still have to pay the monthly fee for their modem just for the telephone.  If you don't have Comcast phone service the TP-LINK Archer CR700 is hands down a slam dunk choice.  Even if you do have Comcast phone, it is still worth it for the dual band and two USB port functionality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R285FJPH4ZR4L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012I96J3W#wasThisHelpful","R285FJPH4ZR4L2","A28TWWUAWFVCTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28TWWUAWFVCTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Columbia sizing runs small (and I do NOT) so I ordered up one size.  These are simply wonderful hiking pants.  Comfort is the most important thing but if you can be stylish in the process, that's a plus.  These pants nailed it in both categories.  They are spendy but worth every penny.  So much better than zip-off pants with that cumbersome zipper.  I found these light enough for a pretty warm day yet surprisingly warm for the chilly start of the hike.  I purchased them in Long even though I'm 5' 6"" because I hate pants that are too short.  They are perfect length with my hiking shoes though they'd drag if I wore them with sandals.  The only caveat is that I think that makes them longer when rolled up too.

"I tested both the Bloody Mary mix and the Margarita mix.  It won't let me post a separate review for each so the two are combined below.BLOODY MARY:  I've never had a Bloody Mary before so I can't say how authentic this mix is, but I found it tasty.  It has a good tomato taste, slight kick and made a decent drink using some pretty generic vodka.MARGARITA: Margaritas are in my top 3 of adult beverages.  I don't bother with making them from scratch so I have tried a variety of mixers and consider myself well qualified to pass judgement on this offering by Mr & Mrs T.  Sorry to say, I didn't really care for it.  Granted, I didn't start out with top shelf hooch but I'd say it was comparable to a ""well"" liquor at a bar.  This mix is a single serve can.  One can plus 1.5 ounces of tequila makes one drink.  The taste was vaguely chemical and not remotely similar to an authentic margarita.  Furthermore, there are THIRTY grams of sugar in each of these tiny cans.  That is a 130 empty calories for something that tastes nasty.  Instead I recommend Baja Bob's Sugar Free mixer.  It makes a tasty drink with any mid-level tequila and contains ZERO grams of sugar.In my opinion, convenience is all these have going for them.  Baja Bob makes single serve packets and  though I haven't tried those, I'd certainly suggest you give those a try instead of this brand. Zero calories and about half the price per serving.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SK4VBS7DQNSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYR51NA#wasThisHelpful","R1SK4VBS7DQNSE","A28TWWUAWFVCTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28TWWUAWFVCTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Looking at the price, I figured these must be poor quality cases made of some sticky silicone.  All the positive reviews encouraged me to give them a try anyway and I am sure glad I did.  They are the perfect combination of grippy in your hand but sleek enough to slide into a pocket.  They are soft and pliable on their own, but once they're on your phone, they feel more like a hard case. They require a bit of work to get them on, which is a testament to their precision fit.  They give better edge protection than the previous hard cases I've used and have a slightly raised lip which protects the screen if laid face down.  They are transparent so the actual color of back of your phone along with any writing on it will show through to some extent but from any distance, you just notice the bright rainbow color de jour.I have no trouble removing the case to switch colors or swap out my battery with a spare (Hey Samsung- why don't your new phones have replaceable batteries anymore???)  and all the buttons, ports, microphone and camera cut outs are perfectly aligned so as to not interfere with access.

They grow between the cracks of my patio pavers and in the gravel of my driveway- both areas where weeds are impossible to pull and are very noticeable and unsightly.

"First thing to note for fans of the Bones TV show: The books bear little resemblance to the show.  Temperance Brennan is still a forensic specialist but that is were any similarity ends. The two may have the same education but are in a completely divergent life.  Not just the setting and surrounding cast of characters are different, but the Tempe in the book is much less of a pedantic, out of touch ""squint"" than the TV Tempe.  I am a huge Bones fan but I actually like the book character more.  She is much more believable and accessible.  It cracks me up that the book actually makes pop culture references to the show several times in the same breath with ""CSI"".Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  You can read the publisher's summary for the basic plot points.  The science, though authentic is not overwhelming, the backstory of Temperance's family and love life will be of interest to faithful readers of the series but doesn't lose those who've picked up the book as a stand alone.  The author has a habit of ending chapters with an ominous cliff hanger sentence which gets a bit annoying  but other than that, I enjoy her writing style.

The design really ""pops"" from the hint of shadow around each detail. It has a quality look and feel in every respect.  I normally prefer a 20"" chain and I was afraid I'd need to add an extender, but the drop of the pendant is about an inch and a half so it hits me just about where I'd want it.  I would prefer a slightly heavier chain over the delicate one it came with but the slide on the pendant is ample enough to easily swap it out for a different one from my jewelry box if I'm so inclined.As with all items from the Amazon Collection, this comes in a pretty, fancy box.  This will make a stunning gift that will look like you spent a whole lot more than you really did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L16IGXZRW64F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZ87JI#wasThisHelpful","R1L16IGXZRW64F","A28TWWUAWFVCTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28TWWUAWFVCTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"McCormick is the brand I always buy at my local grocery store.  I go through a lot of Almond extract in my homemade granola so recently I've been getting the Rodelle brand from Amazon because it comes in a big bottle.  I was surprised to see that (as of today's pricing) the McCormick 8 oz bottle is actually less per ounce than the Rodelle in the 16 oz bottle!  Both contain the same ingredients: Water, Alcohol and Oil of Bitter Almond and either will be a wonderful ingredient for any recipe calling for almond flavor.  I don't recommend trying to save a few pennies by buying the imitation stuff.  The real, pure extract makes a noticeable taste difference and the extra cost is well worth it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BLT8GLWHQMUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNMF5CI#wasThisHelpful","R3BLT8GLWHQMUP","A28TWWUAWFVCTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28TWWUAWFVCTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cleaner is similar to 30 Seconds Outdoor Cleaner.  Spray on, let it sit, scrub any stubborn spots and hose off with clean water.  The liquid is not toxic to plants nor does it stain clothes the way bleach does.  It took off the light coat of grunge on my patio chairs easily but did not help the etched in spots that have defied several other cleaning products on previous attempts. My problem is that the hose-end spray feature of the container is about the worst designed thing EVER.  Here is the best case scenario: After you screw it on to your hose, turn on the water before you do anything with the spray nozzle. Then push the little tab (that is so stiff it actually hurts your thumb) and turn the dial to begin spraying.  If you do this out of sequence, ie push the tab, turn the dial and then turn on the water, it will start spraying all over the place before you walk back from the faucet to the sprayer.The real issue comes when you are done spraying soap and want to rinse off with plain water.  It is a two handed struggle to push the tab (ouch) and turn the dial, (as you waste soap the whole time). Then walk back to the faucet and turn the water off- but, you still have pressure in your hose!  You either have to push the tab (ouch again) and turn the dial to release the pressure (and waste soap) or unscrew the bottle from the hose that still has water pressure and get water all over yourself.  Stupidest thing ever.To redesign the sprayer, put a 3 position slider on the bottle: Off, Water Only and On .  That way,  I can control how and when I dispense soap, rinse off my item without having to detach the bottle and easily release the water pressure when I want to disconnect from the hose.  This isn't rocket science.  In fact I have another spray lawn product ALSO MADE BY SCOTT'S that has a perfectly designed dispenser with that exact design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2XCVA3FFBQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZO2YS#wasThisHelpful","RQ2XCVA3FFBQU","A28TWWUAWFVCTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28TWWUAWFVCTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crescent is a go-to brand in tools and this socket set lives up to the name.  The set comes packaged in a compact carry case.  The individual pieces are held in place by a foam pad rather than having a tight, snap in/snap out fit you have to struggle with.  The ratchet action is smooth, the handles and sockets both have a quality feel to them.  I can't find a single thing wrong with this tool set.

"I also own the Swingline Optima 45 which sells at a similar point, so I will make my review a comparison of these two comparable staplers.  Both can handle up to 45 sheets though the Speed Pro also accommodates staples with a longer length which better cope with big stacks of paper.  I appreciate that this model has a smaller footprint than the Optima 45 but it lacks several features of the Optima.1.  No on board staple storage for spare staple strips2.  Staple position is a fixed distance from paper edge.  The Optima can adjust to staple right near the paper's edge or have a set-back of up to an inchThe biggest consideration is noise.  The Optima makes a gentle whirring noise when it staples.  The Speed Pro makes a sharp, fast LOUD sound like a nail gun.  Scared the heck out of me the first time!  I would get complaints from co-workers if I used this in a quiet office setting.  It's powerful, fast & sturdy but really, really loud.  If you're running the parts counter at a garage or somewhere that is already noisy, go ahead and buy with confidence.  Otherwise, check out the Optima 45.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RK2EDZ9NID68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIM5L6O#wasThisHelpful","R1RK2EDZ9NID68","A28TWWUAWFVCTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28TWWUAWFVCTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a charming little necklace.  The chains are quite thin and delicate.  The two chains, one slightly longer than the other, are independent of one another and each connect right to the clasp, which has an extender to accommodate various necklines-and neck sizes.  As with most dual chain necklaces, the two do tend to twist together at the back as the day goes on but not as bad as some others I've worn.  The garnet and butterfly, being in a fixed position rather than a sliding pendant, do occasionally go off center as you move, but they have enough weight to stay basically in the right position.  And the clasp always stays where it belongs too.I was afraid this would be too ""little girly"" for a grown woman but the quality exceeded my expectations.  I do think a young girl would just love this but be mindful of those delicate chains if choosing this for a child.  The garnet is the January  birthstone, but anyone can enjoy this piece and find items in their wardrobe it will compliment.

"This clever pot holder is designed to slid onto the handle of a frypan, if you have pans with non-insulated handles. It's a great idea, since it will stay put so you don't forget, grab the handle and burn yourself.  It's compact size should also keep it from posing any fire hazard by getting too close to the burner.  It is thick enough to give good protection and the silicone stripes give excellent grip. Personally, I'll be using it as a hot pad with a toaster oven so I really like the compact size, approx 10"" x 6"".  While it is a tad small to use for handling large cookie sheets or casserole dishes in a full size oven, it is perfect for a toaster oven or maybe for use in an RV kitchenette.One thing to note, the hanging loop is sewn so it lays flat, facing the pad instead of sticking out from the edge.  This gives it a nice clean silhouette but does make hanging it on a hook a two handed operation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VV95S2O58QDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UABRF84#wasThisHelpful","R1VV95S2O58QDK","A28TWWUAWFVCTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28TWWUAWFVCTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are great gloves for most any situation where you want to protect your hands from whatever it is that you're handling.  Whether it's garden chemicals, paints or stains, cleaners or solvents, craft glue or the car wash water - your hands will stay clean and dry in these heavy duty gloves.  I wouldn't recommend them for stuff that is super sharp or pokey.  Even though they're puncture resistant,  you wouldn't choose them for pruning roses or stacking firewood.  But they are ideal for anything liquid or granular.  Personally, I'm really looking forward to having my hands not smell like iron after the next time I put moss out on my lawn!Size-wise, they fit my husband's hands snugly enough that he has sufficient dexterity for intricate work.  On me, they are a bit loose but I can still use them for basic tasks.  They seem quite durable.  I spread out half a bag of fertilizer by hand and the gloves were still in such good shape I saved them for the second half of the bag.

"For $8.43, this seems to be an expensive option for carrying spare batteries. I've used these in the military, and was wondering if the ""civilian"" version was worth the price. Well, it's pretty good.The product I ordered is the Clear color, AA holder that holds twelve batteries. It's 3-7/8"" long, 2-1/8"" tall, and 1-1/2"" thick. The batteries are kept side-by-side, not staggered. All of the AA batteries I've found - alkaline, lithium, NiMH, lithium ion (10440), and nickel cadmium - all fit just fine without tearing the battery wrapper. The retention of the batteries is nice: they do rattle a little bit, bit they're in tight enough to not fall out even when shaking the battery holder. This is true whether the batteries are inserted positive side up or down. A small tab keeps the batteries inside until you push them out. The plastic itself is a tiny bit flexible, but not bendable, if that makes sense. I wanted to use a hacksaw to divide the holder into multiple smaller holders, but the plastic is too thin to do this without sacrificing some of the battery spots. The batteries can be inserted either way - button side up or down - and still not have either end touch anything else. Good polarity protection.There's not a lot more to say about these. Yeah, you can hold some batteries positive side up or down to tell which are used, but almost any battery holder will allow you to do that. These aren't waterproof, but you can easily just slide one into a zip-lock bag. For the cost, I'm satisfied with this battery holder.

"This is the updated version of the Inova X1. It was updated in June of 2011, and again from 55 lumens to 80 in February of 2014, so if you bought one since then, you can disregard. At just 2.1 ounces and 4"" long, it's quite compact. For the $18.90 cost, it's a good light. The price keeps it from being a ""great"" light, as there are many other lights that use one AA battery and have comparable output. Inova is owned by Nite Ize now. That means production is in China, but the quality is still good.The X1 I got is black. The anodization is nicely done, with no splotches or uneven coloring. It's not quite glossy and not quite matte; it's a good compromise. The light is 4"" long and 3/4"" thick, and weighs 2.1 ounces with an alkaline battery. The light is made out of aluminum and is thick for such an inexpensive light. You can run it over with a car without denting it. The bezel (the shiny part towards the front) is stainless steel, and is a nice contrast to the body of the light. The lens is plastic, not glass, but it's pretty thick. The reflector is aluminum as well, and has a light orange peel texture. There are no artifacts (halos, dark spots, or an uneven beam) but the beam is still quite ""throwy"". It's nice and tight. Not as tight as say, a Streamlight ProTac AAA, but still good. The beam can't be adjusted or focused, but that's okay with me. The LED is a Cree XP-E.The tailcap screws on (the head is pressed on and not designed to be removed) and is how you operate the light. It has a hole machined through it for a lanyard, and there's some knurling at the end to help in turning the switch. Tighten the tailcap for high mode, and loosen it then tighten it again for low mode. High mode is advertised as 80 lumens and low mode is 11 lumens. You can also loosen the tailcap just a little bit and you'll be able to press and hold the tailcap down for momentary mode: hold for high mode, then let go and press it in again within two seconds for low mode. Let go at any time to turn off. The tip of the tailcap has a rubber cover to be a bit soft on your finger when using this mode. I tested the output numbers, and the high peaked at 83 lumens while the low mode peaked at 12 lumens, each on a fresh Duracell alkaline. I also tested runtime: In high mode with a Duracell alkaline battery, the light will run for 3 hours and 39 minutes minutes. In low mode, it will run for 69 hours, 41 minutes.So, how is it? It's good. Not perfect, but very fair for the price. Its beam is tight and smooth, and I like it. The white light is actually white, not ugly blue or yellow like most ""cheap"" flashlights. The fit and finish are great, and it feels like a very tough  piece of equipment (which it is). Would I buy another one if I lost this one? Yes, I would. Pick one up if you need a simple, durable,  inexpensive flashlight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RODHV8MBGL6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YI1T4K#wasThisHelpful","R3RODHV8MBGL6G","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Coast HP1 runs on one AA battery. You can use a lithium ion (14500) for more output as well. For ten dollars, this is a great light. Why not five stars then? Well...The light is made of aluminum, which is anodized black. The anodization is Type II, and the black scratches off very easily. I mean, I used a soft metal (non-marring) caliper arm to attach an O-ring for more grip, and that scratched it. The LED is an R2 (I'm pretty sure) which is good for throw, but there's no reflector in this light. Since it's a zoomie (adjustable flood-to-throw using an optical lens which slides forward or backward) the ""throw"" isn't as good as it could have been with a reflector. The tailcap is also a little bit ""mushy"" in that there's some, well, mush in it until it clicks on. The lanyard hole is too small for any split ring I have, and I have some small split rings for flashlights. That's the bad. Now, the review...The light is 4"" long and 1"" wide at the head. At the body and tailcap, it's about 0.8"" (4/5"") in diameter. It weighs 3.8 ounces with an alkaline battery. It can use any AA size: alkaline, lithium, carbon zinc, NiMH, or lithium ion (14500). I tested mine with alkaline and lithium ion, and I used ANSI standards; the results are below.Runtime to 10%, Duracell Coppertop alkaline (2200 MaH): 3 hours, 39 minutes.Runtime to 10%, UltraFire 14500, 900MaH: 58 minutes, but it got very hot. I thought it might melt the plastic lens.Runtime to 10%, Rayovac NiMH 1400 MAH: 2 hours, 11 minutes.The output was as follows, starting after 30 seconds of being on:Duracell Coppertop alkaline: 96 lumens.UltraFire 14500 lithium ion: 193 lumens.Rayovac NiMH: 66 lumens.So, the 220 lumen claim is a little optimistic, but that may have been taken right when the light was turn on, or right when the 14500 battery was taken off the charger. Still, at 193 lumens, it's bright for its size.At no point did the light get too hot to hold, and there was no damage from running it for almost an hour on the 14500: no melted lens, no melted tailcap parts, no dying switch, no nothing.The head can slide back-and-forth to zoom in or out: slide the head out to get a farther beam, but not as much flood. Pull the head into the body, or at any point in between, to get a smoother beam that's not as focused. It works well, but I found it to be too slick; the zoom is too loose. I had to put some O-rings on the body to prevent the head from sliding back too easily, and it's not much better. Also, when zoomed all the way in, a lot of lights will project a square in the center, being the zoomed-in LED itself. The HP1 doesn't do that. It's not perfectly round, but it's a lot better than the other ones.The tailcap screws on easily, and has the appropriate O-ring. The switch is plastic and screws in. The switch is just one mode, on or off. It's a forward clicky, meaning you can press it softly for momentary light, or just press it until it clicks for constant light. A tiny lanyard hole is drilled in, but it's too small to be of any use to me.The body is a nice size and texture, with aggressive gunstock checkering machined in. The pocket clip attaches via two Torx (T-6) screws, and allows for a bezel-down carry. It can be removed, but not moved to any other position. It's just fine as far as tightness and placement: about 3/4"" of the light sticks out of the pocket when inside.The overall quality is good on this one: O-rings where they should be, no splotched or chipped anodizing, no gouges in the knurling, no machining marks, the metal is thick enough to not dent on the first few drops, nothing loose that's not supposed to be, none of the stuff you find on the cheap China lights you get at the dollar store.For ten bucks, buy a few. Stash one in your backpack, one in your car, one in your gym bag, etc.These are some of the best flashlights you can get for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH183Q6VSB8BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEMUOWU#wasThisHelpful","RH183Q6VSB8BZ","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After having many problems with the Streamlight Nano (ugly beam, low battery life, the light unscrewing itself) I tried the UST Pico Lite 1.0. Despite using the same batteries, costing around the same, and having the same listed output, the Pico is way better. It's essentially a rebranded and redesigned eGear Pico Lite, the differences being:-The UST has smoother, deeper, and farther-spaced machining in the head to turn on and off. The eGear felt more like knurling, while the UST is just a few grooves. Both work just fine.-Likewise, the back of the light has changed the machining from knurling to smooth grooves.-The UST has a slightly smaller battery cage.The light uses four LR41 (also called AG3) batteries, and they're housed in a neat little plastic carrier. The batteries are too tiny to really put in the light without them flipping around, so eGear made this thing and UST slimmed it down a tiny bit. Way to go! I haven't ran one all the way down yet, so I can't comment on battery life. The battery cages are interchangeable between the eGear and the UST. I'll say that side-by-side with the Nano, the Nano is much dimmer and the Pico is still very bright. Output is 10 lumens, which is enough to do a lot of tasks in a dark room. The beam is white with a hot spot and smaller spill beam; it's very useful. The LED itself is exposed, but for a 5mm LED that's not uncommon.The construction of the Pico is great, even better than the Nano. The head is easy to use one-handed. A small gate clip is attached for keyring use, and it's the same one used on the Nano. Meaning, it's pretty good.I like the Pico a lot; it's the keyring light that the Nano should have been. I have several for keychains, zipper pulls, and small kits. The one I bought - the blue one - was six dollars. Yeah, I'll be getting more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354B5BBQLFUBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVX4BF2#wasThisHelpful","R354B5BBQLFUBJ","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This knife costed $33.35 including shipping, and was from BladeShop. That's the lowest price I've seen anywhere for it. So, how is it? It's an Emerson, built by Kershaw. how do you think it is!?-The knife is 4-1/2"" closed and just under 1/2"" thick. It weighs 4.8 ounces. The handles are made with 410 stainless steel liners, both bead-blasted. The locking side is a frame lock with no handle scale. The lock is very secure, engaging at about the 50% point. There's no blade play in any direction. The lock release has some light jimping, but I wish it were a little deeper. The entire knife is held together with #1 Phillips screws, except the blade pivot pin screw, which is a small flathead screw. There's jimping on the blade spine and the thumb rest of the handle, as well as the area your pinky finger sits on, but again, I wish it were deeper.-The other side has another liner, not drilled out. Over it is a slab of black G-10. It feels about where the Spyderco Tenacious does, in terms of roughness and thickness. The pocket clip is for tip-up carry only, as the ""wave"" feature won't work well in tip-down carry. Although the advertising says it's for left or right hand carry, it will only attach to the right hand (locking) side of the knife. This is because the G-10 handle scale makes it too long for the screws to thread into. There is also a lanyard hole, and it's fine: where it should be, not in the way, and will accommodate two strands of gutted 550 cord.The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel, and is heat treated to 57-59 on the Rockwell scale. It's 1/8"" thick and has a nice finish to it: the grind is stonewashed, and the flats are satin finished. The grind is fine on mine: a typical hollow grind (both sides of the blade are ground) at about a 23 degree angle. The grinds were even and smooth. The cutting edge is 3-1/4"" long. It was very sharp right out of the box, and stropped up to razor sharpness very quickly. A blackened thumb disc is screwed to the top to facilitate normal thumb opening. I've found that the ball detent used to keep the blade closed is a little too strong, and a normal thumb push is difficult. Instead, I have to ""pop"" it out with my thumb nail, making a loud ""click"" sound as the blade flies open and locks. Neat, but some people may not like it.-The last feature of the knife is the ""wave"" feature itself. If you don't know already, it's simply a small unsharpened hook that protrudes from the spine of the blade. While the knife is in your pocket, the wave sits against the seam of your pocket. If you pull back, it will snag on the seam and ""pop"" open. This is normally done to have the knife end up edge out / blade up in your hand. If you keep the pocket clip on the right side and put the knife in your left pocket, you now have a knife that opens up edge out / blade down.In general, this is an excellent knife. I don't like the bead blast, but that's easily fixed with five minutes using a steel wool pad and some polish. For a $35 knife made in China, this thing is great. Kershaw and Emerson really outdid themselves with the CQC line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2KCSHI3IMVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0RSVQK#wasThisHelpful","R1I2KCSHI3IMVV","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The venerable Farmer is up to $30 now. That's a bit high, but the quality is still there. The Farmer is 3-5/8"" long when closed and is 7/16"" thick. It weighs 3.7 ounces. The liners are aluminum, as are the ribbed Alox (aluminum oxide) handle scales. The ribbed texture gives a better grip than the smooth Alox, and it hides scratches and wear better. On the back is a small (3/4"" by 1/4"") smooth rectangle so you can engrave something on it. The standard Victorinox split ring is attached, which is just a 3/8"" diameter steel split ring. The Farmer is basic, but very capable. None of the blades or tools lock, just so you know. Here's the tool layout, sorted by the layers:-The knife blade. It's a little larger than a standard Swiss Army Knife blade, at 2-3/4"" long with a 2-5/8"" cutting edge. It's 56 on the Rockwell scale, and is pretty easy to sharpen. It's your basic Victorinox blade: easy to take an edge, very stain-resistant, and low to medium edge retention. In truth, if you dull the blade before you can touch it up, you probably should have brought a more appropriate tool. The blade opens via nail nick.-The reamer. It's 1-1/2"" long and sharpened to poke holes in things. The arm of the reamer is sharpened on one side as well, enabling you to use it as a fire steel striker. A small lip allows you to open it. I wish this were the standard reamer on all Swiss Army Knives and not just the Alox models, but I see why the flat awl makes more sense on the others.-The middle layer houses the wood saw. It's 2-7/8"" long with some very aggressive teeth. They're kerfed, meaning the teeth are thicker than the spine so the saw doesn't get stuck in wood. They will cut on both the push and pull stroke. The saw is a little flexible, which you want in a saw. The spine is sharp, giving you one more option to strike a ferrocium rod if you have to. A few people don't like the keyring attachment's placement since it digs into the hand while using the saw, so they file it off. I've never experienced this problem, but if it bugs you, that's a quick fix.-The last (or first, if you're looking at the Victorinox shield on the handle) layer has the bottle opener / wire stripper / large screwdriver. It's 1-1/4"" long and just over 1/16"" thick. The bottle opener works just fine. The large flathead screwdriver is 1/4"" wide, so you can get some torque in larger screws. This tool also has a detent in the halfway position, allowing for even more torque. You can use this tool for light prying, although Victorinox doesn't warranty that.-The other tool on this last layer is the small screwdriver / can opener. It's 1-1/4"" long and will open cans of food quickly. The proper technique is to cut forward, but either way will work. That flathead screwdriver tip is just under 1/8"" wide, and it will work with most #2 or #3 Phillips screws as well.Overall, the Farmer is a great tool. I think the price is getting a bit high, but it's still worth the cost. There are other colors available from time to time: red, blue, and even black. Those will cost a little more money, but the quality is just as good as the plain-Jane aluminum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MBXCHP9LPI8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6LOKLA#wasThisHelpful","R1MBXCHP9LPI8O","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fenix E01 is a simple, one-mode twisty flashlight. It costs around $14. What should you expect?Expect a good, basic flashlight. The E01 is made of durable aluminum, and has been described as ""bomb proof"" by flashlight aficionados. The body tube is one fixed piece with the tail, and has some nice knurling on it. Be advised that the anodization wears off quite quickly if it's rubbing against things like keys or pocket change. A simple split ring is included so you can attach the light to something, and it goes in the one open lug on the tail. This also allows the light to stand on its end while in use, in effect giving you a ""candle"". The E01 is quite compact at 2-3/4"" long and 1/2"" in diameter.The LED is a white 5mm Nichia, and all of the E01s I've seen tend to have a blue-ish, blobby tint to them. Output is 13 lumens, but this isn't a pocket rocket. It's made for long runtime. I've gotten 30 hours out of a fresh AAA alkaline battery. A no-name heavy duty (read: cheap!) battery is provided. This light will also run for a while on your almost-dead batteries, so that's good. The head twists to turn the light on. Tighten the head to turn on, loosen it a 1/4 turn to turn off. One-handed use is easy. The reflector is a dulled matte aluminum finish, regardless of the color you choose. There is no lens on the E01.If you want the beam to be better, just get some fine steel wool and rub the LED bulb itself. Then the reflector. Blow out the debris and use a flattened Q-tip to get in the crevices.The E01 has been a staple of the flashlight community for a while, and it's easy to see why. Again, this isn't the light if you need output or throw, but it does very well as an everyday-use item that will run a long, long time on one AAA battery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7E29A9CW439/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNUBDNO#wasThisHelpful","RQ7E29A9CW439","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DooHicKey is $7 for polished stainless steel, or $8 for blackened stainless steel. Either price is fair. The items are identical except for the color, so I'll discuss that now...The polished steel tool is marked with a dark brown laser mark, while the black one has white lasering. The stainless one is all stainless, including the carabiner gate. The black one is all black, including the gate. The black one is painted, not anodized or black oxide coated. When it rubs against your keys or coins in your pocket, the paint will flake off. The lasering will remain. The rest of the features are identical...The tool is 2-1/2"" long and 11/16"" wide, and 3/16"" thick not counting the carabiner gate. It weighs only half an ounce. The carabiner gate is wire, and has adequate ""snap"" and stiffness. Once in a while a key will get tangled in it since it's open, sometimes opening the carabiner or twisting it, damaging it. An easy fix is to put a small piece of heat shrink tubing over it and heat it up.-The rulers are lasered on, with 2"" on one side, in 1/16"" increments. The other side has 40mm marked, in 1mm increments. Yeah, I measured both against a real ruler, and they're both accurate.-The wrenches are also lasered on, and are 1/4"", 5/16"", and 3/8"" slots. I've found that they're a little soft, but they do grip the nut / bolt/ whatever tight and secure. I like that a 1/4"" slot is included; that way you can use standard 1/4"" hex bits.-The end serves as a 7/16"" wide flathead screwdriver. It works just fine, and also works as a scraper. It's beveled on one side, allowing it to slip under things for light prying. The tool is advertised as having a prybar function, and as long as it's a low-torque applications, that's true.-The bottle opener works as advertised. I don't have a lot of use for this tool, but it does work.-The last feature is a box cutter. This is the corner of the flathead screwdriver (the corner near the bottle opener) ground at an angle. It will open a box or cut tape, but don't expect it to open blister packaging or slice paper.The DooHicKey is a great keychain tool: inexpensive, compact, effective, and lightweight. Yeah, it has some faults, but it's perfectly acceptable for this price and size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4O0LD057X8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5M5S0Q#wasThisHelpful","RI4O0LD057X8E","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For $8, this is an acceptable tool. As with all keychain tools, it's a compromise of size and functionality. This tool is 2.2 ounces in weight, which is too heavy for most keyrings. It's fine for pocket carry, or in a sheath with a knife or multi-tool. It's made in China, if you care about that.The tool is 3-1/8"" long, 1-1/8"" wide at its widest point, and 1/2"" thick. Those measurements are when the tool is snapped closed. When closed, the only tools you can use are the knife blade, flathead screwdriver, and key attachment.-The knife blade is the same as used on the UtiliKey. It's 2"" long and sheepsfoot shape; the first half is serrated and the half towards the tip is plain edged. The serrations are scalloped, which work fine. The knife is chisel ground, meaning it's only ground on one side. The steel seems pretty soft, and it behaves like 440A. This is never my only blade, so it's fine. The blade doesn't lock, but it does stop halfway with a deep detent. It also has a nice detent while open, so it's no likely to collapse when in use.-The flathead screwdriver is on the side with the hinge. It's described as a #2 flat screwdriver, but it's more like a #3. It works well for most screws, and can be used as a light pry bar or scraper. It only protrudes 3/8"" from the tool, so it's pretty limited in where it can reach.-The keychain attachment is really just the empty space between the Phillips screwdriver, the frame, and the micro screwdriver. It works, but there's a small gap between the Phillips driver and the micro driver, allowing it to slip off your keyring if you're using a small one. If your keys jingle or are heavy, they can pull on the frame and open the tool, detaching it from your keys. So my advice is to forget about the ""keychain attachment"" feature.Open the tool for the rest of the tools. On the frame side, there are the following:-The nail file is good, but not as good as on a Swiss Army knife. It's machined into the metal like a Swiss Army knife, but not as deep or aggressive. It works fine, and is 3/8"" wide by 1-1/2"" long.-The bottle opener is machines into the side of the frame, and is integral to it. It works fine as a bottle opener, but tends to jab my hand when I'm using the wrenches in the open position.-The micro screwdriver is on the end of the tool. It's a #0 flathead, which is just a tad too big for eyeglass screws. It works fine for the screws it's sized for, but it's only for light duty. Too much torque and you'll snap the driver blade off.The other side of the tool is attached with a hinge, like a door. It snaps closed and is held open by the hinge, but it will be necessary to use the wrenches with the frame on top so it doesn't collapse when in use. This side is 1/4"" thick, which is great for the wrenches.-On the tip, there's the Phillips screwdriver. It's a #1, and is relatively soft. It works fine for screws of the right size, but it tends to slip out unless you're pressing in hard.-The wrenches are the last tool. They're machined into the inside of the hinged piece, and are relatively soft for wrenches. I know they're stainless and not hard tool steel, but they're still pretty soft. The sizes are...English: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 1/4"", 5/16"", 3/8"", and 7/16""Metric: 1mm, 2mm, 3mm, 4mm, 5mm, 6mm, 7mm, 8mm, and 10mm.The wrenches do have a tiny bit of ""slip"" in them, so they're not as tight as a dedicated wrench. I like that a 1/4"" slot is included, so you can use standard 1/4"" hex driver bits. After only about 8 or 9 low-torque uses, that 1/4"" wrench slot is getting rounded a bit. I'm not sure how many times it can be used, but I'm a little disappointed.Overall, this tool is worth the cost. It's not for hard use, and it's not really for frequent use either. The snap that you get when closing the tool has began to loosen on mine already, and it will soon have no ""snap"" left. I'd like to see a tool that's just the wrenches in one solid piece of metal, but this is okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247F5O2A4C6ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YKXTV0#wasThisHelpful","R247F5O2A4C6ER","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes, you get five of these. I chose the masks with the blue pouch because it was the cheapest, but the masks themselves are the same no matter what color pouch you choose. In the review I describe one mask, but all five are exactly the same.Each mask comes in a nylon pouch, which comes in a 3"" by 4-1/2"" zipper-close bag, which also contains basic instructions on a bi-fold sheet of paper. The first side tells how to put the CPR mask on the patient, while the second side gives basic CPR instructions (chest compressions and ventilations). These are in English. The third and fourth sections are the same thing, but in Spanish.The pouch itself is nylon, blue in my case. It has a slightly looser weave than a military-issue pistol belt. On the front is a sewn-on Ambu logo, which can be easily removed if you wish. The pouch measures 2"" wide by 1-7/8"" tall and 5/8"" thick with the mask inserted and the flap closed. There is a small section of nylon on the left side, which has a standard 1"" split ring attached. The flap closes with a Velcro rectangle. There's no attachment point for a belt or anything else, but the split ring should be sufficient enough to attach it to almost anything.Inside the pouch is the mask itself. It's enclosed in a wax paper sleeve, which is there to protect the thin plastic from tears when not in use. I just snipped the taped edge off so the mask can be accessed easily in an emergency. The mask is folded to a size of 1"" by 1"", which is just larger than the size of a U.S. quarter. The mask is just under 1/2"" thick when folded. Unfolded, it's 9-1/2"" long with the ear loops unstretched. A one-way valve is located in the center, and it goes right over the patient's mouth. Since it only allows air in one way, it has to be put on one way. If you can read the Ambu logo, it's on the patient right. Also, there's a small drawing of a mouth over the valve; this is where your mouth goes when doing the ventilations. Elastic strings go around the patient's ears, and they stretch pretty far. If they don't fit, then just use the mask without the ear attachments.In use, the mask is okay. It's designed for one use only, and clearly says so. The valve works fine. However, the plastic is too thin to be 100% trustworthy. When ventilations are being administered, it's common for the rescuer to grind their teeth a little, especially under stress. The patient will almost always bite when breathing is restored. Either one will tear the plastic, rendering the mask useless since you can now introduce bodily fluids through the mouth. If a patient bites a little harder, the valve can come off and fall down their throat, creating a new choking hazard. Yes, this has happened.So, should you buy these? Absolutely. They are valuable, and they are pretty reliable. At $11 for five, they're cheap enough to include in any First Aid Kit or glovebox.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259JHFL29PBH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEPH83W#wasThisHelpful","R259JHFL29PBH3","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need six extra shells on my tactical shotgun. So do you. Get $25 together and you can have this great add-on. I bought the 870 model for my H&R Pardner Pump Protector, which is an 870 clone. In short, the SideSaddle fit with a few minor modifications.The kit comes with a mounting plate, the saddle itself (a plastic screw-on shell holder), six small screws for mounting the saddle to the plate, a large bolt, a small bolt, two washers, three hex keys (one for the large bolt, one for the small bolt, and one for the six small screws), and instructions.Installation is very easy:1. Put the larger washer on the large bolt and the smaller washer on the small screw. Tap out the two pins holding the trigger assembly (large in the rear, small in the front).2. Push the large bolt through the rear hole and the small bolt through the forward hole.3. Apply a drop of blue LocTite to the end of the threads on each, and tighten them to the mounting plate. The mounting plate only goes on one way. Don't overtighten, or you'll cause the action to bind when you rack the shotgun. If you do, just loosen it up. I got mine pretty tight - so tight I thought I would bend the small hex key - but it didn't bind.4. Remove one of the small screws that holds the saddle to the plate, apply LocTite, and screw tightly. Repeat until they're all done.The SideSaddle is now installed. Try to rack the shotgun and you'll find that you can't because the forearm bangs into the saddle. Here, you have four options.1. Remove the SideSaddle. I want to keep it on, that's why I ordered it, so we'll move ahead...2. Order a smaller forearm, like the MagPul. I don't want to, so we move on...3. Send this back and order the SideSaddle that holds four shells instead of six. I already got this, so let's use it...4. Trim the forearm. Your manual will tell you how to get the forearm off. From there, use a set of pliers to remove the retaining ring that holds the action bars to the forearm. Pull the action bars off. Using a saw, cut off that rear 5/8"" or so. You'll know you're there when the forearm is even at the rear. Clean it up with a file, Dremel, or sandpaper pad. Replace the action bars, retaining ring, and put it back on the shotgun. Ta-da!The SideSaddle went on easily and stayed in place during recoil, not shifting. The plastic saddle held every 12 gauge shell I tried: the little 1-1/2"" all the way up to 3-1/2"" magnum shells. I know the Pardner Pump won't take 3-1/2"" shells, but the saddle will hold them. The shells didn't fall out or wiggle, but they were a bit hard to pull out unless I made a very deliberate pulling action. This is fine.Since the mounting bolts are both in the rear, the front has a little ""air"" showing in the front between the receiver and the mounting plate. This is purely cosmetic. If it bothers you, I guess you could remove the SideSaddle and stick some foam or tape on it to fill the gap.I like this thing, and I believe it should be a standard add-on for a shotgun, whether it's tactical, hunting, or sport.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N83PJSS2TI35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TTX75W#wasThisHelpful","R1N83PJSS2TI35","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my Ruger SR9C. It fits, only after some effort and modifications. (The SR9C had the backstrap in the ""flat"" position.)The price is right for this grip; ten bucks is good for what you get. It's rubber and doesn't feel tacky, so it won't snag on pockets or holsters. The light cobblestone texture feels okay, but it doesn't do anything to keep the gun in your hand. The grip has one finger swell to make two finger grooves, as opposed to the photos, which shows two finger swells. I think the back of the grip is the weak point: it's molded there, and the molding is a very thin line. The sides taper towards the bottom, adding about 1/8"" of thickness to each side. I like that.Getting the grip on required more effort than I thought. First, it was just way too tight, even after using a spoon as a lever. I heated up the grip with a heat gun, and it finally went on after some effort (and being careful not to tear it). It didn't cover up the magazine release buttons, but it did cover the magazine well. A few seconds with a razor blade and that was fixed. The grip didn't budge when it was installed. Even under recoil, it wasn't move.This is a good grip, but a better one for the SR9C is the Butler Creek Slip On Pistol Grip, in Medium, for $7 here on Amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KIL6M2DDSTCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLTS1W2#wasThisHelpful","R3KIL6M2DDSTCP","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this for my Ruger SR9C; the size I ordered was Medium. The bottom of the grip is labelled Uncle Mike's, who makes some good stuff. I also tried it on my German Makarov right over the stock rubber grip; it fit great.It took a little elbow grease to get the grip on; use a spoon to make it easier. Once it was in place, it was great. No shifting or twisting, even under recoil. The grip feels a bit tacky, and it may pull lint out of your pocket or holster. On the SR9C, a little bit had to be trimmed with a razor blade to get the magazine in. It didn't cover up the magazine release buttons at all.In general, this is a great slip-on grip. It's inexpensive, it fits, and it is very comfortable. It doesn't make the recoil any less, but it does make it more comfortable.P.S.

"I bought this to use on my H&R Pardner Pump (a Remington 870 clone) so I could mount a light on the forearm. For seven dollars, this is a very handy item to have for any gun. It can be used with wood or polymer stocks and frames. You get:1. The rail itself. It's hard polymer (plastic) and black. It has five grooves for centering your rail adapter / scope mount. It measures 2.55"" long and 0.6"" wide at the base, 0.835"" wide at the widest part of the rail. It's 3/8"" thick. The holes are spaced 1.2"" apart, center-to-center.2. Two bolts. They're black metal and use a 1/8"" Allen (hex) key for adjustment. I got two of these rails, and no Allen tool was provided with either. They have enough LockTite already on them for one installation.3. Two oval-shaped nuts. They're a grey steel and have a nipple coming from one end. This is the bottom; the nipple is supposed to sit in whatever hole you're using it in.4. Brief instructions are printed on the enclosed card.Everything is very high-quality. If you have a gun that doesn't have a Picatinny rail, this is an easy add-on. Even if there's no holes for it, you can just drill them. The accessories I tried - lasers, light, slings, even vertical forearm grips for a shotgun - mounted on and stayed there. Since the rail is plastic, you can cut it down to suit your needs. As far as my review goes, that's it. This is a great add-on for any gun at a great price.However, if you plan to use this on a shotgun forearm...The pre-drilled holes (on the rails you're ordering here) won't work on the Mossberg 500-series or Remington 870 forearm without some modifications:1. First, you have to remove the forearm from the forearm rails (your manual might call them action rails, etc.). This is done by unscrewing a circular retaining ring from the front of the forearm, then pulling the forearm rails out the back.2. Then, since the part of the rail that sits with the gun is flat and the bottom of the forearm is round, you'll have to trim some of the forearm to make a flat spot for the rail to not wobble on.3. Line the rail where you want it, and drill the front hole.4. The retaining ring for the forearm rails won't screw back on with the oval-shaped ""nuts"" so you have to trim (with a file or Dremel) one almost all the way to the nipple.5. The forearm rails and retaining nut go on now. Get it as tight as you can without stripping the threads. It goes on now because the retaining ring WON'T go over the nut.6. Screw that screw in and through the nut. Don't tighten yet.7. The screw in the rear won't be able to go into a nut since it's right under the forearm rail and there's no space for the nut. So, drill a smaller hole. Once the rail is lined up where you want it, put some additional LockTite on the threads of the screw.8. Using straight, positive pressure, screw the rear screw in. Get it tight, but be very careful not to strip it since you're screwing it into the plastic forearm and once you've stripped the plastic, it can't be used in that spot any more.9. Tighten the front screw. No additional LockTite is needed here, but can be handy.If you have large hands, you may want to trim off the rear portion of the rail, right behind the rear hole, so it doesn't jam your hand when racking the shotgun. This is easy with a saw; just sand off the end after you've cut.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SURKNZ9H4H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003F6EMQO#wasThisHelpful","R28SURKNZ9H4H8","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, there's not a lot to say about some utility knife blades, is there?In terms of construction, these are basic carbon steel blades. They're not titanium-coated and they're not bi-metal. A Rockwell test showed they're at 57 for hardness.These blades are the same size and shape of a normal utility knife blade, except these are fully serrated. The blade is ground and sharpened on both sides, and the serrations are very purposeful. It glides through rubber, carpet, nylon webbing (like seatbelts or backpack strap), linoleum, and rope / cord with ease. However, if you use it on something like drywall or particleboard, it will gum up quickly. The blade held its edge well: about as long as a normal utility knife blade, plus another half.Being the standard size, it was able to fit in any utility knife I have. The SuperKnife brand uses a contractor blade, which is thicker: if you're going to use this in a SuperKnife or the Gerber EAB Lite, then the blade will snap in but it will wiggle a little bit side-to-side.The very tip of the blade isn't as needle-like as I'm used to in utility blades, but it's still able to pierce if you need it to.If you need a blade that retains its edge through fibrous materials, this is a great choice. It makes a good all-around blade as well, but you don't get the precision you get from a straight-edge blade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D82Z3LEAS2DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GIIRS8#wasThisHelpful","R1D82Z3LEAS2DN","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rapala is a Scandanavian brand, made in Finland, and then Sweden. This knife, however, is made in China. For the price, it's a decent fixed blade.The handle is 5"" long and made of hard white plastic. A lanyard hole is provided, and it's highly recommended that you use it if this knife will be used over water. The handle is basic, but comfortable. It's not soft or rubbery; it's hard plastic with a very light cobblestone texture. A small guard is there, but it won't prevent your hand from sliding onto the blade if you stab something hard.The blade is 4"" long and actually Scandi ground. T%his makes the knife very easy to resharpen. The blade steel is 420J2 at 54-56 Rockwell. This is a good balance of rust resistance (since this is a bait knife) and edge retention. Mine came very sharp, and could shave paper with only a light stropping. The blade is 1/8"" thick, so it's not flexible for filleting. It's only 1/2""  wide. The back of the blade has scalloped serrations for removing fish scales, but I find they're too sharp. They're as sharp as a knife's serrations, and tend to cut into the meat. They take up the first 2-3/4"" of the blade's spine.The provided sheath is okay. It's made of the same white plastic as the handle, but it's thinner. The sides are like lattice, allowing the water to drain from the blade while in the sheath. The tip of the sheath allows for another lanyard. The knife snaps in via a small plastic lip, which can snap off over time. For the cost, I can deal with it, as almost any other fixed blade sheath will work with this knife.For the money, this is a good bait knife. It's not a fillet knife, but ti does a great job at cutting up bait. Replace the sheath with a better one, and this would be a good hunting knife: skinning, caping, and sawing through small bone or tendon is easy with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L7NQ6L03ENT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LF7Q1A#wasThisHelpful","R3L7NQ6L03ENT","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lengthy review for an industrial box cutter that every grocery store in the country gives away to its stock employees? Well, okay...These box cutters (called tap knives here) are simple. A pressed metal sleeve holds a blade holder. The sleeve acts as the handle, and measures 3"" long by 7/8"" wide and 1/8"" thick. Whether the knife is fully opened or fully closed, it's 4"" long including the blade holder. The holder is pressed metal as well, and is fully removable for blade changing. Simply pull it out the back. Removal from the front isn't possible since the back of the blade holder has two rectangular spots pressed outward; one on each side of the blade holder. This is a good safety feature, since some materials will ""grab"" the blade and pull it, possibly pulling the blade and its holder straight off the sleeve. A bad cut is usually the result if that happens, but that's not possible with this design.The ""tap knife"" wording comes from the act of holding the sleeve and just tapping the back on something sturdy to expose the blade. Then tap the flat part of the blade holder to close the knife (the front has a flat piece of metal so you don't cut your box while tapping the knife shut). Retention is pretty good; the knife doesn't open or close without me wanting it to. If the sleeve loosens up, you can always flip it over and try that side, or just crimp it a little tighter with pliers.Replacing the blade is easy. Pull the blade holder off the sleeve from the back, pull the blade up (pull straight up on the crimped side) and just slide the new blade down. Slide the blade holder back onto the sleeve. The sleeve is void of markings, and the blade holder isn't notched at the back or anything to let you know what side is sharp when the knife is closed. A simple remedy is to put a piece of electrical tape over the sleeve on the side where the blade's edge is, indicating the sharp side by glance or feel. The knife takes a standard single-edged razor blade. When in the ""open"" position, 7/16"" of the razor blade's edge is exposed.These are sold as a 12-pack, and mine came boxed and labeled, with instructions on how to change the blade. The knives each had a blade already installed, and everything was clean and rust-free. I couldn't be happier with these simple, but effective cutters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJH836L8PZ88E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9R004E#wasThisHelpful","RJH836L8PZ88E","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this Condor EMT Pouch for emergency medical supplies (as it's intended) but you can use it for all sorts of things. The one I got is olive drab, and the color fits perfect with all of the other OD military gear I've acquired. The pouch measures 7"" tall by 5"" long and can expand up to 2-1/2"" thick. The overall construction is great for the price.The nylon feels tough, and I'm guessing it's around 1000 Denier, as it feels just like my Maxpedition bags. In terms of stiffness and weave, it's right where Maxpedition is. For me, that's about perfect. The outside features three MOLLE strips on the front, sewn to have three slots in each. The back has two MOLLE straps, and they're sewn to give you two wider slots each. The back also has two MOLLE straps that snap to the bottom for attachment to your gear. The sewing is all (inside and outside) single-stitch, and there were a few places where the stitching was stray. All I had to do to fix this was singe the strays with a lighter. The MOLLE straps are nice and tight, as they should be. The snaps are nice and tight; they snap on with a ""click"" and pop off with a quick tug. The bottom of the bag has a grommeted drainage hole, and it's about 1/8"" in diameter.There are two zippers on the pouch, and they go from the bottom all the way around. The zippers aren't YKK, but they're decent. Simple paracord zipper pulls with a plastic end are used to open and close the bag.Inside, there are many places to put things. The bag opens to an L shape since there's an elastic section of 1"" wide webbing on each side; this is to prevent your contents from spilling out. I couldn't get easy access to the items in the very bottom, so I clipped one of the sides off. Now the contents don't fall out, but I can still get to the bottom.The side without the attachments (I called it the front earlier) features the following:A loop of nylon webbing, not elastic, that is about 1-1/2"" long. I use this to hold my gloves.Two verticalal strips of elastic 1"" wide webbing, each one sewn in the middle to make four slots. Each strip has another strip sewn right over it, so you can add even more things. These are sewn onto the pocket.The pocket is about 3-1/2"" deep. When the pouch is full, you might have to turn it inside-out to get to the contents of the pocket.Under the pocket is another run of 1"" wide elastic webbing, sewn down the center, with another run of elastic webbing sewn over it.The other side of the pouch (the back) has a small loop of 550 cord sewn to the top. It's small; I don't think a dime will fit through it. I use it with a small run of 550 cord to keep my tape in easy reach.The only other things on the inside are two elastic webbing straps, which are sewn horizontally and are about 1-3/4"" wide. These aren't sewn down the middle, so your large items can go here.When all of the slots are filled up, there's still plenty of room in the middle for things such as a notebook and pen, some gauze, and a headlamp. A headlight is almost essential for a medical kit: A flashlight can be clipped to the outside MOLLE straps, but you're going to need both hands free in a medical emergency, and that's not the time to hold your flashlight in your mouth while your hands are busy.Overall, this is a great pouch. It's very inexpensive, yet well-made, holds a lot, and has enough ""sections"" for easy customization. If you don't need a medical bag, it can function in lots of other roles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R44C9IIYLDX36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086UBIJI#wasThisHelpful","R44C9IIYLDX36","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a few of these at WalMart for $3.88 each. They're well-made, but not bright. Their claim is runtime, not output.The light is anodized aluminum in either blue, bronze, or red. No matter what color you get, the rubber grip is black with the Rayovac logo molded in. The light is 3-1/2"" long, not counting the keychain. The entire light, except for the grip, feels like an old record, in that it's highly machined with fine lines. The body and tailcap are 9/16"" in diameter, while the head tapers to 11/16"" in diameter. The tailcap unscrews for battery replacement; a Rayovac is included. The tailcap is nicely knurled and the threads are fine for a $4 light. An O-ring at the back keeps water out. The tailcap has a keychain attached, with a lobster claw clasp. This protrudes 1-3/4"" from the rest of the light, and is removable. If you remove the keychain, the light can tail-stand. The rubber grip is 1-1/8"" long and is removable as well.The head tightens to turn the light on and loosens a bit to turn it off. An O-ring is inside to keep moisture out of the light. A white 5mm LED is the light source, and it's shielded behind both a focusing reflector and a thick lens. The package says output is 5 lumens, and this seems to be right. In twisting the light on and off, I found that it was too sloppy, so I put a few turns of plumber's tape around the threads. It's much better now; no losing the head due to loose threads.The included AAA battery is just a cheap dollar store one with the Rayovac name. You'll get about 4 hours of usable light out of it, but if you stick an alkaline in the light, that goes up to around 6.5 hours.The keyring is okay. It's a circular ring (not a split ring, which is designed to be removed and replaced) attached to a swivel piece, attached to another circular ring, then finally the lobster clasp. The whole thing screams ""CHEAP!"" to me, but this is a $4 light. The lobster clasp works some of the time, but any sideways pressure will cause it to ""jump"" and snap to the side. I've found that replacing the entire unit with a small split ring attached to a quick link or snap link is much more dependable.For $4, it's hard to beat this light. It's compact and very reliable. Maybe it's too big for your keychain, but it's not too big for your toolbox or glove compartment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKNMH57TMQLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H05C94#wasThisHelpful","RCKNMH57TMQLP","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a simple, but effective light. It's available in several LED colors, but this one is red.A simple snapping wire (I guess it could be called a micro carabiner) enables you to clip it to anything less than 3/8"" thick. Zipper pulls, keyrings, backpack sliders, D-rings,  and buckles are all ideal uses. The light's functions are simple: squeeze the flat sides once for steady on, a second time within two seconds for blinking. A third squeeze, or squeezing after two seconds, turns the light off. Actually, you only have to press the side with the sticker (the sticker is on the inside, but visible) on it, as that's the side with the switch.To change the battery, you pop off the side with the sticker. A small screwdriver or butter knife works well. Then, you pull out the light. Pry it out carefully, as you can bend the thin metal walls easily. You'll see the 5mm LED on the other side. Inside are two CR2016 batteries. Push them out with your screwdriver, knife, carabiner, etc. They can be replaced with CR2016s, or one CR2032 for longer tuntime, but a less-bright light. Before you replace the light, click it to make sure you put the batteries in right. Then it just pops in (the LED goes into the divot) and the cover you removed just snaps back on.I've found that with two CR2016s, runtime is about 20 hours on high and 27 hours on flashing. Output is around 6-8 lumens.With one CR2032, runtime is 34 hours on high and 43 hours on flashing. Output will be 3-5 lumens.This is a good light. It's too big for my keys, but clipping one to a backpack strap or zipper pull will allow you to be seen by cars at night. I use them as blinkers. I would love these at around $3 or $4 each, but right now, the cost is too high for more.NOTE: The batteries, both the two CR2016s that come with the light, and the CR2032s I mentioned, can be bought at your local dollar store or Radio Shack.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1B46OCHPV8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001K4FNS4#wasThisHelpful","R2M1B46OCHPV8I","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered two of these lights, both with the red LED. I was concerned about getting a fake from some other reviews, but mine came in the factory packaging (the seller was Amazon). All of the accessories listed - the clip-on necklace and the clip-on clamp - were included in each package. A split ring is also attached to the light. The red Freedoms use one CR2032 battery, but you can swap it out for two CR2016 batteries. Doing so will give you a brighter light, but will shorten the battery life. You still have all of the modes, no matter which battery you use. The batteries supplied are Energizers. I'm familiar with the various functions of the Freedom, but an instruction sheet is included. The light doesn't remember what mode you used last, so it will always come on in high. For a ""crash course"" on the Freedom, a great link can be found here... [...]Keep in mind that I'm talking specifically about the red Freedom, but the modes are the same for all of the lights in the Freedom line.The Freedom can be used at any brightness between minimum power (just enough to look at a map at night) to full power (enough to use as a beacon so cars don't hit you) and can even be set to come on in that brightness whenever you want. You can also choose to have the light in a squeeze-only mode (to signal, or to save the battery) or constant on. There's even three flashing modes (different flashing speeds) and SOS. A ""hidden"" mode features a three-minute auto-shutoff.The clip-on necklace is a good idea, and it works just fine. It's just a plastic tray that flexes to hold the Freedom light. A small cord is attached to hang off your neck, and magnets on the back allow you to stick it on almost any metal surface for hands-free lighting. The light points down when installed. You can also install the Freedom on the tray backwards to prevent accidental turn-on. To remove the Freedom, just give it a yank.The clip-on clamp is fine, I just never use it. It's the same tray as the necklace, except it's attached to a ball joint, which is attached to a small clamp. The ball joint rotates to any direction you want, and it stays there without fuss. The clamp can go on your hat to make a headlamp, on your shirt collar, or anywhere else you can fit it. I have one clipped to the sun visor in my car.In general, the Photon Freedom is nice. I agree that it's a little expensive for a 5mm LED, but you also get the accessories, multiple modes, and LRI's lifetime warranty.

"The Gerber Shard comes in at 3"" long and 1-1/4"" wide, and it weighs 0.6 ounce. How does it do as a keychain-sized prybar?The entire tool is coated with a black titanium nitride finish and it holds up fine to daily tasks. If you put the Shard on your keyring, your keys will chip away at the finish.The features are listed as a Phillips driver, two flathead drivers, pry bar, lanyard hole, bottle opener, and wire stripper. One-by-one, here's how they perform:The Phillips screwdriver is very pointy, and is a little too pointy to be used on screws. Mine had to be sanded down to get a better ""bite"" on the screws.The small flathead screwdriver is next to useless. It's a small stub. It required substantial grinding (thinning out the metal) to fit any screw that would require a driver of this slot size.The medium flathead screwdriver is okay. It's very limited in its reach, and again, it had to be ground down to work on anything.The wire stripper is the area between the flathead screwdrivers. It doesn't work; it's simply not sharp enough to strip the sheathing of the wire.The lanyard hole is there, sure, and it's 1/2"" in diameter. It's a hole; not much to get wrong.The bottle opener works as advertised, and is a nice feature. I don't drink, but it comes in handy.The pry bar also works as advertised. It's nice for, well, prying things. You're not going to open an elevator door with it, bit it comes in handy for a lot of things.There are two areas that have very shallow grooves for greater control, but they're almost useless. A Dremel or file will allow you to make them deeper.Overall, the Shard is a nice tool. After all of the problems I had with the tools on it, why? Because they're all fixable, and this is such an inexpensive tool. With a Dremel, I can fix all of the problems listed in under 20 minutes, giving me a perfectly serviceable tool for my keychain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLQKTHXBSW4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZK45IQ#wasThisHelpful","R2KLQKTHXBSW4L","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is thirty bucks? Umm, wow. Put the SureFire name on it, and this would cost almost twice as much.The ProTac 2AAA is essentially an upgrade from the Stylus Pro, but it's an entirely different light series (there are other Protac lights). Included in the package are the light itself and two Energizer alkalines. In my testing, alkalines gave the following runtimes: 1 hour 49 minutes on high, 5 hours 32 minutes on strobe, and 37 hours on low. The light will also run on lithium primaries (NOT the 10440 cells), NiMH, and even NiCad in a pinch.The ProTac is nicely constructed. It's anodized with a black finish, which is a bit glossier than that on the Stylus Pro. I've found that the anodizing is easy to scratch with just a little contact with a key. The light itself is 5-5/8"" long - just a hair under 1/2"" longer than the Stylus Pro. It's the same thickness as the Stylus Pro, but the head is more bulbous. The head has cooling fins machined in, and they have flats to give you an anti-roll feature. The lens is clear plastic, and the reflector is smooth. The LED is an XP-C, and mine has no blue tint. The beam throws very nicely. In case you're a light tinkerer, the head unscrews from the body.The tailcap is almost identical to that of the MicroStream and Stylus Pro. The tailcaps of all three lights are 100% interchangeable, the difference being that the ProTac has one more revolution of threads added. This isn't noticeable unless you're looking for it. The top of the tailcap unscrews for replacement of the switch cover, but I didn't find an extra one in the package. It's the same switch cover as the Stylus Pro or MicroStream. The pocket clip is positioned low for me, but it easily pops off so you can put it high on the tailcap, like on the Stylus Pro. The pocket clip is the same as the Stylus Pro, so it's good enough for me.In function, the ProTac is nice. The first press turns the light on in high, which is 80 lumens. Another press within half a second goes to strobe, which is an 80-lumen flash at 9Hz. Press again within half a second for low at 10 lumens. At any time, press the switch until it clicks for constant on. There is no memory; the light will always come on in high, and the modes will always be high, strobe, then low. The beam is nice and white, with no artifacts or halos. I like it a lot; it's more throw than flood.Because the circuitry is in the head, you can swap the bodies and / or tailcap between the ProTac 2AAA, Stylus Pro, and MicroStream and whatever has the ProTac's head will have three modes (See NOTE 1 below). Thus, if you want a multi-mode MicroStream, you can have it, but you lose some output as you decrease from two AAAs to one.Summary? It's a great pen light for $30. If you already have a Stylus Pro, you might want to check this out anyway.NOTE 1: This is assuming you have the older (pre-C4) version of the MicroStream or Stylus Pro, with the removable head. The C4 version of these lights have a permanently-attached head. The tailcaps and clips are interchangeable regardless of which version you have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UG94IIKJN1YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079GQR32#wasThisHelpful","R3UG94IIKJN1YD","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since Schrade has closed their doors and was bought out by Taylor, they've seemed to be on a downward spiral towards obscurity. If this knife is any indication, they might be getting better quality knives. Please note that the measurements provided in my review are from a ruler, not a website description. It seems that Amazon has posted the wrong item description.The Handle: The Schrade 304 is a heavy knife, weighing in at 9.7 ounces. Over half a pound. Everything on it is metal, except the two bushings. The knife is 4-3/4"" long when closed, and just a hair under 1/2"" thick (not counting the pocket clip). The handle is 1-1/8"" wide. The handles are stainless steel, just over 1/8"" thick each, and are titanium-nitride coated to give them a nice grey color. The non-locking side has five grooves machined in, and they help a little bit with grip. This side also has the Schrade name machined in. A nice groove is there so you can unlock the knife easily. The back of the knife is open, using two hourglass-shaped spacers (also called stand-offs). Each side of the handle slabs uses two Torx (T-8) screws to hold the knife together.The locking side has no markings. It's a frame lock, and has an external cut-out for the lock. Some of the Schrade frame locks that look like this have a Hinderer-type overtravel disk; this one doesn't. The pocket clip is held on the locking side, and while it's removable (two T-6 screws hold it on) it's not able to be put in any of the other corners. So, it's right-hand tip-down only. The clip itself is good. It's a loop-over deep carry clip, coated the same as the knife. It's a bit long for me (2-3/4"" from the tip to the bend) but it works fine after some tightening. As it came, it was loose and would rotate to where it was on top of the lock, pressng it in further, making opening the knife hard because the ball detent would sink further into its hole.The lock-up is great. Much better than other China-made Schrades I've had. There was a little bit of blade play, but it was fixed by tightening the pivot pin screw (a T-10). The blade stop pin is of a larger size than I'm used to seeing in ""cheap"" knives, but I like that. When it comes to a 9.7 ounce knife being thumb-popped open, I'd rather have a thick pin to absorb the energy than a smaller one, waiting to snap or crack. A lanyard hole is also provided.The Blade: The blade is given the same grey titanium-nitride coating as the rest of the knife. It's made of 9Cr13MoV, and is 3-3/4"" long. If you're only counting the cutting edge, it's 3-5/8"" long. The blade is 3/16"" thick and has a hollow grind, starting at the mid-way point. Mine came very sharp, and needed only a light stropping to shave hair. Each side of the blade has a white nylon washer for smooth opening, and the blade flies open easily after the pocket clip is tightened down (see above). There's a thumb stud on each side of the blade, and opening is easy to do with a ""flick"" of your thumb. It seems that opening the knife in the traditional manner of rotating your thumb along the thumb stud makes the blade ""pop"" out due to the detent ball. If you want to, you can take the knife apart and round the ball down a little bit.The blade has no jimping, but a small section on top of the thumb studs is machined out for some traction.In use, the knife feels good. It's heavy enough that you know it's there, even in the pocket. The corners of the handle are all smooth, and there are no real hot spots unless you're applying a lot of force. Things like carving hard wood, for example, make the lock dig into your index finger because the other side of the handle is cut away. The blade steel seems adequate, and from what Taylor says, it's around 57-59 on the Rockwell scale. I'll say that it holds an edge a little worse than AUS-8. It's very easy to resharpen. Rust resistance is good, especially with the coating. Speaking of that, the coating seems to be pretty tough. Everyday chores shouldn't be a problem, but if you drop the knife on concrete or keep it in your pocket with your keys, it will get chips in it.Buy the knife? Yeah.

"Here are my thoughts on the Direkt, Chad Los Banos biggest folding knife to date...The Handle: The Direkt has a very nice, straight handle. It's a tad over 4"" long. Black, nicely-textured G-10 handle scales are bolted over full stainless steel liners. Four Torx T-6 screws (two on each side) and the blade pivot pin (T-8) hold the knife together, and it's very easy to disassemble. The G-10 is textured like all of Chad's other designs, and proves rough enough to get a good grip on without tearing up your pockets (or your hands). A lanyard hole is provided, but it's not very useful. I couldn't get a lanyard made of gutted 550 cord through it, and I struggled to get even one strand through.The handle is straight as mentioned, and it has a sub-hilt. This sub-hilt doesn't get in the way when the knife is closed, and it really helps when the knife is open. It serves as a nice flipper. Locking is positive and solid thanks to a liner lock. The lock is jimped. The back of the handle is open to allow debris to be blown out. It also has jimping for finger placement while working. You get a pocket clip, too. It's reversible for left or right hand carry, tip up or down. It's titanium-coated, and is held on with three T-6 screws. A few people have reported problems in switching the clip from tip down to tip up, but I had no problems switching mine.The Blade: All of this would be irrelevant without a blade, right? It's a nice one, and it's a 3-5/8"" long piece of 440C. Mine is 1/8"" thick. It's a clip point with an unsharpened swedge. The hollow-ground edge came out of the box very sharp. The blade is titanium-coated and has a blackish-grey color to it. The left side of the blade has the Boker Plus logo along with Chad's CLB logo. The right side of the blade has 440C Stainless above Steel CHINA above 0590. I believe 0590 is the serial number, as each knife has their own.You get a thumb stud on each side of the blade, but you probably won't use them much because the flipper makes the knife more fun to use. The flipper sticks out about 1/2"" from the back of the handle when closed, and required very little effort to use. The detent keeps the blade in the handle, but the flipper can easily fly open one-handed with finger pressure. ""Flicking"" the blade open is easy. There's a hump above the thumb studs, and they're jimped as well. This gives you a good place to work with, pretty much guaranteeing your finger won't slip forward.Speaking of slipping forward; there's almost NO WAY you're going to get your fingers slid onto the blade of this knife. The flipper gives you a nice stop, but the sub-hilt gives you even more of a stop. You've got two half-inch pieces of steel to keep you from slicing your fingers during a thrust.Buy a Direkt. Heck, for $45, buy two. You'll be very impressed, as I was, with the quality and innovation that went into this design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJJAV9BAX9LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014VGJV8#wasThisHelpful","RUJJAV9BAX9LY","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's another great Chad Los Banos design; the M-type. Boker says that this is Chad's entrance into the larger folding world. This one is a bit heavier than I'd like at 4.6 ounces, but it's forgivable because of the nice design. This knife is made in China. It's model number 560. Here are the details...Handle Details: The M-Type has a very nice handle, which is 4-3/8"" long. The handle consists of two liners, one locking, and a black G-10 scale. The frame lock is jimped, although it's a bit stiff. The scale is a nice piece of black G-10, textured much like earlier CLB designs like the Subcom and Trance. The frame is titanium coated and has a grayish color. There are two finger grooves in the handle, one of which rests on the lock. There's a lanyard hole if you want to put something in there. The back of the handle is open so you can blow out debris, and the handle is held together with six (three on each side) Torx (T-6) screws. They're titanium coated, too. A Torx (T-8) screw is for the blade pivot, and it's adjustable for tension. The pocket clip is right hand only, but it's reversible for tip up or tip down carry, and is held in place with two Torx (T-6) screws. The right (locking) side of the frame has three oval cut-outs, probably for weight reduction.A complaint here... the ball detent in the frame lock makes the knife very hard to open. I disassembled the knife and smoothed the blade pivot area and sanded it down, lubed it, and reassembled. It still required two hands to open. I eventually got it where I wanted it by disassembling the knife and running a coarse stone over the ball detent until it was good enough to open the knife one-handed, but still hold the blade shut.Blade Details: The M-Type's blade is 3-5/8"" long and made of 440C, and is hollow ground. It's 1/8"" thick and has the same titanium coating as the frame. The left side of the blade is marked with the Boker Plus logo, and the CLB logo on the tang. The right side of the blade has ""1329"" on one side of the thumb stud and ""440 C"" on the other. The right side tang has ""China"" lasered on. It has dual tumb studs, but unfortunately, no flipper. A flipper would've really helped on this knife, especially with the opening problem. The back of the blade has jimping so your finger doesn't slip forward when using it. There's a slight recurve shape to the blade, but it's not enough to make sharpening or cutting difficult. The left (non-locking) side of the blade has two washers - a bronze one on top of a nylon one - between it and the frame. The right side has just one bronze bushing. An unsharpened swedge is on the back half of the blade. The blade locks open solidly, and cuts very nicely. It takes a razor edge quickly, and holds it for a reasonable amount of time. Each M-Type is individually serial numbered, which is lasered on the blade.Need a frame lock for under fifty bucks? The M-Type is quite a nice knife, and is worth the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13R92ABOUVNNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B80MLW#wasThisHelpful","R13R92ABOUVNNK","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my sister, who has no formal training with a kubotan / yawara stick / koppo / whatever you want to call it. It's made of aluminum, and has a Type II anodizing. This one is listed as crimson red, but with the way light hits it (at any angle) it looks like a metallic dark pink. If you want to change the color, this responds very well to spray paint. The Fury logo is lasered on the top portion, as shown in the Product photo. This stick is 5-3/4"" long and just under 3/4"" in diameter, and it weighs 2.1 ounces. A simple 1"" split ring is included.The anodizing from the factory holds up okay, but any metal objects will quickly put scratches in the finish. The stick has some really good finger grooves machined in, and they work very well for my sister's small hand, as well as my size XL glove hand. Apart from the grooves, there's nothing to keep the stick in your hand. It's smooth, and I wish there were a little texture. A piece of heat shrink tubing over the stick is an easy fix for this. The end terminates in a semi-pointed tip, which has been rounded. Using the stick like an icepick, it would be easy to damage a person. I prefer a thumb-reinforced hold with the tip down, and the split ring has to come off for this (again, I have large hands). Using the stick on a tree, it held up very well. There was no damage to the stick, but there were some missing spots of the anodizing.This is a good force multiplier. Period. That's it for my review, but below are my thoughts on using a stick like this as a self-defense item.-A split ring is included, and it's advocated for use with your keys. Don't do this. Sure, it makes the stick handy and makes your keys harder to lose, but using the stick on an attacker with your keys attached is an easy way to hurt yourself. Put your keys on it, hit a board or tree with it a few times with a few different strikes, and you'll see what I mean.-This is a good non-lethal device. Yes. However, an attack to the head or neck can be fatal. Be sure you know what you're hitting.-Familiarize yourself with how to use a kubotan. It's not hard. Mostly, you need to get the feel of ""holding on"" so it doesn't slip out of your hand when your strike makes contact. Foregoing any training, this would be an effective weapon with a basic icepick attack, going berzerk on the collarbone or sternum until the attacker stopped.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182T1YH5ELEP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007J8J12E#wasThisHelpful","R182T1YH5ELEP5","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you buy a six-dollar pepper spray, you're typically buying a no-name keychain unit from Harbor Freight or a vendor outside the ballpark. Sabre is a well-known brand, and even for a unit this size, six bucks is a screaming good deal.The canister featured here measures 3-7/8"" long and 7/8"" in diameter. Everything is clearly marked, and the expiration date is reasonable (the two I ordered both say 08/2017). A handy pocket clip is already installed, which keeps the unit at the top of your pocket or purse. The clip is shown on the Product page as metal; it's plastic. It slides off if you don't want to use it. There's no keyring attachment, but it wouldn't be hard to duct tape some 550 cord to the bottom if you wanted to. The unit has 22 grams in it; that's a little over 3/4 of an ounce. The main ingredients are OC (oleoresin capsicum) and CS tear gas, with a ultraviolet dye so the police can identify your attacker later. The addition of the CS tear gas is why this can't be shipped to AK, HI, MA, MI, or NY.I tested mine out in the back yard, and got 27 one-second bursts. This was without shaking the canister, taking ten seconds between each burst. There was no wind. Effective range seems to be around 8 or so feet. The spray comes out in a stream, which I prefer to a fog. A fog or gel can be wiped off the attacker's face and used against you; that's a bit harder with a spray. Also, the spray doesn't deflect as much in the wind (I used a fan to replicate a windy day). So, how does it work? Well, spray some in the far corner of your backyard and just walk around the area. It's a pain in the rear, but it's not debilitating. (Yes, I realize that walking on top of some pepper spray on the ground isn't the same as getting sprayed in the face with it.) Taking a face full of this might deter an attacker enough to run away. I prefer to use pepper spray for dogs, but I think it would be enough to get away from a human.I like the Sabre spray featured here. Nothing fancy, yet inexpensive and effective. I think it really shines when used against dogs, but I'm never eager to get sprayed with it myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14OMYHOIE8INS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007VM8UC#wasThisHelpful","R14OMYHOIE8INS","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't buy these off Amazon for $7 for the two-pack. My local WalMart sells the same two-pack for around $4.Dimensionally, the F-301 bold is the same size as the regular F-301 Ballpoint pen. It measures 5-1/4"" long and 3/8"" in diameter. The body of the pen and the tip are stainless steel; the clicker is plastic with metallic accents. The grip is textured black plastic, 1-1/8"" long. A clip is installed and can't be removed unless you break it off. It doesn't rotate. When inserted in a pocket, 1/2"" of the pen sticks out. The pen unscrews right below the grip to refill. A drop of lubricant will keep the threads clean and squeak-free. If you decide you don't like the F-301 in Bold, it can accept a normal Zebra F-series ballpoint refill. The opposite is also true: the F-301 ballpoint can use the Bold refill with no problems.In use, the F-301 Bold works very well. It writes as smoothly as any other Zebra, and the bold line resembles a gel pen's line. The pen writes fluidly on most materials as long as they're not greasy or glossy (photographs, for example). I did notice a few gobs of ink coming out when the pen wasn't being used for long periods, but that's to be expected from a tip of this size. There's not a lot more to say. It's just a good pen. It looks like it should cost twice as much as it does.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RD3OIRIIY90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VNJ1B2#wasThisHelpful","R39RD3OIRIIY90","A19VISO9EHD1OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19VISO9EHD1OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Andrew just keeps getting better. This is genuine music. I can't speak for everyone, but it just resonates with me. I am not sure I would recommend this as a starting point for his music, but you could do worse. It continues and builds upon the signature sound he has developed over the years.

"I have wide, 45 year-old, size 11""+ feet with high arches and feet that ache and are sore if I am on my feet a lot and not properly supported. I've purchased custom shoes from the Walking Store in the past, and they are great. I sometimes wish some of my other (less pricy) shoes had similar support. Enter PROFOOT Dura-Sole Insoles. The feel quite sturdy for extended use, yet comfy and supportive as well. I especially like the cushioned heel and arch support. They're easy to trim to fit a pair of inexpensive 11.5"" dress shoes I own. I can slide them into my sneakers as well, though the fit is much tighter. Support is greatly improved and I can wear them all day and be on my feet a lot without experiencing little if any of the end-of-the-day pain I would normally have if I just wore standard shoes alone. Dura-Soles are easy to trim - though I didn't have to trim much - so I question if they can be comfortable for size 14 feet. I would say the sweet spot is for sizes 9 through 12. There may be better insole support options out there, but this is the one OTC version I've tried and for the price they work well.~ Kort","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBAWXGTT2P5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYE2O9S#wasThisHelpful","R1IBAWXGTT2P5E","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good stuff. Moroccan Treatment Premium Hair Serum from Simon $ Tom is a bit on the pricy side, but my wife and I like it. First off it smells good. An fresh, airy, yet earthy scent.

Essential a leave-in conditioner, be careful not to use too much. That said, it seems like absorbs rapidly does not leave much of an oily residue. My wife and I have used it right after the shower and towel drying our hair. 3 squirts from the bottle was good for her hair while my shorter crop only needed one. Once it has absorbed, the hair is very manageable without be laden down and flat looking. In other words, still soft and fluffy, but easier to style and it feels healthy.

"Monoprice offers quality cables at a great price point. A 6ft generic store brand version of this cable cost me $5 more and wasn't MFi certified. I've only used it for a short time, but it feels just as sturdy and the Apple version and the lightening connector fits easily past the cases on my family's iPads and iPhones. While some might prefer a shorter cable, I usually plug my cable into a wall socket or power strip using a USB adapter, so the extra length is welcome. 6ft probably would be enough but 10ft gives me even more flexibility.

"I'm an old school Star Wars fan and the Falcon is my favorite hunk-o-junk of all time. I'm a bit picky when it comes to reproductions of it.

"I like the ""look at me"" appearance of Invicta watches. They are like the Lamborghinis and Ferrari's of the watch world (looks wise). I like many of their designs and the overall quality of the timepieces themselves. Fit and finish are not up to 'Rolex' level, but neither are the prices. This is my second Invicta and I've handled a number of others. As far as Invicta watches go, this one is still bold, yet rather understated in design and color scheme. The comfortable black leather band with white stitching is a plus too. It comes with Invicta's signature yellow box which makes it a great, showy, item for gift giving.Invicta (at this price point) is all about flash though. This is hardly a ""Pro"" diver's watch. The outer bezel doesn't turn and the 3 lower dials can be hard to read under the best lighting and circumstances. The I wouldn't use it with this band in the water either. My last watch's band was a heavy rubber and it broke. Twice. For $28 just to send it in for replacement and repair (before other costs), I didn't get a second band. I'm hoping this one is more durable. It also looks like I might be able to replace it with a non-Invicta band if it comes to that.The company puts the list price at just under $1K, but anyone familiar with Invicta knows how overinflated that is. What Amazon is selling it for is closer to the truth, though still a little pricey for what you get. It is a large, heavy, solid watch with an attractive leather band.

"I'm a graphic desinger and I've had Epson printers and scanners since the 90s. As a MAC user, I find they usually tended to cater to 1) the artistic side of things and 2) the Apple platform. Fast forward to late 2015 and I feel I finally have an EPSON printer that meets the needs of the Apple enthusiast and designer who made them popular. This compact wireless XP-960 is great for both the casual all-in-one user and those that want to create quality prints. The set-up was the easiest I've ever experienced. After the initial set-up and connecting (all very easy), I was printing wirelessly from both computer and mobile devices alike via my home network. Print quality is exemplary, but I recommend running the set-up print head alignment before using the printer.The 960 provides what you'd expect from a mid-level printer with all-in-on features. Scan quality is better than I had hoped for. Print quality is very good even on plain paper (though a bit muted), and overall usage of the printer is easier than any printer like this I've used in the past. For comparison purposes, my previous printer is and was an Epson 730. It still works and prints well, but the 960 integrates into our home system even better and print quality is better as well. My mobile devices find and can use the printer easily, though you don't get as many options as you do with the a dedicated desktop or laptop. The printer has a lot of features I've yet to explore, but I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a home printer that delivers on compatibility and print quality. It is may not be the best home printer for a graphic designer, but it certainly is better than most at meeting 90% of my needs and those of the more casual user.~ Kort","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IB8PB38QLB8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","R3IB8PB38QLB8S","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It pairs well with a pair of black slacks I also got from Oxford. It is good for work or dress casual. I no longer wear ties often so the collar is a bit ""buttoned up"" for me. The fabric is comfortable and resists wrinkling, which is a plus since I rarely iron my clothes.

"I personally would not spend this kind of money on a playset like this, but my daughter is really into MLP and Equestria Girls, so having a fancy backdrop of the school makes playtime more fun. Aside from the 3 panel backdrop, you don't get a lot of extras. DJ Pon-3 is the only doll to come with the set. I'm not sure why the description says 2 dolls. Her DJ booth does light up and play ""music"" but I was really impressed with the lights or music, and the 3 AAA batteries are not included. The playset feels flimsy, but is holding together.I feel you are paying a lot for a little, and though it is being enjoyed right now, I can see it being relegated to the seldom-used toy heap in just a week or two. You need to ask yourself if your child will get a lot of playtime out of it to make the purchase worth it. I know I wore out my Death Star playset as a kid, but this Canterlot High is no Death Star. But that's me, the Dad. My daughter is loving it, ...for now. As with many toys these days, there is a digital/app tie-in that my girl has already figured out.It indicates adult assembly required, but my daughter was able to put it together herself -- and wanted to!

"This is my first flatscreen HDTV, so please realize this review is from someone who has used non-HD tvs at home up to this point. The company I work for sells commercial grade Samsung TVs to the hospitality industry, so I'm familiar with them and know they are a quality product. This is Samsung's base line series (5), though still a bit more advanced with the SMART features. I got mine locally on sale for less than last year's non-smart model, so am satisfied at the value.What I like:- Easy to set up. The process was fairly smooth, though I ran into some cable and Wi-Fi connectivity issues. My fault though.- Lovely clear picture and better audio than I expected for a thin unit.- Once Connected, The SMART hub offers a lot of web based content.- Controls fairly easy to understand and use.What's not so great. This may seem like a lot of negatives, but I feel most are relatively minor yet worth noting.- 2 HDMI inputs only. None have ARC.- Remote not very ergonomic- TV starts up quickly, yet the SMART menu takes about 2 minutes to become ready- Image quality varies. I suppose this is normal with HDTVs that don't have constant HD input, but it is noticeable over the older TV's uniform look.- Color balance in the reds tend towards a cooler magenta rather than a warmer red/yellow. I have not be able to find a way to adjust the colors appropriately even with a bunch of tweaking. Skin tones looked better on my analog TV.- I have a Bose Soundtouch 120 system hooked up to my TV. While it improves the sound quality, the TV didn't have HDMI ARC so I needed to get an optical audio cable to handle the added throughput.- Typing is a hunt and peck affair via the remote. Very time consuming.- My (Xfintity) cable box does not have an HDMI out so I use either the coaxial cable or AV cables to connect to the TV. AV cables provide a stronger audio signal, but coaxial provides a better picture. Upgrading my cable box will likely fix address this.It is a big change moving from an SD Plus TV to and HDTV. You lose the warmer analog look in favor of the more detailed digital HD look. Most of the time it is great. It can be a shock to those moving from one platform to the next though, especially if you don't have an HD infrastructure in place to support what the TV is capable of. I've seen what this TV is capable of and am impressed. I wish it were more seamless thing, but can't fault the TV. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and this foothold in the next generation of TVs. Even with digital content I've yet to achieve the clarity I see on the TVs in the showrooms, but I know I'll get there.~ Kort","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUROMAIU4BHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR292JE#wasThisHelpful","RQUROMAIU4BHF","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While taller than many non-charging cases, this one-piece design is slimmer and more affordable than most and I like the clean white look. I have a black iPhone 6, but it still looks attractive in this case and is well protected on the back and corners; and by the front by the bumper (I have a screen protector). As a case alone, it does a good job and all ports and controls are accessible, cameras are unobstructed and the speaker still sounds about the same, maybe even better now that it redirected to the front of the phone.As a MFI-Certified charging case, it gives more than a full recharge of my phone, more than doubling my battery life. This is fantastic. One minor drawback might be that while charge via a cord, you have to charge the phone fully first before the case battery begins charging. This will slightly more than double connected charging time so keep that in mind. However, you can charge the phone and the case while you're sending data through the iPhone -- something not all battery cases allow. It's a nice feature and shows how well this case integrates with the iPhone. The case charges the phone quickly.Perhaps it integrates too well. Once the phone is snapped in, it is a hassle to get off again. This is no big deal if you plan to leave the case on 24/7, but if plan on removing your phone for whatever reason, it isn't easy, and delicate component parts can bend and perhaps break. Other minor drawbacks are the added weight the somewhat slick battery case adds, the slight rounded back and the need to use their USB charger. Written instructions would have been nice too.This is a great charging case for the price and it does a lot of things well. There is a little room for improvement though. I was sent this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.~ Kort","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T7VWQE4QSU5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGQ2W3G#wasThisHelpful","R3T7VWQE4QSU5G","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I'm personally not a big fan of taking 3 large caplets a day, you do it if you need to and this one is effective. I've tried a number of joint supplements that contain Glucosamine and they all worked fairly well but required a few doses a day. At least this uses just one caplet at a time and I didn't find them hard to swallow. With daily use per the instructions, it should last about 5 months, so the high initial price point is worth it. If you want to take just one a day, then I recommend trying Schiff's Move Free Ultra Type II. It has a non-Glucosamine formulation but is still effective.This works for me. I'm in my mid-40s and when I stop taking supplements like this, I notice more aches and pains and joint issues, even though I am fairly active and get good nutrition otherwise. Old sports injuries make themselves felt. Joint Soother helps keep those aches away to a large degree.  They are still sometimes noticed, but I'm not thinking, ""geez, my knees, feet, or hands are killing me today."" In my experience, it takes about a month for Glucosamine (Chondroitin, MSM) supplements to start being effective, but I rolled from taking a competitive brand (Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH) into this one and over a week later I'm still feeling fine.

"I was sent an evaluation unit by the Amazon Vine Program.I was actually expecting the X-Wing version of this toy, but was sent this model instead. If you have children who like Star Wars and are not that old yet, it would make a fun yet pricy gift. The idea behind the Mashers is that you can mix and match body parts to create custom figures. Other toys in this line range from $10 to $50, so if you want to mix parts, prepare to spend some money.The ship also reconfigures, though not a lot. It has a laser that shoots a projectile, so that along with the figure coming apart doesn't make it an appropriate toy for small children that like to put things in their mouths.While it looks kinda cool (and hey, it is Star Wars), it has an exaggerated Fisher-Price Hero World appearance I find off putting. So these toys may not be for older kids and adults and all but the most hardcore collectors. This 40-something old school fan is not overly impressed. Pre-school through middle school would seem to be the target audience.

Just unpack the parts, add AA batteries, turn on both the controller and the scooter, and Pinkie Pie is ready for action. The controller plays music clips and sound effects in addition to maneuvering the scooter. It is amazing how fast that thing can spin, but it has a 4th small wheel to help it make tight turns. The range is good for at least 50 feet, which is about as far as we can see it in our house.

"This Moen faucet is a stunner simply from the form side of things. It's swooping shape and brushed metal finish just begs to be looked at.  Functionally, it works quite well also. The high arch and pull-out faucet with stream or spray selector is perfect for working with large dishes in a crowed sink.  The flow pause feature is a nice touch too. As seen in the photos, it fits well in an area with little backspace, but also looks good on open counter space. A bonus is that it is shaped like the filtered water dispenser installed to the right of our kitchen sink so we have a design theme going now.I've installed a number of faucets in our home, and this installation was the easiest by far. My sink is cut for 3 holes, and I had to contact Moen to get one, which they sent promptly with no fuss. Once I had that, installation when smoothly and I was done in about an hour. It was a bit tight and awkward maneuvering beneath the skink and around the garbage disposal, but I knew what to expect and all went well. Just makes sure you have all of the proper tools and that all parts are there and undamaged before beginning.The Moen Notch is a lovely example of kitchen hardware and it feel quite durable so should last a long time.

"I installed a new bathroom faucet in our master bath about 3 years ago. It has worn okay for a sub-$100 Depot purchase, but there are little things I'm not super happy with. It is beginning to show wear after this short period of time, and I feel the water stream could be more powerful. Enter the Delta 564. This is more along the lines of a faucet you might find in a modern, upscale commercial bathroom, but it is classy and looks good in the home environment too, despite its industrial design. It is the fourth faucet I've installed, and it was the easiest (though still took a couple of hours to do right). Read all of the instructions first and make sure you have the proper tools and accessories handy. Get a plumber if you suspect this may not be something you can handle. The only slight hitch for me aside from maneuvering in the tight confines under my sink was the long length of the plumbing tubes, but I was able to curl and bind them to keep them out of the way of under-sink usage. The faucet mechanism is smooth and exact, the water flow good, and it feels solid. I used the 6"" escutcheon to cover the 3 holes left in the sink from the original faucet, but it still looks good. I have a feeling this Delta is going to go the distance and perform well for years to come, but I will update here if that isn't the case.~ Kort","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R130WS7TH565L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1FWAFW#wasThisHelpful","R130WS7TH565L0","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not as flashy as they appear in the photos, and a tad smaller than I expected, but I really like these hoop earrings on my wife. She normally wears subtly styled earrings so these suit here nicely. Up to a couple of feet away, they indeed appear antique. There are no gems, but gold with rose gold accent and heart scrollwork along the bottom, they are very classy. They have a sparkle that makes a viewer think they MIGHT have gems from several feet away. My wife's sensitive ears suffered no irritation from these and the only really problem I can think of is that my 11 year old daughter likely wants to whisk them away. The click-top clasp I can see perhaps wearing over time, but for not it holds them shut nicely and is easy to open by feel. The gift box is understated yet of quality, so it makes for a lovely presentation.If the woman in your life likes this kind of style, why not spoil her a little?

"At almost 45 years old, I grew up thinking Bose products were the best because they are expensive, compact and supposedly innovative. I later learned this wasn't always the case. Still, the Bose name carries a certain panache and high expectations. For the most part, I am happy to say that this sound bar home theater system delivers to all but the most discriminating audiophiles and tech geeks. At this price point, you expect a lot. For the most part, the SoundTouch 120 delivers. It replaces a Sony HTCT260H in my home and is definitely and upgrade. Sound performance is comparable, but I'd give the edge to the new Bose system.When sitting in front of the sound bar, the Bose sounds sharper and fuller. The base woofer fills the room at the low end nicely. I would say 20x20 foot room is ideal for the 120, but can handle larger spaces as well. AdaptIQ helped the sound in our odd space sound great in the main room and the adjoining kitchen. Connectivity to television and in-home WiFi (and mobile device Bluetooth) is outstanding.

"I'm old enough to have seen the original Star Wars in the theater. I was still under 10 at the time, but I remember it well. It was an amazing experience that transported me to far away worlds and sparked my playtime imagination for years to come. Aside from action figures and play sets, Star Wars merchandise has been hit or miss in the fun department. Especially with gaming. X-Wing and Tie-Fighter were big for me in the 90s but other video games didn't deliver. Fast forward to the present and now we have Disney's Infinity 3.0 Bundle.As a collector, I had to have this for the Boba Fett figure alone. As a fan of TOS, video games, and the latest animated Star Wars shows, this set really delivers. In the huge box you get lots of goodies - as has been laid out by other reviewers. The gameplay is amazing, as is the possibilities for creative fun with what is included. I could spend hours promoting what is provided here, the many pros and the few cons as well, but I'll try to be brief. If you are a Star Wars fan, or if you kids love the franchise -- get this. Get a PS4 if you have to. It might not totally supplant Minecraft, but it will put a big dent in the time kids spend on it. As an old school fan, I've found a lot to love here.

"Tessa Hadley's 'The Past' is not my usual literary fare. Gentle, meandering family dramas don't usually find their way into my hands for pleasure reading. Historical fiction, action and adventure, fantasy and sci-fi -- these are most often the staples of my reading diet. This lovely novel falls into none of those categories.I wasn't sure what to expect when I cracked open 'The Past', but from the first few pages I was hooked and wanted more. I don't mean hooked in the sense that I had to find out what happens next, because there are no real climactic scenes and overt plot twists to engage such thinking. Rather, I wanted to spend time with the characters. This is an exceptionally well written family drama about four siblings (sisters and a brother) and their families coming together in mid-life at the deteriorating family in the English countryside for a reunion of sorts and to decide what to do with their mother's (grandparents') home. The writing is unrushed and invites the reader to linger and ponder the motivations of the various characters, primarily the siblings but also the ancillary characters. We begin in the present, have a flashback to the past when the mother still lived in the home, and then come back to there here and now.I'm not sure who I would recommend 'The Past' to. Certainly fans of contemporary English literature and Ms. Hadley's other works. But even the hard-core Action/Adventure reader might find something to enjoy in this well-written interpersonal drama.~ Kort","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10V8KWDC57L59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062270419#wasThisHelpful","R10V8KWDC57L59","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Expo Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers markers at work and for my kids school needs for some time. They work great and priced fairly.  The AmazonBasics markers may seem more expensive at the outset, but they are larger and should last longer, especially considering their special DryGuard ink. For all intents and purposes though, they work much like Expo chisel-tip markers and while are considered low-odor, they still have a distinctive scent to them. They write easily, thin or thick, and are easy to wipe off in the first day or two. They WILL eventually dry and be harder to remove without a solvent though, so are best used for very temporary note taking or presentations.Aside from making lists at work, my kids use these at school and we have a fridge dry erase board for the daily diner menu or to leave messages for family members.

"Finding and appropriately healthy AND good tasting protein bar can be hit or miss. Unfortunately, for me Manitoba Harvest Hemp Heart Protein Apple Cinnamon bars are in part a miss. Perusing the ingredient list, I won't dispute that they are a healthy snack. They're an excellent source of vegan, non-GMO protein and omegas. All in a handy bar form you can take with you wherever you go.  I personally just don't care for their taste and texture. The apple cinnamon flavored hemp has an odd tone and aftertaste, and the texture is a bit off-putting. I like hemp but perhaps this not the best flavor combination (maybe it is the rosemary?). This coming from a guy who eats a variety of healthy bars similar to this. Aside from a rather gritty texture, they also don't look overly appetizing. Not bit deal for the later, but there you go. They are worth trying if you want this kind of on-the-go dietary supplement, but I would not get a whole box to start with. Perhaps they will grow on me. Other options to consider are Health Warrior Chia Bars and/or Detour Smart Nutrition Bars.EDIT: 09/21 - The flavor has grown on me. Still not my favorite, but not bad. Good for an on-the-go healthy snack. 3.5 stars.EDIT: 11/12 - The flavor and texture continued to grow on me.

"It can often be difficult to determine if an OTC supplement is working or not. I've no such issue with Jarro-Zymes. The night before these arrived I ate a garlicy bean and pasta dish and it caused some intestinal discomfort (gas, bloating). These capsules arrived the next day and I took one with the leftovers. No issues this time. They are priced fairly and are vegetarian based enzymes rather than ones derived from animal sources, so they actually have a broader appeal.

"Power strips have come a long way. Compared to those from just a few years ago, this one has a very compact size for 6 outlets, ensures 'clean' energy transmission, has built-in child-safe outlet protectors, and a terrific product usage warranty. The slim form is reason enough for me to want it. If I had to find one issue -- and this can be a big one -- is it may be too compact. It moves and twists easily if heavy cords are attached, and the strip is not affixed to anything.

"This pricy Black & Decker PureOptics(tm) task lamp is quite impressive. It is well built. It has a USB charging port in the base. The magnifying glass has great optics for peering down at your work. The LED lights run cool and have 5 levels of brightness of what appears to be a fairly neutral light. Basically, I can see someone who needs this sort of light really liking it and getting a lot of use out of it. My wife is a watercolor artist and this is a great replacement for the current 2 bulb task lamp she currently uses on her oversized drafting table workspace.There are some aspects that are not so perfect. The base for this light is heavy. Perhaps too heavy at 12lbs.! it feels like it is stuck to the desktop and it is hard to lift or push it. It's great for lamp stability but bad for flexibility. Along those lines, the arm doesn't rotate in the base. The joints move vertically and the head of the lamp has a wide range of motion, but if you want to move the arm horizontally, then you need to shift the base. Lastly, the light controls are cool but not super easy to use. You press and hold down on one side of the top pad to reduce the light, and likewise for the increasing the light when pressing the other side. Sensitivity varies. A quick touch in the middle turns the light on and off. It isn't overly intuitive, but I got the hang of it fairly quickly.The Black & Decker PureOptics Summit Zoom desk lLamp is a great modern light and tool for those with the desk space and strength to take full advantage of it. The USB charging port is particularly useful for those who use a tablet or smartphone constantly throughout the day and don't want to deplete their battery.  I really like it but for those few caveats.~ Kort","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBOPPDPZTQEWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW75FY#wasThisHelpful","RBOPPDPZTQEWV","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Photography In The Digital Age: The Art of Image Capture (Volume 1) is a great book for the new or intermediate digital photographer who wants to learn everything they can about their new passion. It is a great mix of old school meets the modern age.  Think of it as a 101 type college course in photography. Readers such as myself who are more at the ""graduate level"" will appreciate the thorough information presented, and may enjoy reading it as a refresher with the occasional tidbit popping up that we may not have known. It explains photography, composition, and color theory in an easy to comprehend format that engages the reader. It is a fun to read book with good information and rewarding visuals, and will be a great resource for your reference library. Mr. Lawton's passion for and experience with photography shines through on every page.

Nexxus has a reputation for producing affordable salon quality hair care products. The ones I've used thus far uphold that reputation. Emergencee is a luscious conditioner that leaves my hair soft, manageable and moisturized without being weighed down by excess oils. It has a noticeable but pleasant scent that mellows after rinsing. I don't fret overmuch about the abundance of mysterious ingredients in this most other hair care products. This one does what I expect from it and that is what matters.

"I've been using Ace bandages all my life. It has been a while since I needed one, but my daughter plays basketball and soccer so they are a staple again in my house. I like the new black look over the old flesh tone bandage, and think it wraps as well or easier as the older versions even though it appears to be the same elastic material. The clips, which have always been a weak link for Ace bandages, could still use improvement. It is better perhaps than the smaller, more simple clip that would stick to the bandage cloth by piercing it, but I think it is too big, and too obtrusive. Also it's not as simple to attach to a fresh bandage as the older version. And there is only one, so the side ends of the bandage will inevitably curl. I still prefer the smaller metal ones and some surgical tape strips to cover them so they hold on better. The bandage will still lose elasticity over time, but I've yet to encounter a bandage that doesn't. Thus it is still good to keep one or two of these in your first aid kit, or handy when you or your child is participating in a sporting event. For long-term conditions or injuries, a pre-made brace or compression sleeve (rather than a rap) like Breathable Neoprene Elbow Support or Copper Compression Recovery Knee Sleeves are what I'd recommend.3.5 stars, rounded up.~ Kort","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TNI3H2EFC7OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLI9OD4#wasThisHelpful","R1TNI3H2EFC7OH","A2W9I628I6SE1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9I628I6SE1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those looking for a step up in quality from VO5 or Suave, this Axe White label is a good, cost-effective option. I'm in my forties but still like many Axe products. Night seems a bit classier than some of their more overpowering scents. It is still strong, especially in the shower, but it soon mellows to a woody and slightly fruity scent. The menthol gives it a nice tingle and I use it was an all over body wash in a addition to a shampoo/conditioner in one. It lathers and cleans well, and leaves my hair and skin feeling and smelling good. The conditioning aspect isn't very strong, but it won't overly dry out your hair either.

"Whoever decided to print this book using such a small font size for the majority of the text should be fired. Seriously, it ruins the any enjoyment or accessibility there might be to this book. And the content, is fantastic. After the engaging introduction, it goes on to review the most currently held theories on the science of evolution, citing countless examples and exploring various time periods and life forms. The photos, drawings, 3D renderings and charts/table pull the view in, but unfortunately the size of the actual works pushes the reader out.

"The cat tree looks as if it has everything and then some. But it really doesn't. It has moving parts, and I don't know any cat who is a swinger...literally. There are a hammock and a swing, and they go unused. The multiple ledges are fine, the single cubby isn't bad (though perhaps a bit small for a Persian or Maine Coon), the stairs are a good addition, and the roped supporting bars are great. Otherwise, the material is the type of plush used on kids' toys and not suitable for vacuuming, though it's terrific for picking up shed fur. It is difficult to assemble, and I suggest having two people on hand. Another reviewer wound up assembling it from the top down, and that's a pretty good idea. The color is iffy - neutral enough to go with any dcor, but light enough to show stains from every hairball and shed fur from most cats.

"The four flavors (2 bars each) have a wide range in the amount of salt and sugar. The dark chocolate with raspberries and sea salted almonds has 11 grams of sugar and 25 mg of sodium, while the milk chocolate with toasted coconut and macadamia nuts has 19 grams of sugar and 40 mg of sodium. The milk chocolate with sea salted almonds (no fruit) boasts 16 grams of sugar and 80 mg of sodium, and the dark chocolate with sea salted pistachios comes in at 11 grams of sugar and a whopping 120 mg of sodium. I found the sea salt to be very uneven; crunching into a chunk of it in the pistachio bar made my mouth shrivel up, and the bar itself didn't taste strongly enough of pistachios.

"This is like a milder form of the kind of book Lolah Burford was known for. Christian, the Duke of Mercia, is shown no mercy by his French captors during the Napoleonic Wars. He's tortured almost to death, and stays alive solely in the hopes of someday killing them all. Eventually, he's released, a gaunt, silent, scurvy-afflicted shadow of his former self, riddled with scars inside and out. Along comes the recently widowed cousin of his late wife, ready to take him - and his newly mute daughter - under her protection. She has her own problems, and the unlikely couple begin to heal together. However, the past is still present, and in an unexpected way it ensnares them both. Most of the book is written in the close third person from Christian's point of view, as is the author's style. Relatively little is revealed from Gilly, the heroine's, viewpoint. The villain is easily guessed early in the narrative, and the bulk of the book is spent dwelling upon the sexual development of the relationship. One point that annoyed me: ""Christian"" and ""Mercia"" point too deliberately at Christian mercy, a quality that is understandably lacking in the hero. The reader doesn't need to have this emphasis on every page.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23V4RXEZ5C9NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402278780#wasThisHelpful","R23V4RXEZ5C9NV","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some ways, this author is starting to grow on me, but I'm still not convinced that one person has written dozens of books within three years or so, all of them lengthy novels with pretty decent editing. Also, I'm not sure the author is a woman, since all the books I've read so far, including this one, are told mostly in the close third person from the male point of view, and most of the sex scenes are written that way. It's almost as if they're written for gay men who want to read historical romance, and I have no problem with that. It's just a different angle for me as a female reader. There are touching scenes and humorous ones, but the reader must suspend a fair amount of disbelief. For example, Noah, the straight-arrow hero, is obsessed with privacy but blurts out marital details to all sorts of people, none of whom have the right to hear them. Thea, the slightly tarnished heroine, has no qualms about quarreling with her husband at every opportunity, yet doesn't force him to listen to her side of a most important story. I was wondering how one of the major obstacles to the happy-ever-after would be resolved, and was pleased with the way the author tied up the loose ends. It looks as if I'll continue reading her books, which she seems to be churning out once a month, making it even more unlikely that she's a one-writer show. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a whole group of men, a writer's club, working together under the name Grace Burrowes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0V6XSEXGT1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492605301#wasThisHelpful","R2S0V6XSEXGT1E","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The good news: this is fairly light and easy to assemble, and likely to blend with neutral dcor. The bad news: it isn't really designed for cats. As any cat owner knows, cats scratch because their new claws grow inside the old ones, which become large, rounded, and loose. They need something to dig those claws into, to pull the shells of the old ones off. Any bristly material, like tree bark, or tough cloth, like canvas, or fibrous concoction, like sisal rope or the backing of carpet, are ideal for the purpose. This cat tree is covered with plush, one of the worst imaginable materials. Not only is it ineffective for scratching, it catches lint and shed fur like a magnet, can't be vacuumed without created droopy flops of cloth, isn't removable for washing, and I don't understand why it was used for a cat tree. There are some bits of sisal rope, but hardly enough. This would have been a million times better if the support posts were wood with the bark still on it, or solidly covered with rope or carpet backing. I've seen cat trees with removable, washable pads - that would have been a great idea for this as well. As for the configurations, the little containers are suitable for kittens and small-boned cats, like Siamese, but if you have multiple adult cats, or heavy felines like Persians or Maine Coons, this tree isn't going to be ideal for them. However, it is affordable, pretty, and if you don't mind plush...well, I can't get my mind around it. It's a deal breaker for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R44DT4LNW15R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY26XPW#wasThisHelpful","R44DT4LNW15R8","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reader, be warned: this is a reprint of a Harlequin romance written in 1989, and has all the earmarks of that era. It's short. The hero's ""secret"" past is revealed in the space of a couple of paragraphs and dispensed with fast in favor of the warmth and charm of the heroine's present life (as an innkeeper on an island off the coast of Washington State). The heroine is unrelievedly good, with not a fault, flaw, vice or any physical imperfection. She has golden hair and blue eyes, is an organized bundle of energy, and is universally beloved by all who know her. Love occurs at first sight, which is necessary considering how short the book is. Love is expressed within the timeframe of a single day (I counted, out of curiosity). Within a week, marriage is proposed. Naturally, the heroine is in some peril, from which the hero must save her. However, in a nod to the author's future trademark self-reliant heroines, she has a hand in saving herself. As with any Harlequin, love conquers all and there is a happy-ever-after in store for Charity and Roman. It isn't a bad book, but if you compare it to more recent stand-alones, it has practically no substance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RET5IZUR3BOEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P7HVPI#wasThisHelpful","RET5IZUR3BOEV","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the previous book, which was profoundly entrenched in the supernatural, Charlie Parker is almost a shadow of his former self and the reader wonders how long he can keep going. After life threatening injuries, he's trying to recuperate in a small town where, it seems, everyone knows him by reputation and steers clear with a lively sense of self-preservation. His nearest neighbors, a single mother and her pre-teen daughter, are hoping to be similarly avoided - but why? After a body washes up on the beach, Parker finds himself involved in murder once again, but rather than ancient gods he's dealing with ancient people and their dark secrets. He's barely up to the task, but indomitable. The most interesting part of the book was about Samantha, his young daughter, who seems to have unusual powers. Did she inherit them from her father, who has the ability to interact with the Beyond, or is it something else? I was more focused on her than on the rest of the story, and I hope she comes into her own in later books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25L8R4XKHWJJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501118285#wasThisHelpful","R25L8R4XKHWJJ0","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As someone raised during the early days of the Women's Liberation movement, I struggled with the idea that women could have it all. It wasn't what I saw among my family, friends, neighbors and coworkers. In discussions, we all wondered what we might be doing wrong. Sooner or later, we all agreed that we were promised too much. In an ideal world, it would be possible to have a rewarding career, a loving relationship, a happy home, and well-raised children, and even some extra time to develop ourselves. This isn't an ideal world. Ms. Slaughter writes a clear and engaging account of the promises (kept and broken), the potential (and suggestions for achieving it) and the basic reality of the choices we face as individuals and couples. She particularly endorses early, frequent and candid communication between partners about their expectations and their willingness to compromise in the short and long term. She cites credible research as well as examples she has encountered. In short, this book is not simply ""preaching to the choir"" but an excellent overview of a subject that affects us all. Whether you're just starting out, or about to retire; whether you've always been single, or are in a long-term relationship; whether you're planning to have children, have already raised them, or are juggling elder care with babies, there are facts, reassurances, suggestions and a whole lot of fascinating and relevant information. I especially appreciate the lack of jargon and the warmth with which the author writes. She's been there, done that, and has a fine-tuned sense of what is needed next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25WPDVV16C1V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994566#wasThisHelpful","R25WPDVV16C1V4","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quite a thriller, and not quite over-the-top. The heroine's story is told in the first person, while alternating chapters are told in the close third person. Kaylee is living a stress-filled life in a small town. Her little brother is gravely ill, her mother doesn't seem to be doing anything about it, and Kaylee's efforts, to date, have all been well-meant but so misguided (even illegal) that she's up to her eyeballs in trouble. When a new social website appears, and everyone in her high school signs up, she finds herself on it as a last-ditch effort to help her brother. Instead, the website, called NEED, gradually seduces the teens into doing mischief, and the mischief has consequences no one could predict. Who is behind this? Why are people dying? And how is Kaylee getting caught in the net of mayhem and murder? I found my heart pounding as I read along. There are, of course, some YA tropes, such as the inability of adults to understand anything or take control. It's all up to the teens. Overall, I thought this was a truly scary book and well worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R67DL07V6H8IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544416694#wasThisHelpful","R67DL07V6H8IG","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are pretty decent gloves. I've never tried nitrile before, and I like the feel of it. Although the box says ""textured"", I didn't notice any texture. It's also strange that, on the front of the box, it states ""industrial gloves"", but on the back of the box it states that these aren't intended for ""prolonged, direct exposure to harsh chemicals, where heavy duty or industrial gloves are required"". After trying them out, my takeaway is that these are useful for short-term household use, such as cleaning a toilet with bleach or tiles with anti-mold cleanser. That's fine with me. I like to protect my hands from the chemicals in those disposable disinfecting wipes, and that turns out to be what I most often use these gloves for. They're thin, so if you need to protect your fingers while doing more delicate work, they should suit you. But...they're thin, so be careful if using any sharp objects.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WTJ54E9OIOYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BR8KB4#wasThisHelpful","R2WTJ54E9OIOYI","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Take a breath, you're going to need it. The pace in this, the 41st entry (not counting novellas) in the In Death series, is far faster than in any of its forerunners. Most of the action takes place within a couple of days, and the countdown is given frequently because someone's life is at stake. There's a fairly brief introduction to the villains, so the reader knows up front who they are and has a good sense of what they're doing and why. But Lt. Eve Dallas, in NYC, has yet to meet this lethal pair. There is one new character, Deputy Banner from out of state, and I hope we see more of him in the future. His experience of slower, small-town life makes a nice contrast to the headlong rush of Eve's NY. Since Eve and her husband, the fabulously wealthy Roarke, are now in a fairly smooth relationship, there's only one minor bump to lend interest. Other secondary characters of long standing are hardly mentioned. I can understand that something had to give; in a story based on top-speed police procedural, there's limited space for the extended crew, but I miss the interaction and character development. Baby Bella is turning a year old, Nadine is house-hunting, and Trueheart is taking his detective's exam, but there's very little about any of this. Despite this lack, the sizzling speed and urgency of the investigation keep the reader turning pages quickly. For the squeamish, be warned...there's a lot of torture detailed here. I think some of those details could have been omitted in favor of bringing secondary characters to the fore, but it obviously was not the author's intention to remove attention from the horror of the crimes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OLFLA6V9KLKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039917088X#wasThisHelpful","R2OLFLA6V9KLKB","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a 1990 Harlequin (I now own the large print, hardcover Chivers version from 2004), so the reader knows right off the bat what she'll find: an incredibly rugged, handsome, alpha hero, and an incredibly beautiful, virginal, feisty heroine. In addition, the story's theme is Mail Order Bride,  contemporary version. Out West, where men are Men and women are Little Ladies, Reese Duncan is struggling to save the family ranch. His ex-wife, a beauty from the big city, took him to the cleaners in a nasty divorce, and his heart and soul are now encased in ice as far as women are concerned. But he wants children to inherit his ranch, he wants a warm body in his bed, and he wants a partner to keep house and home while he's out tending the land. So he puts an ad in the paper. Madelyn Patterson is a beautiful city girl who yearns for a more leisurely and meaningful life. She already has some family money, so it's her inner quest that has her responding to Duncan's ad. It's undoubtedly love at first sight, but Duncan resists with all his considerable strength. He tells Madelyn she's not up to the role of rancher's wife and sends her packing. But, after reviewing the few other candidates, he gives in. Madelyn, who is a lot more clear-sighted, understands she's in love and is facing an uphill battle to break through Duncan's reserve, but she's up for the challenge. As these two spirited characters face off and develop a relationship, a minimum of secondary characters leaven the tale. There's Madelyn's brother (who has his own book, ""Loving Evangeline""), Floris, the man-hating caf owner, and that's about it. The weather also plays a part, from the scorching summer to the brutal winter, in which both hero and heroine face real danger. Will Madelyn overcome Duncan's distrust? Can the ranch be saved? Will true love win out? I give you one guess!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BV5J4O8DHEJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078626392X#wasThisHelpful","R1BV5J4O8DHEJB","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the author's best books in years, and certainly the best of the Survivors series (this is the sixth of seven planned books). The hero, Percy, who at first appears to be too good to be true, has endearing flaws and faults. He's afraid of heights and the sea, he's unbelievably rude, and he's rather aimless, having drifted on his good looks and fortune all his adult life. The heroine, who at first appears to be too damaged to heal, has strength and qualities that gradually endear her to the reader. The heroine's backstory, known in part from previous books, is that she was captured with her husband during the Peninsular Wars, watched him be tortured and die, and she has been an emotional wreck ever since, even though it is now eight years later and she's managing to endure life in a superficial way. These two unlikely people come together, and sparks fly. But they are not alone in the story. There are delightful secondary characters, such as Lady Lavinia, who collects stray humans and animals, and Cousin Adelaide, who hates men with a passion and has no hesitation about expressing her opinion in front of the foe. There is also something sinister going on, and it turns out to be as relevant to the past as to the present. The suspense holds up well, the confrontational dialogue between hero and heroine is often quite funny, the romance is believable, and the ending totally satisfying. After reading the last few books in this series, I was starting to think that the author had lost her luster, but this reassures me that she has a firm grasp of the reins!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L6RD5NA4BISN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469682#wasThisHelpful","R2L6RD5NA4BISN","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The conclusion of the Sanctus trilogy is thrilling, but if anyone is strongly invested in Liv and Gabriel, the heroine and hero of the first two books, be prepared: this book focuses more on another hero. Agent Shepherd (all the names in all the books have strong significance, by the way) is a rookie with the FBI, yet somehow gets partnered with an experienced agent and the two are sent to investigate an extremely high-profile event: sabotage of the Hubble space telescope. They're hampered by a lot more than the usual villains. There is a religious conspiracy at play, with seemingly unlimited funds and other resources. The weather has turned on its head everywhere, and people are taking to the road in unprecedented and unstoppable hordes. Everyone is going home, whatever home means to them. Liv is out in the desert, pregnant and apparently in charge as a motley assortment of refugees make their way to her side. Gabriel is tied to a bed in the Citadel, the ominous home of an ancient order of monks. A seemingly incurable disease is wiping out people. And Shepherd has more at stake than tracking down bad guys. I was satisfied with this book, but I would have liked to have read more about Liv and Gabriel. Still, there was a thrilling and satisfying conclusion. The author has a new series on tap, and the first book of it was already terrific, so I'm going to stick with Mr. Toyne for future adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAR9T8LJ1Z7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062225901#wasThisHelpful","RQAR9T8LJ1Z7F","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second installment of this thrilling trilogy does NOT suffer from the usual failings of the middle book. In many trilogies, they are often a weak link between an exciting start and climactic conclusion. But The Key is a strong novel, and essentially a long chase, from America to Turkey and back and into the desert. Liv Adamsen, a crime reporter from New Jersey, is investigating the apparent suicide of her brother, who had been a monk in a reclusive, sinister and all-but-unknown religious order in Turkey. Gabriel Mann, descendant of an ancient tribe (think 7,000 years ago or more) is doing his best to keep her alive while the monks and the Catholic Church are out to see her dead. All around them, the world is beginning to collapse; weather patterns are running amok, people and animals are migrating, and a horrific disease is taking hold. Is it the End of Days? There's a host of secondary characters, many of them quite well-drawn, considering the rapid pacing of the story. There are heart-rending scenes, enigmatic puzzles rooted in ancient times, and I loved this book as much as I loved Sanctus, the first one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25IEEG8ZXLVMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062038338#wasThisHelpful","R25IEEG8ZXLVMU","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific book, truly thrilling, with some surprises and lots of intriguing possibilities. It's the first of a trilogy and, although I think there are too many trilogies on the market, this is one time I approve. It starts off mysteriously enough, with a monk in an ancient and secretive order. It looks as if his brethren are going to kill him, but he escapes...sort of. This sets off a chain reaction that involves the entire planet. But the focus is on the monk's sister, a journalist who has been searching for him for years. As soon as she learns of his whereabouts, she heads to Ruin, Turkey, where there are those who seek to kill her at all costs, and others equally devoted to saving her life. In the meantime, the world is changing in astonishing ways, from unexpected weather events to the migration of people and animals. The characters are intriguing and most are well rounded. The writing is very good and keeps the reader turning pages as fast as possible. I wanted to read it in one sitting, but have to work for a living and was impatient for the workday to end so I could return to this enthralling adventure. By the way, the heroine's name is Liv Adamsen...her name is highly significant, so keep it in mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2COC6O1V4G0UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062038303#wasThisHelpful","R2COC6O1V4G0UO","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are ordinary cordless phones made of cheap plastic, so I don't expect them to last more than a few years. Sometimes I dream about the Good Olde Days, when my Verizon corded phone lasted for decades. But that was then, and this is now. The answering machine can be wall-mounted, and a bracket is included. The Quick Start Guide is pretty comprehensive, but there are even more details available online. Instructions are clear, and in a readable font, and drawings are well done. I appreciate this very much, though many of the functions are bells and whistles I don't need. One thing that is handy, for people who tend to put down handsets and wander off, is a handset finder. Press a button, the handset rings, and you go right to it. The sound isn't perfect, but I'm not sure how much is due to the phone, how much is attributable to the fact that it's cordless and subject to interference, and how much can be blamed upon my service (Time Warner).

"From 2007, this book features one of the author's kick-a$$ heroines who is also a damsel in distress on multiple occasions. It's a win-win for readers who like romantic suspense with a guaranteed happy ending after all sorts of mayhem. Phoebe is a hostage negotiator in Savannah. She has a lot to juggle in daily life, including an agoraphobic mother, an ex-husband who doesn't care about their child, and an insubordinate cop with a serious anger management problem. Then she meets Duncan. He's laid back where she's tightly wound. He's rich, having won a multi-million dollar lottery. And he's gorgeous and willing to fight for her. Then there's Carly, the 7-year-old daughter, Essie, the mother, Ava, the family friend (female), Dave, the family friend (male), Carter (the brother) and his wife Josie, Duncan's friend Phin and his wife and mother...lots of characters. And a fair amount of plot, as it becomes clear that someone's out to get Phoebe and possibly people around her. Is it Arnie Meeks, the bad cop with pull in the department? Is it someone else? Who and why? Set in Spring and Summer, the Georgia heat is almost a character as well. If you've never read a book by Nora Roberts, this is a pretty good place to start. It has some of her trademark witty banter between Phoebe and Duncan to offset the steadily increasing suspense if you don't like too much heart pounding, and it has passionate interludes if you do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PI4B5KUAJIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399154345#wasThisHelpful","R7PI4B5KUAJIF","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are three things I really like about this stapler, and three that I don't.Pros:- it is balanced so that you can press anywhere and it will staple - you don't have to lean on the front alone- it staples flat, as advertised, so if you have piles of paper to file, this will save some space- it staples up to 30 sheets, which is far more than the average staplerCons:- it's heavy, about a pound. If you often staple in the air, by holding it in your hand and squeezing, your wrist will hurt- those flat staples are hard to remove; if you're filing something like taxes, that you plan to shred in a few years, this will annoy you or tangle your shredder- the top doesn't open up, so you can't staple anything to the wallAdditional notes: the staples themselves, because they lie flat instead of looping in the back, can scratch you. They're expensive compared to regular staples.Bottom line: if you staple on a desk, staple many pages, and don't plan to remove those staples, this is for you. If you generally hold a stapler in your hand to staple, are likely to pick out the staples at some point, or are on a budget when it comes to stationery supplies, skip this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXG46XOC3S3UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPP0I3W#wasThisHelpful","RXG46XOC3S3UO","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once upon a time, four decades ago, Alice Cooper was a phenomenal sensation in the rock world. Their deliberately staged shock rock outraged parents, fascinated fans, and made headlines and filled performance arenas everywhere. The music was deliberately gritty, with lyrics designed to incite. Some of those songs hold up beautifully, especially the teen anthem School's Out. A fairly young reporter, Bob Greene from Chicago, pitched the idea of traveling with them on their Christmas tour, the Billion Dollar Babies tour, as a singer and performer (he couldn't sing worth a hill of beans, but that's another story). They let him in and this is the book he wrote about it. He covers all the bases: each of the band members (and their emotional baggage); their manager, the roadies, the groupies, the fans. He records with them and shows how marketing and hype were skillfully handled, as in a radio interview where Alice is presumably fishing on vacation, but the phone call is actually taken in the recording studio in NYC. A lot of scenes are clearly manipulated for effect, but that doesn't detract from the overview of life in a famous band as they tour. The book is now out of print, but you might find it in your library and it's worth reading. You can extrapolate a lot of it to other bands at other times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18BQL1GKLZXCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689106165#wasThisHelpful","R18BQL1GKLZXCG","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a quarter of a century old (1990) and reflects the style popular then: the fragile, virginal young heroine who yet survives every peril - and, believe me, there are plenty of perils on hand for Emma McAvoy, illegitimate daughter of a famous rock star and an unstable, low-life woman. We first meet Emma when she's a precocious toddler, subject to the physical and emotional abuse of her hard-drinking, drug-using mam. Jane thinks she can get back with Brian McAvoy, the poetic lead of the world-renowned band Devastation, but she'll be happy to take money instead. Brian, only 23 and about to marry his pregnant girlfriend, is unprepared for the addition of a brutalized little girl to his life, but he doesn't hesitate.We meet the members of the band, each with his own emotional baggage, and see how Emma grows into being their mascot. Then, tragedy strikes. Years pass, the band members are doing well or ill, and Emma is still their mascot. There's no flash forward; this is a fairly leisurely book, which is nice. Eventually, Emma is an adult. Falls in love, marries...then tragedy strikes again. Emma is like a lightning rod for this kind of thing. And, although it looks as if she's finally finding real love again, there is yet more tragedy in store before the happy ending we know will occur.This is the first Nora Roberts book I ever read, and I've reread it many times over the past 25 years. It holds up very well, so I recommend it, with the single caveat that if you weren't around back then, and are unfamiliar with the Perils of Pauline plotline that so many romance novels used to have, you may find it disconcerting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U31EY5ZRCY42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553106554#wasThisHelpful","R3U31EY5ZRCY42","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read this several times. It's one of the best of the author's books in recent years, and it's like romantic suspense comfort food. You know in advance that all obstacles will be overcome, the heroine will be strong, the hero likewise, and there will be a happy-ever-after, complete with some witty dialogue and sizzling sex along the way. In some ways, the author is a careless writer. She telegraphs a lot of the plot, and an intelligent reader can tell what's going to happen and when. But it's a fun read - well, if you don't mind a couple of serial killers with their warped agendas.Fiona Bristow trains dogs, including Search and Rescue, and she's part of an S&R team. She lives on a remote island off the coast of Washington, and has loyal and devoted friends and family (I'm including her three dogs as part of that family). Simon Doyle has recently moved to the island and his mother has foisted an untrained puppy upon him. Naturally, he brings Jaws, as the voracious pup is named, to Fiona for training. Simon is one of those rough heroes. No tender words, a surly expression, a cranky attitude, and an unwillingness to fall for Fiona, even as he falls hard and fast.Along comes a serial killer, and the rest is the usual storyline. Since I've read this several times, I've long lost interest in that part of the book and skim it to get back to the banter and developing relationship between Fiona and Simon. This is a very enjoyable book, and if you haven't encountered the author before, I do recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUU75Q8M8FPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399156577#wasThisHelpful","RIUU75Q8M8FPR","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bright and cheerful patterns on these dividers will definitely appeal to schoolgirls (not sure about boys on this). The big tabs allow for longer titles, useful for today's more complex subjects in high school, particularly. Instead of Math, how about Advanced Placement Calculus? The 5 dividers come with a printer-friendly sheet of 18 tab inserts, so the dividers are good for three semesters...actually, they're sturdy enough that you can just make your own tab inserts and continue using them. The pocket part swoops up very high, the better to hold sheets without them leaping out, as papers tend to do with most such products. However, smaller bits of paper are likely to be harder to retrieve - index cards come to mind. So I took off one star for that, as I do have small scraps of paper to stow from time to time. More troublesome are those tabs, which is where the second star came off. They stick out of any normal binder. You really need an oversized binder, otherwise the tabs stick out and are prone to catch on things, be rubbed and, eventually, damaged. If you don't mind anything sticking out of a binder, and are careful with it, this won't bother you. I'm very careful with things, but this does bother me. I suppose the next step would be for Avery to create an oversized binder suitable for this product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VH1FJU82ZOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2M9O98#wasThisHelpful","R33VH1FJU82ZOP","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never tried an air purifier before, though I know people who have/had them. This one was not impressive. First, it has an odor. I don't know if it's because of impurities that emit a smell once trapped in the gadget and exposed to heat from the machine, but I'd rather be in a room that has impurities and no odor than vice versa. Second, I live in a large city, where the air has plenty of particulate matter. So the filters have to be changed more often than the manufacturer recommends, and that runs into a chunk of change over time. Third, notice the recommended room size for this. It is too small to handle a large room or an open floor plan. Fourth, it's pretty noisy. So if I use it in my bedroom, it is not comfortable because of the noise, but I can't use it in the living room/dining room because that is too large an area. I don't want to use it in the bathroom because of the high humidity, which leaves the kitchen. Unfortunately, past experience has shown that steam heat and greasy heat in the kitchen can gum up the works of machines, so I don't want to risk using it there. To sum it up: too expensive, thanks to the never-ending supply of filters, too noisy, too smelly, and not suitable for my needs.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1ZOCPQYVIRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DK35B#wasThisHelpful","RS1ZOCPQYVIRZ","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never mind the color on the computer. This is a much more attractive, darker red, and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. It's made of some kind of pleather, so while it isn't soft at all, it can be scratched by a hard object. The back has a thin velveteen cover, and it can be used vertically or horizontally. The only thing I wasn't too keen about was the single rotating clip that holds the back in place, but the back opening is only a flap, open on three sides, so that is unlikely to fall off unexpectedly.

"I happen to have both the monthly/weekly smaller planner, which fits into a tote bag, and this large monthly planner, which doesn't. Comparing the two, I've realized that it's more helpful to have both monthly and weekly pages in any size than simply monthly pages, even in a larger size. The best thing about this planner is the thick, flexible cover, which can be wiped down easily. In descending order, other good parts are the double-spiral binding, which prevents snags, a 2-pocket plastic page in the back for stray papers, a list of holidays (religious and secular, including Canada and Mexico, going out to 2018), and providing full boxes for Saturday and Sunday instead of combining them as many planners do. I received this free, but I did check the price.

"There are heroines who are too stupid to live. There are, more rarely, male characters who are too stupid to live. This book manages to have one of each, which makes it too stupid to read. I'm generally a fan of Ms. Mallery's Fool's Gold series, but this entry (#17) is more annoying than romantic. First we have Phoebe. Our heroine starts out as a do-good doormat. She performs a criminal act just to help out someone who doesn't deserve to be helped, then placidly accepts that her entire career may be lost due to her stupidity and makes excuses for the real bad guy (gal - her boss). Then we have Chase, a secondary character who commits fraud, theft, insider trading and who knows what else...but he has charm galore and just about everyone forgives him and makes excuses for him. What they ought to do is put him in juvie. Or send him to a psychiatrist. He doesn't seem to understand that he's actually committing illegal acts and we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto. Then there's Zane. In keeping with the author's usual technique, he's suffering from a past trauma that haunts him constantly. He could also do with some counseling, but never mind - Phoebe's on hand to distract him. What distracted me, as a reader, was the way she's a tiny woman and he's an unusually big man, so when the inevitable scenes of intimacy appear, some purely physical complications keep crossing my mind, though they don't cross the page. The way the Fool's Gold series is set up, each segment is comprised of a trilogy. This book is the second - always a weak link - in the sixth trilogy of the series. The book is stuffed to the brim with characters from the other 16 books, which creates unnecessary clutter. Since it's published by Harlequin, I am not giving you any spoilers when I say that there is attraction at first sight and a happy ending in store for the hapless heroine and the curmudgeonly cowboy. Why I keep reading the series is beyond me. But there have been some good books in it, and I'll probably continue to follow it, while secretly hoping it comes to an end before it jumps Sharknado.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EP10PQHAHWX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373780125#wasThisHelpful","R3EP10PQHAHWX7","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a ghost story and a whodunit, and - having been written a long time ago - a charming period piece. There's no sex, no graphic violence, no profanity...just good writing, good manners, gentle humor, and many plot twists in a short novel, or novella. Mr. Brenton finds himself deceased on Christmas Eve, and disgruntled at being a witness to the world without being able to affect it in any way. He encounters various other people in the afterlife, most of whom are quite happy with their lot (and an ingenious explanation is offered for Hell). But his main concern is his wife, a beautiful young woman who is promptly charged with his murder. Despite being advised to stay out of earthly affairs, he decides to clear his wife's name and find his killer. It's a quick and delightful read, and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R281ISTWLYP0G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00848XDAO#wasThisHelpful","R281ISTWLYP0G1","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty awful book with a poorly-blended mesh of genres, of which not one stands out to take charge. It starts out with a poor girl finding a humble job (cleaning toilets for a billionaire). Presumably, she's in college studying business, but there's never any indication that she learned a single thing. Her main feature is a bosom of amazing size, but nothing is done with that, either. There are bits about the billionaire's rocky childhood, more bits about a rocky coming-of-age, but in general, Dorian has all the personality of a flounder and he flops around for most of the book. There's a very feeble attempt to insinuate kinky sex, but it's so inadequate it should have been omitted. There's danger, which doesn't appear until the end of the book, and is dealt with so rapidly that it has little effect upon the reader. And there is no, I mean NO, sizzle between Tori and Dorian. Zilch. Zip. She should go back to cleaning toilets, at which she excels, and he should go back to standing around ineffectually in the vastness of his estate. The reader should go elsewhere for entertainment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTZ8QK24WU2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXNZOAI#wasThisHelpful","R1LTZ8QK24WU2H","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The white and off-white towels are attractive, but the brown is a muddy color and the greenish/bluish color is not pretty. These are thin cloths with very sparse raised loops. That sounds cheap, but actually it is a reasonable construction for its purpose as dish towel or bar mop. It is nowhere near as absorbent as terry or Turkish toweling, but if you just want to wipe down a table after a meal, or a counter after preparing that meal, or dry off a plate or glass, it is fine. I've sworn off paper towels (as much as possible) and have been collecting an assortment of dish cloths and towels. So far, I've been happy with DII products and I have plenty of them. They do shrink after washing, but the square footage isn't an issue when wiping down something.

"Mary Balogh has written so many books that she can probably pen one in her sleep that will still be better than most other historical romances. But she has a distressing tendency to write series that go on a bit too long and the result is a crowd of characters from previous books which distracts the reader from the hero and heroine of the present one. Not only that, she often pulls in characters from previous series or stand-alone novels, and those tales date back decades (of our time) though the novels may all be roughly contemporaneous. In this offering, Ralph is the heir to a dukedom and under considerable pressure to marry and keep the succession intact. Chloe is a woman  who is ineligible for marriage, through no fault of her own (and there's a nod to Pride and Prejudice in the situation, which I appreciated). Chloe proposes to Ralph and the two strike a bargain: a loveless match. She'll get children to love and a secure life; he'll avoid any possible entanglement while doing his duty to his rank. Naturally, things go wrong immediately, starting with the death of his grandfather within hours of the wedding. Chloe's dream of living in a modest manor turns into life as a Duchess. Ralph's constant depression and despair - the result of service in the Napoleonic Wars - must give way to membership in the House of Lords and taking up the reins from his late grandfather despite his real preference for a different life.  I found this book somewhat tiring. The constant dwelling upon Ralph's suicidal trauma and Chloe's woes was a drag. It was almost with relief that I encountered all those characters from other books and was able to reminisce about their stories as a change of pace. Although the modern rage for trilogies is swamping every genre from YA to romance, in this case I wish Ms. Balogh would stop writing extended series, cut back at least as far as trilogies, and keep some of those excess characters out of the way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF39Y2F88WXT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469674#wasThisHelpful","RF39Y2F88WXT1","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I selected this book, I was impressed by the number of prestigious awards it had won. Then I learned that the original novel was only 40,000 words, not what we'd consider a novel at all. Further, it turned out that this book was originally published back in 2002, and the version I read was a rewrite to extend the story to a full-sized novel by American standards. Considered the Philippines' first crime novel, it's a fascinating yet grim tale of the truly downtrodden: forgotten people living in a trash dump, digging up tidbits to sell because there are no jobs to support them like human beings deserving of dignity. They are also deserving of justice, yet the author points out that justice takes a back seat to corruption in the Philippines. Apart from the politics, which are infuriating and fascinating, the book is engrossing. The villain is somewhat generic, a serial killer. The sleuths, however, are unique: a pair of Jesuit priests, one trained in psychology and the other as a forensic anthropologist. I liked this book on several levels. First, it's an excellent crime novel. Second, I cared about many of the characters. And third, arguably the best part, was the unique location of the story.  I had been afraid that expanding the book would make it a great novelette with a lot of filler, but that is not the case. Ms. Batacan is a very talented writer and I look forward to reading more of her work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D2QA0CCCNMS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616953985#wasThisHelpful","R3D2QA0CCCNMS6","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many good things to say about this planner, and I'm about to say them. The only negative factors are very minor, so I'll say them first and get them out of the way. First, unless you write in pencil and are willing to erase, anything you enter here stays entered, even if your plans change. Second, it's a bit large and heavy to lug around in your handbag. BUT, the good far outweighs those trifling considerations. I like just about everything about this planner. The spiral binding is a double spiral, making it very strong. The covers are a thick, yet flexible ""pleather"", so I don't feel worried about damp-wiping them. There's a 3-year reference at the beginning, if you're interested in seeing what day of the week a date will fall (I like to know if my birthday will fall on a weekend!). There's a modest personal profile for your name, address, phone and email. Note: only room for one phone number and one email address is provided, but most people I know have home, cell and work phone numbers and several email addresses, so Acco ought to update this feature in subsequent planners. This is a planner for the Academic Year, meaning July through July. There's a tab for each month, opening to a 2-page spread of the entire month. The tabs are reinforced with plastic. Many holidays are already filled in. A small calendar inset of the previous and following months is provided, along with a small area for notes. I'm happy to report that both Saturday and Sunday get full squares instead of sharing one square. The monthly squares are not ruled. The following pages feature 2-page spreads for a week at a time, and those squares are ruled. Again, there's a section for notes. Although the last tab is for June 2016, all the pages (month and weeks) for July 2016 are present. Acco ought to add the July tab in subsequent planners. Following the last week, there are a couple of ruled pages for contacts, without specifying the type of contact. That's handy if you're less interested in addresses and more in websites, for example. Then there are several ruled pages for notes and an event calendar by month that doesn't state a year, which is handy for things like noting anniversaries. For reference, there's a list of holidays out to 2018. They include secular (and Canadian and Mexican holidays) as well as religious. There's also a map of time zones and area codes - personally, I found the area codes useless, as people tend to take their cell phones all over and their original area codes go with them. Finally, there's a plastic page with two pockets if you need to stuff in a few loose papers along the way. This may not be perfect - I'm very attached to my Excel spreadsheet, which can be altered and color-coded with ease. But if you don't have a smart phone, or your computer crashes, this planner is not likely to let you down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HI5P20BX9LN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC4WUA#wasThisHelpful","R2HI5P20BX9LN6","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These short stories, or essays, were the basis for a popular series of monologues given by the author. They are vignettes of life as a NYC cop over a span of 20 years. Starting in the 1980s, armed only with a high school diploma and a gung-ho attitude, he joined New York's Finest during a time when crime was so rampant that one borough was nicknamed Krooklyn, and a precinct in the Bronx was known as Fort Apache (the movie was loosely based on it). It is clear that the author has little technique or polish. But the stories speak for themselves, making this a worthwhile read. They are sometimes humorous, sometimes sad, and give a good feel for what things were like back in the days when the city had more than 2,000 murders a year and felons would sometimes commit their crimes right before a police officer or even inside the police precinct. You had to be there to believe it. I was, and I remember those days vividly. The city is very different now, and every citizen is armed with a cell phone to record what's happening. That is good, and I'm all for it. But, once upon a time, there was so much crime, and so little to fight it with, that strong measures were called for. This book describes some of them. You may not approve, but you'll be enlightened, and entertained.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVCZ8V6B2P6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539622#wasThisHelpful","R3OVCZ8V6B2P6U","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I'm not too keen on the writing (it's a bit flat), the concept of the story is excellent and it held my interest. This is intended to be part of a series (yes, another trilogy - I'm really tired of the way EVERY book can't stand on its own any more), but I think it's enough to read this and imagine the rest, as the ending is not too much of a cliffhanger. It's somewhere between YA and adult science fiction. An experimental military spacecraft, Ananke has a top-secret mission. Dr. Althea Bastet is the computer expert who is in charge of the machinery. The first thing you notice is that a lot of the names evoke ancient gods, and this is done on purpose. Ananke is an amazingly intelligent computer, and Althea is more involved with it than with people. But there's a whole world outside the two of them, and that world is comprised of the System, which controls the people, and rebels who want to overturn the System. Some rebels wind up on board Ananke, and the next thing you know, they've tinkered with the computer. Now, Ananke is becoming sentient, and people aren't the only danger. Ananke, as a machine, doesn't have any empathy. It (she?) is like a baby turning into a toddler and thinking of herself as the center of the universe. Can Althea save her beloved ship? Or will Ananke take charge? Great concept + mediocre writing = well worth reading, but perhaps not worth buying.

"The only reason I selected this book was because it supposedly featured interviews with celebrities about how gratitude impacted their lives, and it's pretty shallow of me to look for something that indicates depth in people I normally only see one-dimensionally on the movie screen. However, what I wound up with was a book that triggered me to begin my own gratitude diary. Unfortunately, I have to confess that it works. It helps. I HATE when New Age-y stuff works!The premise is simple, and it's been around a lot longer than the current trend. Look on the sunny side of the street. Pollyanna put a good spin on events a century ago (or longer?). Let a smile be your umbrella. Smile and the whole world smiles with you. Pay it forward. Or the Victorian mantra: Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better. In this iteration, it's up to us to improve our physical and mental health, our relationships with others, and the world as a whole, by being grateful. We can be grateful for family, friends, a job, our homes, the weather, you name it. And that's where the diary comes in.It's easy to forget when you're grateful and what you were grateful for, so you keep a journal. As often as you can (I write daily), jot down at least one thing you're grateful for. You find yourself, during your normal daytime activities, thinking of ways to regard events positively. Sometimes you actively look for things to be grateful for. By the end of the day, you have some pleasant memories, and you've managed to overlook or soften any negatives you encountered.It works. I gave the book only 3 stars because it's a bit of overkill. This should have been a magazine article instead of a book. The author goes through a chapter being grateful for her husband (yes, comments from scientists and celebrities are tossed in), then a chapter being grateful for her kids, then...you get the picture. Every chapter, she's focusing her gratitude on another aspect of her life. I found her writing to be workman-like and well-meaning but not truly inspirational or engaging.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2VEWEJZ2RQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525955062#wasThisHelpful","R1K2VEWEJZ2RQM","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally written in 1983, this is a period piece. If you haven't read any of the Harlequin/Silhouette romances from that era, this is a decent example: there's practically no plot, and from page 1 on, the reader knows exactly what's coming (pun intended). It's as obvious as a neon sign that Rule Jackson, manager of the Texas ranch, is - and always has been, and always will be - passionately and obsessively in love with Cat. It's even more obvious, as the book focused on her, that Cat is, always has been, and always will be, passionately and obsessively in love with Rule. It's actually her ranch, but she fled it after having unprotected sex with Rule. She was a 17-year-old overcome with hormones. He was a 28-year-old Vietnam vet with lots of issues. Nowadays, that would raise red flags, but remember: 1983. Older, experienced man? Check. Young virgin? Check.Well, now Cat is home. She's 25, a widow, and Rule is ready to make a move on her. This begins in the ranch plane as soon as he picks her up from the main airport and doesn't stop until the last page. In between, he is jealous of her date with a perfectly nice guy, she is jealous of the way her stepsister throws herself at him, and to top it off, she wonders whether he truly loves her or just the ranch and will do anything to keep control of it.I can't tell you why I enjoy this book so much. I'm a big fan of Linda Howard, and when she writes well, she packs a punch. This is from early in her career, where she shows promise but honestly, this book is a piece of series fluff. Still, I reread it every decade or so. There's a lot of sensual kisses, virile masculinity, and melting surrender going on. If you want a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours and would like an alpha man getting what he wants while the feisty-yet-vulnerable heroine dithers, this is a great read. If you want a book with more depth, I recommend any of Howard's later books, like Mr. Perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9JQG6JJKYWY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727884891#wasThisHelpful","R9JQG6JJKYWY4","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't normally read Christian fiction, and selected this book by accident. It's not a bad read, though neither is it especially good. I enjoyed the concept of it: a young woman who competes in Trivia tournaments finds herself somewhere between life and death, surrounded by dead celebrities. She has to come to terms with her emotional baggage, which is literally baggage - a pretty little trunk, which she's never seen before, is brought out of her car. Between memories and the type of flashbacks experienced by Ebenezer Scrooge, she reexamines her life and the choices the people in her life made, and the way she reacted to them and made her own choices. The biggest problem with the book is that a whole lifetime of memories is reviewed in a relatively slim volume. I think it would have worked much better if a small number of traumas had been dealt with and more time had been devoted to each. It also would have helped if her present life had been described better before plunging into the past.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HZ9Y05X7W4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426769636#wasThisHelpful","R22HZ9Y05X7W4P","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While teenagers change clothing styles, hairdos, and dreams of what they'll be when they grow up, there's one thing that is immutable: the Best Friend. The real best friend, the one they've known since elementary school (if not from infancy). The one who knows every single detail about them, and loves them anyway. The teen years are filled with angst; I think half of it is propelled by hormones, but the other half is real enough. Life is about to change, they're going to launch into college and then out into the world, they're heading to the heady world of adulthood. In this YA novel, everything goes to pieces. Zoe and Olivia, inseparable, were going to be professional dancers. They've worked themselves to death, only to discover that the dance school is dropping them. They're good, but not good enough. While working for years on their now-unattainable goal, they gave up a lot...like other friends, and a social life. Awkwardly, they begin to pick up the reins and travel a new path, one including others. Then, just as it looks as if there are possibilities left for them, Olivia runs out of possibilities.Better have a box of tissues on hand while reading this. I found myself crying over it. My childhood best friend is still with me, half a century after we met, and the thought of losing her is devastating. I also remember a boy from middle school - not a friend, just a kid from class - and how shocking it was to all of us when he became ill and died. It seems impossible. It's wrong, it's against the laws of Nature, and how can anyone deal with it? This isn't what a teen (or an adult) signed up for when signing their friendship in blood.Some of the writing is a bit awkward, mixing metaphors, and some of it seems anachronistic. I've never heard a teenager say ""snazzy"", and even my contemporaries don't use the word. It's from my parents' generation. Some of it is written simply, which I think suits a topic that runs so deeply, but some is almost overwritten. I think it will appeal to teens who are heavily invested in their best friends, which means teenage girls. I can't envision a guy reading this. An increasing number of YA novels are being read by adults, but I don't think this will appeal to grown-ups.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2GDSNRFB8O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062279203#wasThisHelpful","RW2GDSNRFB8O2","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The late Shirley Jackson, whose untimely death robbed us of endless reading pleasure, was an incredibly gifted master at conveying psychological horror. She understood that no description of mutant spiders with dripping fangs can ever compete with the fears in a person's mind and the evil in his heart. Using plain language and carefully crafted sentences, she could turn an ordinary commute home into an exercise in peril, and keep the reader guessing until the last sentence whether that peril is real or imagined. Sometimes, with a twist of genius, she even leaves the issue in doubt.At the same time, she had a deft touch with comedy, and mined her large family (four children and a husband, who is almost never named) for scenes that a reader can relate to completely. Most people have encountered her work already; her classic short story, The Lottery, is read in high school. Even if you haven't read one of her novels or many short stories, you have probably seen one of the movies made from them, such as The Haunting of Hill House.Decades after her death, her children have gone through her uncollected short stories, unpublished short stories, essays, letters, and some notes from speeches she gave, and put together this wonderful collection. If you're already a fan of Shirley Jackson, you won't want to miss this book. If you haven't encountered her yet, you can start here and get a sampling of her fiction, non-fiction, horror and humor, all in one place. And if you're a big fan of horror, you should try this to see how well it can be presented without the modern Stephen King-style trappings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OID5MTCM7E7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997662#wasThisHelpful","R1OID5MTCM7E7S","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many suspense and mystery series which can be read out of order. This isn't one of them. There isn't sufficient backstory (though the author does try) to place a new reader in context and allow him to catch up with the regular characters. So, if you haven't read anything by Mr. Sears before, don't start here. After a promising, but not stellar, debut novel, and a much better sequel, this third book flounders a bit. It settles down in the second half, with clever chase scenes, thrills and a few chills. As for the Villain, there's more than one, and I guessed the identity at the first mention. There's a clever little bread crumb in the description of the character that the reader can detect right away. As for the convoluted plot, it includes insider trading, the rich and shameless, alternative energy sources, and computer hackers. There are any number of murders, endless Bad Guys willing to commit more, and the usual cast of characters: the almost-middle-aged hero, his autistic son, his girlfriend...who wants to become the mother of his next child...his father, his father's girlfriend, his employer, a buddy in the FBI, a friend who used to be his girlfriend's employer, the friend's new employee...as you can see, there are many characters. That's apart from a victim (or is he a villain), his wife, assorted lawyers and bankers...now you know why it isn't possible to convey sufficient details on the people, and you'll need to read the first two books to understand the third. In 340 pages, you have all the above characters, and plenty more, as well as the intricate plot and assorted secondary characters who appear for a few pages, and to top it off, there are chase scenes and fight scenes and scenes from Long Island to the Caribbean to New Mexico. I think the author needs to consider what he wants to tell the reader and pare down the rest. He's trying to cram an awful lot into too few pages. However, I'm willing to read the next book in the series to see if he improves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6K9ZTZGIJOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399166718#wasThisHelpful","R3H6K9ZTZGIJOS","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought Outlander was nearly perfect as it was, but I was thrilled to find that the sequel was nearly as good. The setup is slightly different. Outlander was linear, and told the story in the first person all the way. Dragonfly in Amber tries another tack. The story alternates between the present and the past (mostly the past), with the past in the first person and the present in the third person. Set twenty years after the end of the first book, Claire Beauchamp Randall is now a doctor. Her daughter, Brianna, is a tall, red-headed young woman who accompanies her mother to Scotland on a little vacation after Frank Randall's death. Little does Brianna know that she's in for a shock: Claire, who promised Frank never to mention this during his lifetime, is about to reveal Brianna's true father: Jamie Fraser, the man she married back in 1744, just before Prince Charlie tried to regain the throne. There's another major character involved. He's Roger Mackenzie Wakefield (he made a brief appearance in Outlander, when he was a little boy). Roger is also in for a shock about his lineage. Once those shocks have been announced, the story reverts to the past. Claire and Jamie are expecting their first child, and they're stationed in Paris. Their goal is to thwart Prince Charlie's attempts to raise money and an army. Can they succeed? Old enemies and new ones appear onstage. Old friends and new ones are embraced or lost. Similar to Outlander, the author writes in a leisurely manner, crafting her sentences carefully and enjoying sidebars on everything from medicine to witchcraft to life on a farm. Although this is an excellent book, I found myself impatient to get through the chapters set in the present because the past was so compelling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18QPQ8EV300SO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC2L28#wasThisHelpful","R18QPQ8EV300SO","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of John Sandford since Day 1 and have all his books in hardcover. So it's with regret that I have to report that his latest Prey novel, featuring Lucas Davenport, is sort of mediocre and predictable. The best part of it is the more-than-cameo appearance of Letty, his adopted daughter, whom I absolutely love. I'd be thrilled to see a spin-off series featuring her, though the author has indicated he has no plans for this. Since the author is somewhat up in years, churning out a yearly Davenport novel, a yearly Flowers novel and now a YA trilogy and his first sci-fi novel, I can see where his schedule may not permit any more series. There will be some changes in the Prey novels ahead, though, as indicated by Lucas' increasing disenchantment with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and a bit of a twist at the end. Otherwise, this story is not as good as it could have been. The bad guys, known to us from the first page, are uniformly bad. As the author well knows, even the worst character needs some relatable or redeemable quality to get the reader invested in the outcome of events. The usual interaction of Davenport's team is mostly offstage or missing, as he goes Lone Ranger, wandering out of state and taking the lead in hunting down the bad guys. Arguably the most interesting plot device, involving Juggalos, is handled weakly. More information on this subset of society would have improved the book immensely. The basic plot has Letty befriending some Juggalos, then becoming involved when it appears that one has been killed. Letty is removed from the story before the shootouts begin. Davenport's other children are barely mentioned; ditto for Weather, his wife. There is plenty of action, a fair amount of gore, and the usual high-speed travelling hither and yon. Though it doesn't equal the best books in the series, I'm hopeful the next one will be better and I'll continue to pre-order it in hardcover.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RSCN7WKICCP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168796#wasThisHelpful","R2RSCN7WKICCP8","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author won the Nobel prize in Economics, but that wouldn't necessarily make him a good writer. I'm happy to say that this is a very readable, interesting, often humorous book. Whether Mr. Roth had a ghost writer assisting him or not, I enjoyed this a whole lot. This is definitely for fans of Malcolm Gladwell and the Freakonomics team. He dips into all sorts of transactions that don't directly involve money: the ""matching markets"", where a law student has to find a judge to clerk for, and vice versa, or something more urgent, like matching organ donors to those in need of transplants. For example, take those law students. Judges in desirable locations might not have any difficulty in recruiting a clerk, but judges in undesirable locations would. How do they compete? There's a rule about it, so they're not supposed to try to lure in clerks ahead of time and undercut the competition, but cheating - by judges, who set the rules! - is rampant. There are other factors at play, because the schools benefit when their students are taken by top judges, and then there is a whole subset of judges who are neither at the top of the heap nor the bottom of the barrel. The would-be clerks are also heavily invested, as their future career may depend upon a buff resume. And the professors who recommend them are also invested. Who follows the rules? Who breaks them and why? Can the process be fair? Anyone who thinks that economics is as boring as the drone of a housefly should try this book and get a new perspective. Economics affects us all, and not just in the wallet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2JCA90VZS0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544291131#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2JCA90VZS0Y","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a crisply written book about several related topics, but the focus is on survivor's guilt. Shiv (that's a nickname) can't get over the loss of her brother Declan, and is rapidly becoming so self-destructive that it's clear she wants to join him in death. Her fractured family, trying to deal with their own grief, can no longer handle her. One last solution remains: a stay at an unusual clinic, where Shiv must face her feelings and memories. Over and over again, the things she can't escape are the things she must see and embrace. Can she learn to internalize her brother and make him a part of herself? Can she return to life, which is arguably a worse punishment than death? At least, once dead, she wouldn't have the constant burden of memory and her role in the events that ended so tragically. Shiv is far from alone. The other residents of the clinic are equally troubled. Can they, too, come to grips with their lives, or will they opt out? Although this is a very dark book, I found it interesting and moving. Having lost a loved one under horrific circumstances, I related well to Shiv's grief, but I don't think that's a prerequisite for reading this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVC7ATJAH56F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385739915#wasThisHelpful","R2RVC7ATJAH56F","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read an Advance Reader's Copy of this before it was published...nearly a quarter of a century ago. Since then, I've reread it many times, and although I'm no longer surprised by the plot twists, I still enjoy the characters, the story, and the quality of the writing. Nowadays, time travel is nearly overused, but back in 1991 this book was iconoclastic and original. There is a lot of sex and graphic violence; the first time I read it, I was a bit taken aback by it. But the world has changed a lot, and you can see (and hear) much more explicitness on TV, let alone read it in a book. Here are just a few of the many things I love about ""Outlander"":- the characters are not only well developed to begin with, but they continue to develop and grow as the novel progresses- the author takes the time to bring the reader fully into the settings- the story is not too linear; there are any number of sub plots and explorations of history, botany, medicine- the sentences are crafted well; it's a pleasure to read them- there is plenty of humor to leaven the darker aspects of the taleI first read it in one sitting, staying up until dawn to finish (and ruining my weekend!). It was worth every minute. I wasn't sure I'd want a follow up novel because this one seemed so perfect, but the following seven have kept up the pace and quality (plus an offshoot series based on a minor character)In short, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good writing, history (the Jacobite uprising of 1745), careful plotting, complex characters, plenty of humor, and a touch of the paranormal. The love story of Jamie Fraser and Claire Beauchamp Randall is very powerful, but this isn't a typical romance by any means. I consider it historical fiction from an extraordinarily talented writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KKMVK83QOXAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385302304#wasThisHelpful","R2KKMVK83QOXAI","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of the author for decades, to the point where I normally pre-order her books in hardcover. It seems as if the time has come to rethink that habit and save my money. First, almost everything in the book is a rehash of a previous book. Red-headed heroine? The Search. Renovating an old house? Tribute. Small-town bully who goes too far? The Witness. Precocious toddler? Rising Tides. (There's even a scene with the toddler that appears to be lifted straight from that book). On and on. The ""surprise"" plot device can be guessed within the first chapter. The heroine is not too bright a bulb, and it's simply infuriating to accept her choice to pay off MILLIONS of dollars of debt that isn't hers. The book is amazingly slow for more than half, then sort of trundles along. Apparently, the author wanted to play with the idea of Southern relationships by listing lots of people with long names and convoluted connections to the heroine...but none of these characters appear again in the story. They are named. That's it. They don't further the plot. In fact, very little furthers this plot. I don't see a lot of heat between Shelby and Griff. He falls for her red hair at first sight. There's actually more warmth between Griff and Shelby's precocious toddler. I was terribly disappointed with this book. At least in other novels, there's something else to engage me, like details of training Search and Rescue dogs (The Search). There is no interesting sub plot here. If you've never read a book by Nora Roberts, don't start with this one! If you're a big fan, borrow it from the library if you must. But don't waste a dime on it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U0GBIMT2094J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170863#wasThisHelpful","R2U0GBIMT2094J","AGB7UQZMVHNUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGB7UQZMVHNUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not everybody can chop an onion like the chefs do on the cooking shows. Yes, they make it look easy, but for us regular folks, we can easily cut ourselves if we chop that fast. There are many different electronic choppers as well as the manual ones available to purchase that are easy and safe to use.About a week ago, I received the Kuuk Onion Chopper to test out and review. I already own a device that will cube an onion, but sometimes recipes calls for the onions to be smaller, so I wanted to test this chopper out. It's pretty simple to use.

"After reading the first book in the Road to Kingdom series a few  years ago, I was an instant fan of Nancy Mehl's writings. Plus, I always like authors that live in my home-state of Missouri. While I had read book two (Deadly Echoes) in the Finding Sanctuary series earlier this year, I went ahead and reread it prior to reading book three, Rising Darkness, which was released earlier this month to bookstores.Once again, the setting is in Sanctuary, Missouri, but this time the story centers on an ex-Mennonite named Sophie Wittenbauer, who had left her strict community in Kingdom to start a new life. She takes a job working at newspaper office under a new identity. Sadly, she can no longer escape her previous life after she receives a tip that a criminal might be hiding somewhere in town. While this might seem like a great story for a newbie reporter, there is a slight problem - Sophie recognizes the criminal's name and she's worried that her past will be exposed.To make matters worse, she runs into an old crush from her childhood, Jonathon Wiese, who is a now a pastor in Sanctuary. There are threats and dangers around every corner, and while Sophie doesn't exactly trust Jonathon, she might not have any other choice, but to let him save her life.Like I already mentioned, I'm a fan of Nancy Mehl's works as she does an awesome job blending in romance and mystery to create an intriguing read. For this book, I was hooked into the story by the third chapter and I read it fairly quickly. (It was read in a couple of hours and a several cups of java!) The main heroine, Sophie, is a strong character that held her own through the entire novel. I like that that the author made some connections to the Road to Kingdom series.

"In my continuing quest to review all the books that have been collecting dust on my desk for months, today I'm reviewing Deadly Echoes, book 2 in the Finding Sanctuary series, by Nancy Mehl. I stumbled upon her Road To Kingdom series a few years ago and I've been a fan of her writings ever since.Set in the same Mennonite community in Sanctuary, Missouri that had to deal with a horrible kidnapping in the first book, Gathering Storms, Deadly Echoes centers on Sarah Miller, who moved to the small town start a new life as a school teacher and to reconnected with her sister, Hannah. Their parents were murdered when they were young and they were separated after going into the foster care system.Out of nowhere, Hannah is also murdered, leaving Sarah to raise her niece by herself. While she could just let the local authorities try to solve the murder, Sarah believes there is a connection between Hannah's death and their parent's murders. With help from Sheriff Paul Gleason, she is determined to unravel a mystery that has been hidden for almost twenty years.Being from Missouri myself, I always appreciate a novel that is set in my home-state. While this is book two of the Finding Sanctuary series, it's a standalone novel, so you'll have no problems reading this if you haven't read the first novel. Nancy Mehl is definitely one of my favorite new authors as she likes to blend in romance and mystery, all of which is set in a small religious towns. Deadly Echoes has a really great mystery plot as well as an interesting heroine that kept me flipping through the pages. I originally read the book back in February, but since I was so late in writing my review for this, I reread the book a few weeks ago to refresh my memory. Overall, Deadly Echoes is a well-written mystery that I enjoyed reading from start to finish. I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.

"I didn't realize how much junk I carry in my wallet until I received the Secret Felicity Men's Vintage Genuine Leather Money Clip Bifold Wallet in the mail a few days ago. This wallet has a cool vintage brown leather look to it. The actual leather is somewhat thin and soft, so it doesn't feel as bulky when carrying it my pocket. It has plenty of room in it with eight card slots, one ID window, one zipper coin pocket. There is a cloth divider in the dollar bills area as well as a long zipper pocket.Overall, this is a well-crafted wallet with plenty of room to carry all your stuff in it.I received a discount coupon for the wallet in exchange for my honest thoughts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9GBWMIO8D8SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WCKHG2#wasThisHelpful","R9GBWMIO8D8SZ","A1LBGXE29GG1IR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBGXE29GG1IR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate to say this, but sometimes your neighbors should just mind their own business instead of stirring up trouble. While the premise of the novel isn't exactly new (Ever heard of Romeo and Juliet?), Lesile Gould unleashes her storytelling magic to create an intriguing story involving an English family and Amish family, whom must overcome their differences, so they can live in peace. I enjoyed all the characters, except for Charlie as his character and his romance with Eve seemed a little forced at times. Overall, for me, Amish Promises wasn't exactly a perfect read, but it wasn't a letdown either. The author's writing skills kept the story moving, therefore, I kept turning the pages.Note: I read this back in July, but I'm just now getting the review written.

"I had never even knew there was such a thing as Amish fiction until I read The Covenant (book one in the Abram's Daughter series) by Beverly Lewis, which was either in 2001 or 2002. I had joined one of the those book clubs where you get five or six books for $.99 and you have to buy three or four books during the next two years at full price. The Covenant was one of the books I got for joining the club. I recall I was short one book, so I just picked The Covenant as it looked an interesting read. Let's just say that I became a fan of Beverly Lewis's writings very quickly. I ended up purchasing her previous novels and I have continued to read each and every new release of hers.While many of the author's novels are part of a series featuring three to five books, she does occasionally write a stand alone novel, which just happens to be the case for The Love Letters. (No, this isn't the made-for-Hallmark movie from the late 90s.)  This story is set in 1966 and centers on Marlena Wenger, a young woman with a lot on her young shoulders. She was set to marry Nathaniel Zimmerman shortly after she finishes her classes prior to being baptized into the Old Amish Order, well, that is until she learns that her grandfather has passed away and someone needs to go to Brownstown, Pennsylvania and assist her grandmother, Mammi Janice, for the summer. Guess whose going?Yep, you guessed it - Marlena must put her life on hold to help out her grandmother. Not too long after arriving in Brownstown, Marlena learns that her estranged sister Luella has died in a car crash. Luell had left the Amish lifestyle to marry her sweetheart Gordon Munroe, who is currently serving his country in Vietnam. This leaves Marlena the guardian of her baby niece, Angela Rose.Her grandmother's neighbors are Ellie and Roman Bitner, who have a mentally-challenged son, Jake (known as Small Jay). Due to the Jake's problems, Roman has emotionally distant himself from the boy. All the boy wants is father figure, and eventually he finds one - Boston, a homeless man with signs of Alzheimers. Jake talks his parents into letting Boston stay in the small house on their land that once belonged to their late Dawdi, where Jake reads Boston's old letters to him.Meanwhile, Marlena must decide what is more important - marrying Nathaniel or taking care of her family.The Love Letters is a completely different novel for Beverly Lewis. While the majority of her novels is about the romance between an Amish girl and her beau, the novel is about faith, family and trust. For me, it starts out a little a slow for the first several chapters, but I eventually got swept into the story. Overall, The Love Letters is an emotional tale from beginning to end.I read the book back in April, but I'm just now getting around to writing the review.

"It's almost hard to believe that there are only five more weeks until Christmas Day. Though I do have about 99% of my gift shopping finished already, I'm not exactly in the holiday mood this year. Every time I stumble upon a Christmas movie on the Hallmark channel, I avoid it all costs. I've also been skipping over the radio stations that are playing holiday tunes. No, I'm not a Scrooge. I just guess the Christmas magic hasn't exactly hit me yet. That being said, I had signed up to review a several holiday themed novels for a few book tours awhile back and I've delayed reading them as long as I could.One these books (well, a novella) happens to be An Endless Christmas by author Cynthia Ruchti, which centers on Wilson and Dodie Blinder hosting Christmas for their large family (children, grandchildren, etc.) at their cottage in Minnesota. They're excited that their grandson, Micah, is going to ask his girlfriend, Katie, to marry him. Micah asks her to marry him in front of his entire family and Katie's answer is - ""No!""Unfortunately for Katie, she has no other place to go, so she's stuck at the Binder cottage for Christmas. Most of the family are upset with her for breaking Micah's heart, but Dodie sees this extra time as an opportunity for her grandson to win back Katie's heart.Typically, I have a good idea what a book is about by just looking at the cover at, but with a only a small cottage surrounded by snow on the cover, I had no idea what An Endless Christmas would be about. At only 232 pages, the author, Cynthia Ruchti, doesn't waste any time setting up the main plot. There is a proposal and an answer right on the first page, except the outcome is shockingly, ""No."" Overall, An Endless Christmas is a simple, fast-paced and sweet story that ignores all the cheesy holiday cliches that are found in books as well as movies. Speaking of films, I can easily see this novella being adapted into a movie for a Hallmark or Lifetime. I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.

"'ve test out several different brand of NO2 supplements over the last few years and for the most part all of them have basically the same ingredients (well, at least what's listed on the labels). The NO2 Booster has a few extra ingredients that I don't normally see in this type supplement, such as Beet Root Extract and Common Oat Extract. Just like any other supplement, I know that it will take awhile for it to get into system, if it even works for me to begin with.That being said, I've either taken the NO2 Booster (3 caps) right before I exercise or right before I'm going to do excess cleaning. (Hey, the holidays are coming up and the house needs to be spotless.) After the first day, it took about 90-minutes or so for me to notice a difference in my endurance. It wasn't a big boost, but it was enough for me to finish what I was doing.

"From the Start is a contemporary romance by author Melissa Tag that was released back in April by Bethany House. I have a bad habit of picking out books directly by their covers, but that wasn't the case with this book as I actually read the synopsis first. After being intrigued by the plot, I thought I would give it a try.The novel centers on screenplay writer Kate Walker, a young woman that writes made-for-TV romances, but her own love life is completely empty. Unfortunately, she has a series of bad luck starting with the lack of movie projects to work on. With no other choice, she packs her bags and returns home to Maple Valley, Iowa in the hope that she will find a new meaning (or career) for her life.This is a romantic tale, so of course there is a love interest for Kate, whom happens to be a NFL quarterback, Colton Green. Due to a recent injury that has sidelined him from playing football, Colton has been hiding out in his friend's (Logan) hometown, which as you have probably guessed, it's in Maple Valley. And guess who Logan's sister is?It's Kate! (How predictable!)After learning that Kate is writer, Logan gets her to help him write his autobiography. This means the two of them get to spend a lot of time together, so naturally some sparks fly and they learn that there is more to life than just football and writing sappy screenplays.The main character, Kate, in this book writes made-for-TV romantic movies, the one genre that I don't like watching as I find them corny and unbelievable. Ironically, I do like reading romance novels for some weird and unexplainable reason. Sadly, From the Start's plot feels more like a made-for-TV movie. (Yes, I've seen a few, well, a few scenes while flipping channel surfing.)The good news is that Melissa Tagg is a talented author and she works her magic to make the plot believable. Since I do dabble occasionally with my own writings, I instantly connected with Kate. I didnt care much for Logan. It probably has to do with the fact that I'm not the biggest football fan. (I'm a baseball fan!), so I couldn't connect with him. However, the two characters do have chemistry, which made the romantic parts more real. Overall, while From the Start isn't exactly a touchdown, it's not a fumble either. (Get it? I do know my football language.) I found the book to be a fun read.(Note: I read From the Start back in late April, but I'm just now getting around to writing the review for it.

"Between reading romance novels and horror books, I had a chance to read a new mystery-thriller, titled Vendetta, book one in the new Nikki Boyd Files by Lisa Harris.Vendetta centers Nikki Boyd, whom is part of the Tennessee Missing Persons Task Force. After her sister, Sarah, went missing nearly ten years ago, she decided to make it her life's mission in saving others, and hopefully one day she'll piece together the clues behind her sister's disappearance. Her hopes might finally come true when she discovers a link between Sarah and a recently missing teenager, Bridget.As she begins to investigate, she stumbles upon a bigger mystery than what she could ever imagined. To solve the case and rescue Bridget before it is too yet, Nikki must team up with her good friend, Tyler Grant, the widow of her best friend who died in accident a year ago, but standing in their way is the killer known as the Angel Abductor.While I had mixed thoughts on Lisa Harris's Hidden Agenda, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Vendetta, which I read in one afternoon. The plot is well put together; reminding somewhat of the early (and better) books by James Patterson. The characters are developed nicely and the descriptions are also nicely done. Overall, Vendetta is fast-paced, mystery-thriller than plays out more like a movie than a book. I was glued to the story after reading the first chapter and I couldn't put it down until I finished reading it.I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.

"I don't recall reading the first book in there series, Home to Chicory Lane, but I did read the sequel, Two Roads Home, during the summer. While this book could be read as a stand-alone story, I do recommend reading the first two books as the plot centers around recurring characters. Typically, a Christian fiction is set around two characters that have never met each other and when they do, they fall in love. Here the main characters are already married, but their marriage and faith is being tested by the fact that they are having problems starting a family.

"Christmas is less than two-months away and a few of the cable channels are already playing holiday themed movies. Many of these movies as well as countless books feature Santa Claus and elves. While I have nothing against Old Saint Nick, many kids can get confused about what the really meaning of Christmas is.Now available to own in bookstores is the picture book The Berenstain Bears: The Very First Christmas by the late Jan Berenstain and her son Mike Bernestain (whom has taken over the Berenstain Bears series).The book begins with the Bear cubs (Brother, Sister and Honey) asking  Papa to read them the story of Christmas from the storybook Bible. From there he tells them the about the birth of Jesus. The entire book is written in a similar style of the other Berenstain Bears' titles, so young readers can easily understand it. The story is accompanied by beautiful illustrations.Overall, The Berenstain Bears: The Very First Christmas is a cute picture book that tells the story of what Christmas is really about.

The cookbook is nicely put together with pictures that go along with the recipes as well as pictures of Giada and her daughter. There are also cooking tips and neat introductions to every chapter/section. I've only had time to try out a few of the recipes, but the ones that I did are simple to make, thanks to well-written directions.

While I read about several different methods, I just covered a small amount of extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan and then scattered a handful of the coffee beans in the pan.

Eventually, I started hearing crackling sounds, which means the beans were being roasted.Overall, the Adrano, Brazil Volcano Coffee has a nice, rich taste to it.

"Two things that I've never owned is a fishing gripper or scale. The county lake has a limit to the number of fish you can catch as well as a minimum pound limit per fish, so I thought it was about time that I buy a fish scale. I couldn't decide if I what kind of scale I wanted, so I purchased this one as well as a more traditional fish scale.The grip scale (yellow) is shaped like a gun. It has a small digital display screen with a on/off button that uses a CR2032 lithium cell battery (included). The description stated that I has an adjustable arm strap, but instead this one has a spiral-type key chain attached to the handle, which can be used as a strap. The actually grips are made from stainless steel.I tested it out with some small weights and the scale gives an accurate weight. Overall, I've been impressed with this grip scale. I especially like the sheath that comes with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22S1VRTRAXJXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT6VTOW#wasThisHelpful","R22S1VRTRAXJXY","A1LBGXE29GG1IR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBGXE29GG1IR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start out my stating that I have never quilted anything in my life. However, I have several quilters in my family, so I know a little too much about quilting. I've seen the original Wonderclips in the stores and they're a little expensive. Last year for Christmas, I gave my mother a set of a similar off-brand and she has loved using them to hold down the binding on her quilting projects.That being said, when I was offered a chance to review the Evergreen Craft Clips for free in exchange for my honest thoughts and I eagerly said yes as I can always give these to my mother for this year's Christmas.This set has 50 craft clips. Each clip features a clear side and a colored side of either red, orange, blue, purple or yellow. They're made out of hard plastic along with a metal strip. I've tested out each (Yes, all 50!) clip and every one seems to be pretty sturdy. There is a seam allowance line on the clear side of each clips.

"Being a coffee lover, I was intrigued to try the Cappuccino flavor. Please take note that you really should read the directions as it calls to use a spoon to thoroughly mix it with water or milk before you shake or blend it, if you don't, the whey protein doesn't get blended quite right. I would like to point out that this does have Stevia Leaf Extract in it as I do know that some prefer not to use it as a sugar substitute, though it doesn't bother me at all.

"I'm normally not in the mood to read holiday theme novels until after Thanksgiving, but I'm a big fan of Amish fiction, so I jumped right into reading An Amish Christmas Gift when I received it last week. There are three different novellas in this title - Naomis Gift by Amy Clipston, An Unexpected Joy by Ruth Reid and A Christmas Visitor by Kelly Irvin.Naomis Gift centers on Caleb, a widower that is traveling with his young daughter, Susie, to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to visit his sister's family for Christmas. Along the way, Susie spots a farmer's market. She begs Caleb to stop there and find a gift for Aeti Sadie, which he eventually agrees to. Being a kid, Susie gets distracted and walks away fro Caleb's sight at the market, but luckily she comes across a quilt booth where Naomi King happens to be. Naomi is a 24-year-old woman, who is lost all hope of finding love, well, that is until she meets Caleb and sparks fly between the two. Unfortunately, Caleb still isn't ready to let someone near his heart as he lost his wife on Christmas Eve two years ago.An Unexpected Gift is set in St. Joseph County, Michigan and centers on Abigail Kemp, a 22-year-old woman who decided just a year ago that she would never find love. With no future husband in sight, Abigail has been saving every cent that she earns from selling baked goods and quilted potholders, all so she can one day buy a horse. Despite being busy making sweets for the holiday season, Abigail agrees to help look after Micah Zook's grandmother, which the elderly woman makes it her mission to set the two up before Christmas comes around.A Christmas Visitor centers on Frannie Mast, a young woman that had fell in love an Englisch farm boy, Rocky, in Missouri, but her life is turned upside down when her parents sends her back to her hometown of Bee County, Texas to live with her aunt and her aunt's new husband. This is a Christmas story, so the unthinkable happens - Rocky follows Frannie to Texas to convince her family that he is the right man for her.There are gobs of authors that write Amish fiction now a days and I can't keep up with all the new names, but I did recognize authors Amy Clipston and Ruth Reid as I've read a few of their other titles. However, this is the first time I've read anything by Kelly Irvin and I'm an instant fan of her writing as A Christmas Visitor is a cute romantic story. The other two stories, Naomi's Gift and An Unexpected Joy, are both adorable romantic reads as well. Overall, it might not be December yet, but I enjoyed reading the three heartfelt novellas in An Amish Christmas Gift.I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.

"I stumbled up on the first season of the Doctor Who reboot when it aired on the Scifi Channel (now known as Syfy) in 2006 and I quickly became a big fan. I later learned about the original the series that started in the 1960s to the 1980s and that the new seasons (well series in the Britain) are a continuation. Since then, I've watched a handful of episodes featuring the original incarnations of the Doctors on DVD.Now available in paperback is Doctor Who: The Dorsten's Curse by A.L. Kennedy, which is an adventure featuring the 4th Doctor (whom was played by Tom Baker from 1974 to 1981). Set at the Fetch Brothers Golf Spa Hotel, the plot involves golfers disappearing into thin air and of course the Doctor is there in the nick of time to investigate it.Once again the Doctor recruits two new companion, Bryony, a Fetch Brothers Junior Receptionist,  and alien named Putta Pattershaun, to help unravel the mystery behind why the golfers are vanishing. To make matters worse, the other people at the spa are acting weird, especially Mrs. Fetch and and the twin grandchildren; all of which seem to have the ability to read minds.As most Doctor Who stories go, there is something alien-like that is causing all the chaos and the Doctor Bryony and his companions must stop it.From my understanding by other readers, is that this book is based on a short story called The Death Pit, so if you've already read the short story, then there's no reason to read the full-version of it. I've only seen a few episodes that starred Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor and he seemed to be a fun Doctor, so I was slightly disappointed with The Dorsten's Curse as it doesn't have the wit that's in the Doctor Who seasons/series. Don't get me wrong, the book is well-written, but it has too many boring scenes. Overall, Doctor Who: The Drosten's Curse is written for diehard fans of the 4th Doctor. Other readers might not like it. I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.

"I learned how to crochet from my mother when I was a young kid. On a rare occasion I do crochet an afghan to give away as a gift.

"What makes Jane Kirkpatrick different from other Christian writers is that she either features real-life people or events in books. In this novel, she tackles the massacure of 1847 and the life of the only survivor, Eliza Splading Warren.

"I have a dishwasher and a garbage disposal in the kitchen. Between the two of them, the drain gets clogged up with grease and other junk, resulting in water backing up into the basement bathroom sink. There are countless brands of drain cleaners on the market and I've tried many of them with mostly bad results. Draino is worthless and Liquid Lightning just clogs it more.A few weeks ago, I was sent a complimentary bottle of Green Gobbler Drain Opener in exchange for my honest thoughts on it. Though I had never heard of the brand before, I thought I would give it a try. I mean I've already tried everything else, so why not try this as well!It's basically a bunch of white crystals that you pour down the drain (8oz to be exact) along with a small amount of hot water. Let it sit in the drain for about 15 to 30 minutes and then flush it with hot water. If the clog is really bad, let the crystals sit in the drain overnight.Currently the drain isn't clogged, but it has been gurgling (which is a sign that it will clog soon), so I tried out the Green Gobbler Drain Opener and the gurgling did stop. Overall, I think the product is pretty decent, though I'm not for sure how good it works on solid clogs.

"At the end of August, I was sent a bottle of Nitro XL to test out and review. It's a dietary supplement with Nano-Diffusion Technology.You might have heard of people taking nitric oxide (NO) prior or after their workouts. It's a gas that is naturally biozynthesized in your body from oxygen and L-Arginine. Having healthy nitric oxide levels in your bloodstream is important to your overall health, especially for your heart and brain function as well as boosting your immune system.Increasing your NO will help boost your exercises by increasing the blood flow and oxygen to your muscles. This will expand your blood vessels and release a huge amounts of oxygen to your muscles, which will increase your strength and stamina during your workouts.Each serving (4 caps) has 3000 mg of a proprietary blend of:L-Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate (AK-AKG) - an amino acid that helps the body make protein. It also increases the blood flow to your entire body.L-Ornithine AKG - an amino acid that reduces fatigue.Arginine Ketoisocaproate - an amino acid that increase your NO levels.L-Glutamine AKG - increases protein synthesis and reduces recovery time from your workouts.Nitric oxide supplements is a must have for anybody trying to lose weight and get into shape, especially if your past the age 30, like me. It recommends taking 4 caps twice a day, but I started out by taking two caps twice a day for two weeks, then I doubled the dose. I would like to point out that the supplement does have Gelatin, as some people are allergic to it. While taking this, I didn't have any sort of side effect.  I do recommend letting the supplement slowly build in your body before you'll see any results from taking it. Overall, I do like the Nitro XL as it's a strong nitric oxide that gave an extra boost during my workouts. I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.

"About a month ago, I was sent the Smart Water Flosser by GREENCO to test out and review. The oral irrigator puts out a powerful jet of water that rinses between your teeth, gums, braces, implants and bridgework.If you've been to the dentist, you might recall the dental assistant blasting a bunch of water into your mouth to clean everything. Well, the Smart Water Flosser is basically a smaller version of it that you can use in your own bathroom. This brand comes with two nozzles and comes with Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.It's pretty simple to use - make sure it's fully charge, fill it up with water and push the off button, but do make sure that you have the nozzle (which can rotate 360) in your mouth before turning it on or water will go all over place. There are three different modes: normal, soft and pulse.This was my first time using a water flosser and I'm glad to say that I have enjoyed using it. Even on the soft mode, it pushes out a powerful blast of water that cleans in between your teeth & gums fast. Overall, I've been impressed with the Smart Water Flosser and I recommend it to others.

I discovered the Annuals about three years ago and I get a kick out of each book. There are a lot of weird things throughout the pages of this installment.

"I received the bottle of L-Arginine about a month ago. I went by the directions and took two capsules a day with a meal, which is prior to when I take creatine. The L-Arginine is supposed to help the creatine absorb into your body faster.I'm glad to say that I haven't had any side effects from taking it.Does it work to increase muscular endurance and energy?I didn't see much a boost in energy during the last month, though I wasn't as sore from my workouts the next day after taking it.

"I'm a little behind in technology as I just purchased my first MP3 Player around Christmas last year. While I have enjoyed the player, it doesn't have the best sound. That being said, I was more than excited to try out the complimentary Tomameri MP4 Player in exchange for my honest thoughts. At first glance it does look cheaply made, but it isn't that bad of a player. It features just four buttons (Menu, Volume, Reverse, Forward). The player can play music (MP3 files), play videos, browse photos (JPEG/GIF), read e-Book text files, record voices, and plays FM Radio. It comes with earbud headphones, a USB cord and a 16GB micro-SD card.Once fully-charged, the battery can lasts for several hours. The overall sound is pretty good with decent bass. I was surprised that the FM Radio works great. So far I have enjoyed using the Tomameri MP4 Player.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVPUIR1S0X7TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJX159Q#wasThisHelpful","RVPUIR1S0X7TF","A1LBGXE29GG1IR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBGXE29GG1IR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well-written tales together with a nice introduction by the author.  Lead tale about a psychic called ""The Sign"" I wouldn't hardly classify as a horror short, but made for a good mystery with a nice twist at the end. Horror fans (like myself) should get a charge from the zombie cows in ""Beef"" tho the tale about the serial killer ""Art in Everything"" was probably my personal favorite. I'm still thinking about that passage ""I wonder what the police would make of it.

"Loved the 18-year old female version of a crazed 'mad max'  with dialogue like, ""Your kind killed my parents. I may have hated them, but they were still mine. And no one touches what's mine"" & ' ""You were a tough bast***, I'll give you that"" she whispered. ""I salute you."" She shot a halfhearted salute from her forehead out and quickly turned it into giving it the middle finger. ' Great concepts including  a 'patient zero' who is more than just another zombie since it is able to heal itself and reclaim part of it's former humanity so long as it eats only brains instead of flesh.  Interesting to think that a warped world could also have birds and other animals susceptible to the virus (how does that change the dynamics of how one survives?) Problem is with awkwardly worded phrases I'm still struggling to understand even today such as this one at location 2528  ""Thing only evidence he wasn't alone anymore was the hairs on his neck standing in attention at the static electricity humming between them."" Were it edited properly this would be an even better book, as it is it's ok tho I hated having to lurch thru segments that didn't really read right and took away from the flow of the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPOFTITT2MCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVOGNJQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NPOFTITT2MCH","AXIO51VZN815F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXIO51VZN815F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Six stories total,well-formatted for kindle including handy links from the table of contents so you can read them in any order you choose. Titles including:1) Peppermint Tea in Electronic Limbo2) Springs and Bootblack3) Anomalocaris4) The Bakers' Barista5) Banshee6) Supermarket AmbushI liked the bookend titles best as they were lengthier and had more of an ending than the short flash fiction stories sandwiched between. Peppermint was a great lead story with sci-fi elements of a dying man wanting to be assured of saving his consciousness long past death and what can result if recessed memories aren't otherwise disclosed. Book finished well with Supermarket being just a fun what-if a blackmailer and her patsy met up and the patsy suddenly decided he didn't give a dam*  about the threats any more.

Too bad it isn't the other way around."" Can't hardly rate it higher tho since it excludes three other fine actresses that made some of Hitchcock's top five movies of all-times including Eva Marie Saint of ""North By Northwest"", Tippi Hedren of ""The Birds"" and who can forget Janet Leigh's performance in ""Psycho"" (one of my favorite horror classics).

"Really grisly which is how this book started for me since I used the active table of contents to flashback and view the photos first which certainly set the mood (dark, very dark!) Surprised to find some killers associated with the photos weren't highlighted in the book, but of those that were I'd say Richard Chase and Ed Gein were by far two of the worst. I'd highlight some phrases like using human skulls as soup bowls and consuming raw animal organs but got to be even too sick for me. Frankly, for those that really enjoy these type of works I thought it might have been better to list half as many serial killers over the 445 pages so as to give an even more thorough account, but in the end it was quite a book that left a lasting impression.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QR46W88AYEVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHB136U#wasThisHelpful","R3QR46W88AYEVW","AXIO51VZN815F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXIO51VZN815F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Action-oriented zombie apocalypse book with a novel twist  since the dead are extremely quick and can survive a head shot, but at least they burn when the sun is high. Turns into more of a military style book at the half way point as rogue groups are wanting what the others have so hardly ever a point where the story line 'shambles.' One thought that crossed my mind was whether fire would have made any kind of deterrent as I was always hoping they'd give it a try. Very good book and leave you with one final passage, ""There was an alertness there in the dark pits. Some kid of awareness of him. But as what?

This is really helpful with school papers when the teacher requires the use of the three ring binder and grades it and it gets used for a full semester.

"I was drawn to this book as I am in my second year of being the owner of a cottage business and have been questioning what it takes to turn a profit versus when it's time to just give up and designate it a hobby. I wanted to hear some business advice specifically for entrepreneurs. I wrongly assumed this would be a typical business ""blowing sunshine"" type of self-help book but it is anything but. From the start, Tobak blows the lid off myths and tells it like it really is with citations from credible sources (i.e.US Census Bureau).The method of writing is a combination of personal stories from his career and stories from big names in business. He then compares what most people who think they want to own a thriving business actually do with their time compared to the very different things that the successful ones do. He calls out the notion that branding and a steady flow of information via social media sites is the way to get famous as that is nothing more than yelling into an echo chamber. After asking you to take a hard look at who you are and how you are spending your time he lays out information on next steps to take to really move you toward fulfilling your goals.The stories are interesting and when he has a point to make he makes it clearly and succinctly. This book was enjoyable to read, not stressful or a slog, it moves along at a good pace, and I underlined throughout and made notes in the margins. I love the refreshing no baloney attitude and I rate this 5 stars = I Love It.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OHHO0MVRDAC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159918575X#wasThisHelpful","R1OHHO0MVRDAC9","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so excited that this is available now. I had formerly bought a crock pot not to cook in but to keep my food hot during transport and to use as a service device (not plugged in). Every time I drove my food in a crock pot to the pot luck party it spilled. The first time was on the minivan trunk's carpet so the food stink was hard to get rid of. After that I devised more elaborate protective ways involving several layers of cardboard boxes that saved the rug but still made a mess (sauce sloshed down the sides of the crock that had to be wiped off before presentation at the pot luck).So for me the main benefit of this is the safe transport of food. This is a sturdy lidded food crock with four strong lock down lid clasps. It has one thick handle on the top for easy carrying so you do not touch the hot part of the crock to carry it. It is a nice shape and easy (versus the oval of a large crock pot).This claims to keep foot hot for 12 hours or cold for 18 hours. I assume that do that the lid must be kept on. (There is no instruction manual to clarify this.) For my purposes I will never need a food piping hot for 12 hours or cold for 18 so this suits my needs. The stainless steel construction is more sturdy than crocks in crock pots and cannot chip or break. I will be careful with the lids and clasps though during washing and handling because this type of plastic cannot be repaired if you break it.This fits a big need for those of us who frequently bring food to pot luck parties and is a fraction of the cost of replacing you car's carpeting and a deep clean after a big spill. Just ask my friend whose entire crock of lobster bisque spilled in the minivan...rated 5 stars = I Love It.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK76ODQZQZ41H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPISUJQ#wasThisHelpful","RK76ODQZQZ41H","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to the LED bulbs the arm which the bulbs are in is narrow and thin, this is a big difference from the former (older) lamps. I like the adjustable arm so you can move it to where you need light. However it does not throw light strongly over a large area of the desk and to get the light I need it must be on the highest setting; there are three brightness levels. I cannot see a reason to use the other two dimmer lamp settings since this is a desk lamp or task light.My original intent for this was for a better desk lamp for my husband as the ceiling fan's overhead light is too dim to read and do paperwork with however I like it best for a task light for knitting. I have been using it in the family room to light my hands holding the needles and yarn so I can see it well without the use of a strong whole room overhead lighting. The way the bar moves means I can angle the light to throw it just where I need it and there is no light getting in other family member's way of viewing the television. The room light can be off and I can use this desk lamp for my project.The base is heavy and the arm moves easily. The power cord is a separate piece. It seems pricey. I am rating this 4 stars due to the brightness having three levels and because I think the two lower levels are not suitable for any deskwork, reading, or crafting work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7WHH8CUABHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW76VW#wasThisHelpful","R1W7WHH8CUABHH","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a tricky review to write and due to the title I am rating this book 4 stars = I LIke It. The book title promises 1600 practice test questions and yes, those are in the book. The font and layout is nice and non-cluttered. There is barely any strategy taught in this book, each test section has less than two pages of introduction or tips, then you take the tests. There is no review section as is normal with other test prep books (i.e. Kaplan, Barron's) but the title does not promise any review.However the online exclusives marketed on the cover are a bit deceptive. By purchasing the book you may register for a free online account. There you can take more quizzes (totaling 1100 more questions) and then it predicts your possible test score. There is an algorithm that leads you to practice taking more and more of the type of questions that you need to practice on, which is great.If you really want to review and learn the Grockit strategies and tips you will need to pay $99 to unlock the video library. I did not do that so I do not fully understand if other test practice work and what else is available or not available.The tagline ""Grockit does not waste your time"" is honestly, what all the companies do, they do a general practice of all topics then they tell you to study and focus on what you don't know. Nothing new there.Overall this is a slender book of 291 pages which is less intimidating and seems do-able compared to the Kaplan and others on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U52U9X4IG4NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506202691#wasThisHelpful","R3U52U9X4IG4NZ","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lacking from this book is general instruction and explanation about what a body butter is and how one would formulate a recipe but worse is her inclusion of fresh fruit into body butter which is a high risk for bacterial and mold contamination and therefore dangerous to use.This is only a compilation of 30 recipes, there is no base information or instruction for a general education on the topic. The ebook lacks a biography or explanation anywhere of who this author is and what her credentials are to justify her expertise in presenting these recipes. Even her author page on Amazon is skimpy and there it says she has a soap business and she teaches but no business name is given so it lacks credibility.Oddly the measurements vary from ounces to grams to volume, this should be standard and it is should be in weight not volume.There is no explanation of what an essential oil is, something very basic to include. She also refers to vanilla cookie essential oil which is impossible, that's a fragrance oil and any soap maker or skin product maker should know that.Also important is it never says she created these formulas, so I am starting to suspect she culled them from the internet. For example the recipes lack any cohesion. For examle some have 2 parts butter to 1 part coconut and 1 part light oil while another has 1:1 ratio of butter to coconut oil and another has 1/2 cup coconut oil to 2 Tbsp shea butter, this makes no sense! These are all different products that will not produce the same type of product in the end. In the beginning she says that body butters are ""sticky, oily, and greasy"" then on the next page she says that these are designed to absorb into the skin and NOT be greasy. Which is it?The grammar is poor and in broken English. Grammar errors also exist on her Amazon author page.I do not trust this book and will not be using these recipes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNUQCA1KVX3FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM99MFI#wasThisHelpful","RNUQCA1KVX3FN","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a lovely cookbook of 100 recipes which are labeled which are gluten-free, vegan, and/or paleo. The foods covered are: breakfast, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, appetizers, soups, salads, side dishes, main dishes, and of course: desserts.

There seem to be more recipes that are more contemporary than Betty Crocker, with a range of foods from around the world and some with bold flavors. A few are: layered beet and carrot salad, maple pickled ramps, and balsalmic carmelized onion pizza with arugula and maple drizzle. Some of the more plain American foods are: baked beans, maple ranch dressing, and maple walnut chocolate chunk cookies.I am a cookbook collector and when I lived in New England I taught myself to do backyard maple sugaring using books, and loved making my own maple syrup.

"I was drawn to read this memoir because it was about how helicopter parenting and a sheltered privileged teen was left unprepared to protect herself and unable to advocate for herself correctly which hurt her and changed her intended life plans. I mostly wanted to read about what it felt like to be helicopter parented as that story and voice is not one we hear much about yet. The cover tells the gist of the book.I found the author's storytelling style engaging and interesting. I was never bored and wanted to know what happened next. Matis' path to healing is not one that many people will want to duplicate; she found peace and comfort in the wild as people were seen as a danger and a threat. Most Americans today are ignorant of nature and the wild and would fear such a journey. She was not that experienced and trekked with barely any gear, going against so many recommendations of what emergency equipment is necessary for backpacking. Trust in others cannot be praticed or lived in isolation so it makes sense that she learns that also on the trail when she connected and fell in love with a fellow through hiker on the trail.I rate this memoir 5 stars = I Love It.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVD6ZF87MECX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","R2QVD6ZF87MECX","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Read the product title very carefully, it fooled me. I thought the silver colored part of the earring was rhodium stone clusters but it is sterling slver bumps of various sizes and on top of that are 5 stones randomly placed. The rhodium does not even catch the light to sparkle. The rhodium blends in completely with the sterling bumps unless you put your eye right up to it. The bumps look weird and cheap.

"Lumo Lift is a device you wear which prompts you to sit or stand with correct posture. It links to your smart phone and uses bluetooth to connect to update the data. When you create you account via the app on the phone you input your weight, height, gender and age. Lumo Lift tracks the number of steps taken in a day. This then calculates to a number of calories burned in a day. It is NOT a heart rate monitor. Thus if you exercise in some other manner your calories burned will not show on the app correctly. For example if you swim and burn 500 calories you would have to add up yourself. Also if you are active in another way you can get away with doing less than the 10K suggested steps walking in a day.TIps and ChallengesThe device is small and must be worn flat against the body a couple of inches  under your collarbone. You cannot wear it on loose clothing. Thus it is recommended to wear on the bra strap or the undershirt for men.It fits my regular bra perfectly but it does not fit on my sports bra. So fitness walking with my sports bra cannot count toward correct posture time (goal 4 hours a day) or toward steps taken (goal 10K steps a day).Use of the seat belt while in a vehicle can make the device fall off and get lost. Since you forget it is on, this can be a problem. It fell off me and down my shirt and fel to the ground when I got out of the car. So when driving you should wear it on the right side of the body and when a passenger, wear it on the left (or opposite of where the belt lies).Pros and CommentsLumo Lift cannot be felt when wearing under a bra strap so you forget it is on which seems to be a godo thing.  However  to switch it when getting in a car can be something you forget to do.Lumo Lift is customizable. It defaults to vibrate when you have sat for 2 minutes with slouching. You can shorten this.Every time you put it on you are supposed to align your body correctly the press it twice to caibrate it. I know I was slouching and it was not going off so I am confused by the imperfection of it. For example if you just do not have your shoulders back it does not consider that slouching.If you lean back or lean to the side to lean on a couch or chair it reads that as slouching. It will keep vibrating every two minutes. The solution is to press it three times to mute the vibration. Then when you are back to typical sitting posture or standing you would double click it to recalibrate it and wake it up.The directions did not say how to power it off (for bedtime). I read online you just lay it down horizontally and it shuts itself off.It comes with a silver square magnet and a black one as well as the bra strap. These magnets are what holds it to your bra or tight shirt. If wearing it on an external surface that people see they would see a little square on your shirt. This is less obtrusive than the Fit Bit wrist band. If your shirt is skin tight there would be a little bump seen.On the morning of day three I was prompted by the app to charge the battery. They said it would last five days but apparently it does not. The battery takes two hours for full charage. It comes with a USB charger that you plug into your own AC plug or into any USB port to charge (computer or back of the TV - a good tip for hotel stays).I suggest you write a cheat sheet of number of presses for what action and keep it near you until you have it memorized.I rate this 4 stars due to the shorter battery life and it being imperfect about signaling poor posture. It is a training and awareness tool for a specific purpose. I love the idea of this as I have aways been a sloucher and this is a gentle prompt to help make a behavior and physical change. Lacking the pulse heart rate montior does not make this on equal standing to the Fit Bit. It's not a Fit Bit plus posture coach. (The Fit Bit can be edited in the app to add your other physical activity for an accurate calories burned count and you can add foods eaten to track calories in and calories out).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVX7C0H3GRZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9P8GMW#wasThisHelpful","RJVX7C0H3GRZX","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a print on canvas that is mounted on a wooden frame. It does not have a hanger mounted on it nor do they give you one, you must provide one and install it yourself before this can be hung up.I am a fan of Banksy and this is a portion of the original photograph image of the site, the full image you can view by seaching ""There's Always Hope"" which has a dark area above the girl, the edge of a stairway ledge which provides a visual focal point for movement across it and contains the handwritten words by Banksy, ""There's always hope"". That is also offered as a print and to be honest I think the visual of the entire ""piece"" is better than the closeup and I like that written message.I rate this 4 stars for quality of product.

"These SteelSeries Siberia X300 are indeed comfortable and lightweight. You can almost not feel them while wearing them. The downside is the faux leather can make you sweat when wearing them for five hours or more. However, when not wearing them for that long they are fine. The sound quality of the game is great and hearing the voices of the other gamers talking is a good volume. The microphone is adjustable so you can put it at the right spot for best pickup of your voice when you speak. The adapter is poor quality and only worked three times then we had to replace it with a new one we purchased (we chose another brand). We have been using these for over three months, I updated this review to rate them a 5 = I Love It because compared to other brands this is the most lightweight and most comfortable due to the headband that distributes the weight properly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH8TNFVL4EW8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3OK0A#wasThisHelpful","RH8TNFVL4EW8N","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I assumed this was large enough to make grounds for a pot of typical American coffee or at least for my 32 oz. French Press with one cycle but I was wrong. The unit itself is small and it comes apart to make it ideal for travel. The amount of grounds it makes was made to suit the Aeropress, which is a new variation of a French Press. The Aeropress uses a specific water temperature (175 degrees F), a different stirring duration (10 seconds) then no wait to steep but a 20-30 second long plunge. The screen size of the Aeropress and the technique, temperature and grounds size creates what is supposed to be the most superior tasting and low acid coffee ever.To use this took some time. I did not mind the hand grinding but suddenly realized how much easier it is to use the electric grinder (albeit its imperfection). Using the Tanors Ceramic Burr Manual grinder is more like a labor of love process that you should feel it a part of the experience and just accept it, kind of like accepting that to clean and cut fresh vegetables just takes certain steps that cannot be rushed or skipped through. That you might be able to use a food processor but after the hand washing and prep of the vegetable why bother and just proceed with manual cutting with a knife.If you want to use the Aeropress get this burr grider. The beans come out nice and consistently ground. There are two settings for fine or coarse. The device is well made and was designed in Germany.On a side note I was researching the new cold brew method of coffee making and it uses three times the quantity of beans that a French Press uses to make 32 oz of cold brew uses 3/4 of a cup of grounds. Thus the lazy way of making a low acid coffee uses more beans. People who care about not wasting a precious resource and who worry about labor conditions in the other countries where coffee beans are grown, and about travel cost and not being very ""green"" in the whole process, if they care about natural and human resources and being sustaiable and not exploiting other humans or nature, they would use a method to make coffee that would not waste the beans. Point being if you want all that use this grinder an an Aeropress for low acid, great tasting coffee.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XD8OPS5LTDHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R1XD8OPS5LTDHU","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The low price was tempting but they are far from ideal. The headset is lightweight but they make you itch so they are not comfortable. The microphone is terrible and other gamers complain they cannot hear what is being said. To explain: usually headsets have a flexible arm that you move toward your mouth with the microphone at the end. This X100 does not have that, it's a mic on the headset itself so it is not near your mouth.This is the issue with headsets: should you pay under $100 but have a set with serious issues, because you are on a tight budget and feel that under $100 is what is best for your finances, only to find out they are horrible and not fully functioning? Or should you pay $150 or more for something that fully works, is comfortable and has great sound quality. I understand not everyone wants to spend over $100 but really to pay this price for what these are seems overpriced and a waste to be honest.I rate these 2 stars = I Don't Like It","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8FLXGXOKVZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3P5WW#wasThisHelpful","R1B8FLXGXOKVZC","A3SMR4HRFJARSC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMR4HRFJARSC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a sturdy steel rack with a black porcelain coating. It is made in China and mine does not sit flat, it was constructed imperfectly and off kilter. I rate this 4 stars = I Like It as it works great at high temperatures in our Big Green Egg. I would have liked it if the open areas were smaller.For the purpose of this review I compared with other STEEL porcelain coated roasting racks on the market for price and design. There are many which are not steel available at lower prices. I found one that was steel and black colored but it only said ""nonstick coating"". Certain other popular nonstick treatments for cookware would not withstand use at high temperatures on a Komando style grill, so that's an issue.

"One of my two cats had been drinking less water and ended up in the pet ER on a holiday weekend for dehydration. He had been peeing outside the box and the start of a chronic common kidney problem was detected. In follow-up our vet pushed hard for me to rush out and buy a fountain which she said the cats love and it would encourage drinking. There were cheaper ones but they were ugly and I knew we would have to look at it. I also wondered of other ones that were plastic (not ceramic like this) would impart an off taste to the water.The cat who needed it is scared to death and will not use it. So it was a waste. I should have bought one for a quarter f the price to test if they would use it.The other cat loves it but the fountain is a pain to deal with. She splashes water out of it for play and I had to rig a mat system. It was hard to find a spot where people (mostly guests) would not walk into it. You have to monitor the water and refill a few times a day. My house is dry due to the AC or heat running every day of the year due to living in humid Houston. If the water gets too low the motor can burn out and break. The cat who likes it is not discriminating so we do not need this.Oh and the fussy cat, I discovered, just hates the tap water taste. I give a couple in ounces of Spring water and he loves it. I just out a new 2 oz a few times a day and he drinks that. Or he drinks from the toilet! Go figure!One more tip: a cat behavior book I read said to out the water not near their food dish.Thus fountain was an expensive thing to buy to not be able to use.

"This is a gripper tool to lift a grill grate out of the grill. The fact that it is metal means you can now remove the grill when the grill lis still hot and not burn your hand. Prior to having this tool when absolutely necessary we lifted the hot grill grate with a pair of food tongs which did not hold it correctly, it wobbled, and sometimes resulted in a dropped grate, or we waited until it was cold to do cleaning and moving ash or charcoal tasks.

"I have been using this for 2 years. You spray it on towel dried hair then style. What I love it is really does help your hair do the style you want and it holds it there but without touching your scalp (unless you spray it right onto your scalp). There is not glop as with gels. Unlike mousses it does not go on thick or coat the scalp. You just spray it where you want it and as much or as little as is needed. I do use hair spray afterwards on some occasions where I know I will be in the wind or when I want it to stay perfect such as for formal events. For everyday I do not use hairspray.

"Was this meant to be comedy?It is no wonder that Miliam treatment centers themselves don't tell their inmates about this book. It is hilariously bad and nonsensical throughout. I mean, a new book by their Guru, you world think, especially after all of these years, would be seen as a big deal, yes? A huge deal? Epic?(Insert sound of crickets here). Nothing. They don't talk about this book. I do not wonder why, having none read it carefully. It is a fishing trip.I especially love the part (sarcasm) where he slams the co-author of his other fishing trip, Under the Influence, because she dared to write a book on nutrition that this little Napoleon didn't approve of. He flat out states that he only used her for her writing skills and only because she allowed him to bully her.I can go on all day about this passive aggressive (against AA mainly) masterpiece on how not to write a book on addiction, but I won't as it isn't worth any more of my time.Reckless is a gentle way to describe it.Miliam is retired now but his legacy runs quite a treatment center scam in the Seattle area. I wouldn't even know where to begin in trying to describe this program of theirs which is designed from the ground up to generate repeat business.P.S. The photos I have attached to this review show that I have in my possession his way out of print ""ECCA"" as well as a first printing hardcover of his other book, ""Under the Influence"". I posted these pictures so that you would know, dear reader, that I am not just someone who is talking smack against this or any other Milam work. Since I reference these two works in a comment to this review, replying to someone who claims to be Milam himself, I wanted to prove that I actually do have them in my possession, that I am not lying. Both works are very rare. In fact, the ECCA is practically impossible to find-- even a casual read of ECCA makes it pretty clear that this rarity is probably quite deliberate. Now then, that being said, I am not trying to attack the man, but I am definitely attacking his work. They are reckless and dangerous works in my opinion, an opinion which I am allowed to have, when taken out of context in the deliberately prejudicial way that they are presented to the reader.This isn't a review so much as it is a warning. Stay clear of this joker. He HAS been thoroughly debunked and is running quite a treatment center scam in the state of Washington, which is a state with VERY LAX laws on this sort of thing. In WA, almost anyone can call themselves a ""treatment specialist"" or whatnot. It's a ""wild west"" thanks to the Hughes Act and poor state laws on this subject. Relentlessly terrible treatment centers are quite a racket in WA, causing all sorts of damage to the few respectful, legitimate sources of true recovery that are still available.Thank you for reading. :)P.P.S. For anyone interested, William R. Miller (Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque) and Ernest Kurtz (RIP Ernie, he passed away recently and is very much missed by many including myself-- author of ""Not God"" which is ISBN-10: 0894860658 and ISBN-13: 978-0894860652, etc.), two EXTREMELY respected authors, archivists and researchers in the fields of alcoholism, addiction, psychology and psychiatry, temperance movement history and much more?Well, they got together and wrote a paper called ""Models of Alcoholism Used in Treatment - Contrasting A.A. and Other Models with Which it is Often Confused"". Milam is prominently discussed within it. Actually, I am being nice. He is actually pretty thoroughly debunked (read: torn to shreds) by it. Much of Milam's rhetoric is deeply dismantled, piece by piece, in it.

"II want to also attest that, as a user of this product for years, the ""new"" formula is absolutely terrible. By removing the enzyme system and replacing it with what looks like (more) glycerin it is quite obvious to me that this new owner of the brand is trying to save money by making as cheap of a formula as possible-- and those that the old formula helped can be damned.Also, the current description is misleading in part and more true than they care to admit in part. Here is the bullet-point description:-Plastic-A soothing mouthwash that cleans and refreshes the mouth-Gently cleans a dry mouth, moisturizing minor irritation-Alcohol-free and refreshes the mouth without burning-Helps protect against the odors associated with dry mouth-Uses the LP3 salivary enzyme-protein systemOn point 1: YES, it DOES taste like plastic now.On the last point: Deceptive advertising as this enzyme system has been REMOVED and no longer exists in the product, thus making it worthless....and it really DOES taste like plastic now.When I noticed that they changed the formula I stocked up. I was lucky enough to be able to do so. But I use it so sparingly now because I dread running out of it and do not know what to replace it with. This corporation has NO conscience for doing this to us! It's clearly a money grab. Why would they ruin such a great product like this and then IGNORE our complaints other than to reply with COOKIE CUTTER responses? Of course they want us to CALL. THAT wouldn't be documented like this.To all: please write your own reviews and keep it up!

"I want to love this app but it contains one major flaw: IF you are going to call this an office calculator with ""paper tape"" then you need to make said 'tape' printable and exportable into useful formats (such as Excel or formatted .RTF or whatever) so that the 'tape' becomes more than just eye candy novelty.In the real world, the tape on an office calculator (and this developer DID name the app as such) is a critical part of looking for mistakes if there are any and is used to validate correct calculations over the course of the entire project. It is quite literally the paper trail.It blows my mind that there is no easy way to print or export the tape out of this so-called ""Office Calculator PRO"" app. In fact, not being able to print or to sensibly export the tape is a showstopper. -2 stars due to this easily fixable flaw that people have complained about for years and that the developer can't seem to be bothered to address.Very poor customer relations when multiple requests for a critical but unimplemented feature is ignored.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A68YX66D28KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TI1WME#wasThisHelpful","R2A68YX66D28KV","ASXYFYCPIP232","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASXYFYCPIP232?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This does not.It is also a much better value in terms of price if you do the math and iodine is what you are after. Who cares if it is more concentrated when you get so much more bang for the buck at 2%? 5% is way overpriced anyway.I apply this, let it dry, then lightly coat with pure coconut oil. No harm to the skin whatsoever.This is wonderful stuff! I use it alongside Nascent, so that my body doesn't have to work so hard converting one form into another. I just give it what it wants by letting it distribute the different types of iodine as it sees fit. And I ONLY supplement transdermally! Why would I take this internally and kill off my GOOD intestinal bacteria as well? IN most cases, that seems silly.

"These are just perfect. These are great for alcohol based tinctures (like nascent iodine) because the smaller bottles allow for less evaporation. Just buy the big bottles of whatever you buy, and save money doing that, but THEN load the contents of them into these. Your mileage will greatly increase because as the large bottles get more empty, the alcohol in the tincture will evaporate into the air of the bottle itself. Thus, every time you open the larger bottle, you increase the evaporation rate, which only gets worse and worse as the bottle becomes more and more empty.Smaller bottles go a long, long way towards solving this problem. Fill up a few of these with the contents of your bigger bottle instead and you will notice a huge difference in how much use you get out of the tincture over time.Try it. :)And buy these.

DOES advertise other games by the developer which you have to click out of to exit the game but at least the game does have an exit. I'm not annoyed by this, in fact, I welcome it. I think that this app proves that it is possible to advertise your other works in a paid game without grabbing permissions that the app does not need.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BHSTJJHMT9KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTGJ23E#wasThisHelpful","R3BHSTJJHMT9KW","ASXYFYCPIP232","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASXYFYCPIP232?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, this app contains only the usual Amazon add-ons and they don't scare me.  I can find no strange behavior with third party servers or anything so I would not equate any of it with adware or spyware.Okay then, as for the game, it reminds me in a way of a classic arcade game called Jungle King/Hunt. In that game, you would swing on a vine/rope through increasingly more dangerous environments with the prize being a girl in a cauldron that you got to save, hooray! ;)Sound familiar?That being said, this is not a bad thing. This is an instant death type get as far as you can game which is all the rage nowadays. It plays well, is quite fun, iseasy enough to control (tap to launch a rope in midair and time it so that you connect with something) and the difficulty ramps up fast but not too fast.The game keeps track of the furthest distance you have ever made it so far and I admit to a certain satisfaction when I can surpass my previous best.

"While It's a great concept, and an easy design to set up, I simply cannot give this grill a positive review.  It's just too flimsy.  My unit arrived with the locking mechanism of one of the risers broken, so it cannot be carried by the shoulder strap or handle the way it is supposed to be carried, and the grilling plate appears to be rather fragile- some sort of ceramic. One of the nubs that secures it into place with the grill side up was already broken off of it.  As for use, while it is easy to light, it simply does not get hot enough for efficient cooking.  Certainy, you can ultimately get your burgers and such to cook, but you will not have any searing, leaving  the darker char marks you would expect from grilling... even when run on high.So, while a practical concept, there are some serious design flaws that must be fixed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K3OBYK0FNG2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3K3OBYK0FNG2M","A3CTI2ARGG2T7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CTI2ARGG2T7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Galen, my Service Dog in Training is a very picky eater, which is pretty typical to shepherds. An 8-month-old Shiloh Shepherd, he also has a rather sensitive stomach. As such, it is difficult to find foods he can both tolerate and will eat. While he is still a puppy, he is now old enough to transition to some adult foods, as his growth has begun to slow and his metabolism can handle any calcium excesses other foods may have.While I can't say Galen is a fanatic for this fish and sweet potato food, it does appear to be one of the few foods that Galen will both eat and agrees with him. Because of his sensitivity, his diet is now mostly seafood, his primary food being a salmon based grain free limited ingredient diet by Canidae. Secondarily, he gets Nutro Limited Ingredient Diet Potato and Kangaroo formula, which I discovered he loved and tolerated well when we tried it for review purposes a while back. Now we have a wet food he likes in addition to the Tripett Green Beef Tripe he gets (tripe contains enzymes that aid digestion).The Nutro fish and sweet potato appears to be reasonably nutritious, and is gentle on digestion. The sweet potato provides the bulk needed for stools that are of a firm, healthy consistency. In all, I'm quite pleased with a number of Nutro's recent additions, and this is no exception.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRY998JN4FGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZSEFC2#wasThisHelpful","R1RRY998JN4FGY","A3CTI2ARGG2T7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CTI2ARGG2T7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Following the Fitz, seeking redemption.Their World...... Made smaller by a magic they don't understand... Made larger by losses to places yet unknown... Split apart with Skill... and only two men, the Fool, and a boy have the power to mend it.In the first edition of ""The Fitz and the Fool"" we mourned the loss of Molly, and celebrated the birth of an tiny and eccentric little girl, a child fully as secretive as her father, and granted with powers no one can comprehend, except by the second father she has never met. But... just after she unknowingly meets her other father, the child has been taken.Fool's Quest is a continuation of this story, as Fitzchivalry does all he can to save his best friend and avenge his daughter.  The Fitz embarks on a quest for vengeance for a daughter lost, alone, but is joined by an unabashed Fool, as well as Lant, who hopes to prove his worth to his father and redeem himself before a sister he never knew he had.  Perseverance, too, joins them on the quest, undying loyalty and hope for little Bee Farseer.Finally, we see the entire world of Fitzchivalry Farseer of the Farseer Chronicles, the Liveship Traders, The Tawny Man Trilogy, The Rainwild Chronicles, and the Fitz and the Fool cocollide in a spectacular mixing of the worlds of Buckkeep and the Rain Wilds, as Fitzchivalry is recognized as a prince, and as his Skill abilities wax strong. Unlike the Skill users of Prince Regal's reign, only good comes from Fitz's use of the Skill. He becomes a hero and healer, but remains far from the vengeance he craves, unknowing of his child's true fate.This book is the centerpiece for all of the series' Robin Hobb has written of the world of dragons and the magics of the Wit and the Skill. While past series' have touched one another, it is not until ""Fool's Quest"" that we see them all come together in a mesmerizing montage of magic, elderlings, humans, dragons, and the little known race of the Whites. The end turns into another beginning, and ultimately the reader is left hanging, awaiting the next installment to find out what is to become of the Fitz and the Fool after their true Elderling encounter and beyond... and to find out just how the small quartet of a blind Fool, an untried man, a devoted youth, and the Prince Fitzchivalry intends to invade the island of the whites, discover what is there, and make all of their lives whole again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM5MCAZ3I1DAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392921#wasThisHelpful","RM5MCAZ3I1DAG","A3CTI2ARGG2T7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CTI2ARGG2T7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~Highlights~***** FAST drying!***** Three temperatures (most dryers have only two)***** Conditioning Ring Offers some protection for hair***** Excellent hairbrush***** Multiple styling attachments (diffuser, concentrator)The Revlon D8700 is, by far, the best hairdryer I've ever had.  I've never had a dryer that dries my hair so quickly, and so far I've not noticed any damaging effects, but only time will tell if the macadamia nut oil in the conditioning ring is responsible or not.  With three temperature setting and cool shot, plus two air speeds, I can adjust the dryer to my styling needs and preferences.  The diffuser and concentrator also expand my customization options, so that I have what I need, regardless of hair length or style.  While not absolutely necessary, the hairbrush is of a style and design that I prefer over other types of brushes, and works well in conjunction with the dryer when styling.  I also find that I can run the dryer longer than others I've had in the past, without it overheating and shutting off, another bonus.If the Revlon D8700 proves to be as durable as their claims, then this dryer is well worth spending a few extra dollars on, as it should be a workhorse for a long time to come for all styling needs.

"~Highlights~***** Nutritional excellence (no preservatives, grains, or other fillers)***** Natural Ingredients (you can actually read and understand every ingredient)***** A great way to entice a picky eater (provided one is using a flavor their dog finds attractive)***** Packaged for convenienceWhen it comes to Galen, my Shiloh Shepherd pup who's training to be my Service Dog (with the help of Guild Assistance Dog Partners), few things are more paramount to me than his safety and nutrition.  For safety, I utilize things like a seatbelt harness when driving (which protected him last month in a serious car wreck).  For nutrition, I look to my pup's dietary needs, ingredients for his foods, and the nutritional analysis for his foods and treats.  For treats, he gets freeze dried lamb or chicken (only one ingredient in those), or home-made salmon or turkey jerky. For his foods, he gets Tripett Green Beef Tripe and Canidae Grain Free Pure Sea, which both have fewer than 10 key ingredients.However, like German Shepherds, Shiloh Shepherds like Galen have a strong tendency toward being picky eaters.  Galen is no exception.  There are few foods he'll eat, and if he suspects any tampering, he'll refuse his food altogether. This proved to be a problem the other week, for he became ill with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.  As the cause of HGE is largely unknown, veterinarians tend to treat not only the symptoms but potential causes as well, including giving an antibiotic, probiotics, and a wormer.  Unfortunately, the probiotics and wormer that were prescribed were in powder form, and adding them to his food, even wet food,would result in Galen refusing his food.  I needed to do something to get him eating, for the antibiotic should be taken with food.While not a perfect solution, as Galen didn't find the Purina Beyond beef and berry puree overly appealing.  However; it was appealing enough to get Galen to eat his doctored food.  An added bonus is that it also causes the powders to adhere more strongly to Galen's kibble, making it less likely that he will get a reduced dose from the powders settling to the bottom of his bowl.While Galen isn't overly fond of the beef and berry puree, he may find other flavors more attractive.  I will be trying the other flavors in order to find out which he likes best, for his lukewarm reaction to this flavor could easily lead to his food refusal any time he needs a powdered medication or supplement.I have tried a number or other products from the Purina Beyond series, and have thus far been impressed with how Purina has finally produced a line of products that eschew grains, food coloring, and other unnecessary ingredients of little to no nutritional value.  These puree packets are no exception.  The ingredient profile is excellent, and it can serve a valuable purpose by enticing the picky eater without compromising nutrition.A single packet is enough to coat all of his kibble (Galen is 80 lbs and 8 months old, so he has relatively high calorie requirements).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VWQ1NYU72ZJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKLCRN4#wasThisHelpful","R1VWQ1NYU72ZJO","A3CTI2ARGG2T7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CTI2ARGG2T7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dino Saluzzi may be the perfect musician for a record label like ECM. He comes from an exotic clime, Argentina, and he plays a somewhat exotic instrument, the bandoneon, which is the concert grand of the accordion family. More than that though, he is always crossing lines. He has played jazz, or something close to it, on albums of his own and with Tomasz Stanko (the lovely 1999 From the Green Hill, which also featured another jazz-classical crossover artist, reed player John Surman), Palle Mekkelberg, Charlie Haden, Charlie Mariano, Palle Danielsson, Enrico Rava, Al Di Meola, and the George Gruntz big band and Hadens Liberation Music Orchestra, and he has played music that can only be considered classical, and that he himself composed, in concert and on at least one other album before this one (Kultrum, 1982). With his brothers and son he has toured and recorded his family project, a mixing together of the many streams of South American music: tango, candombe, milonga All his albums are good: they are the more arresting for blending musical traditions. He is quoted as saying in the liner notes for this album, La musica es una.   Music is one. For him clearly it is.He doesnt play at all on his latest album. Argentinian pianist Horacio Lavandera does the playing, Saluzzi the composing. The album comprises ten pieces, ranging from little over a minute to just over nine minutes long and composed across a span of forty-two years, from 1960s Montanas to 2000-2002s Moto Perpetuo, Imagenes, and La Casa 13. Its lovely music but not easy to categorize. The shortest cut, Moto Perpetuo, could be used as a training lesson for perspective jazz pianists: its an exercise in time and rhythm as much as melody. The other pieces, including the lovely waltz, Vals Para Verenna, fall somewhere between the Romantic tradition and Argentinian tango music. Time is not kept mechanically but organically, and drama swells up and back down over and over again in a music that is for the most part intensely emotional but also deeply lyric. Its a very pleasant album to listen to, kind of what I imagine Schubert would have sounded like if hed also played jazz and tango.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27C5D70IVCK23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7GCFMQ#wasThisHelpful","R27C5D70IVCK23","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jim Hall: Jazz Guitar. (1956)  JH, guit; Carl Perkins, p; Red Mitchell, b.Bill Smith: Folk Jazz (1959)  BS, clari; JH, guit; Monty Budwig, b; Shelly Manne, dr.The Modest Jazz Trio: Good Friday Blues (1960) JH, guit; RM, p; Red Kelly, b.Paul Desmond: First Place Again:(1959) PD, alto sx; JH, guit; Percy Heath, b; Connie Kay, dr.These recordings were made between 1956 and 1960. Hall had arrived in Los Angeles in February 1955, barely 24 years old. He was picked up almost art once by drummer Chico Hamilton for Hamiltons revolutionary soft jazz quintet, which featured the unusual instrumentation of sax/clarinet (Buddy Collette), guitar, cello, bass and drums. In 1957, Hall, always questing, joined Jimmy Giuffres new trio, which had the even more unusual instrumentation of reed (Giuffre), guitar (Hall) and bass (Ralph Pena), later replaced by valve trombone (Bob Brookmeyer). By 1962, two years after the release of the last of the four albums in this compilation, he had joined tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins in a quartet of tenor, guitar, bass and drums and the group had released one of Rollinss classic albums, The Bridge. (The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015.) At different times in a long and productive career, Hall played or recorded with John Lewis (Grand Encounter, 1956  --arguably Lewiss best small group recording), Hampton Hawes (1958, the classic three All Night Session! albums), Ben Webster (1959), Bill Evans (three albums, starting in 1959), Paul Desmond (1959-65), one album with Ella (1960) and two with Helen Merrill (1967-8), Lee Konitz (1960-61), Rollins (1961-2, and again in 1964), Art Farmer (1962-64), Tommy Flanagan and Ron Carter, and then Red Mitchell (1962-65 -- Carter was a favorite companion, on and off again from 1962 until 1985), Don Thompson and Terry Clarke (1975), George Shearing, Itzhak Perlman, Joe Lovano, etc., etc., etc., up to and including fellow guitar players Bill Frisell, Pat Metheny, John Scofield and Peter Bernstein. Among his numerous albums is an appearance in trio with pianist Michel Petrucciani and tenor player Wayne Shorter on The Power of Three in 1986, a most unusual album for someone of Halls general persuasions, which leaned toward more straightforward swing-ish and boppish jazz.Premier Guitar magazine stated that ""it could be argued that the jazz guitar tree is rooted in four names: Django [Reinhardt], Charlie [Christian], Wes [Montgomery], and Jim [Hall]"".  But when Hall was asked once to characterize t his style of playing, he responded:  I'm not sure I have what's called a style. Looking back over almost sixty years of recorded output, that seems a pretty accurate assessment. He didnt have a style, other than his roots in 40s and very early 50s jazz. (He always said that his style was rooted in sax players Hawkins, Young, Gonsalves, Thompsonand not other guitar players.) Rather, Hall was a master listener who adjusted his playing to the styles of his co-peers and the needs of the moment.On these four albums, though, Hall was a young man, just starting out, and the recordings show both his early strengths and his weaknesses at that early point in his career. The first album, Jazz Guitar (1956), is a trio album. Mitchell, the bass player, was as good as they came at the time. Perkins was a good but not exceptional journeyman pianist. The roots of all three musicians were in bop, but in accord with the preferences of the time, particularly in west coast (= predominantly white) jazz, the music they produce is bland, one or two cut music but boring beyond that. The decision to dispense with more elaborate arrangements in favor of simple head arrangements did not help: theres not much here worth listening to a second time.  Not bad but not good, and since theres so much superior music out there, why waste time on this?The second album, by the Bill Smith quartet (1959) received a positive review in the Penguin Guide to Recorded Jazz but not from me. Its warmed over Jimmy Giuffre Trio music, but with drums added in: Smiths clarinet sounds amazingly like Giuffres, played almost exclusively in the chalumeau register (which means its played in the low and middle ranges, no highs and no excitement either), and the choice of melodies to play (all folk tunes) and the overly neat arrangements made of them drain it of interest. As to Hall, on this (early) album at least, his famous listening skills seem to have failed him: his solo work doesnt meld with Smiths or with the overall arrangements. What you have is an album on two tracks: the one Smiths, the other Halls, and never the twain shall meet.  Im being a little too harsh in saying it that way, but this is not an album youll want to play often.You will want to play the next album over and over again because it is one of the little, almost unnoticed gems of jazz in that era. I forget the backstory to the album:  bassists Red Mitchell and Red Kelly (Kelly was playing in the Woody Herman band at the time) showed up for the session, which originally was to be a track or two for a composite jazz blues album that Richard Bock of Pacific Jazz Recprds was assembling. Somehow Mitchell, who played a mean piano (he played it again on a few tracks on the 1974 duet album with Lee Konitz, I Concentrate on You), wound up playing piano while Kelly played bass, and thus was born one of the best mainstream albums of the early 60s, Good Friday Blues. Everything works on this album. The chemistry among the three players is transparent. All of the six pieces are first rate but three of them Good Friday Blues, I Remember You, and Bill Not Phil, are superb.The last album in this collection is Paul Desmonds. He had won four years straight in the Downbeat Readers Polls plus Melody Maker, Metronome and Playboys polls. When youre up, you promote it, so Desmonds agent did with this good but not great quartet album. The rhythm section was as good as you could get at the time, if you didnt want too much excitement: Percy Heath and Connie Kay from the exquisitely precise Modern Jazz Quartet (another constant poll winner).  All of the cuts are good, although I could have done without the waltz version of Greensleeves. The format is much the same across the board: theme statement by Hall alone or Desmond and Hall together, Desmond solos, Hall solos and out. On some cuts (like the first, I Get a Kick Out of You), it starts with some of the cutesy frou-frou that I associate with Dave Brubeck-Paul, butt then the straightforward jazz kicks.  Drums and bass tick off a beat, Desmond or Hall deliver straightforward, soaring jazz solos. Neither of them stretches the boundaries of jazz but theyre good, their solos are competent, driving, and intelligent. If you dont like the Brubeck approach (as I dont), its easy to dismiss Desmond as a musical pretty boy but he wasnt. He was competent, sometimes driving, and a very good artist, and this recording shows that.One last comment on this collection of decidedly mixed value: somethings wrong with the sound balance. The [piano sounds tinny not just Perkins but even Mitchell. (Theres no piano on the other two sessions so you cant compare them.)  Its not bad enough I cant listen to these sessions but it shouldnt have happened. Where it happened, I dont know but if it was the fault of the sound engineer who oversaw the re-recording, tsk, tsk!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRWQWCZJ00WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHZYDY#wasThisHelpful","RPRWQWCZJ00WD","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At Lucys wedding reception it was to her first husbandher mother-in-law introduced her this way: This is Lucy. Lucy comes from nothing.  Years later when Lucy has started to sort out her life through writing about it, she comments: I took no offense and really, I take none now. But I think: No one in this world comes from nothing.Inside, she knows she almost did: a dirt-poor family which was just as poor in emotions, a mother and a father who never told her they loved her or praised her for her accomplishments, living for a good part of her childhood in a converted garage, always old clothes, short even on food (sometimes they had bread with maple syrup on it for their supper), behind her back other students making fun of her. Lucy got out of that life. She went to college, got married and had children, started a career (writing)but her past life never fully left her. Even though she no longer saw her parents or siblings, she felt the deficit inside her: shed never watched TV, her clothes sense was wonky, it took a while for her to learn common etiquette. Then she goes to the hospital. A simple operation turns bad and shes stuck there for nine weeks. She hasnt seen her mother for years but her mother shows up, stays five days by the side of her bed, not even leaving to sleep she sleeps in the chair by the sides of Lucys bed instead. And she talks. Simple stuff. Do you remember so and so? This is what happened to her. Still shying away from the personal, no emotion, at least not overtly, still unable to tell her daughter she loves her. But she showed up and Lucy needs what she gives her. Its a gift why so much needed? Because she didnt get it when she was a child? Probably so, but she cherishes it regardless.Lucy tells us about this time from a time later in her life. In the process, she talks about a lot of things her first marriage and what was good and what became bad about it, her relations with her daughters both before she left her husband and after, her own growing up, the last times she saw her parents, first her mother and then her father, as they lay dying, her oblique and passing relation to a sympathetic doctor at the hospital, a woman writer who gives her the advice she needs to forge her own literary voice, a neighbor whos there before she goes to the hospital and gone afterwards, dead of AIDS. The story ends with a short chapter (half a page) with Lucy accepting her story as hers, freed (though she doesnt phrase it this way) from the shadow of her mothers expectations at last. She ends it: But this one is my story. This one. And my name is Lucy Barton.Thats beautiful. But its not the end. An equally short chapter follows that talks about her daughter and her: if it has a subject, its that parents choices affect their children, but its also that parents love their children and if their children feel pain, they feel it too, clutch it forever to their hearts.But thats not the end either. One final chapter follows, a reminiscence a word picture- of what the farmland around her parents small house looked like in the autumn as the sun rose, passed over the sky and set again at nightfall. The closing words are lovely, elegiac she remembers the sun going down:  ""but if you turn around, the land is still available to the eye with such softness, the few trees, the quiet fields of cover crops already turned, and the sky lingering, then finally dark. As though the soul can be quiet for those moments.  ""All life amazes me.""I hope Ive convinced you that this is a beautiful book, all the more eloquent for the simplicity of its images and the modesty of its story line. I hadnt read anything by Elizabeth Strout before. Now I think that was dumb. I did know that she had won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel, Olive Kittredge, in 2009.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12HHQIMIPGHEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067693#wasThisHelpful","R12HHQIMIPGHEY","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clines first novel, Ready Player One (2012) was a really good pop novel. Its hacker hero, still a teenager, ends up saving the world, but en route, theres a lot of humor and lots of action and the hero is an appealing character. The setting was good to, a future world where the poor are permanently dis-endowed  and kept in tutelage by a combination of handouts and flashy media toys. Armada is like ready Player One but the steroids have run out. Again, the hero is a hacker. It turns out that for the past four generations, the hidden rulers of mankind have been using movies (2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, E. T.) and video to train the Earths next generations of interstellar warriors because, what a surprise!, we have been under attack all that time. It started with a giant swastika carved on the reverse side of the moon but now its a full-scale invasion armada which is approaching earth with surprising rapidity. So all these teenage war gamers, geeks at school until now, have been called up to active duty. Theyll be piloting drone warships in one last effort to stop the attackers.There are surprises in what follows but theyre not terribly exciting ones and the sense of humor that suffused Clines first book is conspicuously absent in his second.  Nothing in this book is as good as its counterpart in the first. The result is a book thats so so, never terribly good, never unredeemably bad. And since the heroes, with few exceptions, average out at age eighteen, and even the older ones are gamer geeks, there isnt much in the way of subtlety or perspicacity in the dialogue or action.I wouldnt call this a hack novel but its much too close to one for an author good enough to turn out Clines scintillating first novel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30N0JDHN8UTU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137250#wasThisHelpful","R30N0JDHN8UTU2","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sunfail is neither an exciting adventure nor all that clear as to what is going on. A series of catastrophes happen in rapid succession: birds fall out of the skies, everything running on electricity shuts down, strange men dressed in black are caught writing graffiti in the subways, the countrys foremost military outpost on the Eastern seaboard is wiped out, and planes, trains and busses start to shut down, locking New Yorkers in their inorganic city. Panic is the result but the goal of the perpetrators is financial gain. The principal good guy is a veteran whos portrayed as decidedly not superhuman yet acts much that way. Hes aided by a former colleague whos now an assassin for the bad guys (will she make it through alive?) and a devastatingly attractive Columbia University anthropologist with whom the vet had a one-night stand a while back and she still has the hots for him. Shes engaged in deciphering hieroglyphics (well, writing thats kind of like hieroglyphics that have been discovered in an underwater city near the Bermuda Triangle). The writing is on buildings that resemble Egyptian pyramids and the writing seems a mixture of Mayan and Olmec. Bermuda Triangle? Egyptian, Mayan, Olmec, all mixed together?As to the bad guys, theyre known as The Hidden. At least thats what they[re called by three guys in black who pop up half way through the story, do precious little and then disappear , who may or may not be federal agents and thus possibly good guys. And what are the bad guys named? The conspirators have confiscated the names of Olmec etc. gods.Does this sound confusing? I hope so because it is. Its also, lapses in logic aside, not very exciting at all. To cap it all, the story doesnt so much end as stop: the bad guys are still around, just their current assault foiled, and I suppose, soon installment two of this deflated epic will appear but I dont know why anyone would want to read it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRU1N62E6GIGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617754064#wasThisHelpful","RRU1N62E6GIGK","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SB, p; Salvatore Maiore, b; Roberto Dani, dr.Composer Alec Wilder has long been a favorite of jazz musicians --Jackie and Roy, Roland Hanna, Dave Liebman, Mundell Lowe, Marian McPartland and Ben Sidran have all recorded albums of his music-- but this is only the second album Ive bought of jazz renditions of his lovely songs. The first was Bob Brookmeyers, 7 x Wilder (1961) with Brookmeyer on piano and valve trombone, Jim Hall guitar and backing them up. Its the first time Ive heard Milanese pianist Stefano Battaglia, though hes got five previous albums under his belt, all critically acclaimed. (The last one, 2013s Songways, features the same trio as on this album.)The differences between the two albums are instructive. Its not simply a consequence of Brookmeyer having Jim Halls guitar in his group, or Brookmeyers ability to switch back and forth between piano and valve trombone on different tunes. Rather, its a difference in tone --and feeling. The Brookmeyer-Hall album is very laid back. It has an informal quality to it, which is enhanced the burry almost muted sound of Brookmeyers horn and the soft, lyric quality of Halls exquisite guitar lines. Its like old friends talking together, and behind them is the impeccable rhythm keeping of two of the best rhythm keepers of the day. In Battaglias trio, the pianist dominates and the music sounds more formal, almost as though as series of movie tracks played by a topflight jazz trio. It reminds me of Enrico Pieranunzis two Plays Moricone albums. Like Joey Baron on the Pieranunzi/Morricone albums, on this album drummer Dani is muted, tasteful and inventive; his subtle brush and stick work moves business along with a steady but flexible beat. And like Marc Johnson on the two Morricone albums, the bassist on this album, Salvatore Maiore, has a resonant tone, plays fluid supporting lines, and his solos are well worth the listening. Im delighted to have met up with this fine trio. I will almost certainly be listening to more albums by them in the near future.This album was recorded in April 2014 at the Torino Jazz Festival but the sound quality doesnt suffer a bit: it is crystal clear.Oh, one more difference!  There is no overlap at all in the songs recorded on the two albums.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRCP3DXBCUE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVJ97FE#wasThisHelpful","R2WRCP3DXBCUE7","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here is the absolutely brilliant pianist Igor Levit on playing variations: I regard variations as travel books, accounts of journeys ... of people who set off on their journey as one person but are ... someone else by the time they arrive at their destination. The quicker the change and the higher the frequency, the better. I need this. I need these colorful and varied characters.""Variations  arent something you get tired of, partly because you dont have time to grow used to them as they move from one approach to the next in minutes sometimes less than a minuteoffering vividly contrasting refigurings of basic themes. This collection illustrates the appeal of this form with bells on, coupling the familiar but challenging Goldberg Variations of Bach (originally composed for harpsichord but legitimated for piano as well since Glen Goulds masterful 1955 recording of them) with the almost equally well known variations on a waltz of Diabelli by Beethoven and the virtually unknown modernist suite, The People United Will Never Be Defeated!, thirty-six variations on a 1970s Chilean revolutionary song. The Goldberg Variations ride over a persistent bass line, and include numbers composed according to the strictest canonic methods. Beethoven has fun tearing apart and reconfiguring what was originally a hackneyed melody composed by composer and publisher Anton Diabelli: the result is virtuoso music with lots of jokes hidden in it. The Rzewski piece is as idiosyncratic as its composer, who studied with such legends as Milton Babbitt and Roger Sessions, performed live improvises music on synthesizer in the 1970s with avant garde jazz men Anthony Braxton and Steve Lacy, and has made a name for himself over more than four decades for his difficult-to-categorize demanding-to-play compositions. What strikes you in listening to Rzewskis variations is their lack of thematic unity: they keep coming back to the simple melody but from radically different directions. This recording includes the occasional whistle and shout, and the slamming of fists or something else on wood, as well as the playing of piano keys, and the piano styles range from flowing lyrical to heavy sparse block chords. Its difficult to write about it without making it seem unpleasant to listen to but thats not true: it is fascinating to listen to. It doesnt feel uncomfortable, just different.  And difference here, especially following almost two hours of listening to Bach and then Beethoven, comes across as a recorded history of modern piano music, going back to its mid-eighteenth-century roots and coming up to the fragmented, feet-going-many-ways-at-one time present.As to Levits playing, what can I say? He plays here with the same skill and fervor as on his earlier recordings of the Bach partitas and the later Beethoven sonatas, which is to say, no one around today does it better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD8P7V72YKB9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128ZEVDG#wasThisHelpful","RD8P7V72YKB9K","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TRIFONOV, Daniil, p.; Phila Orch., Yannick Nezet-Seguin, cond.Trifonov plays these variations with the fiery skill of a youngster but the seasoned judgment of the mature professional. Its hard to imagine a pianist today who would be a better match for these works both in precision of playing and emotional sensitivity. The recording comprises three sets of variations by Rachmaninov: variations on a theme by Paganini for piano and orchestra and on themes by Chopin and Corelli for solo piano. The variations on Paganini are fireworks stuff, less unified than the later variations on Corelli but also probably more demanding to play. The ever-competent Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Yannick Nezet-Seguin, is an ideal partner for the young piano virtuoso on this music and Trifonovs playing is gorgeous. The album includes a short suitesix pieces- Rachmaniana, written as homage by Trifonov himself.  Everything on this album excites.

"This is the second time that Linda Wallheim, loving wife of Kurt, the Mormon ward bishop of Draper, Utah, has gotten tangled up in a case involving murder. The first case was detailed in The Bishops Wife, which was praised by Janet Maslin in the New York Times but panned by a handful of Amazon readers who self-identified as Mormons. Behind their complaints about a boring story or pedestrian prose, the principal complaint seems to have been that Mormons wouldnt express the views that are voiced by Linda --theyre not Mormon enough. But the author is definitely not a dummy: she holds a Ph. D. in German literature from Princeton, not a bad school at all, and lives (Mormon) in Utah with her (Mormon) husband and five (Mormon) children. Its a little like criticizing Scientology: if you do it in print, you better expect to get I wasnt certain Id  enjoy this book when I requested it for review. But I was intrigued by the Mormon background and interested in the dilemma encased in it. A man is killed, the wards second counselor, an important lay position in the Mormon church hierarchy. But it turns out he was a woman. Twenty some years before, hed crossed, had reconstructive surgery and took hormone treatment to make him a man. Hed buried his past, married and his wife and he had adopted two children, now in their teens. As ward bishop, it falls to Kurt, Lindas husband, to deal with this case, which would potentially require the resealing of every covenant in which the dead man had been involved. What follows describes the reactions and attitudes of a notoriously conservative religious group as its members deal with both a murder and the news of the mans transgendering. In the process, you learn that opinion in the Mormon church isnt a monolithic block: attitudes have changed in the church and probably will continue to change, though at a slow pace.I liked the book a lot. The narrative isnt flashy but the story is solid and the characters seemed both true and interesting. I didnt want to put the book down once Id started it. Linda in particular is a gem. Though shes a dutiful wife and a devoted church member, she hasnt lost her capacity to think critically, shes competent and determined, and her domesticity and devoutness, when combined with her willingness to think outside the box, makes her utterly appealing. As a detective, shes so-so, more of a witness than a solver of riddles, but that too seems sensible. In her role, we shouldnt expect a Sherlock Holmes, inspector Maigret or Steve Carella. But she is so grounded, and such an attractive character, that she makes you think better of this religion which sometimes seems so alien to the people outside it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PBCZTWXU6SV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616956100#wasThisHelpful","R1PBCZTWXU6SV5","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Donald Hall, U. S. poet laureate from 2006 to 2007, is proof that poetry can be rigorously crafted without loss of accessibility. Hall is one of a small number of poets, confessional in nature one thinks of Lowell, Plath, Sexton, Snodgrasswho draws on his own history to produce lovely, textured poems, often quite short in length. In his respect for physical labor (lovely reminiscences of his farmer grandfather) and for perceived and felt nature (plants, animals, landscape, his dead wifes flower beds, the activity around her now abandoned hummingbird feeder) and his feeling for times changes (a recurring motif in his poems), he reminds me of several other of my favorite contemporary poets: Philip Levine, David Ignatow, Haydn Carruth, B. H. Fairchild are a few that come to mind. Reading selections from a lifetimes writing like this makes clear Halls enduring preoccupations: time, the cycle of growth and decay, the virtue and pleasure of working with ones hands, natures seductions, but also how we f**k up our own lives by bad choices, anger at a venal and self-important world, and near then end, the lovely, mournful, agonized poems about his poet- wife Jane Kenyons agonizing battle against leukemia, her death, his loss and his memories. The first poem in the book (My Son My Executioner) is about holding his infant son in his hands. It ends: We twenty-five and twenty-two, / Who seemed to live forever, / Observe enduring life in you / And start to die together. The second poem is about a four=year-old Donald Hall looking out the window of his house at the countryside, waiting for a giant, a sleeping giant, to wrench himself out of the earth and walk around. The giant doesnt come. Summer ends and school began, / And winter pulled a sheet over his head. Snow covers a hillside but also a four-year-olds fantasy  will die. Not all of these poems work for me. (Woolworths is an example and {The Snow strikes me as trivial, just a wordworkers conceit.) But most do, and the best ones are very very fine. An example, and another instance of his preoccupation with the cycles of living and dying, is Digging, twenty-five lines long, which starts about the pleasure of the act of digging in the earth and ends talking about being in the earth and new things growing out of the remains of old. Best of all for me are the memory poems. Walking back from his grandparents farm by the side of a horse (named Riley), then another time riding back on a wagon after helping his grandfather gather the hay:My skin dried in the sun. WindCaught me in clover.The slow rideBack to the barn. I dangledLegs over split-pole railsWhile my grandfather talked foreverIn a voice that wrapped me aroundWith love that asked for nothing.In my room I drank well waterThat whitened the sides of a tumblerAnd coolness gathered like darkInside my stomach.in a voice that wrapped me around with love. I like that line!If you already own a number of Halls books, you may not want to buy this one. But its inexpensive, he selected the poems himself, and reading them in one flow helps fix in your mind just what kind of a poet Donald Hall has been and what were his preoccupations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQ3DUF8F1MB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544555600#wasThisHelpful","R3LQ3DUF8F1MB5","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With his new novel, Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits, just on the bookshelves, its a good time to look back on David Wongs first novel, John Dies at the End (2012), a stoned-out-slackers-face-off-against-totally-awesome-other-dimensional-alien-invaders comedy so deranged that it spawned an indie movie which is just as deranged, only shorter. (Film scripts run a hundred pages, the book to 466, plus a preface.) To start with, David Wong isnt David Wong. Hes an on-line blogger-humorist named Jason Pargin, and David Wong is his nom de plume, or is it cle? Wong composed this tale on line, then an indie press published it (more or less) and then a mainline publisher, St. Martins, picked it up and it proved a raging success, outselling even Gone with the Wind no, I made that up, the last part, not all of it. And then an indie film maker, Don Coscarelli, made a movie out of it same title- and the film even has Paul Giamatti in it.

Oh, yes!  A meat monster, arms made of game hens and country bacon, with sausage fingers and a roast turkey head, and a flying mustache and colorless wingless flies that burrow into your flesh and try to k ill you.

"ZIMERMAN, Krystian.  Lutoslawski: Piano Concerto; Symphony no. 2.. Deutsche Grammophon. 2015.  $14.69. KZ, p; Berliner Philharmoniker, cond. Simon Rattle.This album, part of DGs Polska Music program, features a piano concerto and a symphony by the Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski (1913-1994). I have had to rely on the album notes for background information. Lutoslawski apparently heard a John Cage concerto for piano and orchestra on Polish radio in 1960 and it made him realize that I could compose music differently from that of the past. What he picked up from Cage was the radical notion that music can use random processes and still be music. His first major orchestral work after that epiphany was the symphony performed on this recording, Symphony no. 2.  The symphony is composed of separate motif blocks which follow but do not directly build on the previous blocks that have been played. The musicians playing in any particular section determine the pace. No beat is prescribed. The conductor is relegated to marking the beginning and ending of the section, which is identified by the notes assigned to the soloist in that particular section. The effect is of a series of harmonic clouds rising up, hanging in the air for a while, with occasional eruptions of sound, and over it an instrument or instruments playing something like a melody but not firmly anchored, and certainly not to an overarching theme. The symphony has only two movements, labeled Hesitant and Direct. Halfway through Direct, regular rhythm kicks in. The effect is startling and is amplified by the pyrotechnics of the orchestra.  Lutoslawski composed the piano concerto in 1988. I dont know how to describe it except to say, one, that it beards affinity to the piano concertos of Bartok and Prokofiev, and, two, that it requires a virtuosic soloist, which Zimerman clearly is. I cant say that I will play this album often but the compositions are interesting ones, the performances superb, and I left listening to the album with my pulse raised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YQE8HRPZ5HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5RRBV8#wasThisHelpful","R35YQE8HRPZ5HV","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gabriel (professor of philosophy at the University of Bonn) has tried to do one of the hardest tasks around for a serious academic: write a serious book on a complicated topic but in a style that will prove attractive to (intelligent) non-academics as well as his peers in his own specialized field of study, which on the basis of this book and references to his earlier published work, seems to be ontology, the puzzling out of existence: of what does it consist, why is it  His intent is to show that previous approaches to the question mislead us, or at best, provide partial (and still misleading) answers. This is not an easy subject to explain simply, much less popularize, but Gabriel has made a yeomans effort at doing it, and for that, he deserves kudos.  He labels his philosophical stance New Realism, by which he means two things. 1.  that we can know things in (for?) themselves, that perceptions and thoughts are not automatically illusions; and 2. That things, facts in themselves *(as opposed to perceptions of facts) do not fall in (belong to) one single domain of objects (and thats it for you, Spinoza!). The argument by which he proves this is long and complicated, and takes on many other philosophers and philosophies. I did not find it sufficiently rigorous to convince me but the problem may be me, not the book in this case. I felt at times that Gabriel was building further proof on the grounds of statements hed made, not proved. I may easily be wrong, but that doesnt change that I found his proof muddy and hard to follow. When I read Bernhard Williams, for instance, or Isaiah Berlin or Thomas Nagel or Eric Dodds on the irrational and Greek thought or Martha Nussbaum on moral luck, I dont have this problem: its work reading them but I leave convinced of their reasoning and in Gabriels case, Im not, even though I generally agree with his position.  What hes saying, if I have it straight, is that different parts of the world organize in different ways, using different organizing principles and criteria, thus creating what may appear to be mutually exclusive orderings of meaning: you dont find beauty next to science, nor an actual physical creature next to a troll or hippogriff, but all of these things/qualities exist just in different parts of what we can know. My biggest objection to this otherwise acceptable book is the authors too frequent attempts to make it hip by referring to artifacts of contemporary culture movies and television shows a lot. These references will inevitably date the book, no matter how relevant they seem today. Though he says many good things in his chapter on The Meaning of Religion, I found the overarching argument in the chapter fuzzy. Still, his main point is well stated: religion is, or should be, more about why things are than what they are, and rule-bound religion is the wrong path to take. So ultimately, religion is one of the ways we situate and try to remake (improve) ourselves. (At this point, he writes a lovely sentence: No one is simply a self in the way that a stone remains a stone.) The concluding chapters on the meaning of art and on what television shows us about ourselves did little for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8229X4UFKBWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745687563#wasThisHelpful","R8229X4UFKBWG","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pat Metheny, guit, comp, arr; Eberhard Weber (taped), elec b; Jan Garbarek, sx; Gary Burton, vib; Scott Colley, b; Danny Gottlieb, dr; Paul McCandless, reed; Manfred Schoof, tpt; SWR Big Band, Helge Sunde, cond.This recording contains most but not all of the music performed at a concert in Stuttgart this January commemorating the remarkable music of bassist-composer Eberhard Weber. Since a stroke eight years ago, Weber has not been able to play his chosen instrument, an electric upright bass he designed that has an additional string added to it.  (He also played less frequently cello and acoustic bass and dabbled on the synthesizer.) Weber was there this night, though, both in person and musically interwoven in the music were taped solos and backings recorded by Weber prior to his infirmity and on a huge screen behind the orchestra played video tapes of Weber as the concert unrolled.The roster of assembled talents was impressive. The great Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek improvised on tenor over a solo tape of Weber (electric bass and synthesizer) that was released on his album, Resume.  Guitarist Pat Metheny composed a long suite (Hommage) based on improvisations by Weber: the 31 minute long piece featured the SWR Band conducted by Helge Sunde, with solos by Weber (on tape), Metheny, vibist Gary Burton, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Danny Gottlieb. Gary Burton and euphonium player Ernst Hutter soloed on Touch, one of my favorites cuts from Webers Colours, the brilliant quietly revolutionary quartet he led in the early seventies. (Touch is on the album Yellow Fields.)  Burton along with Oregons Paul McCandless soloed on Maurizius, from Webers album, Later That Evening. (McCandless was on that recording too.) Burton and McCandless were up again for Tubingen, from Encore, and Burton, McCandless and alto player Klaus Graf soloed on the final cut, Notes After an Evening, from Pendulum.All told it was a highly satisfying outing but I have some reservations. The SWR Band is a killer ensemble and the arrangements for the night were rich, full, and for the most part, sensitive to the music being performed. (Michael Gibbs arranged Touch.)  But I missed the small group feel of (most of ) Webers performances, the tight, close interplay of a small number of instruments conspiring together in inspired, almost ecstatic communion to create a truly extraordinary music.  It showed too when the soloists entered. Garbarek, with his piercing, almost strident, vibrato-less tenor sax sound, could ride over the ensemble with no less of definition but that wasnt true of the softer voiced instruments of Metheny, Burton and McCandless. You could still follow them, they still played well, but I missed the chance to hone in on them, undistracted by the sound around them. Secondly, Methenys long Hommage, as musical collages often do, tacks from one piece to another not always with the tightest musical logic. The parts are good but the composition over all lacks coherence. Theres one musician still alive I would have liked to hear play this music. His sound was integral in Colours. That is pianist-keyboardist Rainer Bruninghaus, but his last jazz CD listing is from 2001.Dont be put off from buying this album by my quibbling. Over all, it is a fine album not essential, but anyone who loves Webers playing and compositions like I do will want to buy it. You wont be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WVDP89QUSBQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DCFVUG#wasThisHelpful","R1WVDP89QUSBQX","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I.Band feeling is more important than bravura.II.Less is more.III.How fast can you play slower?IV.A beat is not always what you think it is.Four dicta from the quietly revolutionary Norwegian drummer Jon Christensen. From 1974 through 1998, he had appeared on more than fifty ECM records, playing with some of the most important and influential jazz musicians in Europe (and the States too). This ECM sampler, issued in 2004, displays his work on nine pieces, with six different groups and eight albums. He plays with pianist Keith Jarrett, tenor saxist and Garbarek and  bassist Palle Danielsson in Jarretts European quartet, three songs from two albums. (The best is still My Song, from Belonging.) In duet and quartet with 12-string guitarist Ralph Towner. (Both cuts are from Solstice, a fine album. Bassist Eberhard Weber and Garbarek make up the quartet cut.) With electric guitarist Terje Rypdal and trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. A trio with Arild Andersen on bass. The Bobo Stenson trio, Anders Jormin on bass. Another Rypdal group. Throughout Christensens drumming is impeccable subtle, ever changing, implying the beat as often as stating it, with the rhythm coming in waves rather than in strict count all the time. His range of effects is wide and his sense of dynamics profound. And, as stated above, the musicians he plays with are among the best in the business.This is not a flawless collection. I have reservations about it.  1. I wish they had included a cut from Eberhard Webers group Colours, preferably Touch or Sand Glass. I know of no other recording on which Christensen plays so subtly and insinuatingly, with no pyrotechnics.  2.  Which leads me to my second reservation, Pyrotechnics. I suppose you cant issue a collection of pieces by a drummer without emphasizing his solo work but solos dont show off Christensen at his best and the presence of them on this album overbalances it. Christensen, like Weber, with whom he played for a while, shows off best in ensemble, never pushing but always there and subtly (notice how often I have used the word subtle in this review?) reshaping the ensemble music. My last reservation? 3. A couple of the pieces seem New Age-ey to me, kind of Jazz Exceptionally Well Done But . Lite nonetheless. I say that even of the Keith Jarrett quartet pieces: My Song is wonderful but the other two pieces dont make it for me. And Ive never much cared for Terje Rypdal.Having said that, and wishing to make it clear that everything in this album is good and some of it extraordinarily good. Im glad I bought it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R366YVO1YRNT13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000ZOT20#wasThisHelpful","R366YVO1YRNT13","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I greatly admired the three previous books by Mary Gaitskill that Ive read: she writes evocatively, plots clearly and by the end of one of her fictions you feel like you know its inhabitants. You feel for them too. The protagonists of her stories have complicated lives. They dont lead easy lives and they feel conflicting emotions. She is a master storyteller. But in her previous writings at least the ones Ive read her observations have seemed to me distanced, not written  --felt, rather-- inside the characters. Thats not easy to argue because she really does delve deeply into the psyches of her characters but Ive always felt that she is more the observer than a partisan. I guess Im saying I find her writing perceptive, even emotionally fulfilling, but I dont find it nor the authorial personality that lies behind itwarm. Hot (= strong emotions), yes. Warm (= caring and involved), no.Until this novel, that is. The Mare has all of Gaitskills signal excellences especially her observations of how imperfect people relate to reach other, the subterfuges they employ to keep from being exposed as what they know they really are, which is damaged goods, and the stratagems they use to hold themselves together. But as well as that, it has heart. You feel that Gaitskill really cares about her subjects and the result is that you care about them as well. The story is told in short alternating chapters, some no more than a paragraph or two long, by a series of narrators but mostly two. The one, the most important one, the one you care for most, root for, is an eleven-year-old, Velveteen Vargas, who travels up state to spend a few weeks as a Fresh Air Fund kid with Ginger and Paul. The rest of the time she lives in Brooklyn with her volatile, abusive mother and her little brother. Velvet is brown and Ginger and Paul are white no one could appear more white in Velvets eyes than blond-haired Ginger, who glows with a sort of radiance around Velvet and dispenses advice to her that may work well in her world but doesnt in Velvets much more dangerous one. Gingers past seems always about to creep up on her:  she was an addict and abused woman in the not too distant past before Paul found and rescued her. Too much stress in any part of their life and it could come unraveled. She quickly grows to care deeplyabout Velvets life too but at bottom, really Velvet is her lifeline. When Velvet falls in love with horses she is a natural with them-- Ginger champions her dreams of competition riding.Theres more to it than this: the horse Velvet rides is damaged too, its face scarred by past abuse; Velvets mother, Silvia, is abusive and often mean but behind all her hurt, shes loving and strong; Paul has to deal with a wife whos drifting out of control, her fantasy life about Velvet taking over and shoving out their own relationship. The ending is positive but not pollyanesque. Velvet gains something permanent maybe, its not surefrom the experience. Everyone moves on with their lives but by this point, the book ends. Its like life: you deal with each part as it happens.Its difficult to write about a book this rich without simplifying the story, and the messages it gives, too much. Suffice it to say it is rich and very rewarding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X02RAMT7CJNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307379744#wasThisHelpful","R1X02RAMT7CJNJ","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my eighth album by Italian pianist Pieranunzi and all of them are good most excellent. This is the first solo album I have acquired by him, though, and its exceptional, sui generis in form and effect. Seven of the fifteen cuts (all recorded live in a Basel jazz club in 2013) feature works by the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu (d. 1959). Heres an example of how Pieranunzi approaches the Czech composers music. He announces to the audience that Martinu loved jazz; he then plays Martinus Prelude en forme de blues straight, and follows it with his own blues based on Martinus melody. Thats the general format of this lovely, alternately pensive and joyful album: classical pieces played straight, followed by jazz or jazz-y improvisations on the themes. All in all, Pieranunzi plays seven pieces by Martinu, two by Domenico Scarlatti, one by Handel and one by around them. An interesting note: on his trio recordings, what comes across strongest is the strong affinity between Pieranunzis playing and that of the great Bill Evans the same preoccupation with voicing and subtle harmonic modulations, much the same rhythm sense. Here playing alone with no bass or drum supportone notices older roots: a tendency, for instance, to break out in stride as he rolls out an improvisation on a classical piece. Its especially noticeable in the two Scarlatti pieces (a Scarlatti sonata followed by Pieranunzis Visions). Its not wholly surprising: the rhythm pulse in Scarlattis compositions is less supple than a jazz beat but no less noticeable.  The approach Pieranunzi has taken on this album isnt a common one. I remember the first time I heard it done. It was on a Bud Powell recording from the late fifties Bud! The Amazing Bud Powell, vol. 3 (1957) and the number was Bud on Bach, a Bach piano exercise, a solfeggietto, done straight and then transmogrified into a rolling blues. It worked then and it still works now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AHPU4K0DZRWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC0JST8#wasThisHelpful","R1AHPU4K0DZRWV","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The format of this lovely debut work is that of a novel within a novel. Poxl West writes a memoir depicting his days in the RAF during World War II, the only Jew to fly a bomber against the Germans. His book gets generally positive reviews. Its a modest bestseller. In Tordays book, between passages from this novel, Poxls nephew not a blood relation, more a tie of sympathytells his story: his warm relations with uncle Poxl and his pride when Poxls book appears, his reaction to the later news that his uncle made the story up. Both narratives end with resolutions: Poxl comes to term with his troubled past, the nephew with his conflicted feelings toward his uncle. As much as anything, Poxls cross was that he couldnt get his story accepted unless he made it into a biography: so he wrote it that way, melding stories he heard in pilot training with his own personally lived experiences. At the heart of this novel is a great love story  --Poxl realizes that he missed his one great chance for happiness when he was too young to know what he was doing. But you never know for sure whether that was a real happening or a made up story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FWO6Q0RASTR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250051681#wasThisHelpful","R3FWO6Q0RASTR7","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An Englishman, touching thirty, is discontented with his life and his job. Back home, he teaches literature to schoolchildren who are bored when he reads to them from George Eliot and couldnt care less who John Donne was. On a summer trip to Cambodia, he frequents a casino and wins big --$2000. He decides to stay there, at least until his newfound wealth runs out. He runs into another expatriate, an older, somewhat louche American. The young mans driver says the Americans bad, stay away from him, hell hurt you but theres something alluring about the man. The Englishman accepts an offer to dinner at the Americans house, ends up staying the night with him and the beautiful prostitute who is the Americans lover. Some food, alcohol, drugs, and when he wakes up the next morning from a drugged sleep, hes on the river on a riverboat. His backpack is gone, as are his money and his passport, and hes wearing strange clothes. Hes not completely broke: after the American had stripped him of his goods, he put a $100 bill in his pocket. But until he does something about it --perhaps a trip to the consulate-- he has been stripped of identity. Hes No Man, no longer Some One. He takes this as a sign. Henceforth, he will remake his life, starting with his name, living as an outsider in this very alien land. Thus starts this moody, twisty adventure. It doesnt have a sad ending, it doesnt have a happy ending, it just ends --inconclusively, like much of life is. This disconcerting novel has powerful antecedents: intentionally or not, in tone and theme it reminds one of a Paul Bowles novel, though set in Cambodia not Morocco, and that is a good thing. Osborne is an adept writer who here has created a slow building but ultimately gripping half-horror story about the perils of drifting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R266LY4ZS904VM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553447343#wasThisHelpful","R266LY4ZS904VM","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I reviewed Mallons Watergate when it came out in 2012 and loved it. Finale, focusing mainly on the second term of the maddeningly elusive Reagan, is in many ways a counterpart to the more overtly robust account of the final years of that not-much-lamented president, number 37 in our country, Tricky Dick Nixon. No one would ever call Reagan Tricky Ron. Fog would be a more apt nickname he was, even to those closest to him (even his wife Nancy) maddeningly elusive, warm and fatherly on screen but  . removed, I suppose is the term, off camera, the presidential equivalent of Oakland as when Gertrude Stein wrote of that city, Theres no there there. (What would you think of a president who confessed he preferred reenacting baseball games from wire copy after the game had ended to narrating them live, in the middle of the action: things seem more real once theyre in the past, he says.)Watergate was a tragedy for our government but the people who brought it to us were such buffoons, it played it as a comedy. Finale plays more as parlor drama, nothing raucous, with inte4se maneuverings for the intangibles of power and influence, and at the center of it, a neurotic lesser movie star who somehow won the Gold Ring by marrying a hack actor who turned out to play perfectly to an audience as long as he didnt really have to engage them or understand what was asked of him.Mallon is an exceptionally engaging author with a gift for political gossip. The novel mixes real and made up characters with glee and aplomb. The real ones do exactly what we know they did by reading the papers. The made up ones fill in the cracks, providing Mallon with entre to the parts of history well never know because they never made it to the history books. The result is a work of fiction so infused with fact as to glisten with authenticity but as work of creative fiction nonetheless. This is not to say that some of Mallons choices are free of question: in particular, his portrait of Reagan embraces the questionable accusations of Kitty Kelly and the presidents disgruntled former chief of staff Don Regan, who had a definite axe to grind in his characterization of the president. Still, its chilling to think that we twice elected a president who was so disconnected from political reality. And I havent yet written a word about Nancys dependence on astrologer Joan Quigley, which is Hollywood, not Washington, D.C. (or it shouldnt have been).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGFURSVZSNM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307907929#wasThisHelpful","R2TGFURSVZSNM1","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hero of this exceptional first novel isnt Jack Reacher, 6 5, 230 pounds and roaming the country because post-military, he finds he cant stand to be confined to routine. But it comes as close as anything Ive read recently, and its a d**ned good story with a d**ned good hero. Peter Ash is a veteran of two tours eight years a lieutenantin Iraq and Afghanistan. Hes home now but left with white static, a panic reaction that overwhelms when hes inside a confined space. So he spends most of his life outdoors now. He hears that his sergeant, Jimmy, has killed himself and he heads east to Minnesota to help Jimmys widow: he cons her into believing theres a government-funded program to do home repairs on veterans houses. Then he discovers, under her porch, a vicious dog kind of a pit bull on steroidsa bag of cash --$400,000and four sticks of plastique explosive.  He doesnt start out to save the world but his code of ethics, the Marine corps code, wont let him walk away from his former partners widow and things grow steadily gummier. A lot of violence follows. There are truly scary bad guys involved and one super villain who is incredibly skeezy but there are also some good guys, most of whom unfortunately dont make it out alive. The action rolls along at a fast clip, the tension builds steadily, and it all ends in a satisfying and reasonably realistic rollout. This is the second novel Ive read right now that simply begs for a sequel. Ash is an appealing hero and the information about PTSD is right on the mark.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MUCPNR59MDQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174567#wasThisHelpful","R2MUCPNR59MDQ5","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people swallow their grief. Some let it swallow them. Thus starts novel # 22 by acclaimed thriller author Reed Farrell Coleman, three time recipient of the Shamus Award, winner of the Barry and Anthony awards, and three time Edgar nominee. And with it  I devoutly hope- the start of a new series. Because, boy, is it good! Gus Murphy is an ex-cop, checked out of his career as a detective because when his teenage son John Jr. collapsed on a basketball court, laid low by an unexpected aortic failure, Gus lost not only his son but his marriage (she wound up in bed with one of his cop partners), his daughter (living out of control, on drugs and alcohol) his career, and any semblance of meaning or happiness in his life. Now he drives a customer service van, picks up people at a second-rate Long Island airport and brings them back to a third-rate motel, and helps out on weekends at the motel complex as a bouncer in its seedy lounge. His life is over. Over, that is, until low level ex-bad guy Tommy Delcamino shows up, asking for his help: Tommys son, another lowlife, has been found dead, his body abused and tortured, and Tommy, in a last burst of fatherly feeling, wants to find out why. He had gone to the cops first but they havent even interviewed possible witnesses: another low life, another skel dead? Who cares? Good riddance! As to private eyes, al they want is to string Tommy along, billing him by the hour until his money --$3000- runs out. Gus is all that us left. Hed been a reasonably effective cop, no genius, but low life or not, hed treated Tommy with respect and other cops hadnt. Gus says no. Hes too deep in his own grief. But then a cop, a former colleague, warns him off investigating what happened to Tommy Jr., and then a second, and a third, and the word goers out that Gus is radioactive poison in his former department.  And then the bereaving father, Tommy, winds up dead. Somethings going on. And slowly, in incremental steps, Gus wakes up.  Once awake, hes a bulldog for the truth.  Want he finds, at great personal risk, is a conspiracy that spirals higher and higher up into the police department he formerly cherished. He never, never gives up. This is an exceptionally well plotted crime thriller that will please anyone who loves craft, suspense, and good writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGCZRQJSD2F3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039917303X#wasThisHelpful","RXGCZRQJSD2F3","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But all that it consists of is a plot outline for a never produced television series about 007 and four or five hundred words describing Bonds meeting of 007 spymaster Bill Tanner and M at the Secret Service headquarters. Thats it. As for plot, this installment presents three adventures in sequence: a brush with death leaves Pussy Galore (remember her? Lesbian merc to hetero sex by the great James himself?) out of action; a Grand Prix auto race, with Bond intervening to save the (British) racing champ from a flaming death at the hands of a SMERSH operative; and, the main course, Bond facing off against a Korean millionaire, Jason Sin, who really doesnt care which side wins as long as he gets to off lots of people along the way. As usual, there are recorded in loving detail the appurtenances of excessively good living the smoked salmon was good, if cut a little too close to the skin, it was followed by excellent lamb cutlets from a local farm, cooked to a pink, the vegetables were also local, and the wine had a deep, ruby colour and scent of blackberries. Etc., etc., for three hundred some pages.  And there is the special knowledge of spies and assassins: Bond disarms a security guard at Sins mansion-palace with the Japanese Strangle, rendering him unconscious but not killing him. Little bits like these come across as so finicky and precise as to produce giggles if not yawns. And there is the basic problem with this mediocre dull book: its a dead man walking. Old routines are served new but theyre seen from the outside, not felt from within. If you suffer from insomnia, maybe youll want to read this book because it will put you to sleep. Otherwise, forget it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1BJ9LPC1QWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062395106#wasThisHelpful","R2V1BJ9LPC1QWF","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Baumans second novel. (His first was And the Word Was [2006].)  But in many ways, its like a first novel. Its sometimes derivative, other times fresh and original. Its not wholly in balance and sometimes its irritatingly pretentious, but for all that, its fresh and bold and not all the time but more often than not a pleasurable read. The novel is large scale. It spans eighty years from the 1940s to the 2020s-- and it touches on avant garde art and music, the rock and roll life, drugs and sex of course but also politics in our new media- and publicity-driven age, and not least, insanity, Jews, Nazis and punks. It reminded me at times of Thomas Pynchons first big novel, V.  There are the joke-ey names: Moses Teumer, his mother Salome Savant and half-brother Alchemy, who is lead singer of a punk group called The Insatiables, and Ricky McFinn, aka Ambitious Mindswallow, bass player for The Insatiables and Keith Richards to Alchemys Mick Jagger. There is the over the top plot and picaresque overtones, and not too deeply buried, hints and nudges of grander social, psychological, esthetic and philosophical messages. So yes, this is an experimental-slash-postmodernist novel, not as much so as, say, the writings of George Saunders, David Markson or Ben Marcus, but Baumans got the chops. This long, loopy history is presented in alternating narratives by or about Alchemy, Moses, Salome, and Ambitious, with the addition of a letter from Mosess unrepentant and utterly repellent Nazi father Malcolm. In his narratives, Ambitious proves entertaining but the songs of the half-mad, nearly always ecstatic Salome are a drag to read for long: overwritten is the word that comes to mind. I dissolved into a southern gentrified inebriation, like ice in an old Virginia mint julep on a sweltering July afternoon. What do you make of a passage like that? And thats the way Salome talks all the time. Nor did I enjoy the made up rock song lyrics that cluttered the pages and in my judgmentslowed down the action too often.  Over all, Broken Sleep is a worthy effort but it is successful only in fits and starts. I wish I could be more enthusiastic about it because I think it took intelligence and courage to write it, but I have reservations about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7Q5A2KDF6Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590514483#wasThisHelpful","R1P7Q5A2KDF6Y9","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This double album is a reissue of two albums recorded by the trio of pianist Pieranunzi, bassist Johnson and drummer Baron in 2001 and 2002. The album has been augmented with two tunes, Musashi and Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, which were captured live in concert in Tokyo in 2004. Morricone has written music for more than 500 movies so it is no surprise that many of the compositions performed here are new to me but Il Clan dei Siciliani rang a bell. So there it is twenty-five songs on twenty-four cuts, five songs penned by Pieranunzi, eighteen by the master of film music, Ennio Morricone. Two things distinguish this fine offering: the exceptional playing of the three musicians mature, comfortable with each other and totally in sync; and the exceptionally fine compositions of both Morricone and the pianist, which blend seamlessly from song to song, making the album(s) almost a suite.First there are the musicians. All three possess formidable chops technique poses no obstacle in their playing and all three produce a lovely sound.By this point in his long playing history, Pieranunzi has pretty much assimilated the bop and post bop that preceded him, creating a style that makes a passing bow to Bill Evans (especially in voicings) but is just exciting, mixing chorded passages and single note. Johnson, as befits someone who played with Evans for four years (his last bassist) has formidable technique, [plays a lot in the higher, more mobile ranges of his bass but has a deeper, woodier sound than either of his most famous predecessors with Evans, Scott LaFaro or Eddie Gomez. As to Baron, it was fun for me listening to him so soon after spending time on Pieranunzis 2010 album Live at the Village Vanguard. The drummer on that album (which is a killer) was Paul Motian in one of his last recorded outings. The difference is immediately noticeable. Motian intruded more, a louder drum sound, more off-beat passages, where Baron is a consummate timekeeper.  I dont mean by this to demean Barons art at all but he blends into the music so well that it is easier to ignore him great playing but rather than standing out, it just makes the music seem right.The composers. Pieranunzi isnt the only jazz musician in Europe today who is captivated by film music. (Pieranunzi also plays a Nino Rota composition from La Dolce Vitaon the live album.) Theres Enrico Rava, Tomasz Stanko, Marcin Wasilewski, and I have the feeling somewhere but I cant remember where Giorgio Gaslini. Theres a reason why: film scores are made to capture mood, evoke emotion, create the aural equivalent of personalities, and in all these respects, good film music is a natural for the jazz musician whose playing is also meant to evoke mood and music (the personalities part Im less sure about). Morricones songs range widely in tempo, feeling, and thus lend variety to an album that honoring a composer of more restricted range, might have been a bit monotonous good for one or two cuts, but twenty-five in a row? As to Pieranunzis originals, they complement Morricones without a break in flow or mood. One of them, Waltz for a Future Movie, is probably the most beautiful piece on the album but it has competitors in the beauty business for this is a truly lovely, lyrical album with much fine music on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z4Z867D05WO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKM5O42#wasThisHelpful","R2Z4Z867D05WO7","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recorded in 2006, this duet album by Italian trumpeter Enrico Rava and his younger contemporary pianist Bollani, is both first rate jazz and near perfect mood music. Bollani has been praised for not using superfluous notes in his playing but this doesnt mean that he doesnt play a lot of notes his technique is almost classical and it is formidable!but that he doesnt waste what he plays. Everything fits. Whether he is accompanying the trumpeter, folding alt lines around his horn, or soloing on his own, everything he plays is a pleasure to listen to. Rava, too, is a master. Possessed of flexible technique and ravishingly beautiful, often near melancholic sound, he steps inside these mostly moody pieces the samba Estate, a Jobim piece, Retrato em Branco y Preto (Portrait in Black and White) played twice over, a lovely ballad by Brazilian composer-instrumentalist Moacir Santos, one composition by Bollani and the rest by Rava everything fits together in this sound suite. Can melancholy not be a sad feeling sometimes? Because thats what this music is like sunshine over mood.

"Sometimes Young Adult doesnt mean much more than that the hero is young in this case, fifteen. As to the story, it can be as straightforward as an adult thriller. Certainly, this one is. Its the second YA novel by novelist Smith about a young climber, Peak Marcello, fifteen years old now and the of world famous climbers, although mother and father are no longer a thing. In Peak, he helped scale Everest, handing over his chance to fame as the youngest cilmber to scale that mountain to his sherpas grandson Siun-jo. This time, climbing as part of the International Peace Ascent, two hundred youths from all over the world, simultaneously scaling the most formidable mountains in the world. Peak, and his mother, whos eager to climb again, are in Afghanistan. Peaks representing the United States and the whole extravaganza is going to be aired on television on Christmas day. Except that things go wrong, seriously wrong. Theres a kidnapping, dead bodies, and the next thing you know, Peak and his ally Ethan, an ex-military type possessed of an intriguing bag of skills, are tracking the kidnappers across Afghani mountain ranges. They find them and deal with them, without recourse to impossible coincidence or unnatural abilities and in the end, all is well in this thriller that is terse, efficient and satisfying.  Peak is an appealing hero and he never appears older than his age. But neither does he appear younger and think back on it, fifteen-year-olds can be chillingly competent when they need to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R161A0TEONGYWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544341228#wasThisHelpful","R161A0TEONGYWG","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are so many good things to say about The Swans of Fifth Avenue that its hard to know where to start. If youve seen either of the last decades movies about Truman Capote (Capote, 2005, with Philip Seymour Hoffman, or Infamous, 2006, with Toby Jones), you know the story: diminutive utterly gay writer with an oversized drive to be recognized woos and wins over his swans, the richest and most glamorous of socialite ladies in New York: Babe Paley, Slim Keith, Gloria Guinness, C. Z. Guest and Pamela Churchill. He was closest with Babe, whom he nicknamed Bobolink. Even her overtly masculine and none too sensitive husband, Bill Paley, founder and chief executive of Columbia Broadcasting Systems, was won over by him. After writing a number of elegant trifles (think, Breakfast at Tiffanys), Truman finally wrote one great book, his non-fiction novel In Cold Blood, about two drifters killing of the Clutter family in cold, bleak Kansas. That was it for Truman. He never again worked up the discipline energy to write anything serious, preferring instead to be a media presence. He hosted the party of the decade in 1966, his black and white ball at the Plaza honoring Washington Post publisher Kay Graham: he hinted to countless friends that he would invite them but then cut them from the list without a warning. And since he leaked the guest list to the media, they couldnt even pretend theyd been invited but had chosen not to attend. Nine years later, running out of excuses for not publishing anything, he sold Esquire a second-rate fictional retelling of the gossip hed picked up in confidence from his Swans under the title La Cote Basque and when his lady friends learned of it he hadnt warned them or asked permission to describe them in prosethey cut him off cold. His life ran down. Its hard to judge his later years as other but the unconscious attempt of a desperately unhappy man to kill himself, only slowly by drugs, booze and haphazard sex encounters. As to the swans, Babe Paley died young 63 years oldin 1978: lung cancer. The other swans? They grew old, saw themselves displaced in the public eye by a newer, younger, wilder generation.Its a heck of a story and tailor made for a novel. There are, after all, the conversations between Truman and his admirers, all held in confidence, and thats what the writers of historical fiction do: they fill in the gaps in the public record with guesses as to what went on that respect the subjects and feel like theyre right to the reader.What distinguishes Benjamins book are 1. humanity and 2. perspective. As much or more than this is a book about Truman, its about his betrayed friends, the five swans, or more properly, the one with whom he was closest, the beautiful and ever elegant Babe Paley. This isnt Benjamins first attempt at capturing the unseen side of a noted womans life: her earlier novel, The Aviators Wife, achieved much the same thing for Anne Morrow Lindbergh, with the same mixture of perspicuity and sympathy. And, in this book, she does it without ignoring or slighting the vacuity of these womens cosseted but ultimately empty (and unhappy) lives. There is a wonderful and revealing passage halfway through the book in which Babe Paley, restless because Truman is busy elsewhere (perhaps he doesnt care for her as much any more?) decides to throw caution to the winds and go out on the town with no prior preparation or warning to the parties involved in dealing with her once shes out there. She gathers up her friend Slim Keith, who is short on cash following an acrimonious divorce, and takes her to Bergdorfs to buy her some lingerie. Its her gift to her. But they leave the house in a chauffeured limousine, the CBS crest on its side, and get off right in front of Bergdorfs, leaving it to the driver to handle such messy details as where to park it. The stores manager greets them as soon as they come through the door, apologizes for the absence of Babes personal shopper, who has the day off, and hovers around them nervously, very visibly aware that if he displeases her he could lose his job, just like that. They sweep through the store to a private dressing room, where the clerks bring them merchandise to try on. When theyre done and ready6 to leave, their limousine is miraculously waiting by the door and their packages have been wrapped in Bergdorfs trademark pink paper. As they drive off, headed for another shopping mecca, Babe says to Slim that Its fun, sometimes, pretending. Pretending what? Theyre always protected, cossetted, but at the same time, never truly free. Husbands rule this world, not their wives, who devote their days to pleasing them, always groomed and coiffed to appear desirable, or if, as with Babes husband, if their husbands no longer desire them, still to appear a desirable acquisition to the world looking on.Marriage is for money in this world and husbands are necessary but inherently damaged, rutting goods.  Thats where Truman got his opening. He could talk to these ladies. He didnt lie to them. Yes, he was outrageously funny, always ready with a new scandal to relate or a naught bon mot that skewered not these ladies, but6 other s they knew. But what won them over to him was that he really looked at them and really listened to them, and his conversation might be artificial but it wasnt false. Dozens of people a day told Babe Paley how beautiful she was. But she really believed it only when Truman did. Then too, Trumans past resonated to these lost ladies especially to Babe- who didnt remember her father and had never felt truly valued for herself by her mother. Trumans hurt was hers too.So here we have it, a novel rich in incident and character, filled with glittering presences. It could have been a chatty Jacqueline Susan novel. It isnt. Its a novel about people and the felt cost of their upscale lives, and its a good one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IOP99NP2O2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345528697#wasThisHelpful","R29IOP99NP2O2D","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw Scott Coopers Black Mass yesterday. I wanted to see it for several reasons: my interest in the gangster movie genre and my interest in the actors, plus I had recently reviewed an account of Whitey Bulgers trial. I had read some of the reviews of the movie, which tended toward guardedly negative so I went wondering how the movie would hit me. My reaction? Guardedly negative.Lets get the elephant out of the room first. Its no Goodfellas but then neither are most movies, regardless of genre. The level of directing, acting and cinematography in that brilliant movie, its fizzing energy but also the coherence of its convoluted storyline and the interiority the feeling youre inside itof that groundbreaking movie its unfair to expect that every gangster movie coming out could replicate that. This one certainly doesnt but for interesting reasons.For all the violence that occurs in this movie (Whitey Bulger was a truly violent man and arguably psychopathic), everything in the movie the action, your take on the characters, even the story line as it unfolds in flashbacks from informant interviewsis distant: you feel removed, not involved, in it as it occurs. Thats especially true of the figure of Bulger himself: Depp is apparently being touted for an Oscar nomination but the only reason I can figure for that is that hes a star, and of course, hes copped out by playing one-dimensional freaks for so long now: Willy Wonka, Pirate Jack, even Sweeney Todd. Its a long time since he electrified the screen with a series of startlingly original but believable three-dimensionalcharacter roles in Gilbert Grape, Edward Scissorshand, Ed Wood, Donnie Brasco. In recent years, hes pretty much phoned it in on all his roles: kinks but nothing behind them. So the prospect of Depp investing himself in a role again was exciting. How does he do in this one? Hes adequate. But you never get inside him: hes an icon of crime, not a flesh and blood player. For all hes called on to do, or chose to do, they could have used his embalmed corpse with little difference to the effect on the movie.( Maybe he needs to do his next movie with no or minimal makeup.)By comparison, Benedict Cumberbach, as Bulgers politician brother, Billy, comes across as real and human, and so do some of the other characters: Joel Edgerton, as the FBI agent John Connolly, who becomes Bulgers dupe, and David Harbour, as John Morris, Connollys accomplice in protecting Bulger and deceiving the Bureau, are first rate. So too are many of the supporting actors, Julianne Nicholson as Connollys wife, Rory Cochrane, W. Earl Brown (always good in movies!), and Jesse Plemons as Bulgers loathsome crew members, Peter Sarsgaard in a cameo as a drugged out informant, soon dead at BUlgers hands. The one major actor who disappoints in a supporting role is Kevin Bacon, who plays Connollys skeptical supervisor in the Bureau: Bacon is too accomplished a movie actor to bomb in the role but he too pretty much phones it in its acting as coasting. (One player who does come across as vibrant and real is the city: south side Boston in the 70s and 80s. Its beautifully presented.)The story presents itself in flashbacks, seen between brief scenes of one or another of Bulgers accomplices turning States evidence against him in desperate attempts to keep their own necks on their heads.  Theres a lot of violence but little heart behind it I know I said its unfair to expect every big gangster movie to be another Goodfellas, but I cant ignore that as violent as that movie was, the violence was directly directlytied to emotions. It was player-driven rather than plot-imposed. Well, that doesnt come across in this movie.Im still waiting for Johnny Depps redemption as an actor because his best (= earlier) work was brilliant. But it hasnt happened yet. I hope he doesnt waste the rest of his career playing grotesque surfaces with no insides to them. Still, it isnt Depp that kills this movie. Its script and direction. You cant film this kind of story from the outside: you need to drag the movie viewer in.It didnt happen this time. At least not for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UML9KGQ7YTGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015JR14FI#wasThisHelpful","R3UML9KGQ7YTGW","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He was considered one of the greatest composers of Brazilian popular music, especially the genre of choro. Ive heard enough Brazilian music to know what choro sounds like but had never read a description of it: while it can range in tempo and mood, it is often a fast, happy music, full of syncopation and counterpoint, and leaves ample space for virtuosity, interplay and improvisation. Sounds a bit like jazz, doesnt it?This album of choro is mandolinist De Holandas homage to Pixinguinha and its difficult to imagine a better one. Most of the album is duets: de Holanda with jazz musicians: pianists Chucho Valdes, Stefano Bollani, accordionist Richard Galliano, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis; duets with pianists Id not heard before: Laginha, Sosa, Mehmari. The album starts with de Holanda solo; it ends with a delightful trio rendition flute, tenor sax and mandolinof Pixinguinhas Carinhoso. Throughout the playing is satisfying and rich, joyous and cooperative. Many of these players are heavy hitters in their own right but they submerge their egos in this gently and intellectually and musically satisfying collaboration. There are differences: Chucho Valdess playing brings a distinctly Cuban flavor to his two pieces where Stefano Bollanis contributions sound more classical: chamber music with Bollani providing backing and counterlines to the ever busy but always tasteful de Holanda on mandolin.This isnt jazz music but music into which elements of jazz fit well, adding zest and another kind of complexity to already zestful, intricately complex music. This album is the second to be issued this year that blend these two attractive musics so well. The other is guitarist Romero Lubambos solo outing, Setembro, on which I commented a week or two back.

"TH, tpt, flglhrn; Mark Turner, ten sx; Ugonna Okegwo, b; Adam Cruz, dr.You expect a good ride from a Tom Harrell album. He knows his instruments trumpet mainly, but also flugelhorn-- backwards and forwards, in solo has a musical imagination as nimble as his exemplary technique, and, a creative composer and arranger, her spends serious effort crafting good song vehicles for his ensembles to play. And in his latest album, recorded toward the end of last year, what an ensemble it is! There is no saxophonist recording today who plays as consistently well as Mark Turner. His Warne Marsh-influenced tenor fits perfectly with Harrells smooth yet urgent trumpet playing: it is a particularly good pairing on those cuts in this album where Harrell plays flugelhorn, with its softer, fuzzier plangent sound. They fit together like hand and glove. The rhythm section bassist Okegwa and drummer Cruzare equally attuned to the music. This is a group that knows how to play together. Both bassist and drummer are superb in ensemble. If I am less enamored of their solo spots, its not because theyre bad, just not as well integrated into the song (Cruzs solo on Harrells tricky Cycle, for instance, is first rate but could fit into almost any up tempo piece it isnt integral to the tune being played) or clearly innovative (Okegwa). These are small potatoes reservations about a uniformly superior album, though. The twelve compositions are all by Harrell. Six of them form a suite about Don Quixote which is quite interesting. The other six are standalone compositions. The melodies are good, Harrell does interesting things with the arranging for the ensemble parts, and all the players not only understand the music, they groove to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21R3A18Y3JWIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM9IWGM#wasThisHelpful","R21R3A18Y3JWIP","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those We Left Behind is a crime novel, and a very good one, but it is equally a novel about the concatenating effects of abuse: parents abandoning children, the children bounced around foster homes, the younger one overly dependent on the elder, whose rage leads him to escalating acts of violence. It starts with biting he bites his brother, not himself moves to bullying another child, their latest foster parents son, and then inciting his younger brother to murder: the younger brother is convicted of killing the foster parent, bashing him to death, blood all over the place. But was that what happened? Its not at all clear it was. Yes, Ciaran, not twelve, confessed to the murder. He testified that he did it alone to protect his older brother, Thomas, from the mans abuse.  But if Thomas had done it, hed have been put away as an adult for a long, long sentence where as a minor, Ciarans sentence was shorter --and Thomass too as accomplice instead of killer.Ciarans out now with eight years served. Hes twenty years old now but still a child inside, and hes still utterly, helplessly dependent on his older brother for direction and support. The cop who put him away has doubts about Ciarans guilt. With him out again, she wants to question him: to find out what really happened that night. But she carries baggage too. She has just returned to the force after a hard battle with breast cancer. The scars it left on her arent only outside. She doesnt feel like a full woman yet and her husband isnt treating her like one. Theres a probation officer too. She too has problems in the past but theyre not fully stated or resolved in the course of the narration. All you know is that she likes her alcohol. Around these two women circle other cops, some keen to right wrongs, others putting in their time, reluctant to have their former judgment questioned.Ciarans released, Thomas is there, his dominance over his younger brother is back in place, seemingly unshaken. Ciaran will do whatever Thomas tells him to do. Terrible things follow as a consequence: there is a beating, then a murder, then much more blood and terror.  On the side, the detective confronts a second, completely separate mystery: the seeming suicide-murder of an elderly couple, both desperately ill in different ways. The pace quickens. Nemesis hovers nearby to claim her victims.Neville has been nominated for the Edgar award for at least one previous novel and has been a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; he won two awards for best first crime novel and was finalist for three more. Its clear why on the basis of this fine novel. Its been interesting to me to watch the arrival of a spate of fine crime and detective novels from the nether parts of the United Kingdom: north Ireland and Scotland. They have common characteristics, which contrast in interesting ways with the many fine Scandinavian crime novels now on the market. I am obviously being over reductionist in what I am now going to say, but I think theres some truth in it:  like the Scandinavian crime stories (Larsen, Persson, Nesbo, and Mankell are examples), the novels feature policemen instead of private investigators, but unlike their Scandinavian peers, the police work that is done is much more a private, single individual affair (not police procedural in form) and though there is as much social commentary in these novels as in the better known Scandinavian ones, it is presented more as observed detail than as excursus digressions from the narrative.  The result is a prose that is gritty and nervy and propels you along the path to the inevitable confrontation, which is usually violent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81EWE2ROU49O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616956364#wasThisHelpful","R81EWE2ROU49O","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like only yesterday when Finch (The Laws of Murder, 2014) brought forth his first Victorian era murder mystery, featuring amateur detective Charles Lenox and his sweet, elegant, formidably capable soon-to-be wife Lady Jane. And here he is now is the ninth book in this estimable series, in a tangled story that is as intriguing and delightful to read as the first one was. After a spell in Parliament, Charles has returned to full-time detecting, this time as a profession: hes partner in his own agency with his former protg, Lord Dallington, and a formidable lady detective, Polly Buchanan, who handles womens issues --stolen silver, vanished fiances, that sort of thing, under the pseudonym of Miss Strickland. After the defection of their former partner Lemaitre, the three are looking for ways to promote business. A success helping Scotland Yard would go a along way to keeping the ink in their ledger black instead of red. As usual in these books, Lenox juggles two very different cases in this installment. One is big. A German pianist goes missing after a concert: no one knows how he even got out of his dressing room, much less why he is gone. Thats the Scotland Yard case.  But more time is spent in the country, at brother Edmunds estate in Sussex, where he is approached by a local gentleman to solve the puzzling case of a strange woman or was it girl?spied in an upstairs window, a missing bottle of sherry. That case conflates with another odd happening: thefts at the village market where two missing chickens, four shillings in change, a half wheelbarrow of carrots, a springer spaniel, some blankets and a cloak, a box of candles, and another chicken have gone missing. Then theres an attack on the town mayor, who is left near death, and the stakes rise. Of course, Charles solves them all: the small potatoes thefts in Sussex, the woman in the window and the missing bottle of sherry, the attack on the mayor, but also the missing pianist in London. The search for answers is intriguing from start to finish, Charles and his family, friends and allies are easy to care about, and the local (and historical) color is lovingly depicted. This is a firstrate series and this installment, which shows no sign of flagging energy, is firstrate as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y1QIK1DQFTLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250070414#wasThisHelpful","R1Y1QIK1DQFTLT","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dont like The Long Siesta as much as I did Sweets previous noir novel, Flowers at Midnight, (2012) but its a respectable effort. The setting is Seville, 1998. The protagonist, Inspector Jefe Velazquez, is lead inspector in the city homicide division. Hes also a junkie. Hes been addicted ever since a spooky pair of hoods, Bill and the Black Lady, abducted him and hooked him up. So along with trying to solve a mystery, a succession of killings starting with two priests, and dealing with a side concern, the Russian mobs abduction of his bullfighter girlfriend, he stops every once in a while to shoot up, alternating illegal heroin and legal methadone. The murders pile up, the mob boss wants him to find and deliver a mysterious LaserDisc, to get it he has to get a Russian prostitute away from her bosses and back to her homeland boyfriend, and behind it all he continues with his efforts to find out why the priests were killed and whats going on that is leading to a veritable crime epidemic in his normally sleepy bailiwick. The style is Raymond Chandler, and the dialogue abounds in touches of dialect, a slightly skewed mix of English English and Spanish slang. The action moves along crisply though not always convincingly. In the end, Velazquez solves the mystery, the killer is apprehended and the inspector is reunited with his girlfriend. But Velazquez is still a junkie and he hasnt yet learned who Bill and the Black Lady really are. Is it the hook for a sequel?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28L0S015TXLRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ZRNHC2#wasThisHelpful","R28L0S015TXLRZ","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Minute zero is the moment of chaos that follows crisis: if you are ready to step in then, you have a brief opportunity to reshuffle the deck in your nations favor before the situation stabilizes and rigidifies anew. Theres an election pending in Zimbabwe: an aging dictator is being propped up by a vicious general but for the first time in decades he is vulnerable. A personable, able and honest woman lawyer is running against him. If all else were equal  --read that to mean if if the elections were being run fairly and the incumbent werent willing to declare the election results void and declare a state of emergency if the results go against himshed win handily. But things arent equal and if something isnt done, the country faces more years of corruption and oppression. This is the second novel featuring policy analyst Judd Ryker, who now heads a small free-wheeling unit within the State Department whose mission is to assist in dealing with crisis in countries that are destabilizing. In The Golden Hour, he headed off a crisis in Mali, assisted by his agronomist wife Jessica and a few other allies. They return in this installment to manage impending crisis in Zimbabwe. As Rykers mentor told him years before when he was headed towards a career as an academic rather than policy wonk: you dont manage crisis, you ride it. Its like whitewater rafting. You dont control the flow of events, you just try to ride them out, giving your vessel a nudge now and then to secure a favorable outcome. Minute Zero is a crisp, well written thriller. The author, formerly deputy assistant secretary of state under G. W, Bush, obviously knows the world he writes about: his charge at the State Department was the Bureau of African Affairs, where he was responsible for diplomatic relations with sixteen West African countries. Judd Ryker and his super-competent wife Jessica are attractive characters, as are many of the peripheral Good Guys. The Bad Guys? Well, theyre satisfyingly bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNVOSFS9Q941B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168680#wasThisHelpful","RNVOSFS9Q941B","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Supersymmetry is a welcome addition to the ranks of hard science science fiction, in this case, revolving around some of the newer hypotheses of subatomic physics Higgs particles, indeterminate reality, teleportation and a kind of time travel, and, oh yes, an extra-terrestrial intelligence extra-universal, actuallythat wants to replace weak humans maybe with something neater, maybe just with itself.The invader comes from one of the alternate universes that hover alongside our own. The Kelleys daughters Sandra and Kelley, physicist father Jasonhave fought the creature fifteen years before. They dubbed it the varcolac, a Romanian term for a demon that lives on the other side of the mirror. That battle was recorded in an earlier novel, Superposition, which was released earlier this year. One of the consequences of that struggle, not resolved until Jacob shut down the supercollider from which the creature was drawing power, was the splitting of his daughter Alessandra into separated twins, Sandra and Alex. Ever since they have been developing their own personalities, going their separate ways: Sandras a policewoman now and Alex is a physicist. Alex works on a below the radar project to develop superweapons for our armed forces. The scientist in charge of it is a neurotic, almost psychotic physics nerd named Ryan Oronzi. He has brought into existence a universe of his own, a bubble universe, which he monitors in his lab through computer simulation. The problem is that with the emergence of this alt-universe there also emerges, again, the varcolac and though Ryan doesnt know it, it is controlling him. From that point on, all sorts of increasingly dire things happen, including a baseball stadium exploding or did it implode?the varcolac invading a demonstration of the new military technology and taking over the Secretary of Defenses body, a second invasion at a funeral for Sandras and Alexs father, but is he dead?a mass assault on high security prison and the escape of a genius killer, and a shootout showdown between US military and varcolac-possessed Turks that segues to the systematic bombing of the major cities of the world in reverse order of their population. (If they get that far, New York will be thirty-fifth.) How do you reverse such destruction? And how do you stop a near-invulnerable super-intelligence that isnt hampered by the confines of physical flesh from taking over the world? And, lastly, will Sandra and Alex stay separate or lose their new found individuality through reunion in one body and mind a second time? Near the end, the math and physics get a bit hairy but theres enough adventure and even a bit of romance to carry it through in what is a successful return to days of high science but also high adventure science fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCYEW4G34E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880982#wasThisHelpful","R3LCYEW4G34E1","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Verve; orig. Impulse. 2007; orig. 1961.  ON, comp, arr, ten sx; Eric Dolphy, bss clari, alto sx; Freddie Hubbard, tpt; Bill Evans, p; Paul Chambers, b; Roy Haynes, dr.Composer-arranger-sax player Oliver Nelsons The Blues and the Abstract Truth is one of the gems of the mid-60s. Its not a great classic, though it comes close to it, but its one of those albums that is so well conceived and executed --the arrangements and the playingthat you keep coming back to it to listen.  Its fifty-four years now since the album was recorded. The only player still alive from it is drummer Roy Haynes, who still plays as hard and well at age 90 as at 20 or 30 or 40.The great player on the session was Dolphy: for this session, he left behind his most distinctive axe, the bass clarinet, but he was just as accomplished and distinctive on alto and flute. Fifty-four years later, his entrances to his solos on this album still astound. He may not have revolutionized the playing of his instruments as much as, say, had his confreres Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane, but the importance and stature of his achievement has become increasingly clear with the passage of time (and the 2014 release of two albums, Aki Takase and Alexander von Schlippenbachs So Long, Eric! and Russ Johnsons Still Out to Lunch: Dolphy deployed his technical mastery of his three horns to expand and solidify bop playing, still tied to the changes but freed from constraints  of rhythm and tonality. On flute, an instrument that usually bores me to death, only James Newton has come to close to matching him for technical artistry and forcefulness. Trumpet player Hubbard was on a roll back then: though nowhere as modernist as either of the group leaders, he played in the two great double quartet experiments of that age, Ornette Colemans Free Jazz in 1960 and Coltranes Ascension in 1965. Add to that sessions with countless other musicians, including Dolphy, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson and Andrew Hill, and his modernist credentials were well established. His sol work on this album is on a par with his work on other albums of the day: driving and fluid but not longer quite as new as it seemed back then. The weakest of the three horns is Nelson. Its common to say that Nelson played arrangers horn, and its true. Its also not an insult because though his solo work broke no new ground, it fit well into his own tunes and he was a good contrast to the fierier and definitely more innovative Dolphy. The other giants on this album were pianist Evans and Roy Haynes on drums. (Chambers was a more than competent bassist and especially good at propelling a group along.) This outing is one of Evanss less exciting ones: his solo passages are solid but never take off. Reading Peter Pettingers biography of Evans (Bill Evans: How My Heart Sings, 1988) it is evident that this was one of the down periods for Evans, whose addiction and physical woes were wearing him down.  Haynes is perfect for this group: his drumming is so right and so infectious and subtly driving that it could wake up a corpse.What of Nelsons compositions and his arrangements of them? The most familiar, and most haunting, is Stolen Moments, which was recorded by the Young Turk super group Roots  (Arthur Blythe, Chico Freeman, Sam Rivers, Don Pullen et al.) on its 2005 album Stablemates and by United Future Organization on the combined hip hop and jazz collection, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool (1994). But Hoedown and Cascades are effective pieces which provoke the horns to exciting solo work, Yearnin and Teenies Blues are tricky blues takeoffs (listen to Dolphys left-field entrance on alto on Teenies Blues!) and Butch and Blue is a good boppish piece.I held off getting this album on CD for years because I already had it on vinyl.  Im glad I changed my mind. This album is too good to leave sitting in storage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14PSLT7XI06RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VS6OXS#wasThisHelpful","R14PSLT7XI06RU","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Twenty-four novels in and Sue Graftons chronicle of the adventures of private investigator Kinsey Milhone is still as fresh and engrossing as ever! What makes these novels work without reader fatigue? For one thing, theres Kinsey. She is a wonderful creation, one of the best fictional depictions of a P.I. in the business. Kinseys no Wonder Woman. She has no special talents exotic martial arts or whateverjust brains, common sense and doggedness, a super work ethic, and an appreciation of people which, if it doesnt help in solving cases, makes her appealing to the reader. Shes also very human: shes loyal to her friends, shes a bit stingy, definitely not fashion conscious, and her easting habits are atrocious (although who doesnt secretly love fatty, unhealthy food?). In this installment, Kinsey juggles three investigations. First, the widow of a former colleague asks her to look through her dead husbands extraordinarily messy files (he was a P.I. too but in Kinseys mind, a crooked one) to help her with an upcoming audit by the IRS. Kinsey discovers, hidden in a carton beneath a false bottom unexplained objects among them a sheet of paper with a string of four digit numbers on it. One of her friends loves ciphers he figures it out: its a cipher, a substitution code using the typewriter QWERTY keyboard as its base: 1 is for Q, 2 for W, 3 for E, and so on. Decoded, its a list of womens names, six of them. Kinsey investigates and the menace ratchets steadily up. Second, Kinsey takes a low budget job: find the address of a newly released con for his mother, who abandoned him at birth and now wants to make up for it. But matters soon go south in this case as well and soon Kinsey is pursuing a true puzzle: whats going on here and why? Lastly, new neighbors move next door to Kinsey and her octogenarian and friend landlord Henry and theyre the neighbors from Hell. Something is seriously amiss about them. Henrys too nice to do anything about it except be taken advantage of so its up to Kinsey to deal with this problem too.  It would be sinful to tell you what happens from this point on. Suffice it to say that this is one of the best installments in an exceptional series of detective novels. I dont know what Im going to do when Grafton runs out of letters to use.(I bought this novel for my wife, who loves the Kinsey Milhone stories. She had been going through a dry spell: no book she started kept her interest all the way through. I gave her this book and a day and a half later, she had finished it.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z567X4VRR6N0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399163840#wasThisHelpful","R2Z567X4VRR6N0","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Saul Black is the pseudonym for Glen Duncan, author of one of the best werewolf novel one of the few good ones --of recent years, 2012s The Last Werewolf. To all appearances this is his first published crime novel and its just as good as his werewolf book, which is to say, gripping. Pick it up and you wont want to put it down. A widow, still young, living alone with her two young children, finds two strange men in her house.  Soon blood is everywhere. Her ten-year-old daughter is pursued but escapes, but at a cost. She holes up with a neighbor nearby: he cant move because his sciatica has flared up and shes suffering from hypothermia and has a broken ankle, perhaps even more breaks in her bones elsewhere. The killers leave her behind and move on to more kills elsewhere. A San Francisco homicide detective is pursuing them but doesnt know who they are or where theyre based: the killings are all over the map. Whats common about them is the act. In each case, seven in all now, a young woman is abducted, tortured and mutilated before being killed, and in some cases raped. The DNA and fingerprints show that two men are involved, and theres always an extraneous object inserted somewhere into the victims body a candy apple, a balloon, a hammer, one time a large pottery goose is shoved into the eviscerated torso of a victim. The search for the killers is destroying the detectives life she drinks too much, has nightmares. Three years earlier, her obsession with a similar case had destroyed her romance with another detective. She still longs for him. Now, out of nowhere, he returns, another complication in her running-down life. Theres another killing, the eighth. But there are still no clues. The detective doubles down, watches surveillance tapes of the scene of one of the abductions. She finds something, possibly a photo one of the killers. Thats the first clue. Soon a second comes, then a third. Theres another abduction, but this one is reported early enough that the girl may still be alive. The manhunt is on. In alternating chapters, we follow the killers, the young girl hiding with a neighbor, the kidnapped woman, and the detectives, as events race toward the bloody climax. Along the way, we learn why the killers are killing stands for. I like thrillers and this one is a standout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS82S9UCO1PW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057345#wasThisHelpful","RS82S9UCO1PW2","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The list of stars who passed through Hollywood agent Sue Mengerss hands at one time or another in the 70s would knock your socks off: Streisand heads the list, but theres Christopher Walken and Gene Hackman, Ryan ONeal, Ali McGraw, Candice Bergen, Faye Dunaway, and Michael Caine. For a decade, she had the magical touch. She was even profiled on Sixty Minutes, the first time a theatrical agent had ever received such notice.She never lost her touch completely but from the 80s on, her career gradually subsided. Part of it was changes in the way movies were put together now bean counting had replaced talent scouting. Part of it was age to the powers that be who controlled so much of Hollywood film making, Sue was simply no longer young enough. Part of it, though, was the result of missteps as a talent manager.  Her premiere client, and she thought a friend, Barbra Streisand left in 1982 after the disastrous mishandling of the release of the movie All Night Long. (Barbra did okay in the film but the movie bombed and Sue wasnt sympathetic to Barbras issues any longer.)  Several other clients drifted away in the years to follow, some concerned about results, others alienated by her pushiness. Her career ended in disappointment: in 1988 she was brought back as senior vice president to revive a moribund William Morris agency but she could no longer able the goods. Increasingly an anachronism, she was pushed out of the agency within two years.  She was 58 and she would live to 79. . She spent the remaining years hosting high profile parties at her Hollywood home, hanging out with a coven of Hollywood female friends, the Dyke-ettes, traveling to Europe with her husband Jean-Claude Tramont (reluctantly, very reluctantly, for she never liked leaving L.A.), and proferring advice, sometimes asked for and sometimes not, to her show biz friends and colleagues. She outlived Jean-Claude by fifteen years.Kellow (Pauline Kael: A Life in the Dark, and biographies of Ethel Merman and Eileen Farrell) is a sympathetic and conscientious chronicler and the list of interviewees with whom he met to write this book is mindboggling. But however admirable Sue was, theres something cold and repellent about her climb to fame and the way she managed it after she arrived at the top. Her friends loved her but friends dropped off the table with almost clocklike regularity and once off, she was cold, cold, cold. Somewhere in this book, one of the people being interviewed captures it: Sue was a narcissist, with all the insecurity and capacity to manipulate people for her own ends that the diagnosis implies, but as long as you didnt rock her boat, she could be a charming and supportive friend just not one you could trust if you crossed her. She was loud, often lewd, and boy was she pushy, but for a decade at least, people felt they needed to be around her. Because she had the magical touch.On April 24, 2013, Bette Midler opened on Broadway in a one-woman play about Mengers: Ill Eat You Last: A Chat with Sue Mengers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHB0PCYLWMHJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670015407#wasThisHelpful","RHB0PCYLWMHJM","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TS, tpt, flglhrn; Tim Warfield, sop, ten sx; Bruce Barth, p; Peter Washington, b; Dana Hall, dr.This album has everything going for it, first-rate musicians, pianist Barths simple but well crafted arrangements, and great, great songs from the pen of Duke Ellingtons alter ego, master songster Billy Strayhorn. Some of the songs are readily recognizable. Raincheck kicks off the album and Johnny Come lately (which starts with an intriguing rephrasing of the melody, fragmenting it into repeated blasts of notes from trumpeter Stafford and saxist Warfield) ends it. Between are the two lush emotive ballads, Lush Life and Daydream, done in quartet with the sax dropping out. Lush Life in particular is exceptionally well done. Having sung the song, I can testify how hard it is to negotiate the twists and turns in it without sounding false but Stafford does it: straight them statement by the horn, then a lightly swinging piano solo by Barth, then back to Staffords trumpet (or is it flugelhorn? I cant tell) for the chance to improvise. Its very tasty, without a single wrong step.  The next tune up is Multicolored Blue: Stafford plays it with mute, adding to the Ellingtonian quality, and the start of Warfields tenor solo evokes Ellington too not Ben Webster but perhaps one of the later players in the band, Harold Ashby? Paul Gonsalves? (Ashby more than Gonsalves.) The other tunes are equally enjoyable: Smada, My Little Brown Book, U.M.M.G (originally played by Dizzy on Ellingtons Jazz Party album),  Lana Turner. All in all, it is hard to conceive of a tastier, more enjoyable album.

"BENNETT, Tony.  Sings the Ultimate American Songbook, vol. I.  Columbia. 2007.  TB, voc, with.

Its mostly good stuff no, fine stuffwith a few exceptions. The best cuts are with Ralph Sharon, his musical director for who knows how many years, either his trio or an orchestra. The worst are (1) a duet on Moonglow with k. d. lang which doesnt ignite more importantly, it doesnt showcase langs unique talent as an interpreter of songs, and (2) a cut with the Mitch Miller Orchestra backing Tony up. The problem with the latter is that Miller was a hack who fit every song into the same cookie cutter mold.  Tonys voice is gorgeous and his ability to interpret songs so high that Miller doesnt ruin the cut, but a Ralph Sharon Mitch Miller certainly wasnt. There is one other hitch on the album, a cut labeled as performed with the Dave Brubeck Quartet, including Paul Desmond. It must be a mislabeling to the best of my knowledge Brubeck never recorded with a guitar player, and if he had, it would have been with someone like jim Hall, who wouldnt have produced such bland chording behind the piano, and there is no alto sax, and thus no Desmond on the cut either.  For that matter, the drummer doesnt match up with what I know of Joe Morello either.

"I bought this album when it first came out, vinyl of course, and almost wore it out I played it so much. I cant take a turntable along with me in the car and I listen to music there, so Ive started to buy albums I loved years ago on CD this one, Willie Nelsons Stardust, Dinah Washingtons For Those in Love, with the Quincy jones band.This album is close to perfect, two in-tune artists performing unencumbered by anyone elses sounds and performing a repertoire of classic American ballads plus Evanss best known song, Waltz for Debbie. Intimate and sensitive are the words for it. Lyrical. Never above gentle up in tempo, muted dynamics. (Well, somewhat muted. Bennetts is a big, rich voice and he uses it as needed to make musical points.) The joining of these two artists wasnt an automatic thing: Bennetts musical sensitivities dont match totally with Evanss and Bennett sometimes slows down the release of phrases for dramatic effect where Evans would likely have pushed on with them. But they did what great artists should do: listened to each other and accommodated gloriously. No one could modulate background chords better than Evans. He could be and was here a consummate accompanist. The result is fifty-some minutes of flowing, lyric, magical song celebrating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQOCD4TGNWC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J233MG#wasThisHelpful","R3VQOCD4TGNWC0","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The group is first-rate, as good as you could get at the time, which is saying a lot. Rava possesses a ravishing sound: his playing is reminiscent of Miles Davis before electronics, but stronger and much more fluent he rips through the 1 minute 52 second-long Surprise Hotel.  His playing throughout is fine, lyrical and moody with burst of savagery as change of pace. Guitarist Abercrombie the perfect partner for a trumpeter like Rava: hes a fine soloist but responsive and pliable in backing, where he produces a range of sounds up to and including guitar synthesizer. (There is some discrete overdubbing on some of the later cuts.) Danielsson and Christensen are among the finest modernists on their instruments in all of jazz, not just jazz in Europe. Its an ECM album with all the quality of sound you expect from that label, and the music played slotting in somewhere between lyrical-modern and film noir, with touches of post-bopis the type of music you expect from an ECM album of that decade.

English (The Westies, Whiteys Payback) is well situated to write it. Its his seventh true crime book and the third to deal directly with Irish-American criminals. This book is about the trial of Bulger for multiple murders (twenty in all) accomplished over many years. The trial lasted two months --June 12-August 12- and ended with Bulgers conviction for eleven out of the twenty murders. The verdict was hailed by the FBI and the Department of Justice as a triumph for the American justice system.  It had taken decades but one of Americas most ruthless and repugnant criminals had finally been taken down. But English asked at what cost? For, English claims with relatively convincing evidence, the government made its case at great cost, giving a pass to other monsters as heinous as Bulger in order to nail him. Even worse, the prosecution carefully limited the case to hide evidence of decades of corrupt practice in the handling of top echelon informers, Bulger included, which had led to the wrongful imprisonment of innocent men (the decades-long jailing of Joe Salvati), a free pass on murdering other hoods, and the exchange of information and money between cops and crooks. English argues that Bulger got what he deserved out of the trial but the American public did not: trial information was carefully cosmeticized to hide evidence of systematic, decades-long wrongdoing of government law officials.A strength of the book is Englishs personal contacts with the Boston crime figures involved with Bulger. He knows them, meets them for cookouts and dinners out, but doesnt try to romanticize them. He knows they lived still live in some casesin a violent world, but their testimony provides him insights into Bulgers world. Not surprisingly, Bulger, his lawyers and the prosecutors all declined to meet with Engiish. The result is a book that presents a pretty convincing case for Englishs thesis but relies of necessity on uncorroborated testimony, and English is the first to admit that the men he is talking to are masters at manipulating perception. There is much of interest in this book. It could have benefited from a rewrite: some assertions are made too often, the testimony presented in the order it appeared in the trialcould use a re-summation. But for the most part, this is a lively telling of a fascinating trial. As to Bulger, even in a world of slimy creatures like the ones depicted her, Bulger emerges as particularly repellent. And scary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6D9BD7M65J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062290983#wasThisHelpful","R1D6D9BD7M65J8","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sweet Caress is another in a long string of wholly engaging novels written by Boyd, who has won honors in the past for several of his books. The characteristics of a Boyd novel are that they are elegantly written and intricately plotted and the people who pass through the their pages are out of the ordinary, even, in the case of Amory Clay, strong willed and determined to lead her own life her own way, regardless of the many and sometimes painful pratfalls she takes en route through her long, rich life. Amory is the heroine of this book, and a very engaging one.  You could claim she doesthat her life started out wrong footed: the [London] Times announcement of her birth informed readers that Beverley and Wilfreda Clay had given birth to a son, Amory, on March 7, 1908. Amorys life played out that ambiguity. She turned down college to become a photographer, was on (or at least near) the front line during the Great War, took photographs on the sly of a den of extreme iniquity in Weimar Germany and when she displayed them in a photo exhibit, was hauled into court on charges of obscenity, and lost both her case and the photos and proof sheets. And on and on, though a life filled with drama, and backing and forwarding, through the between war years, on into WWII and much later Viet Nam, and includes passionate love, violent war, and trying to be a good mother to her two twins who have wills of their own.  It may seem like I am revealing too much of what happens in this fine novel but I havent. Amorys is a complicated life but once you start hearing her talk, you wont want to put this book down. And there will be surprises.Readers who have read others novels by Boyd may notice similarities between this novel and his The New Confessions (1988). That novel recounts the life and career of James Todd, a forgotten filmmaker, whose final project was a five-hour, three-screen version of Rousseaus Confessions. Unfortunately for Todd, his masterpiece appeared in the theaters just as talkies arrived and quickly sunk into obscurity. Amory Clay has the same passion for her art as did Todd, and again its a visual art, and though she has more success in her life than Todd did, Amorys projects also run up against the vagaries of history and they dont always make it through intact.Boyd is an elegant writer but hes an interesting one too. When I reviewed The New Cpnfessions years ago, I wrote that it was sparking with ideas. Sparking, not sparkling. The intensity of Amorys involvement with people and events fizzes with energy. And as are many of Boyds protagonists, Amory is strong, durable, human and admirable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDW3QXL2VQ0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632863324#wasThisHelpful","R2GDW3QXL2VQ0G","A3R9HPWFF9QWSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9HPWFF9QWSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think providing a sizing kit like this is very helpful, as I would have been hesitant to buy a full package of any particular size. The kit includes 2 each of each size, so you have a good chance of finding out what works best for you. In my case, I found they inserted easily enough and they stayed in place. However, they are very uncomfortable to me. My body is unique, as is yours, so you may not have the same experience. The sizing kit is a GREAT way to test a product like this in the privacy of your own home. It's worth a shot!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SK0KV16LTU6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGZSI80#wasThisHelpful","R1SK0KV16LTU6Q","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solid Gold Furrever Young cat food is perfect for our older cat. He loves it, and he digests it well without any issues. His coat looks fantastic, too. He's older and getting slower, just like me. I'm a big fan of the Solid Gold brand, it's been a part of our lives for the last 10 years. Our vet said he thinks it's a good choice as well. I don't know if it matters to them or not, but they are healthy and happy cats. I'm very comfortable with the quality of ingredients in this brand, and in this flavor. It's produced in the United States from high quality ingredients, so it's going to cost more than imported foods that potentially carry more risks. It's a good food, the cats like it, and they are healthy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SL7T0SJW1MBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTVQK#wasThisHelpful","R2SL7T0SJW1MBS","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful, high quality dog food for small breeds. The kibble is very small and easy for tiny mouths to eat. One of mine has a hard time eating most kibble, and this works perfectly. We used to buy Solid Gold Wee Bits when she was a puppy, then our local store stopped carrying it and we switched. I'd forgotten how small their food could be. She has no trouble digesting this dog food, although one of my other little dogs has a poultry allergy and this is off limits. Check the ingredient panel to make sure it's right for your dog. The company is known for using very high quality ingredients, and nothing is questionable or from China. That matters to me. We are very pleased with Solid Gold products for dogs and cats, and we recommend them to our friends along with similar brands. I believe that the quality of our pet food is important enough to pay a little more for, and I also feel better about how their ingredients are sourced. You can't have that kind of confidence with supermarket pet foods.

"This is a pretty amazing dog food! The quality is top notch and the ingredients are varied and nutritious. This dog food is miles ahead of anything you can buy in a supermarket or big box store. The label says the kibble is for all sizes of dogs. The pieces are about 1/2 inch diameter, flattened, so it's up to you whether it fits your dog. They do love it and it digests well. It contains poultry as the main ingredient, which is a problem for a lot of dogs, and one of mine can't have it. If your dog can tolerate it, this is an excellent food to feed him or her. It costs more, but it's not bad when quality matters. Definitely recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZAMNRU1YZOMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGK2C#wasThisHelpful","RZAMNRU1YZOMI","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very surprised by how well and how quickly this Honeywell heater works! It heats up very quickly and it's easy to control the heat level. I used this in a 12x16 room and it worked well. It heated smaller rooms quicker, of course. No matter where I put it, I was happy with the results. This heater also offers a lot of good features, with very little to complain about.My heater smelled bad at first, almost like burning plastic, but more chemical - if that makes sense. I inspected the unit and everything seemed fine, so I waited until the next day and turned it on while I could use a window fan to suck the air out. Once whatever it was burned off, it didn't emit anymore odors.It's not perfectly quiet, but I wouldn't call it noisy. The fan helps heat the room quickly, and the sound level is easy enough to tune out. I'm okay with that. You can turn the oscillator on or off as needed.I really, really like the timer. I feel safer knowing it's going to shut off after a set time. I tested it a few times and it really did shut off, no problems. The motion sensor is also a nice feature and would be helpful if you have children running around, or fearless dogs.This heater comes with a very small remote control. I can see where that would be handy under certain circumstances. Personally, I prefer to get up and move my body when I can, so I put the remote away. It's very small and would be easy to lose anyway. I wish they made small remotes in fluorescent colors!Overall, I'm very pleased with this heater. I haven't had a ceramic heater since the early 80s and it barely put out enough heat to warm a closet. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this heater works. It's packed with features, it doesn't take up much space, and it's efficient.

"This food is for Tank. He's big, he's bold, and he'll eat anything. He is getting older and his dietary needs are changing. He digests this food very well and he seems satisfied with it. I trust the brand, Solid Gold produces very high quality foods that are safer than imported pet foods. We've used various Solid Gold pet foods over the last 10 years, depending on our pets needs at the time, and our vet said he likes the brand as well. Overall, it's a high quality food. Their stools are more compact and less smelly, and that's always a plus and usually a good sign of diet quality.

"I've gone through a few retractable leads over the years. The cords shred and snap, or they cease to recoil properly. To be honest, I've always bought cheap leads and I had never compared them to higher quality models.  This lead is for my 8lb chihuahua, who recently broke her lead after spotting a squirrel.When I pulled this Amigo lead out of the package, I instantly noticed a difference. This lead feels more solid and well made than my old leads. The tape glides out very smoothly, and it retracts quickly and quietly. The stop button works perfectly and holds the tape at the correct length without any effort or slipping. The button even has a rubber tip so it's non-slip and easier to press. Before taking my dog outside with it, I pulled the tape all the way out and tugged hard to make sure it was secure, and I felt confident that it would hold Olive back.I have the small size lead and the tape is about 1/2 inch wide. It looks similar to satin ribbon, but it appears to be thicker and very tightly woven. It feels very strong. The swivel hook on the end spins easily, and it hooks into her harness and holds strong. Olive wears a Ruffwear Web Harness and I've had trouble finding a lead with the right size hook, they can be too large or too small. This one fits perfectly.The handle of the Amigo is easy to grip and it fits my hand well. I like the Mountain pattern, it makes her lead easy to spot in a pile of other pet supplies. It's not too bulky, so it can slide into my purse if necessary.Overall, I'm very pleased with this lead. I know I'll need more soon, for my other dogs, and I'd like to buy more Amigo leads. I have a feeling they will need replacing much less often.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMFF15M1CRUPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BW8BPY#wasThisHelpful","RMFF15M1CRUPQ","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I intended to write my review after 3 weeks of following the Brain Fog Fix plan, but as I read the book, I quickly realized that I already do everything in this book. I made these changes a few years ago, and they worked incredibly well for me. I'll explain that at the end of my review. I chose this book because my elderly mother saw it discussed on a daytime talk show, and she asked me to buy it and help her follow the plan. Mom has dementia and doesn't realize that she doesn't have the type of brain fog described in this book. The book does discuss dementia, and overcoming brain fog can be helpful in pushing back the onset of dementia for some people. However, my mother is not the target audience for this book. Of course, she doesn't realize that.I had this book in my cart for two weeks, as I was on the fence about it. I was not familiar with Dr Dow because I don't watch daytime TV or reality programming, which he is apparently known for. I wasn't sure if the book would be a wise investment. I accepted the book through Vine, and I'm glad I did. Overall, I believe this book can help many people, and I am living proof that the methods described can make a real difference in ridding brain fog and becoming more productive.This book was written for those of us who have ever fallen into the trap of eating processed foods while ignoring nutrient rich vegetables, and have forgone activity for lives of convenience, or lack of time or energy. The choices we make have a strong bearing on how our brains function, and brain fog is an all too common side effect of the Standard American Diet and lifestyle. These choices can also predetermine our future brain health, which is probably something most of us don't think about. We have more power and control than we realize.What's in the 3 week plan? The first week involves dietary changes. Take out everything that may cause brain fog, and replace it with foods that improve it. It's stringent, but also very flexible. Anyone can do it. You'll also work on improving your mood. You can loosen up a little on the diet the second week, but you will increase activity, improve sleeping habits, and learn new things to stimulate your brain. The third week is called a spirit revolution. There are many options, including religion, meditation, a connection with nature, or even political awareness.None of the advice in this book is ground-breaking, and it can all be found elsewhere from very reputable medical websites.  However, it is very helpful to have it consolidated in one place, especially to someone who hasn't taken the time to search through multiple resources. This book is also written in a manner that is very easy to follow and understand. The book includes many case studies that help explain how this information can help those that put it to use.  I know that this works, and that brain fog can be cleared up if we are willing to make changes to our diet and lifestyle.Brain fog caused me to float through my days in a near stupor, never really getting anything accomplished. I'd forget why I went into the next room. I had trouble concentrating. If you are considering this book, you already know how badly brain fog can affect your life. A few years ago, I started choosing food based on nutrients, not cravings. I chose the most colorful, nutrient dense vegetables and fruits available. I chose lean proteins, and high fiber foods. I cut way back on grains, and I gave up all added sugar as well as artificial ingredients. I cooked from scratch, giving up processed foods. I began exercising, working up to an hour a day on the treadmill. I discovered meditation, although it was difficult to master at first. Once I did, it made me feel incredibly relaxed. I became more social. I studied a second language. The result of these changes was a brain that was on fire!  My energy levels went through the roof, and I even felt more confident.By the way, I am in my 50s. I'm a grandmother, I work full time, and now I even help take care of my elderly mother.  I'm a very busy person, but I found the time to plan and make these changes. It DOES take time and effort to improve our lives, but it doesn't have to be difficult.  The quick results provide all the incentive you need to keep going. The Brain Fog Fix offers real advice for real people. It's do-able.Mom isn't going to get better, but we are going to walk her through the steps in this book. Maybe it will help slow down the progression of her dementia, maybe it won't. But it will give her hope, and that can greatly improve each day, one day at a time.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with brain fog, or who has a loved one that needs help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3BXSQQCN4TJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140194647X#wasThisHelpful","RB3BXSQQCN4TJ","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of Solid Gold pet food, so I was surprised to be disappointed in this variety. I found 3 issues with this dog food, although the quality is high and most dogs will benefit from eating it.Problems:1. Not just fish, it contains turkey2. Kibble size isn't really for all sizes as claimed3. Carnitine content useless for weight loss, as claimed on package.1. The front of the Fit and Fabulous package advertises 'fresh caught Alaskan pollock' while the back of the package lists a variety of healthy ingredients. It wasn't until I received the package and examined the side of the bag that I learned turkey meal is a prominent ingredient in this mixture. Like many dogs, one of my chihuahuas has a poultry allergy. I've come to depend on fish based dog food to help him feel normal and healthy. I think turkey should be included on the front and back of the label.2. The package says this variety is good for any size dog. Maybe it should say good for most sizes of dogs. My other chihuahua is very tiny and this kibble is too large for her to eat. Each piece is about 1/2 inch square. That's not a big issue, just a quibble.3. Package claims l-carnitine additive will help weight loss. However, the amount contained is negligible. According to Chow Hounds: Why Our Dogs Are Getting Fatter -A Vet's Plan to Save Their Lives- Small dogs (under 20lb) should be dosed at 250mg twice daily, and dogs 20-40 pounds 500mg twice daily..  This package contains 25mg per kg of food, and the bag weighs 1.81kg. Your dog could eat the entire bag in one sitting and still not get a day's dose of carnitine.All of that aside, I'm fostering a schnauzer who will eat anything. He LOVES this food. It digests well, but to be honest he doesn't have trouble digesting anything. So far, he's gobbling it up without any complaints. I feel good about giving it to him because the quality of Solid Gold is very high.If your dogs have a poultry allergy, avoid this food. If your dog has a tiny mouth, he may not be able to eat it comfortably. Otherwise, this may be the right food for your dog.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CD1AURIUCU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGNKQ#wasThisHelpful","R16CD1AURIUCU3","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This humidifier is different from others I've owned in past years. It's evaporative, so it doesn't create a visible mist in the air. The unit is super quiet and it operates very simply. Setting it up was a breeze and the directions were on the box flap. The manual includes further information, such maintenance and safe usage. It requires a filter which must be replaced every now and then, so there will be an additional cost in using this model. The manual includes tips for making your filter last longer, such as turning it over and also drying it out when not in use.So far, I'm impressed with this model. It's very quiet and it's efficient, and it truly helped prevent dry mouth in the night for me. The filter is a great idea since it helps ensure the mist is clean and germ free. You can't put Vicks salve in the tank like Mom did when I was a kid, but the VapoPads seem convenient. However, they can get costly. The product description says the unit comes with two pads, one in each scent. Mine only came with one menthol pad, so I'll have to buy the lavender rosemary pads separately. I didn't try the menthol pad because my chihuahuas sleep in the same room with us. There seems to be conflicting information out there on whether menthol is safe for dogs to inhale, and one of my dogs is in poor health and it isn't worth the risk. I'll look forward to trying the lavender rosemary pads. I would love to see a reusable pad that can use essential oil for a more cost effective option.Like most people, I grew up with a Vicks humidifier and it got a lot of use every winter. Mom would spoon a small dollop of Vicks salve into the water and it would scent the room. Our humidifier lasted over a decade before it was lost in a move, it was very well made. I had one in my home when my son was growing up, and eventually gave it to him when he had his first child. I hope the new models are made as well. This particular model is lightweight and seems durable. If it bites the dust, I'll update my review accordingly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14DD8KOSUB3WP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410YUH8#wasThisHelpful","R14DD8KOSUB3WP","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These gloves are great! They are stretch without breaking and are stronger than we expected. The black color is a little odd for a glove, but it's easy to distinguish them from other gloves in our garage. We chose the XXL size because not everyone in our family has small hands. They fit well without being too tight. They go on and off easily and they can be reused, depending on what you do when you wear them. The nitrile material smells a little strange, but it's not overpowering and it airs out quickly.

"This gate is short, light weight, designed very simply, and it looks nice. Even better, it works very well! Nothing has to be screwed into the wall, so it's totally portable.It arrived mostly assembled, and all I had to do was slip the four bumpers into each corner. I was initially concerned because I thought they screwed in, but they just slide into the holes. Then you simply turn the knobs to slightly increase the space and push them against the door jam to hold the gate in place.The gate size adjusts with knobs that screw into predrilled slots and it can fit a doorway up to 44 inches wide. It's very easy to loosen the bumpers to remove the gate and tuck it away when it isn't needed.If you want your pets to roam freely, but don't want to remove the gate, you can open the little door and let them go back and forth. It opens easily with a spring loaded knob. I have two chihuahuas and only one would walk through the gate. The other thought the bar across the bottom was still a barrier, so she wouldn't cross it. Your mileage may vary.I've tried several pet gates over the years, but always went back to a simple locking bar baby gate, even though it was a hassle to climb over at times. This little walk over gate is the solution I've been looking for. The size is perfect, it has a clean and simple appearance, and it works well.

"This beautifully written story details the sad and jarring lives of a few children whose lives took an unexpected turn at an early age. The author takes us through the many layers of their history which lead to their current situation in a mental hospital. This book is about more than the two sisters, there are other characters who also share their past, present, and future.I found myself absorbed into the pages of this book and looked forward to each chapter until it was finished. I enjoyed the author's style as she brought every detail to life, and I felt the emotions of each character. The book is filled with pain, but always tinged with hope. I thought I knew how their story would end, but I was taken by surprise. The ending didn't provide complete closure, but it ended on a note that was satisfactory.The book is recommended for ages 12 and up, but I would feel more comfortable recommending it for slightly older children. Fortunately, most children are not exposed to the experiences these characters lived through. Even I, as a grandmother, cringed through the painful parts. I would recommend it for young adults and older teens who are drawn towards this type of novel. For the right crowd, I would easily recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKHZM7A6F0QPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054448200X#wasThisHelpful","RKHZM7A6F0QPQ","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using an Epson XP-850 for over a year and am very happy with the performance. The XP-950 appealed to me primarily because it can print up to 11x17 prints. This is useful not only for photographs, but also signs and graphs for work. I also know that it will be very helpful for the grand-kids when they do their science projects, as we always either have to tape regular sheets together or get them printed at a local printer. The possibilities are endless, so I had to have it.Setup was super easy. My other model is connected to my Mac, so I decided to use this one with my PC. The software was easy to install and worked well with Windows 10. The touch screen display is easy to use and it walked me through the process. They make it all very simple, I think it would be hard to make a mistake.  Scanning is easy to use, and I like the folding top. It makes it easy to close and cover my documents without them slipping, so I get it right the first time.The photos that I printed came out very clear and gorgeous, with vivid colors or detailed black and white. I recently received a large box of old family photos, so I used this scanner to create high res scans. I used PaintShop Pro to correct and fine tune them, then I printed them with my new Epson. The detail was fantastic, and we were all impressed with the results. I now have a very large photo of my mother when she was a little girl in the 40s, and I'm going to frame it and give it to her for her 78th birthday this month. It was wonderful to be able to do this from home without sending it out and hoping for the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFLMEOQC2LJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","R1QFLMEOQC2LJ5","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This weight bench is very solid and sturdy, and it offers a lot of features for a good workout. It was easy to put together, although it took some time and a partner is needed. The actual product varies slightly from the photo, which I'll describe below. Overall, assembling and using this bench has been a good experience. This is a substantial upgrade for me, because I've been using a small, portable bench. It takes up a decent amount of space, but it looks great, it's solid, and I can work every part of my body with it.The main photo for this model shows a smooth, solid black seat and back. The actual parts are gray and have a texture. If you scroll down to the 'design call outs' section, check the photo for the step in squat rack and zoom in. That's what this model looks like.The seat pad is ample and very comfortable. It measures 14 inches at the widest point, and it's 14 inches deep. It's approximately 2 inches thick. The seat consists of a wood base with padding, and vinyl cover. The top layer is stitched to the sides. The bottom is also stitched, and it also has a trim that goes around and has a metal piece that screws in to fasten it at the back of the seat. It's very well made.The backrest length is 29 inches. The width is 10 1/2 inches throughout most of the back, with it flaring out to 13 1/2 inches at the base. Also 2 inches thick with the same construction as the seat. It's comfortable and it offers support, and it feels very stable.The arm curl pad is large, measuring 20 inches at the widest point. It's about 11 1/2 inches deep, and shares the same construction as the back and seat.The rollers on the leg developer are dense foam with a vinyl cover. The cover is not sewn to the roller, each is made like a tube that is gathered on the ends. The foam core is visible at the center of each end.The frame is very heavy and sturdy. The metal is thick and the powder coating is high quality. The bench can fold up and back for more compact storage, which is helpful if you are limited on space.Total weight limit is 600 pounds which includes up to 300 pounds in weights and a person up to 300 pounds.You'll need to maintain this bench by occasionally lubricating all moving parts, and keep everything tightened.Overall, I am very happy with this weight bench. I go to a gym, but winter is coming and I've been considering setting up a more complete home gym. This is a great unit that beats my old bench, and it will offer a much more complete workout. Happy camper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZEHE7M9X38Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5PQO84#wasThisHelpful","R6ZEHE7M9X38Y","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cranberry hobnail glass hummingbird feeder is beautiful! It's much nicer in person, and we love it. The glass is thick and has an old-fashioned feel to it, but it's not terribly heavy. The base is lightweight, but it isn't dinky. The flower ports are all attached securely and in great condition, nothing is bent or out of shape.Measurements:* 8 1/2 inches tall without the wire hanger,* Base - 5 3/8 inch diameter* Glass is 3 3/4 inches diameter at widest pointTo fill the feeder, you turn it upside down and unscrew the base. The threads don't go all the way around, but they still hold it together without leaking. Just make sure you get it tightly back on. Unfortunately, the hummingbirds have migrated so I can't say how well they will like this feeder. We have good luck with hummingbirds in the summer, so I have no doubt that they will find it. I'm pleased with the quality of this feeder, and I love the appearance. I look forward to hanging it outside in the spring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32WX2FYF3AKEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIW3RKC#wasThisHelpful","R32WX2FYF3AKEU","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These gloves are very strong and comfortable. They go on easily and remove without tearing. I tried to puncture one by pushing my fingernail through but only ended up with a sore finger. The glove is tough! It feels a little bit thicker than the generic blue gloves I buy in 10-packs at the supermarket.

"I really love these shoes, although they are not what I expected. Walking shoes are generally designed with support and shock absorption to help when walking for fitness or for extended walking. These shoes are very lightweight, they bend easily, and the fabric is soft and just stretchy enough for them to feel good on my feet. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are marketed as walking shoes. I don't feel that they have enough support in the sole to wear while walking for fitness. The soles are so thin and flexible that I can feel every bump on the road, plus the arch support is not as full as I would have liked. They are great to wear to the supermarket or at work. When I go to the park to walk for exercise, I like more support on my feet. For general wearing, I'm very happy with them.  I'm probably going to buy another pair in another color.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCPU12UVMA5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MG4BSPE#wasThisHelpful","R2PCPU12UVMA5T","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This razor is lightweight and easy to use. The results are just average, it doesn't really provide a closer shave than similar razors - or disposables. It works well for a razor in this price range, especially on fine, straight hair. If you have curly or coarse hair, you might want a rotary razor. This model maneuvers easily, has a lightweight design, but it doesn't feel dinky.About this razor:* 6 1/2 inches long* 2 1/2 inches wide at the head* 6.6 ounces* Charger/cleaner, when extended, is 9 inches height, 3 3/4 inches wide, and 3 1/2 inches deep.This model has a 10,000 RPM motor. The more expensive models from Panasonic have up to 14,000 RPM while a couple of lower priced Panasonic models have 13,000 RPM. Not all of the models advertise their RPM. At the time I checked, there were 24 different models currently available from Panasonic. I'm not sure why there has to be so many, but it should be easy to find what you need.I honestly think this razor is easier to clean without the dedicated cleaner. It rinses of easily under running water. Plus the cleaner takes up quite a bit of space on the bathroom counter. We can tuck it under the vanity when not in use, but it will likely stay there unused.Overall, we like this razor, but we don't love it. It's better than some we've owned in the past, but it's not the highest quality. It's easy to use, does a good job, offers a close shave, it isn't too loud, and it feels like it will last a long time. We would both recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2RSPZ5V8403/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2RSPZ5V8403","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little oven is a lot of fun to play with. The oven and the accessories have rounded edges, so there's nothing to hurt if your little one falls on anything. The size is just right, and I love how everything stores inside the oven. It's interactive, not too loud, the sounds are not annoying, and it's good and sturdy.It's designed to help teach a few numbers and simple equations to toddlers, and it makes learning fun and effortless. I see one missed opportunity - While pizza and cupcakes are a lot of fun, why not add in some roasted vegetables? Teaching kids that healthy food is also fun can help foster better eating habits.We've been playing with this with our granddaughter for about a month and it's still fun. She zooms right over to it when she comes to see us a few times a week. We have similar toys, but she seems to be fixated on this one.

"This little owl nightlight soother by Skip Hop is so cute! I love the clean, modern design, it can fit in with so many themes. The wings are the speakers, which is a creative idea that's also adorable. It works just as nicely as it looks! The buttons on the back of the owl are clearly marked and easy to figure out. They are a bright green color that is modern and fresh. There are also 4 green non-skid pads on the bottom of the owl, to help keep it in place. The light can be dimmed by pressing a button on the back, so you can choose how bright you want it. It's never very bright, but you can make it very dim if you prefer. There's also a volume control button. It has a timer that can let you run the sound for up to an hour, so you don't have to worry about turning it off later. The musical tunes are nice, but I really like the nature sounds better, especially the rainforest. I wouldn't mind having this in my own room!  I would definitely recommend this little nightlight. It's the perfect gift for a baby shower, or to treat your own little one to something special.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T9D1HGPO7YVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIL7EZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1T9D1HGPO7YVI","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cups are great for when everyone comes over to watch the game, or for other friendly gatherings. They hold a decent serving of beverages and they fit well in the hand. They feel about the same as similar Hefty disposable cups. Thin, but sturdy. You can crush it with one hand if you want, but they won't collapse easily unless you intend to break it. The design holds up under hand washing a few times, but it will eventually wear off. They are disposable, but not necessarily recyclable. My local recycling center won't take them, and polystyrene plastic isn't accepted at a lot of recycling centers. Call your local center to make sure they take this type of plastic before tossing them into your recycling bin, so you don't accidentally contaminate the batch. As a Hefty cup, these are great and the college sports design makes them unique and perfect for the right occasion.

"I am super impressed with this LeapPad! It's well made, offers a lot of features, and it's easy to use. She loves it, and even I am having fun with it! The colors are bright, and the graphics are clear. The LeapPad feels very durable in my hands, and I believe it will survive any accidents that may occur. The stylus is attached and easy to hold, even for smaller hands. It can be unlooped and removed if needed. It was easy to set up and we had it running in just a couple of moments after it was charged.Although the description says it's good for ages 3-9, there are games available for as young as 2. For the younger kids, this is an excellent tablet. You know exactly what is installed on it, so you can feel safe when they use it. I didn't test any games for older kids, so I don't know how they compare to the educational games you might find on a more robust tablet. It's not a Kindle or an iPad, but it's not supposed to be. It's a very dedicated little tablet that offers plenty of educational games and fun, and they are all fully supported by LeapFrog. I'm not comfy sharing my iPad or Kindle with the little ones because they can damage it - plus they are grown up toys and the distinction is important in our home. And again, it's safe because it can only accept LeapFrog apps.The games may seem a little pricey, but I think that's because we've become accustomed to so many apps that are free or cost 99 cents, and sometimes not even worth that. The LeapFrog games are designed specifically by the company and are fully supported. There are no surprise ads, in-app purchases, or anything inappropriate for our kids.Some parents may easily be looking for more in a tablet for their kids, especially those closer to 8 or 9 that may be ready for more. For the younger kids, I feel that this is an excellent option that is fun, educational, safe, and it offers a very wide range of games. This is exactly what we were looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z5WBBM8MIAV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P6AM#wasThisHelpful","R2Z5WBBM8MIAV4","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"She loves playing with the shapes, I love that it's so portable! It's flat enough to stow away in the baby bag, yet it opens up to a full size toy. The sides are soft, while the base and top are sturdy. It's easy to put she shapes in, and the trap door on the bottom opens easily enough to remove the contents. The shapes are actually sets, with two of each shape. She can stack them, or take them apart and put each in individually. I'm embarrassed to admit that I had a hard time popping this thing down at first, because it felt awkward - it kind of twisted when I tried to push it down. Once it's in place, the lid closes and everything is secure. Easy to pack for travel, and everything stores neatly under the lid when flat.

We play with it together, so no accidents will happen. We play with it on her play table, not on the floor. It really is a lot of fun. I wouldn't exactly call it an educational toy. It repeats ABC without additional letters. However, that's pretty good for the younger toddlers. I like that all the parts fit inside for storage. I can teach her that everything has a 'home' and that's where the parts for this toy go, so it helps her learn to keep it tidy. The sounds that it makes are not too loud, and nothing sounds annoying.

"We have been using this smoker for about a month, and we love it more and more! It does a fantastic job smoking meats, but it's also great for smoking foods you might not have considered, such as tofu and baked beans. It's easy to use, once you read the directions, and it seems to be very well made.We seasoned the smoker as instructed in the directions, before using it the first time. We didn't read the directions again, like we should have, and didn't realize the smoker would not work without preheating first. The first time we tried to smoke something in it, we set the temp and timer, and thought it was working. A half our later we realized it was cold. You must go through the preheat stage, which lasts 40 minutes, before you can set the temp and begin smoking your food.This smoker is also fantastic if you are a vegetarian or don't eat a lot of meat. We eat mostly plants, and we were surprised by how much we could put in this smoker. We like to fill pans with baked beans and smoke them for about 2 hours at 275 degrees. It's amazing! Tofu, tomatoes, eggplant, corn, and more - all taste so much better smoked! We smoked tomatoes and crushed them, then froze in small containers to pull out and add to chili or other recipes this winter.Each rack is large enough to hold a 9x13 inch pan. The racks remove easily, in case you need deeper space. You can lay most items directly on the racks, which is probably best for most meats.Overall, we are more than pleased with this smoker. We had an older smoker for about 20 years until it bit the dust. The design was different from this one, and we much prefer this one. We would easily recommend this model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3272GXVTTWBEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMRXY06#wasThisHelpful","R3272GXVTTWBEY","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Colgate Daily Repair toothpaste does an okay job cleaning my teeth, and it's affordable. It promises to do much more than just clean my teeth. Does it work? My teeth don't feel any cleaner than they do after using other toothpastes. Though it tastes normal while brushing, it leaves an odd aftertaste in my mouth. That might be worth it, if it performs the miracle claimed in the ad copy. Unfortunately, the company would or could not substantiate their claims when I contacted them by email and by phoneThe claim in the ad copy says ""Repairs early teeth and gum damage. Strengthens teeth by remineralizing weakened enamel."" I thought that sounded great, it's just what I need! How long would this take to occur? How could I learn more?  I couldn't find any references to studies or data on their website, so I sent them a quick email. How long does it take for this to occur, and where are the studies behind it? That seemed simple enough. Getting an answer seemed tougher than pulling teeth.I submitted my question multiple times via email over a one month period, and each time I was told that my question needed additional time to research and someone would get back to me. Each time, I was left hanging.I was finally told that there were no studies they could point me to that would substantiate their claims. I was basically told to blindly trust their ad copy without any evidence. I thought this was strange, in an age where companies are quick to link to PubMed studies or other reliable sources to support their claims. I would have been happy with a brief synopsis comparing results between this and another brand.I finally called customer care. After placing me on hold for a few minutes, the rep told me that there was no set time for the product to work, it was different for everyone. I said their studies had to have taken a specific length of time to establish that it worked, how long was it? 2 weeks? 2 months? 2 years? Again, she said the time was different for everyone and there was no one answer.I realize that this may seem like a small issue to many people. It's just toothpaste, right? In this case, a company is making claims they seem unwilling to back up, in an effort to promote their product over other brands. The product contains controversial ingredients, and it's possible that it could take years of usage to produce the benefits promised in the advertisement. Even THEY don't know how to answer that question. I feel kind of insulted.

"We use an old-school laminator at work that does a good job, but it's heavy and bulky and I wouldn't want one in my home. In comparison, this Scotch model is very compact, it's faster, and it does a good job. It heats up quickly, and it's easy to feed the pouch through for a quick lamination. Once done, it's small and easy to store, especially since it's designed with a place to stash the cord. These are good features to have in a home laminator.This laminator comes with 2 starter pouches, one each 3 mil and 5 mil. The thinner one is for regular paper, and the thicker one is for photos and thicker papers. I had hoped that I would be able to cut the pouch to use as needed, but the manual says you must use a full uncut pouch or it could get rolled into the machine. However, I can purchase pouches as small as business card size if I need them, and the largest size it will hold is letter size.The directions say you may have to run your pouch through the machine more than once, if it doesn't seal properly. Both of my pounces sealed in one pass. They were free from bubbles or voids, and they looked smooth. The unit has a jam release lever in case of an error, but thankfully I didn't need it.The kids are excited because this will be useful for school projects, particularly science fairs. You never know when you might need a tool like this. There are some things you can't laminate, according to the manual, such as credit cards and stamps. They recommend not laminating historically significant papers or one-of-a-kind items.Overall, this is a nice laminator. It's compact, easy to use, easy to store, and it's efficient for small jobs. I would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3164HFSJU08H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI7MI96#wasThisHelpful","R3164HFSJU08H2","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sleek looking lamp that offers useful features and a unique design. It has a heavy base that will stay put, an extra long power cord, and It's beautiful and appears well made. It's not very bright, but it's still useful as a desk lamp. It's not perfect, but it's nice.The tech specs at the bottom of the page are not quite accurate. Actual specs, out of the box:4 pounds, 12 ounces (weighed on a postal scale)20 inches tall, including the base - about 19 if you remove the baseBase: 8x6 and 3/4 inch thickRemovable lamp head: 8 7/8 inches long, including the carrier loopPower cord: 9 feetWhat I like:* I love the long power cord, 3 yards is an ample distance and much longer than the cord on other lamps. This makes it easier to find good placement for the lamp.* The rechargeable lamp head can be removed with the press of a button, so it's easy to carry if you need to.* The allen wrench stores under the base, and can be used to tighten the position so it won't budge. Find the sweet spot and make sure it stays.* Manual says light operates for an hour if power goes out, but it lasted 3 1/2 hours in my test.* USB port makes it convenient to charge my devices* Dimmer with 3 levelsWhat I don't like:* The shiny, black base arrives scratched due to the way the cardboard packaging was wrapped around the parts, and it did not have a clear protective film, like similar products.* It's just not very bright, even on the highest level. It's bright enough to read for a while, or for short term use. It can't compare to my full-spectrum desk lamp in brightness, and the light isn't white enough (for me personally) to read by for long periods of time.What's iffy:* If the power goes out, this lamp will automatically turn on. That's great - unless I'm not at home. In my test, the light turned on when power was disconnected from the lamp. It turned on at low level, not the brightest level, so it conserved energy. It lasted 3 1/2 hours. Let's pretend that the power goes out 3 hours before I get home or can get to the lamp. The internal battery will be drained before I need it the most. If I designed this lamp, I would include a feature to allow it to auto-cutoff after 5 or 10 minutes. I could then manually choose to turn it on and leave it on as needed.Overall, this is a very nice lamp. It's beautiful, solid, and offers nice features. It's not perfect. I would recommend it, unless you are looking for a brighter light to read by for long periods of time.  I like it, but I don't love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJKPIBV5R6YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW79SC#wasThisHelpful","R1RJKPIBV5R6YG","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are really pleased with these pants. The size fits as expected, and they feel very good. The stitching is tight, everything about them is well made. The lining is thin, but very warm and it feels good on the skin. We were concerned that the lining might shrink after washing, but it held up in size and fit without any issues. The lining doesn't feel bulky, so it doesn't interfere with movement. They are perfect for working out doors in cooler weather. The leg width fits well, and the cuffs pull over workbooks just fine.

"This little light works well and it's easy to install. We put it by the door on the storage building, since there isn't electricity for a standard light. The size is fairly small, but it holds 12 LED lights so it gives sufficient light. The motion trigger works very well, we had no problem getting it to detect us and turn on when we reached the storage building. The light is bright enough that we can see to reach the door safely. The light only stays on for about a half minute or a little longer. It requires 4 D batteries, which the manual says should last between 6 and 12 months, depending on how often it's used. It slips open to change the batteries without having to fumble for a screwdriver. Overall, this is a nice light! It's brighter than I expected it to be, and it works exactly as described.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4U9ON81ZEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTE4X5C#wasThisHelpful","R2O4U9ON81ZEG","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that this little lunch kit is designed for kids, but I'm keeping it for myself! The size is perfect for packing snacks for work, or even a light lunch. The plastic is thicker and sturdier than I expected. Usually similar kits bend or warp, but not this one. It's not so rigid that it would crack easily, either. The lid closes very securely, and it's easy to flip open or closed even when wet. It doesn't seem to hold odor, and I pack some pretty smelly snacks, like hummus and peppers. It cleans up easily, and it's easy to carry. It's cute, colorful, and I like the little window. I'd love to see one just like it in a larger size for grownups.

"These chips are seriously delicious! I love roasted seaweed and eat it daily. I like brown rice chips, they are crunchy and light. I've never had both combined in one chip, but the result is pretty darned satisfying! They are light and crunchy, salty and easy to eat. I can taste the seaweed, although it's not very pronounced. I was particularly excited about the gochujang seasoning on these chips. I love Korean food, and gochujang is a fermented red chili paste that has a little bit of a pungent flavor. That unique taste is missing from the seasoning on these chips. They taste more like sweet chili to me, and that's still good. Just not what I was expecting. Still, these chips are very delicious and satisfying. I received one bag as a sample, now I have to buy a whole case.

"I wanted to like this shampoo, because I am probably the target market for this product. However, it left my hair feeling awful. It was difficult to lather up - had to shampoo twice each time I used it. It seemed to rinse cleanly, but my hair felt heavy after it dried, and it was limp and difficult to style. Despite smelling very good, my hair looked dirty. I normally use shampoo from the natural food store - chemical free, sulfate free, etc, and my hair feels clean and looks full and shiny. With Dove Youthful Vitality, my hair was a mess. The container says it is weightless, but that was not my experience. I used it 3 times over the last week and that was enough.

"I've been using Wholly Doanjang for over a month and I'm astounded by the difference between this and the brand I was using. Everything about this paste - the scent, color, flavor - is miles ahead of the little square plastic container of supermarket paste I had been using.When I opened this jar of soybean paste, the room instantly smelled pungent - of course in a good way! It's naturally fermented, so the fragrance is quickly released. The flavor is salty, but very savory and rich. My old square tub of paste lacked scent, and it was very hard and dark in color. The Wholly Doanjang is softer, easier to spoon out, and looks lighter in color. You can tell that it's a better, more natural product. It makes all the difference in a recipe.Wholly Doanjang is made with just soybeans, water, and salt, and it's naturally aged and fermented for 3 years. My old brand contains these ingredients, along with wheat flour, alcohol, and more, and it's quickly processed. It doesn't have time to develop the level of flavor that Wholly Doanjang possesses. I had no idea what I was missing!I eat LOTS of vegetables, and I love to experiment with flavors. I eat spinach a few times a week, and my favorite way to prepare it is with doanjang. I briefly cook fresh spinach until it's just wilted, then squeeze out all the water. I blend a very small amount of doanjang with a smidgen of gochujang (fermented chili paste) and a drop or two of sesame oil. Massage it into the spinach. It's simple, quick, and addictive, I can't eat spinach without it anymore. Some people add minced garlic, but I prefer it without it.This paste does cost more than supermarket brands, but it takes just a tiny bit in a recipe, so it lasts a long time. I can't imagine going back my old brand after this. If this brand becomes unavailable to me, I'll just have to learn to make it from scratch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353ZDU6DCYILR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9WG6D8#wasThisHelpful","R353ZDU6DCYILR","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this little solar charger. It's about the size of a cell phone with a thick case, although it's quite a bit heavier. It's compact and easy to store in the glove-box or a backpack. The flashlight is bright and it stays lit for a long time. This charger works reasonably well. I tested it on a Kindle, BLU phone (battery is similar to iPhone 6 Plus), and I ran the flashlight as long as it would go on a full charge, and will describe my results below.I initially tried to charge my charger via sunlight, from dawn till dusk. By dark, 3 of the 4 charge lights were lit. I then plugged it in via a USB cable to finish charging it. The third light began blinking, then soon the fourth light blinked. It didn't take much longer before all 4 lights were solid, indicating that it was fully charged. Plugging it in produced a faster charge than sunlight, but it's good to know that I can still get a substantial charge if I'm hiking or without access to a power source, as long as I'm patient.My Kindle Fire HD 7 power was down to 16% when I plugged it into the fully charged Dex unit. It reached 77% after 1 hour and 45 minutes, at which point the Dex ran out of power.My BLU 8XL phone has a 2920mAh battery, which is a smidgen more than the battery used in an iPhone 6 Plus (2915mAh) and more than the typical 1800'ish mAh of many other phones. I depleted my battery to 15%, when my phone alerted me to charge it. It charged slowly and took 2 hours and 40 minutes to charge it to 100% full charge with the Dex. That sounds fine to me, and the Dex didn't die too soon.The LED flashlight is bright, and it promises to last up to 14 hours. I fully recharged the Dex overnight by plugging in the cable. I covered the solar panels by taping a piece of cardboard over it so that it would not gain additional charge during the day. I turned on the flashlight in the morning, then timed it to see how long it would last. It lasted 13 hours and 10 minutes, which I felt was very good.I think this solar charger is a helpful tool to have available in case of an emergency. The unit has a green hook on the back that opens to make a stand, which is nice. It would also make it possible to attach it to a backpack so it can soak up sunlight while outdoors. Overall, I'm happy with this and would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RGXR222R2HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LML7GJY#wasThisHelpful","R18RGXR222R2HM","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, small sized notebook that is a good size for slipping into the smaller compartment of a backpack or handbag. The plastic covers a good thickness - not so thin they curl, but thick enough to provide support. The fabric spine hides the spiral binding, so it doesn't get caught on anything. It's stitched on with a very wide stitch which looks like it would unravel with the slightest catch. However, I picked at the loose ends to see if it would come loose, and it stayed on tight. One neat feature of this notebook is the moveable plastic pocket divider. It's designed to come loose, then you can slip it somewhere in the middle of the notebook. It slipped out easily, but took a little finagling to slip it back in. Not a problem. The divider has pockets on both sides, which is pretty handy. The only thing I wish it had was a loop or other method to fasten it closed. That would make it more perfect for tucking into a bag. I found a jumbo rubber band which will serve the same purpose. Overall, it's a good little notebook","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DOQZCOD218MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NT1QQ#wasThisHelpful","R3DOQZCOD218MX","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm very pale. When I put this lotion on my face, it turns dark and looks muddy on me. I tried putting my makeup on over it, which helped, but I still didn't look right. Most people probably won't notice the color on their skin, because most people are not this pale. I would definitely recommend this lotion because it feels and smells great.

"This soup tastes better than most processed tomato soups. I love to cook from scratch, but naturally sometimes it's more convenient or even necessary to buy food that is pre-made. Most canned soups taste too salty, and have a metallic, heavily processed aftertaste. I was a little concerned about trying this soup, but the simple ingredient list drew me in. It tastes better than I thought it would. The texture is very smooth, but also has bits of tomato pieces. The basil flakes are visible, and the soup is a dark red color. It tastes a little too salty, but the salt is not overpowering. The tomato taste isn't fresh, but it doesn't have a chemical aftertaste.

"It's cute and the size is great, but the quality just isn't the same as it used to be. Granted, it's been a long time since I bought a Trapper Keeper. I remember when they came out in the 70s. The closure has changed a few times since then, but they always sported a good size and various useful pockets and other features. The Hello Kitty Trapper Keeper that I have in hand doesn't have any frills, other than two inner pockets and a cute design.The metal button closure is weak and doesn't want to stay closed. It keeps popping open.  I will probably attach self-adhesive velcro to it because that's the only way it will fasten and stay shut.The inner pocket inside the back cover is made from a thin plastic that is curling up, and that's before adding or removing any contents. The inner pocket inside the front cover is also thin, but the shape is different and much better, in my opinionOverall, I'm a little disappointed in this Trapper Keeper.

"This little jumper is well made and attractive, but it runs a little small. The stitching is tight and even, there were no loose threads, and the zipper glides smoothly. Pink satin seam binding around the inside of the neckline helps hide stitches, and also makes it more comfortable if she happens to wear it without an undershirt. The belt is lined with a light pink and blue stripe fabric that is attractive.She wears a size 14, and this dress barely fits her. The shirt she wears underneath is thin, so it doesn't add bulk. Still, it feels a little tight if she bends or sits. I don't think she'll get much use out of it and we wish it were a size 16.

"This beautiful carry-on luggage is lightweight, loaded with compartments, rolls smoothly, and it STILL passes as a carry-on if the new ITIA proposals pass. Please don't be discouraged from considering this luggage due to the confusing new measurement proposals. More on that at the end of my review.This Tumi Tegra-Lite Max Continental Expandable Carry-On is very durable. The outer shell feels thin, but it's made from a tough material that can take a lot of abuse. According to Milliken, the company that makes Tegris, it can withstand strikes from rocks, baggage handlers, shrapnel, etc. It's very roomy, and the various compartments inside help keep everything organized and separate for safe travel.I have the graphite finish model, which has a basketweave appearance. It has a light sheen, but it isn't shiny. It can be cleaned easily if it gets dirty. The beautiful design makes it stand out, and it's also easy to spot. I learned the importance of unique luggage in a busy airport a long time ago.I initially thought the weave was just a print on a plastic-like material. After reviewing the Milliken website, it is actually a woven material that is fused together with heat and pressure. The weave is real, yet it's perfectly smooth.The wheels allow this luggage to spin incredibly easy. I dragged it down stairs, across rough pavement, down a long and bumpy sidewalk, and back indoors, and it's maneuvered easily across every surface. It's like sliding across warm butter.The zippers are thick and have durable metal teeth that grip well and should not come apart. The slider glides easily when opening and closing. The pull tabs are slightly curved and have a non-traditional shape. The design allows them to latch into the combination lock on the side. However, I personally find them a little hard to grip and pull.Be sure and register your luggage with Tumi as soon as it arrives. A serial number on each piece can help ensure that lost luggage makes it way back home.By now, you have probably heard of the new ITIA proposals that will reduce the recommended size of carry-on luggage, if it passes. As of this review, the proposal is on hold.  The new ""Cabin OK"" proposal does NOT change the maximum size for carry-on luggage, so this model will still be accepted if it passes. The proposal only suggests an optimal size which is a little smaller, and they said luggage that size can carry a special tag so it will not have to be measured when boarding. They have also stated that no one will have to buy new luggage, and the old maximum size will still be in effect. Therefore, this particular piece of luggage will still qualify as a carry-on if the proposal passes.This is a pretty spectacular carry-on. It's durable, beautiful, spacious, light weight, easy to maneuver over any surface, and it's so well made that it should last a lifetime. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13V2UJF8N0134/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3TJDKE#wasThisHelpful","R13V2UJF8N0134","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an amazing backpack! It's designed for hunters, but the multi-compartments make it useful for just about anything. It's well made, versatile, and comfortable. There are a lot of compartments, the stitching is tight, the fabric is thick and tightly woven. It's durable and should last many years.This backpack is loaded with compartments in various sizes, and each can serve a distinct purpose. Lots of straps hold everything tight and secure, while also ensuring a good fit.* Two waist belt compartments, 7 inches wide and 2 1/4 deep, zip open easily with large loop zipper pulls. Store ammo or keys, wallet, and a cell phone for easy access. No fumbling or losing anything important!* Two long wing compartments that flank each side and measure 17 1/2 inches high and 7 inches deep. The back side of each also includes a mesh pocket.* The main compartment is 25 inches deep. 2 large loop zippers are easy to access. Inside is a large nylon elastic pocket to help organize your gear.* On the outer flap is another compartment which is about 11 inches deep and 8 inches at the widest point, and it has an inner mesh pocket.* Below the smaller compartment is yet another compartment which unzips to reveal a gun or bow holder.* On the very bottom are two more zippers. One opens to reveal a rain cover. My zipper seems to stick in the middle, due to the contents, but it does open. The rain cover is an elastic edged shell that slips over the backpack to help protect it from rain. The other zipper reveals the meat shelf which unrolls and can hook to an upper strap.It doesn't show very well in the product photos above, but the molded foam back panel of the backpack looks like the inside of a turtle shell. It's flexible, but offers plenty of support for the backpack. The wide shoulder straps are very well padded, as is the waist belt. They are lined in soft fabric that should help keep it comfortable during long treks, while still preventing slippage. It weighs almost 6 pounds, which isn't bad since most of the weight is on the back.Overall, this backpack has a lot to offer. Plenty of compartments, extreme comfort, and durability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQ75MQV0IYV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011YC24PQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FQ75MQV0IYV0","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic dog food! I recently switched to a fish based, limited ingredient kibble because my chihuahuas had trouble with poultry, which solved their problem. I'm very familiar with Honest Kitchen dog foods, as I have used them off and on for years. (My dogs do better when we switch occasionally) I was intrigued by their new limited ingredient fish based food and was anxious to see how my dogs would do with it. When I first opened the package, it smelled very fish. The fishiness seems to have gone away, or perhaps I've just gotten used to it. It smells much better now. The fine powder is mixed with warm water until it creates a slurry, which then thickens a little as it sits. My dogs seem to prefer a thinner mixture. I transitioned my dogs to this over a few days and they didn't experience any digestive problems. Their stools are firm and not too smelly. They have a lot of energy, too. I'm impressed with the quality of ingredients in this food and I know it's safe for my dogs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NAMSP05MQ9G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBI9DD6#wasThisHelpful","R1NAMSP05MQ9G2","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am sorry to say this, but I'm disappointed in this little USB flash drive. It holds a lot of data and it checked out fine when tested via a flash drive testing software program at the office. However, the body is very flimsy. It's made from a type of plastic that I consider 'crunchy'. It reminds me of the kind of plastic used for those little free toys that came in cereal boxes back in the day. Actually, that might have been better quality. It's obvious that it would crack with the slightest pressure and turn into a mess of shards that would make it unusable. I would be hesitant to use this to store anything important. Even then, I would store it in a very safe place and I would not carry it with me. I'm not sure how many times I would be able to insert it and remove it before a disaster might occur. It comes with a little lanyard, but I've still not been able to insert it. I'll save this for an occasion when I really need a flash drive and all my others are full.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UAZLVBLJVRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5V62RQ#wasThisHelpful","R38UAZLVBLJVRS","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ProTeam commercial backpack vacuum is perfect for anyone who has to clean large office buildings. It also comes with a 'home kit' that helps if you are a professional housekeeper or if you do home renovations and need a good vacuum that will clean everything from the ceilings to the floors. It comes with a variety of accessories and a 50 foot extension cord.I'm using this in our 10 room family business. We have hardwood floors, and we have a lot of shipments going in and out every day. Cardboard dust and various bits of debris really makes a mess on a daily basis. No one likes to clean it up, particularly since our vacuums are all designed for residences and are wimpy and cumbersome in our environment. The ProTeam backpack vacuum made it a breeze to get every nook and cranny clean! The long handle and thick felted brush tool allowed me to cover a lot of territory in a short time. I found a video online demonstrating a sweeping motion to make vacuuming more efficient. The floor tool grabbed everything along the edges and in small spaces between furniture. The accessories worked exceptionally well when cleaning behind boxes, etc.When I took this vac out of the box, I was worried because it felt very heavy. Once it was on my back, it felt very comfortable. It wasn't heavy at all. The harness is well padded and I was surprised by how comfortable it was. I had to set the backpack on a table and walk backwards into it. The base of the vacuum is thick rubber, so the unit will not slide around easily. The straps adjusted easily and it felt secure as I used it. Having the power switch on my waist was very helpful.The suction is excellent! We didn't have any trouble cleaning up the the worst corners in our office.The 50 foot cord is a heavy duty extension cord that is not built into the unit. You can easily switch it out with a shorter or longer cord that matches the electrical rating.This vacuum is great for the office, but it's also perfect for deep cleaning my home when I want to cover every square foot, from ceiling to floor. It's comfortable to use, not too loud, it's very versatile, and the quality is very evident from the moment you take out out of the box. I would highly recommend this for commercial use. Get it for your office and you won't have any trouble finding a volunteer to use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKPOVJDCB96IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NPU2N6#wasThisHelpful","RKPOVJDCB96IA","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Batiste dry shampoo works very well, after you get the hang of it. It makes hair seem fluffier, less oily, and it smells better. I bought this can to the office and had previously asked my coworkers not to shampoo today. We took turns using it, with mixed results. It was easy to initially spray too much on, which resulted in white hair. We found that it looked better if we used the end of a comb to lift sections of our hair to spray, without spraying on the outermost later of hair. Miss E is blond with brighter blond highlights. Her hair looked white and dull after using this. She was the first in line, so the next guinea pig received more careful treatment. The rest of us are brunettes and we managed to successfully freshen our hair without it looking unusual. I can't say it looked spectacular, but it did look better than the lifeless messes we walked in with. We lost a little shine, but overall our hair looked and felt cleaner. This is definitely a product I would keep on hand for one of those days when I don't have time to shampoo. I used to think dry shampoo was just something to use if you were sick or in the hospital. Now I can see it as a more routine hair care product. I like it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34RC17AFPFYFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB00DK2#wasThisHelpful","R34RC17AFPFYFO","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love a lot of things about this DVD player. It's very small, it provides clear 3D playback, it has a lot of apps, and it can double as a Playstation!  There are a few things that I don't like, such as limited audio output options and a slightly cumbersome app interface.I'm impressed by the small footprint of this unit.  It measures just 9 inches wide, 7 1/4 inches deep, and under 1 1/2 inches tall. It's barely noticeable, which is just the way I like my electronics.DVDs load and play pretty fast. Playback is clear and smooth. I connected it to a 3D TV in my bedroom, as well as a 3D Epson projector home cinema. It played regular and 3D DVDs beautifully.There are a lot of built in apps, but that's pretty standard these days. The app interface isn't the sleekest I've seen, but it's easy to use.A unique feature of this unit is the ability to stream and play PlayStation Now games. It's easy to navigate, and there are plenty of games to choose from. You need a controller, such as a DualShock 4. This controller may be wireless with a regular PlayStation, but you need to connect it to work with this system. Fortunately, extra long USB cables are very inexpensive these days. The qualtiy of your game will primarily be limited only by the quality of your Wi Fi connection. I chose to pull out the old ethernet cable for this one. It was a lot of fun for the kids and the grownups! This may not replace a PlayStation console for many people, but it's a great way to pack a lot of game into a small space for someone who doesn't have room for more, or who only plays occasionally and doesn't need more.I wish this DVD player had more audio outputs. The digital coaxial cable output is a start for many people, but I need a digital optical output (toslink). Therefore, I can't currently use this in the room I would prefer. I'll still be able to use it in my study, and the small size of the unit makes it optimal in that room.Overall, this is an excellent DVD player with a lot of options. It performs beautiful, especially at this price point. I'm happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUNJN4P6GQX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYFCJOM#wasThisHelpful","R1PUNJN4P6GQX4","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been buying these oats for several years and I love them. The flavor is always consistently fresh and delicious. I rarely run into hulls, unlike with some other brands I've tried. I don't cook them, I soak them with almond milk and fruit, such as bananas or raisins. I don't even add sugar. I mix it in the bowl and cover it, then come back after my morning shower.

"When I bought The Honest Company multi-purpose cleaner, I wondered if it would really clean well, or if it would just smell good and look pretty on the counter. I've used it on my kitchen sink, counters, stove, inside my refrigerator, on my floors, and in my bathroom. Everywhere I've used it, it's done an excellent job getting the surface clean! I've not found anything I couldn't clean as well as or better than conventional cleaning sprays.Thankfully, it also smells wonderful and looks gorgeous on the counter. The bottle is too pretty to tuck away!My only complaint is the addition of a preservative, methylisothiazolinone, that may be questionable in some circumstances. I don't know what amount of the preservative is necessary to cause a problem, but it is the last ingredient on the list. EWG ranks it 7 out of 10 on the safety scale, with 10 being the worst. They also say this is based on limited data. Use restrictions seem to be based on cosmetic use. So I guess no matter how good this smells, don't squirt any behind your ears! I personally feel comfortable using it as a household cleaner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX3TBTGSLV70T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8VVP1E#wasThisHelpful","RX3TBTGSLV70T","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gorgeous laptop, inside and out! The case is sleek and beautiful, the keyboard is large and easy to use, and the back light makes it easier at night. The touch screen removes all of the typical frustration associated with laptops since I don't have to deal with the little touch pad. I also love being able to enlarge the screen with a pinch and pull. It's so much easier on my old eyes. It's so easy to do everything I want when I'm online. It's also extremely fast to boot up and operate.I'm still getting to know Windows 10 (I'm a Mac girl) but it's easy to see that Toshiba has created an impressive laptop with all the features I need. There are plenty of ports. The screen is very bright and clear. I love the flexibility of this model because I can flip it around into a tablet, or stand it open on the table. I initially thought that was gimmicky, but now that I'm using it this way, I can definitely see the benefit for many users.I was curious why this model came with 128GB drive when the standard seems to be at least 500GB these days. I found out that Solid State Drives, such as this one, are twice as expensive to make so they usually start smaller to help keep the overall costs down. PC Mag says they are also much faster, more durable, and more efficient than regular hard drives. They are quieter because they don't have moving parts, and data is stored on chips. Apparently SSD is better if you need speed, HDD if you need more storage. I'll take speed.This laptop comes with minimal documentation - basically showing you how it can be folded in different directions, along with a drawing of the various ports. After that, you are on your own. Windows 10 looks and feels different from previous versions. I mainly use a Mac and only use a PC at work. I had to tinker with it to get the hang of it. But it was easy. The last windows computer I bought came with a backup DVD. I found a brief mention of needing to create a recovery drive for the laptop, so I bought a 32GB USB drive to create a recovery drive as directed in the help files. It says you need 16GB, but a 16GB drive only contains about 13GB of usable space. Grab a 32GB thumb drive when you order this machine.Overall, I'm very happy with this laptop. It weighs about 5 pounds, so it's easy to carry around. The size is perfect, it's much faster than I expected, and the picture is beautiful. It's pretty fantastic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R232TT3M9N69SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SBB27U#wasThisHelpful","R232TT3M9N69SE","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to create a recovery drive for my laptop. The laptop requires 16GB of space on the recover drive, and of course a 16GB drive is not sufficient since it only contains a little over 13GB of useable space. The 32GB version is very affordable, and it's definitely sufficient for the drive. My laptop did not have any problems creating the recovery drive on this unit, and my computer recognized it when inserted again.The exterior is white with a red loop end which can be attached to a keyring if you need it. The end cap on the other side closes very tightly without any risk of slipping off. I prefer the white exterior of this model because I can label it with a black sharpie.It's a great deal, it's efficient, and it seems to be well made.

"This MaxCraft tool is loaded with features that I never realized I needed. I have tested out all of the features, and they work perfectly. The unit is easy to use and it's compact. It's about 6 3/4 inches long and it weighs slightly over 6 ounces with the batteries installed.The pressure gauge seem to work very well. I tested all of my wheels, and it's so much easier than using an old fashioned pencil style pressure gauge. The digital reading is easy to see, with numbers about 3/8 inch high and a blue back-light for day or night viewing.I tested the seat belt cutter on card stock, which slid right through it. Then I found some old webbing in the garage and it also cut through it with power. I had to tug a little for it to make the first break, but the rest was like butter.The last time I owned a map light, it was installed in my 1979 Pinto Wagon. It swung down and pivoted in any direction. I was impressed. The map light in this tool is red, to reduce eye strain, but I can't imagine it being useful for anything. I didn't read maps in 1979, and I don't plan to start now, especially since everything I need is available at the push of a button. The white LED light is going to be more helpful.  It's not a substitute for a good flashlight, but it's still a good addition to this tool.The glass hammer pops out with the flick of a switch. I didn't test it on glass, but I did take out outside and banged it on a brick. It broke the brick, and it stayed in place without folding back into the tool.I never knew a product like this existed until this one came along. I'm not surprised by it, I just never gave it any thought. I try to be a safe driver, and I never think about the worst that can happen. When I mentioned to my coworkers that I was getting this, I was surprised by how many people either already owned this type of tool, or were planning to buy one. I guess I was the only one that felt invincible. After reading all of the ways this tool can be used, and giving it more serious thought, I'm glad to have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35D95VR4OJP1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNM1KM#wasThisHelpful","R35D95VR4OJP1E","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put this Germ Guardian air purifier in my study. I have the slightly larger version in my kitchen. My dogs hang out in my study a lot, and I spend the mornings with the windows open. The result is a room full of allergens when the windows are closed. My study is small, 8x12, so I don't need a larger air purifier. I like this model because it's small, but it's very effective. It's only 22 inches high, and the sides are about 9x7. This makes it so easy to find a place for it. It needs about a foot in every direction to operate properly, so you can't put it against the wall.  A little bit of normal maintenance is required, such as quick monthly swipe of the filter with your vacuum. The HEPA filter will need to be replaced every 6 to 9 months, and the UV light will also need to be replaced at some point. Both are super easy to access, so it will be a breeze. The machine will let you know when you need to replace either part.This particular model has a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) for tobacco for this unit is 118. That makes it perfect for small to medium size rooms. This unit can clean the air in a room up to 183 square feet, which is a pretty good sized room.It's very quiet! There are 3 power levels, as well as a button to turn on the UV light if you wish. The lowest setting is so quiet that you can barely hear it. If you have an odor problem, or if have a lot of allergens in the room, you can turn it up to medium or high power. They are still not too loud, unlike many other air purifiers on the market. The air in my study cleaned up very quickly. I left it on overnight, and when I walked in the study it smelled like nothing. You couldn't tell that my dogs have spent so much time in there, and it didn't smell like an old study. It smelled like nothing.

"This sauce is delicious! As described, it starts with a little bit of sweet and tangy flavors that have a lot of depth. The flavor is fresh and clean, and I appreciate the lack of chemicals and artificial ingredients. You can tell that they didn't take any shortcuts in making this sauce. The rich flavor is followed by spicy kick that you won't soon forget :) I'll be more sparing with this sauce next time because a little goes a long way, both in flavor and in heat.Regarding freshness: I ordered this sauce on July 24, 2015, and the bottle has has a best by date of Feb 10, 2016.

"I bought this Roku 2 about 6 months ago and I love it. It's not my first Roku - this one is replacing one of the earlier generation models that I've used consistently for many years. I cut the cable many years ago and never looked back after discovering Roku. The older models had a lot of bells and whistles that the new ones lack, but the technology was older and couldn't keep up with the new apps, etc. I chose the Roku 2 over the Roku 3 because I needed an audio output to connect to my Epson projector, since I don't have a traditional setup or television where I use it. The original Roku could handle a digital optical audio cable, s-video, composite video, component video, hdmi, etc, and it had an Ethernet port. As Roku continued to develop the inside of the box, they excluded the various ports that could have provided so much benefit to customers. When I finally needed a more advanced Roku to handle the newer apps, I had to give up all of the connections that made the original Roku so useful. Otherwise, the Roku performs fabulously. My apps load quickly, the unit doesn't lag, and it makes my life a little nicer. My fingers are crossed that they will release a Roku 4 model that will include, at the very least, a digital optical audio output.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FPV98V5KKKQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5NB7MW#wasThisHelpful","R1FPV98V5KKKQE","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently switched to Wellness Simple Salmon and Potato because one of my chihuahuas has shown signs of allergies, which our vet said could be caused by chicken. It was hard to find a poultry free, grain free food that was also small enough for his tiny mouth. We gave this food a try and we're now on our third bag. It's working well for him. The kibble looks and smells like cat food. The pieces are very small triangles, and they smell fishy. However, it doesn't smell bad or too strong. He loves it and he scratches and chews much less now.  I'm happy with the short ingredient list, and the dog food advisor ranks this food very highly.

"I bought this container to make kimchi because I wanted something foolproof, as well as something that would help keep my fridge smelling fresh. The e-jen did everything I hoped it would! It's very well made, is the perfect size for my needs, and it made making kimchi less messy, less smelly, and much easier.The plastic container is not flimsy, and the vacuum liner fits snugly in place. The hinges on the locking lid just fold away from the lid, if that makes sense, and are not the type with pins. However, they seem durable and I don't think they will fail on me. This is one area where many similar containers fail, since repeated use can cause them to break.I bought the .9 gallon size. My kimchi recipe called for 5 pounds of napa cabbage. That's a lot of cabbage, but by the time I brined my cabbage and it shrunk and became pliable, my completed recipe fit perfectly in the e-jen with room to spare. The inner vacuum liner slipped easily into place. I unplugged it while I slid it down onto the kimchi until just a little liquid came out, then I plugged up the hole. I used a paper towel to blot up the liquid, then I closed the outer lid securely on the container. The next night, I peeked and the liner had raised up due to the gasses from the kimchi. I unplugged it and pushed it down again as before. The next day, I put it in the fridge.I didn't notice any smell coming from the container.  It's sealed tightly! In the past, I have found that produce next to a jar of kimchi would spoil quickly due to the gasses coming from the jar. I once watched a lemon turn black on the side next to the jar. I didn't have any problems with the e-jen. My fridge smells normal. My kimchi turned out great.I'm very happy with my e-jen. I had it in my wish list for a long time before I finally treated myself, and I wish I had bought it sooner. I'm going to buy another so I can make two different types at the same time. I would definitely recommend it to my own friends and family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R379Q4M8JZ4U1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M40ANMO#wasThisHelpful","R379Q4M8JZ4U1M","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the compact design of the Germ Guardian air purifier. It does a great job removing odors, and it isn't too loud. It doesn't have an automatic sensor, so it stays on at one level until you adjust it or turn it off. The sleek finish makes it easy to keep clean, and the filters are easy to replace.The Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) for tobacco for this unit is 129. CADR ratings are usually provided for tobacco, dust, and pollen. Germ Guardian only publishes the CADR for tobacco, but that's usually a pretty good indication of how well the model performs. CADR can range from 10 to 450, and the rating determine what size room it can handle. The higher the rating, the larger the room. This unit is efficient up to 199 square feet.This unit is tall, at 28 inches, but it measures just 7 inches wide and 9 inches deep. You have to place it at least 1 foot away from your wall or furniture, so it gets good circulation. The air blows out both sides of the unit, unlike many air purifiers that blow out the top or back. The air is pulled in through the back.This air purifier is made of glossy black plastic and it doesn't have grooves or textures that trap dust. It's easy to wipe clean as needed. The blue circular light, as shown in the photo, turns on when you have the UV option enabled. Otherwise, the front is solid black.I put this air purifier in my kitchen because the tall, compact size fit well in there. I have a smaller unit in my study. I live in an old house, have two indoor dogs, and I cook a lot of fish. I am the target market for air purifiers and I've used quite a few different brands and models in the past. Some work better than others. Some are practically worthless. I would rank Germ Guardian at the top of the list for efficiency. It does a great job and doesn't take up a lot of space. I wish it had a sensor so it could increase power as needed, but that's my only complaint about this unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEULC972P3IP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5ZB36O#wasThisHelpful","R2WEULC972P3IP","A33PVCHCQ2BTN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PVCHCQ2BTN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The insert is about the weight of photo paper, so you could easily cut a 3x5 or 4x6 picture down to slip inside this case.

" 1:04 Mins This game is like a 3D version of scrabble. It really gets the mind going as you are not only trying to build words across and down like a crossword puzzle, but you can also build the words upwards by adding letter tiles on top of one another. Takes a little bit of brain power, but you can finish the game in under 30 minutes. I like that you can literally change the game and make it harder for your opponents to plan out their next turn.The board game is raised. The tiles are nice and large.

"Update 10/14 After using these headphones for a few days my son gave them back to me. ""Mom, I can't wear these. They are painful. They make my head hurt. I would give them one out of 5 stars"" So there you have it.I expected more from these headsets even given that they are priced right around $20. The head set came separated in the box and I had to put the headband together. It wasn't really hard to do, but because of the construction I was afraid I was going to break them before I even had a chance to try them out.Pros:1. Price is right2. Flexible microphone bar.3. Ear piece was comfortable.4. Standard audio jack so that you can use these headphones with XBox and other devices.5. Audio input and output work well.Cons:1. Despite padding, headband is not comfortable for long. In fact, my son described them as painful.2. Feels like construction is flimsy3.

" 3:50 Mins Mountain House has a very good reputation among Scouts, hikers and campers for have above average dehydrated meals. This 3-day emergency package includes some of their most popular meals.  My Boy Scout son favorites include the chicken and rice, chicken teriyaki and biscuits and gravy.These meals have a shelf life of over 12 years. (Kinda of scary when you think about it).  I find them very easy to prepare. You simply add the correct amount of boiling water, stir, seal package and wait 10-14 minutes (stirring once about 4 minutes into the process). The packages range from 2.5-3 servings of 1 cup. On a hiking trip my teenage son eats at least one entire package as his big meal of the day. One cup serving ranges from 200-300 calories. So, if this truly is your only source of food for a few days you will not starve, but you won't have the calorie intake of your normal American meal.I think the food tastes ok. I cook a lot from scratch, so to me these meals have a very packaged taste to them. The quality of the dehydrated food, the variety offered, and the ease of preparing can't be beat.  Also, these meals individually sell for between $6-$8 apiece. So purchasing a case like this saves a little bit of money as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3I8DFLKEFA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ER40MS#wasThisHelpful","R2M3I8DFLKEFA9","A3BVDW4DOLJAN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVDW4DOLJAN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I applied generously to my face as instructions stated and was surprised to find waiting the two minutes as the packaging suggested that the mud was still very wet. After I rinsed it off, my face felt a little tighter, pores looked a little smaller, and skin felt a little softer.

I appreciate that it doesn't seem like a lot of other ingredients were added. A list of ingredients was not provided on/in the package I received, which knocked this product down a star.According to the AHAVA website the full list of ingredients for this mud mask is more complex than I thought it would be:Kaolin, Silt (Dead Sea Mud), Aqua (Mineral Spring Water), Cocamide MEA & DMDM Hydantoin & Sodium Lauroamphoacetate & Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Propanediol (Corn derived Glycol), Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Ceteareth-30 & Cetearyl Alcohol, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Water), Sodium Lactate, Zinc Oxide, Caprylyl Glycol & Chlorphenesin & Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol (Pro Vitamin B5) , Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Oil, Stearyl Alcohol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Peg-40 Stearate, Allantoin, Lactic Acid, Dimethicone, Sorbitan Tristearate, Xanthan Gum, PEG-5 Cocoate & PEG-8 Dicocoate & PEG-9 & Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Triclosan, Methylisothiazolinone, BHA, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)Not super impressed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMDT1NVIFGM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TMRV8Y#wasThisHelpful","RFMDT1NVIFGM4","A3BVDW4DOLJAN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVDW4DOLJAN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:04 Mins When we went on vacation we took one of these docking stations along with my hubby's tablet. It  allowed us to plug his tablet into the TV in our room and access our Amazon Prime videos and Netflix. Besides that my hubby has several of these that he uses at home, his office and while traveling. The docking station allows him to plug in and use several different devices, like printers, keyboards, screens, portable hard drives, etc, to his tablet or laptop.The advantages of this docking station:1. Very easy to set-up.2. High speed, with one gigabit port and USB 3 ports.3. Stands upright, so it doesn't take up much desk space.4. Power plug can be adapted to use outside the United States (additional purchase required).There are 2 USB 3.0A ports as well as 1 USB 3.0B to connect to your laptop/tablet and 4 USB 2.0A ports. A possible disadvantage to some, actually, is that it stands upright - a double edge sword - since it cannot be hidden away and it raises the cables up off the desk into view.  Sits nicely, however, next to your monitor so you can easily access the ports, headphone jacks, microphone jack, etc.USB 3.0 provides exceptional speed, over 10x the speed of USB 2.0.  In fact, using USB 3.0 you have theoretical maximum throughput of 5gbps (640MBps), so the I/O of an external drive nearly equals the speed of an internal drive.  With 2 ports you can connect two back up/storage devices for redundancy, even setting them up with RAID 0 to double the size, or RAID 1 to provide redundancy.  For a really good backup solution, plug a 4 bay RAID box into one of the USB 3.0 ports using RAID 5,6, or 10 - you will never lose your data and can set up incremental backups of your device(s) you plug into the docking station.I give this docking station five stars.

" 3:50 Mins Mountain House has a very good reputation among Scouts, hikers and campers for have above average dehydrated meals. This 3-day emergency package includes some of their most popular meals.  My Boy Scout son favorites include the chicken and rice, chicken teriyaki and biscuits and gravy.These meals have a shelf life of over 12 years. (Kinda of scary when you think about it).  I find them very easy to prepare. You simply add the correct amount of boiling water, stir, seal package and wait 10-14 minutes (stirring once about 4 minutes into the process). The packages range from 2.5-3 servings of 1 cup. On a hiking trip my teenage son eats at least one entire package as his big meal of the day. One cup serving ranges from 200-300 calories. So, if this truly is your only source of food for a few days you will not starve, but you won't have the calorie intake of your normal American meal.I think the food tastes ok. I cook a lot from scratch, so to me these meals have a very packaged taste to them. The quality of the dehydrated food, the variety offered, and the ease of preparing can't be beat.  Also, these meals individually sell for between $6-$8 apiece. So purchasing a case like this saves a little bit of money as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNE4RG5YXPVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L49XDK0#wasThisHelpful","R1BNE4RG5YXPVQ","A3BVDW4DOLJAN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BVDW4DOLJAN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You have to have the time and forethought to spray the poo-pourri into the toilet before you go. This eliminates most parents of young children and woman over the age of 45, where getting to the toilet on time is the greater battle.2.

"""Who is like the Lord our God, Who dwells on high, Who humbles Himself to behold The things that are in the heavens and in the earth?"" -- Psalm 113:5-6 (NKJV)Calling The Finkler Question a funny book is like calling Hamlet a humorous play ... just because it has the gravediggers commenting on a skull. There certainly is humor in The Finkler Question, humor designed to soften what otherwise would be too much angst and gloom for many readers to sustain.So if you are looking for a good old belly laugh, look elsewhere.If you want to learn more about identity, this is your book. Howard Jacobson has succeeded in providing the kind of multi-layer story that delivers new insights each time it is reread or thought about again. While on the surface the main story line is about a life-changing event that causes a Gentile to see himself differently, the application of that story is much broader.While I'm sure many people who are Jewish or know much about Jewish life will point out the inaccuracies in what is portrayed, I think that they will miss what I take to be the author's point in choosing to do so: identity looks much different from without than from within. For that reason, Jewish people will probably ""get"" more of the book's intended message ... to the extent that they don't take the details as an attempt to portray their own lives and beliefs.The book also has much to say about the forms of identity that form our foundation, contrasting identity through birth, connection to others, relative to others, and in contrast to others. Through the story's development, it's clear that Mr. Jacobson favors seeking a firmer foundation based on a sense of the uniqueness that defines a person.It's not an easy read. You have to chew on it. I took the book in small doses and felt rewarded for doing so over four weeks. Stop whenever you've got a mouthful and don't start again until that mouthful is swallowed and digested.Before you leave the book behind, reflect on who you are? Who is that person?Bravo, Mr. Jacobson!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6YGBXSHKT2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BV2NCVA#wasThisHelpful","RW6YGBXSHKT2A","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden."" -- Matthew 5:14 (NKJV)I admire anyone who attempts to write a novel called ""Paris: The Novel."" I think it's an impossible task, but I deeply appreciate the opportunity to enjoy the best of what is provided. And I thought that the best in this book was pretty interesting: glimpses of the Eiffel Tower that reminded me of visits there and extended my understanding of its structure and history, spotlights placed on some of the lesser-known parts of French history (such as the Commune), and an interesting character who is well-woven into much of the plot (Thomas Gascon).Unfortunately, the book isn't as consistently interesting, focused, and detailed. The characters are often little more than sketches. And Mr. Rutherfurd loves to quickly switch centuries to make ironic connections between families that must be more amusing to him than they were to me. Many favorite spots in Paris receive only a quick dab. I think the book's plan was too ambitious. Cut it back to just following the last 150 years with fewer of the best-developed characters, and I think the book could have been a big winner. It's not a strike-out by any means, but more of a bloop hit rather than a line-drive after making solid contact.I do recommend the book, but don't expect that you will find the same Paris that you know and love. In many cases, you'll get more of a passing reference to names and places that are familiar ... but little else. The book is actually more focused on France than on Paris. But if it had been called ""France: The Novel,"" the difference between the title and scope would have been even more obvious.Pay attention to the Family Tree in the front of the book (better yet, stick a bookmark there for easier access), or you may find that you are struggling to keep track of characters whose names are different, but whose characteristics aren't especially memorable.One final word: If you aren't especially interested in how the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower were built, you won't like this book as much as I did.Solid work, Mr. Rutherfurd!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KCD9NKY9HO2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535309#wasThisHelpful","R1KCD9NKY9HO2T","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."" -- Exodus 4:10 (NKJV)If you have never read a Nora Roberts novel, you will probably like this book better than I did. I expected a lot more than the book delivered. As I read it, the book felt to me as if it had been written as a brief plot draft and padded out to novel length. There was enough here to make a nice, tight novella ... but not enough for a novel. As a result, it's oh so slow!Having shared those views, the book has one redeeming quality: Abra Walsh is an interesting character, well developed in every way. Otherwise, I would have described Whiskey Beach as a one-star book. I hope Ms. Roberts will write a whole book about Abra Walsh. Now, that would make for good reading!The lead character, Eli Landon, reminds me of the lead sinkers that I put on fishing line to get the bait below the surface where only the fish will see it. Abra Walsh needed a male foil, but Eli Landon is as leaden a one as I've had the misfortune to read about in some time. Ms. Roberts could have just called him, ""John Victim,"" and let him soak in his victimhood for 80 percent of the book ... and few would have noticed the difference.There are some tiny mysteries in the book (not much more than what would sustain a short story), and I don't think those will draw you in.While there is a love story here, it's more of a ""nurse Abra takes on the self-crippled victim"" than a love story that would inspire many readers.It's very watered-down whiskey, indeed!","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPMFJM78C966Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399159894#wasThisHelpful","RPMFJM78C966Q","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."" -- Matthew 11:30 (NKJV)I have been using a reliable Lawn Boy for 29 years. My Dad was a gardener, and he relied on them for decades before that. Carburetor troubles this spring meant that the Lawn Boy was in the shop. Then, the rains came. My grass was two feet tall when I finally ordered this mower from Amazon.com. Although Amazon.com said it was in stock, they didn't send it for a week after I ordered it. But it came in two days.Having read that some people had trouble with this model and gasoline, I carefully read the directions which said ""unleaded regular gasoline with no more than 10 percent ethanol."" I bought some, poured the oil from the box into the crankcase, pulled the starter very easily, and took off with my new mower. It easily cut and mulched everything I tried it on, including vines creeping in from the forest. The engine never faltered, and I just went forward. The work was much easier than with my Lawn Boy ... and went faster.I think this mower is a great deal.

"""There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment."" -- 1 John 4:18 (NKJV)Regardless of your ultimate view of this book, I think you'll agree that pages 1 through 49 are as well written as anything you've read in a long time. Bravo, Mr. Hosseini! They are a remarkable achievement!!While anyone would envy an author who accomplished so much to open a novel, there's a problem. Readers expect the rest of the book to maintain that remarkably high standard.I believe that Mr. Hosseini has the talent to do so. The plot for this book, its scope, and length make it impossible to do so. You couldn't write War and Peace in many fewer words ... or a Tale of Two Cities. And the Mountains Echoed needs to be two or three times longer to flesh out his plan for the book.Without that length, the book comes across as a series of short stories briefly connected to one or the other of the two siblings in the book's beginning, Abdullah and Pari. Each story is its own morality tale about how we treat other people, including those in our families. Within the whole book there are themes connecting suffering, responsibility, and morality. Some characters adhere to timeless values, at least in parts of their lives, while others talk a good game ... but don't act in accord with their words. The result is a tapestry capturing Afghanistan yesterday and today against a backdrop of humanity over all times.One of the book's major accomplishments is to present some of the most thought-provoking writing I recall about how appearance affects our lives and our behavior. I would love to see Mr. Hosseini return to this subject in future books. He obviously has a deep understanding that can inform us all.But please do write a book next time that's as long as your subject deserves, Mr. Hosseini! We'll read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGW7KOQ3JM9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159463176X#wasThisHelpful","R1BGW7KOQ3JM9M","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A faithful witness does not lie,But a false witness will utter lies."" -- Proverbs 14:5 (NKJV)John Le Carr has lost none of his ability to imagine, describe, and develop compelling characters that advance what he likes. You'll remember several of these characters for some time to come, I'm sure. I was most impressed.He also presents the plotting and execution of secret tasks in nimbly realistic and memorable ways.I thought the book went very wrong, however, in characterizing those representing what Mr. Carr doesn't like and in plotting the actions that they take. These parts of the book weren't just poorly done; they were impossible to swallow.Consequently, the book presents a mixture of writing that might characterize Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde alternating as coauthors. The mixture was most unsatisfying for me.I would have liked the book better if I had stopped reading around page 200. I don't remember having that reaction to any of Mr. Le Carr's earlier works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10REKDFGPUQFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670014893#wasThisHelpful","R10REKDFGPUQFV","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Faithful are the wounds of a friend,But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful."" -- Proverbs 27:6 (NKJV)When Ace Atkins wrote Lullaby, I was struck by how well balanced the book was for bringing in readers' favorite characters and story elements. At that time, I opined that the real test of his ability to carry the series would be to write a story that wasn't so typical of what everyone loves. I'm pleased to see that Mr. Atkins stepped up to the challenge and gave us a humdinger of a story that contains no Hawk and not much Susan. The book is distinguished by turning Henry Cimoli into a more significant character than in any earlier book, a major challenge that he carried off very well. We also enjoy further development of Zebulon Sixkill as a character.To me, however, the most breathtaking part of the story was pitting two fictional gambling barons against one another, two characters who remind me of two such real moguls. The closeness in the characterizations gave me a feeling of almost reading nonfiction. I was really impressed by how well the plot was crafted to take into account the personalities of two such characters.While Spenser will never be the same, he's in good hands. That's more than I can say of most series continuations written by new authors.If you miss the old terse dialogue, just go back and read some. You'll never meet its like, I'm sure.Well done, Mr. Atkins!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7OZFZIQ184Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399161570#wasThisHelpful","R1N7OZFZIQ184Y","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""This I recall to my mind,Therefore I have hope."" -- Lamentations 3:21 (NKJV)I recently had the pleasure of sitting in on a class led by Professor Langer. As she referred to so many ground-breaking studies that have become part of the foundation of how we consider improving thinking processes, I realized it was time to read more of her work. She recommended I start with this book.Since I like to learn while driving, I opted for the unabridged audio CD set, which was perfect for my purposes. As someone who often conducts experiments to increase mindfulness, I was pleased that overviews of her methodologies were included along with descriptions of the results and their practical implications.The book opens with compelling examples of how we categorize things in such ways that we cannot easily access helpful knowledge, even when the potential rewards are great. I see this problem all the time, and it made me smile to listen to this material. She then turns to other reasons we behave without considering our options, such as automatically deferring to ""authority"" even when such authority is based only in appearance. From there, Professor Langer makes a compelling case why we should seek to do better.In Part Two, the book explains how to be more mindful. I thought that Chapter 5 was especially helpful in addressing the need to create new mental categories, welcome new information, seek more than one view, seek control over the context, emphasize method over result, and grasp other perspectives on what mindfulness is.Anyone over the age of 45 will find Chapters 6 and 10 (Mindful Aging and Minding Matters: Mindfulness and Health) to be worth the price of the book.Chapter 9 on prejudice will be an eye-opener for most people. It should be required reading for all.If you haven't read any of her works, you've probably heard them described in other books. Why not learn from the source?Read this book ...

"""Jesus said to him, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk.'"" -- John 5:8 (NKJV)What could bring more anticipation than having Easy Rawlins return from what looked like the end in Blonde Faith? With so many years between novels, I'm sure you are expecting the best of the bunch. Well, I hope you find it to be so.I didn't, but I'm still grateful for the chance to read the book. I was again impressed by how well Walter Mosley captures what I remember of race relations in LA during the late 1960s.Given that it looked as if Easy was gone for good, Walter Mosley does a fine job of providing a credible explanation for his unlikely survival. I almost felt as if I was with Mouse struggling to bring Easy back up to the road.My objections to the book are focused in two areas: Easy comes back to full strength much too fast for someone with his injuries ... and he does so with a not-quite-credible reliance on Mama Jo's Gator's Blood. I felt as if I could see Walter Mosley's tongue sticking deep into his cheek as he wrote these sections.The mystery and investigation are vintage Easy Rawlins, aside from my objections.

"""If the ax is dull,And one does not sharpen the edge,Then he must use more strength;"" -- Ecclesiastes 10:10 (NKJV)I usually read mysteries because I like the mental challenge of trying to solve them before the detective or the author reveals all, the characters and what they are doing interest me, or the setting is one that I enjoy. Looking for Yesterday clearly appeals mostly to my liking for San Francisco and the surrounding Bay area.The mystery's solution stands out far too much in advance like, well, Telegraph Hill does when you are in that part of San Francisco. Sharon McCone is mostly talking to herself or to someone I didn't care for in the book. I could have skipped either kind of dialogue and not have been diminished. It was fun to read, once again, about San Francisco and some of the surrounding areas.I haven't said this before about this series, but you could definitely skip this book and not miss much.

"""Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines."" -- Hebrews 13:9 (NKJV)Having a variety of authors can be a great blessing to a series such as this one. They can each bring something fresh and interesting to the story outline, along with their own unique styles. Occasionally, such a choice will misfire. That's what appears to have happened here.I don't know why David Baldacci departed from the character profiles by so much in this story, but it could be that no one was willing to tell him that he blew it. After all, he might get grumpy and not help out again. Publishers worry about such things. Readers should hope that he won't come back to the 39 clues.The Cahills vs. Vespers series started off with great promise ... and sustained it pretty well through five books. Then, well, we have Day of Doom ... which doomed the series.I don't see how you can avoid reading Day of Doom ... because you'll want to know how this series ends. But you won't want to own this book. Borrow it from a friend or the library. I'm sure there's no long list to take it out.If you think you want to read a David Baldacci thriller, try The Hit instead.Check out the reviews before you start reading any future series about the 39 clues characters.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4EJ909AZ0ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545324165#wasThisHelpful","R3U4EJ909AZ0ZU","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""For in much wisdom is much grief,And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow."" -- Ecclesiastes 1:18 (NKJV)I believe that your reaction to this book depends totally on whether you already crunch and reuse all available data. If you do, it's old news. If you don't, you may feel that the floor has been tilted a bit in favor of those who have and know how to use the data. In the latter case, first appreciating that data-driven learning can be more valuable than theory-testing learning can be quite an eye-opener. You may not agree. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't.If you aren't a data jock, the book has accessible examples and anecdotes that you will probably understand just fine. If you are a data jock, the content may seem, well, ""Elementary, my dear Dr. Watson.""I thought the most interesting parts related to how privacy might be protected against unanticipated invasions by those who are incautious in plowing ahead without considering who will get hurt and how.The case for not needing to know cause-and-effect is greatly overstated here. One of the best potential uses of data-driven analysis is identifying what combinations of changes may work best with one another in a new business model, an improved strategy, or an upgraded business process. If you don't understand cause-and-effect in seeking to make such improvements, you'll make a big mess most of the time. That's also true in other complex environments, such as many medical ones. The benefits of one such cause-and-effect based improvement will usually run rings around the kind of incremental enhancements described in this book from acting on merely data-driven conclusions.I've graded the book for its value to someone who is new to the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKT74UKD38U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009N08NKW#wasThisHelpful","R3KKT74UKD38U","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers."" -- 1 Samuel 31:3 (NKJV)Will Robie is back. Once again he's sent after a member of his own organization, this time a highly talented assassin, Jessica Reel, he knows. As you can imagine, Robie finds this troubling, even in the emotion-free zone that he tries to maintain. He also wonders why Jessica has been assassinating other members of the organization. What could her reason be?Assassin versus assassin is a familiar theme in the thriller literature. It can provide some astonishingly interesting confrontations and fascinating plot developments. I give Mr. Baldacci full credit for putting in some good surprises in the book, the points that I'm sure are contributing to this book being a hit in the book business. However, I wouldn't be treating you fairly if I didn't point out that on the scale of such thrillers The Hit is pretty average.The ""miss"" elements here involve making Reel's motivations far too easily disclosed, presenting the ""bad"" people a little too early and a little too clearly, and having a final crisis that doesn't seem quite up to the way it's built up in the book's plot.I thought that the book was an easy read and sustained my interest. It is more of a thriller than it is a suspense novel, something that would have made the book more appealing in my opinion. The book has a few scenes that will definitely get your pulse racing, which is good.I'm not aware of a better thriller in the last few weeks, so if you are looking forward to one there can be no doubt that The Hit will do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TAQSYEOFOMV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455521213#wasThisHelpful","R2TAQSYEOFOMV3","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""For how great is its goodness And how great its beauty!"" -- Zechariah 9:17 (NKJV)Just to be clear, I'm reviewing the unabridged audio CD version of Girl in Hyacinth Blue. I highly recommend listening to, rather than reading, this intriguing book. The audio version will make the insights of Ms. Vreeland's stories more accessible to you.The Girl in Hyacinth Blue has a simple premise: Start with the current owner of a beloved painting and move back in time to learn about its previous owners and its ultimate creative origin, expressed through what the painting means to them and how it affects their lives.Adding these dimensions to fiction about a rare (imaginary) Vermeer painting certainly expanded my horizons. Although I certainly own art that others must have possessed and valued before me, I had never given them any thought (except for a name captured in a friendly inscription). Yet they were there before me, all the time! I must also admit that I tend to focus more on how others and I react to art today, rather than how people in the past did, or how the works were created. I am extremely grateful to Ms. Vreeland for adding this perspective to my life.Let me make a few things clear about the book that may be more important to you than they were to me. Ms. Vreeland's mastery of writing about Vermeer's work isn't that of an art historian, but it's rather more like that of an art enthusiast. If you take your commentary on art seriously, your nerves will screech a bit in places. Ms. Vreeland is also not an historian. She writes more accurately about the human heart than about the times that the fictional events took place. The experience is a bit like reading a thriller of a mystery, where you want some vivid characters, some surprises, and a gradual unveiling of an interesting set of facts and truths. Since I like mystery thrillers and collect art, the book was perfect for me.Thank you, Ms. Vreeland! You've expanded my awareness quite a bit!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8KIRAHA1O5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565115449#wasThisHelpful","RF8KIRAHA1O5H","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."" -- 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NKJV)Bleak House is Dickens' most complete statement of the virtues of self-sacrificing love. I am very sorry that I waited so many years to listen to the uplifting reading of this outstanding book by David Case.Lest you make the same mistake I did in putting off this joy, let me explain how I ended up deciding to avoid Bleak House for so many years. First, of course, there's that title. You have to admit that you probably don't get excited about learning about a bleak house. On this point, let me assure you that the literal bleak house in this book is anything but. Second, there's the book's opening and continuing theme about lives being destroyed by the evils of the Chancery court, most vividly expressed by the suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. One of my law professors read part of that opening on my first day of classes in graduate school, and it made me think that surely the rest of the book must be nearly as depressing and discouraging. Wrong again! There are some very commendable characters and actions in the book that would inspire anyone.Bleak House essentially describes England from the perspective of Miss Esther Summerson beginning with her guardianship by one John Jarndyce, one of the affected parties in the Jarndyce and Jarndyce chancery case. As Dickens does in many of his best novels, these two characters provide the examples of right behavior that encourage the reader while advancing the plot. Throughout the story, you'll find more characters that will stick in your memory than I suspect you are used to finding in a single novel. In that sense, Bleak House is a bit like a movie with a cast filled with Academy Award winners.In fact, while there are certainly many sad events in the book, I think you'll spend more time smiling than feeling sad.Enjoy this amazing book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R1OT2PBGBU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400132649#wasThisHelpful","R3R1OT2PBGBU3","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing."" -- James 1:4 (NKJV)This book cannot be too highly regarded for providing a valuable template for football coaches and showing how to thoroughly and effectively organize any complicated undertaking. Bill Walsh reveals a combination of intelligence, character, integrity, and attention to detail unequaled in my experience.As much as I admired watching Bill Walsh coach the 49ers, I think the on-the-field results were never nearly as impressive as this book is in explaining the foundations for all of that success. Many people succeed for either the wrong reasons or due to circumstances. Bill Walsh clearly succeeded due to intense and careful preparation. It's fascinating to consider how much thought and effort went into his coaching methods.Having attended more football training camp sessions than I would care to admit, I learned more about what was supposed to be going on during such a practice by reading this book than I have by attending all those practices.If you want to know where you stand as a person, as a coach, as a leader, and as a role model, compare yourself to what you find here. You won't like by how much you fall short, but you'll surely know how to improve.In my case, the lesson is that I'm lazy about developing the details and drilling them into others. I need to change that, and I will use this book as a guide ... even though I don't have any intention of ever coaching football. You will also benefit, if you will but give yourself a chance to make such comparisons.Bravo, Bill Walsh!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20W1KU6WUT42W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1571671722#wasThisHelpful","R20W1KU6WUT42W","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""But this is a people robbed and plundered; All of them are snared in holes, And they are hidden in prison houses; They are for prey, and no one delivers; For plunder, and no one says, 'Restore!'"" -- Isaiah 42:22 (NKJV)If you are like me, you've been reading translations of Harry Hole novels for some time. Those references to solving crime in Australia have probably both baffled and intrigued you. Well, you can find out what it was all about by reading The Bat, the first Harry Hole novel.If you haven't been reading the Harry Hole books, then you have a great many treats ahead of you. I think you'll like the series best if you read the books chronologically by beginning with The Bat. While it's certainly not the best book in the series, it's a solid foundation for understanding and more greatly appreciating the later books.Harry in Australia is like an aardvark at a black tie dinner: he doesn't really fit there. Nevertheless, he feels called to find a cruel killer who has stolen a young life in a most violent and degrading way. While he's supposed to be there just so show the Norwegian flag, Harry takes as active a role as he would have at home.He quickly figures out that there's something very strange going on, but it's a big puzzle. In fact, Jo Nesbo clearly wrote this book to be jointly appealing for its flawed hero, our Harry, and its unusual mystery. Of the two, Harry is more appealing to me than the mystery. Solving the murder feels a bit too contrived.While there are lots of references to sights and places in Australia, the book doesn't feel fully placed there. Don't pick up the book to see if it reminds you of all your good times in Sydney. It won't.Nevertheless, there's a charm to a novel where readers are treated as though they had a mind, such that the story jumps ahead in rapid ways to action sequences in ways that require filling in the blanks. I like to do that. If you don't, you won't like the book as much as I did.Some of the action sequences are quite interesting in their conceptions and descriptions. Good going, Jo!The book has some startlingly original characters in it in terms of their backgrounds and preferences. I found that these details gave the story an edge that I liked.There's a deep irony in the book that makes the book more appealing, as well. If you don't care for irony, you'll just think the book is too long.Well, it could have been edited down to good effect by about 15 to 20 percent. There are loose sections that don't advance much of anything.But don't miss it. Harry Hole is a piece of work, and you need to see this part!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJT3P8LJ5SC9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099581876#wasThisHelpful","RJT3P8LJ5SC9L","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope."" -- Romans 5:3-4 (NKJV)If you are a fan of the past novels in this series, don't miss this one! It has developments that will interest you.Since I started reading mystery novels more years ago than I care to recall, I've always been drawn to difficult puzzles, fair clues, subtle misdirections, and the opportunity to ""solve"" the crime before the author reveals what has happened. In recent years I've noticed that some mystery novels have become more like novels and less like traditional mysteries. Such works have to attract us by either by being exceptionally well written or having intriguing characters whose lives interest series readers.Most people who have read the Aime Leduc books quickly notice that she's not a great detective. The ""mysteries"" are often not very mysterious. And in many of the books, Aime isn't the most interesting character. Her partner, Ren Friant, often grabs that distinction. In other cases, the victims and criminals steal the show.In this book an unexpected thing happened to me, something that rarely occurs: I became so interested in the subplots and character developments involving Aime and Ren that I was perfectly happy not paying much attention to the murder mystery. I think that Cara Black has hit her stride in this novel in a way that promises to make this an endearing and enduring series, even if Aime never gets any better as a detective and the mysteries don't improve. Of course, that wonderful character, Paris, appears in all of the stories. Now, what's not to like about a book that takes you all around Paris?I am excited about what will come next in the series. Keep up the good work, Ms. Black!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39KQ7RH6GCTHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ADFHXY#wasThisHelpful","R39KQ7RH6GCTHS","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Furthermore, whom should I serve?"" -- 2 Samuel 16:19 (NKJV)Most people have few problems deciding whom they should serve.

It's a calling with her.I don't often have the pleasure to read about the life of such a person. I felt blessed by this opportunity.Many readers will enjoy (as I did) gaining a better sense of what it's like to grow up with Type 1 diabetes, be of Puerto Rican ancestry, and to face challenges for which one has little preparation to make things easier.I was intrigued by her descriptions of learning to be an effective prosecutor. Most memoirs skip over the details of such trials by fire.Be aware that this is not an autobiography. It isn't rigorously capturing a life, bur rather giving her thoughts about her experiences ... through the time when she was first appointed to be a Federal district judge.I don't know another person who has worn the black robes who has been so candid and open about a personal life before sitting behind the bench. I admire her for doing so.If you read only one memoir this year, I commend this one to you as an excellent choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KY0KAJHT2N2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594882#wasThisHelpful","R3KY0KAJHT2N2Q","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man."" -- Ecclesiastes 9:15 (NKJV)Because his novels are so long, I've avoided reading many of Charles Dickens' novels until quite recently. I'm working with a number of budding novelists, and it occurred to me that it would be good to study all of the novels.Little Dorrit turned out to be a delightful surprise. I found the book to be far more appealing than many of the author's more famous novels. The novel features not one, but two, memorable characters: Amy Dorrit who was born in London's Marshalsea debtors' prison, and Arthur Clennam who seeks to ease the difficulties experienced by the Dorrit family through the father's long imprisonment.Seldom do today's books contain characters that provide good examples of right living. This book abounds in them. I won't mention who they are, lest I give away the plot.While you might not think that debtors' prison would make a worthy subject, remember that Dickens loved to draw contrasts between the top and the bottom of English society. In this case, those who are in charge of the government and ""society"" are what the Bible would call the poor in spirit, rather than the poor in economic terms. Pride, influence, and power are the coins of the realm that they can never get enough of.The book also contains some of the best satire I've ever read about government red tape and general humbug. Dickens lays in on thick, but he'll have you nodding your head, I'm sure.Another major theme involves how values determine how life is lived, and the quality of character. In typical Dickens fashion, you'll find plenty of people who are more than happy to compromise to get their way and have a ""good"" reputation.The values of English society take a much-needed major slam that focuses on exposing pretense and materialism.I can't say much about the plot because its twists and turns are a major reason why the book is such a delight.I listened to the unabridged CD that is ably read by Antony Ferguson. I highly recommend the reading. It gets you more deeply into the characters and story than just reading could.Bravo, Charles Dickens!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OAV65OIZ5LEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452650322#wasThisHelpful","R2OAV65OIZ5LEA","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Then they said to him, 'What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?'--for the sea was growing more tempestuous."" --Jonah 1:11 (NKJV)Some people don't seem to want to accept that Clive Cussler uses his story telling talent to develop outlines of novels that include many of his signature ideas, formats, and action. Then, he turns the books over to people with more pedestrian skills to put meat on the outline's bones.I found much to like about this book compared to early outings by Dirk Cussler as coauthor: There's a lot more Dirk and Al; the far-out technology is more interesting than usual; and the battles near the book's end were placed into an unexpected context. All-in-all, there was fun and food for thought. I don't expect any more than that from the Clive Cussler outlined books. If you do, you'll be disappointed almost every time.So don't expect the dialogue to be the same as before. So don't expect the derring-do to be described in the same witty way. So don't expect the book to sparkle with zest.Find another writer whose new works about the sea are more fun.

"""But wisdom is justified by all her children."" -- Luke 7:35 (NKJV)When a group of adults shows up for one of my night-school classes on how to develop a business, I always cringe after learning that most of them are well educated. It's typically my least well-schooled students who create the businesses that transform their lives and those of their employees and customers.When I try to explain the point, I often emphasize differences in curiosity and in not being satisfied with the conventional answer. Those with lots of education seem to display lots of test-taking skills, but they don't seem to have any other abilities that would be useful. Worse still, they reject the idea of having to go out and develop their own experimental results to decide what to do more and less of. They, instead, think that running a business is just like solving an algebra problem: there's only one answer and it's just a few steps away. Wrong!Paul Tough has done a good work by searching out information and examples that point to the importance of skills other than test-taking for allowing someone to accomplish more in life.Both liberals and conservatives will find information here to confound their pet beliefs. Yes, young children are permanently harmed by being in violent environments. That harm doesn't, however, make it impossible for them to accomplish as much or more than someone else ... but it will take a lot more effort and perseverance.Curiosity counts for a lot, as it does for my business students. The answers to most things we need to do are all around us. Those who are curious will keep poking around until they find something that works (remember the story of Edison trying and failing thousands of times before inventing a practical light bulb?).Do we have a formula we can follow so all children will succeed? No, of course not. But in the same way that we have learned to appreciate that there are multiple intelligences (although anyone who reads the Bible would have known that many years earlier), this book points to the importance of people learning how to measure and build character, curiosity, and enthusiasm for doing what's difficult.Is this a perfect book? No, of course not. Is it well worth your time? Sure it is.Bravo, Mr. Tough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ8LIRS563I33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547564651#wasThisHelpful","RZ8LIRS563I33","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things."" -- Matthew 12:35 (NKJV)Your reaction to this book will depend on your tastes in satire. Done best, satire decapitates its subjects almost bloodlessly. It's also quick and thorough. Tom Wolfe seems to feel that we won't get the point unless he develops the satire from many different angles, many of which repeat the lesson of the last angle. I also find that satire that's describing what's close to the reality of someone you've met also works better. The characters here are almost satires of satires due to being so remote from what most people are like.To me, the result is a book that's bloated to such an extent that it loses steam due to being overweight.I almost got the feeling that the author was trying to outdo Carl Hiaasen on his home ground. Now, that would be a tough thing to do ... and it certainly wasn't carried off, if that were the intent.The novel is saved from being without redeeming qualities by having three characters that show some integrity. Naturally, that's not much to build a story around when almost everyone else is so flagrantly without an ounce of integrity.While I can hardly claim to be a citizen of Miami, my extended visits over many decades have shown me a much healthier and more successfully integrated society than Mr. Wolfe describes. Consequently, the writing, while funny, just didn't ring true. Such satire doesn't work for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLBS53UXTOB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316036315#wasThisHelpful","R3LLBS53UXTOB7","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I thought the story was interesting then. This unabridged audio CD is far more interesting than what I had read earlier. King Bartels is an amazing woman, filled with a desire to do good, a willingness to sacrifice, and almost unlimited patience with utter nonsense. With God's help, she becomes quite a good king.I was attracted to the book because I will be visiting many African nations in the next few years as part of The 400 Year Project, and in working with people there I have come to appreciate that how Americans think about Africa is almost always totally wrong. Ms. Bartels does a wonderful job of bridging that culture gap so we can better appreciate how things are done in her corner of Ghana.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXARM6BHTIZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307879070#wasThisHelpful","RGXARM6BHTIZW","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another."" -- Leviticus 19:11 (NKJV)Reading about Isabel Dalhousie is a lot like paying attention to the mental chatter in your own mind, as you waver over what to do in trying and morally difficult circumstances. The main difference is that Isabel's life is filled with love and loving thoughts, rather than just annoyances.In this outing, Isabel is presented with the challenge of a painting that's been stolen and is being offered back in exchange for a reward from the insurance company. What's the right thing to do? Isabel's answer may interest you. I certainly enjoyed it.Another challenge arises when Charlie begins to show arithmetic skills ahead of his years. As more is learned, the questions to be answered increase. I think you'll enjoy this set of moral questions as well.I thought that the more interesting questions in the book revolved directly and indirectly about what it means to be a good parent. The stolen art seemed more like a hypothetical that professors like to use in ethics classes than a credible event for such a novel.There are also some seemingly hair-splitting decisions involving making representations that may or may not be the whole truth.

There's also enough arrogance, ignorance, shallowness, and incompetence to make anyone seethe about the people in the other party. As an independent voter, I found myself annoyed by both parties.Those who like to think of the president as an empty suit who gives good speeches will find evidence to support their beliefs.

"""All their thoughts are against me for evil."" -- Psalm 56:5 (NKJV)Everyone cares about orphans. If orphans are being treated badly, the sympathy is huge. Consider the Broadway show, Annie!Tess Gerritsen takes that well-known penchant for a ride in creating a roller coaster of a plot in which youngsters are placed at more risk than anyone can imagine ... including the youngsters themselves. The story unravels a complex set of circumstances in an intriguing way that holds back some essential perspectives long enough to make the twists and turns more than usually surprising and entertaining.Those who like this series for the interactions of Rizzoli and Isles won't be pleased, however. What goes on could have been conducted by any other pair of fictional characters. It's just that plot-driven.

"""For the land is filled with crimes of blood,And the city is full of violence.Therefore I will bring the worst of the Gentiles,And they will possess their houses;I will cause the pomp of the strong to cease,And their holy places shall be defiled."" -- Ezekiel 7:23-24 (NKJV)One of the ways that freedom has been abridged is by wide-ranging laws that can cause anyone who had any dealings with a criminal to be drawn into a racketeering charge. That's just what happened to Malcolm Bannister, who handled the wrong real estate transactions ... helping to launder dirty money in the process. Guilt by association led to time in the penitentiary. Like all cons, he had a lot of time on his hands ... time that went into finding ways to get out. When a federal judge is murdered, the time is ripe for a ""get of out jail free"" card to anyone who could finger the murderer. With the FBI chasing its tail, Bannister has a plan.No one can manipulate the legal system better than a lawyer. John Grisham returns to his roots as a legal novelist in describing how laws can be broken with the help of the law.The story is an intriguing plot, the ultimate in the underdog trying to overcome lots of impossible limitations. Unfortunately, to make the story work the story bogs down in more details than even many third year law students would want to think about. I found my interest fading rapidly in the second half. But I had to take my hat off to anyone who would work so hard to come up with such an on-the-surface implausible story ... that just might lead to the results described here.While this won't be your favorite book in the Grisham library, I think you'll be glad you read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JW6UVJLTHS5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535147#wasThisHelpful","R1JW6UVJLTHS5P","A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:00 Mins I've owned about 4 StarTech docking stations over the years, and I travel with one in my briefcase every day when I make tech calls, so I was excited when they asked me to review their latest dock.To me, a drive dock is an essential part of every technician's workbench, and it's invaluable in the field. This newer model improves on almost every feature of previous generations, by adding USB 3.0 and eSATA III, it gained speed and flexibility.The older models didn't have a fan, which is a great feature for when you plan on using a drive for extended amounts of time, or for when you are dealing with a failing drive that is running hot.  You can adjust the speed of the fan, or even turn it off when you don't need it.This dock is main for technical people, but it could also be used by anyone who would like the flexibility to use low cost internal OEM drives.I hope you found this review helpful.

" 1:13 Mins I was given the opportunity to try this leather case for the Dragon Touch 7"" tablet and it fits like a glove, but the most important thing was that it adds much needed protection to my tablet.  While screen protectors provide scratch protection, there's nothing better than having a case to protect the screen from impact.  While I didn't drop it, I'm sure the tablet could survive a lot more abuse while in the case than it would without a case.The other thing that's great about this case is how it feels in your hands.  It gives your tablet a nice leathery feel, like carrying a high quality book or journal.  Another nice bonus is a leather flap in the back that allows you to use the case as a stand, which is great for reading books or watching movies.It has cutouts in all the right places so you never have to remove it to access any of the buttons or plugs.I hope you found this review helpful.

" 3:06 Mins If you are one of those people that still don't have a tablet, this is a great place to start.  It's inexpensive and it has everything you need to get started.While I can go on and on about the technical details, such as how sharp the IPS display is, or how you can see it at just about any angle, or why it's great to have a quad core CPU, but the most important thing is that it runs just about every major Android App, so you can just log into the Google Play Store, and start downloading Apps.I've tested it with some of the most popular Apps, such as Kindle, Chrome, FireFox, Angry Birds, and Netflix and they all work absolutely perfect.  It has a front and back facing camera, so you can use it to make Skype video calls.I was sent a sample to review and I was very impressed by the quality.

"I have 3 iOS devices, a Kindle and 3 Android devices.  Prime Instant Video works great on everything but the Android Devices.  Android support is a complete train wreck.First, the Prime Instant Video App wasn't in the Google Play App Store, which shocked me, because other Amazon Apps are there.I learned that I needed to install the Amazon App Store to install this, which involved changing my security settings to allow me to install untrusted sources, then manually download the App from the web.  A strange request, but I did it.After installing the Amazon App store, I located the Instant Video App, and assumed everything would be easy from this point on.  I was wrong.  It got worse.It downloaded the App and created an Icon, which I assumed was a regular App... as it turns out, when I touched the icon, it asked me what I wanted to use to open it... and it gave me a choice of my web browsers.At that point, it just took me to the Amazon Instant Video website.  It's seemed pretty strange to go through all that trouble installing two different Apps, just to end up back at the Amazon website, but I decided to play along.I was able to browse my library, and the latest titles, so I picked a title and expected to see it play.  Instead, it told me I needed Adobe Flash to continue, and it gave me a choice of multiple Linux versions.  At that point, I just gave up.Amazon Prime Instant Video is a great service.  They need to work on better device support.

"I've been wearing the Original Wayfarer sunglasses for over 35 years.  Back then, you didn't need to call them ""Original"", because there was only one Ray-Ban Wayfarer.  Ray-Ban now makes a newer version that they say is a modern interpretation of the Original.They say the ""New Wayfarer"" looks more natural on your face.  The angles of the lenses are drastically toned down, and the lenses are smaller and more natural looking.  I couldn't agree more.  That's why I don't like the ""New Wayfarer"".A friend told me he always loved my Wayfarers, but never bought a pair because he didn't think they looked natural on his face.  That's when I explained to him that they don't look natural on ANYONE'S face, and that's the point.  People wear them BECAUSE they look don't look natural.That's why so many A-List celebrities wear Original Wayfarers.  It's all about attitude.When I explained this to my friend, he finally ""got it"", and that changed everything for him.  He realized they didn't look any more natural on my face than his, but they did fit my attitude.  I wear them with pride, and I'm equally comfortable wearing them in T-shirts and jeans as I am at a black tie event.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF4GGGUWHHCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LFG4A4#wasThisHelpful","RKF4GGGUWHHCI","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:02 Mins The funny thing about carbon monoxide is that many people think they can smell it, because the only thing they think of when they think of carbon monoxide is car exhaust, which has a smell.  That's not what CO smells like.  That's the smell of burning gasoline and oil.  The truth is carbon monoxide has NO SMELL, which is why everyone should invest in as many detectors as needed to cover their entire home.This particular model runs on a 9V battery, and it can be mounted on the wall or even placed on a table with the included stand.  In addition to the alarm sounds, the unit has an LCD display that shows you the current CO level in the room.  In my case, I was happy to see zero.While they don't mention it, the battery will last quite a while, but most people suggest that people change smoke and CO detector batteries every time they adjust their clocks for Daylight Savings, so you'll always know you have power when you need it.I was sent a sample to review and I highly recommend these to anyone, regardless of whether they live in a city that requires them by law.

" 2:03 Mins Because I'm often sent sample products like this to review, sometimes I can see the evolution of new products from generation to generation.  This is clearly a next generation battery case because unlike some of the older cases I've seen, this is the first one I've tested that lets you keep your iPhone inside even while charging.To be clear, with other models, you have to take the iPhone out, and plug in the Lightning Cable that came with it, then charge the case using a Micro USB cable, then re-insert the iPhone into the case to use it.  This model lets you keep the iPhone inside it and charge it using an off-the-shelf Micro USB cable.  That's pretty convenient.  It gives priority to your iPhone, and after the iPhone is charged, it starts to charge the case.Like most battery cases, the idea is that you use your phone as usual, and the battery runs at the same pace it did before, except that once your iPhone power drops, you can turn on the battery in the case, and it charges your iPhone, effectively giving you at least twice as much power.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11O3Z6QTB5DX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TA21G2A#wasThisHelpful","R11O3Z6QTB5DX2","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:23 Mins There's something special about this case that's hard to put into words.  I simply like the way it feels, and the way they put it together.Although the title says leather, there is clearly some kind of vinyl or plastic texture on the outside, but that's actually one of the best things I like about it.  I like how it feels.  It's got a nice texture and it's flexible, yet sturdy. and the magnetic clasp snaps into place with a satisfying click.The battery is larger than some of the other battery cases I've tested and it works more or less the same way.  Basically you charge the case and the phone before going out and your battery will drain as usual.  When you feel your battery is low, you turn on the battery inside the case and it re-charges your phone.  For people who use GPS or other power hungry Apps without access to a power outlet, this is simply essential and it will more than double your battery time.I was sent a sample for review and I can say that I was quite impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B4X62P7G9DV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYBV032#wasThisHelpful","R3B4X62P7G9DV1","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of business / self-help / motivation books.  I think I've read or listened to at least 500 or more, and some of them, such as Seth Godin's books, I've heard at least 5 or more times each.So when I'm on Amazon or Audible and they say there's a new Seth Godin book, I don't even bother to read the synopsis to see what it's about.  I just buy it, and chances are much of the material will seem familiar, yet different enough to make it worthwhile.While that may sound funny, it's classic Seth Godin.  He's not like most business book writers who roll out their ""5 Step Program to Riches"", riddled with acronyms that remind you the steps.  And THAT's why I read his books over and over.  I'm not looking for somebody to give me a checklist of sure fire steps to riches.I read his books because they remind me why I do what I do, and they remind me that sometimes people who follow their passion and create art find riches, but they succeed whether they make money or not.The audiobook was recorded live, which adds a bit of character to the recording.

Everything fits perfectly together and stays in place because it's meticulously designed.It took me about 30 minutes to put it together with my young nephew.  We didn't rush, and I'm sure it could be done quicker for those with more advanced skills.

" 2:44 Mins Stirling Engines are fascinating because, they use external heat sources, which means they don't have the complexity of an internal combustion engine.  Because of this students and hobbyists can see the operation of the engine at it's most basic level.In this particular model, SunnyTech has simplified and miniaturized the entire model to it's most basic elements giving you a great way to see how it works.  I love the fact that it's got an industrial look and uses glass for the piston so you can see inside it too.  In this video, I powered the engine using off-the-shelf 91% Isopropyl Alcohol, but theoretically you can use just about anything that burns.  I use alcohol because it's inexpensive, safe and clean.  Keep in mind, although burning alcohol is safe, you should supervise young children any time they use it.I was sent a sample for review because of my interests in scientific models and I was absolutely blown away by this model because of how small it is and how well it runs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CVDG78X19ET2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUSWPD4#wasThisHelpful","R2CVDG78X19ET2","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:56 Mins As many of you know, it's considered poor protocol to leave a US Flag outside after dark, unless you install a light.  This is one of the reasons some people make it a ritual to take their flag down each night, and raise it again in the morning.Installing permanent lights are expensive, so many people don't bother installing a flag pole in the first place. This product solves this problem perfectly.  It charges in the sun throughout the day and turns on at night, so you don't need to take in your flag.  Absolutely brilliant idea.I was sent a sample for review and I was quite impressed by this light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VMZH5K5SRIHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGSG7V0#wasThisHelpful","R2VMZH5K5SRIHJ","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:25 Mins Because of my background in technology, I'm often sent products like this to review and this one caught me by surprise by how well thought out it is.First, the battery itself is 2600 mAh, which is plenty of backup power for giving yourself an extra charge when you need it.  That's expected.  What I didn't expect was all the little details that they clearly nailed to perfection.It's relatively small, smooth and portable and it easily stands upright on either end.  When you pop off the top, the lightning cable is embedded in the cap, and there is a Micro USB connector on the other end.  Also inside the cap is the standard USB connector needed to charge it.I've tried at least 6 or 7 other battery units and none of them have integrated connectors and cables.  This one is clearly in a class by itself.I hope you found this information helpful.  Comments and questions are welcome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EDF2021J4NDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RL4FPK8#wasThisHelpful","R3EDF2021J4NDA","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:02 Mins The funny thing about carbon monoxide is that many people think they can smell it, because the only thing they think of when they think of carbon monoxide is car exhaust, which has a smell.  That's not what CO smells like.  That's the smell of burning gasoline and oil.  The truth is carbon monoxide has NO SMELL, which is why everyone should invest in as many detectors as needed to cover their entire home.This particular model runs on a 9V battery, and it can be mounted on the wall or even placed on a table with the included stand.  In addition to the alarm sounds, the unit has an LCD display that shows you the current CO level in the room.  In my case, I was happy to see zero.While they don't mention it, the battery will last quite a while, but most people suggest that people change smoke and CO detector batteries every time they adjust their clocks for Daylight Savings, so you'll always know you have power when you need it.I was sent a sample to review and I highly recommend these to anyone, regardless of whether they live in a city that requires them by law.  It's a very small investment that could save your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINXWB4FHFKQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTFG26A#wasThisHelpful","RINXWB4FHFKQU","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent a sample copy to review, and I read it from cover to cover.  While many of the jokes are silly enough for children to enjoy, I was completely shocked to find some jokes that were clearly not for children.  Two in particular were very offensive and one had a curse word in it.Since this is an electronic book, I tried to contact the author to see if the offensive jokes could be removed or changed, but I did not get a reply.  If a future edition omits these jokes, I would give it 5 stars, but any book specifically for kids needs to be 100% clean.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXNKTI9JS4W9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYOMP6A#wasThisHelpful","R2IXNKTI9JS4W9","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
